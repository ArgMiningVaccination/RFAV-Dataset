REPORT OF THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES COMMITTEE ON THE COMPENSATION OF THE OFFICERS Compensation Committee Report June 2022 Subject: REPORT OF THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES COMMITTEE ON THE COMPENSATION OF THE OFFICERS Presented by: Steven Tolber, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee F This report by the committee at the 2022 Annual meeting presents two recommendations. 1 2 BACKGROUND 3 4 At the 1998 Interim Meeting, the House of Delegates (HOD) established a House Committee on 5 Trustee Compensation, currently named the Committee on Compensation of the Officers, (the 6 \"Committee\"). The Officers are defined in the American Medical Association's (AMA) 7 Constitution and Bylaws. (Note: under changes to the Constitution previously approved by the 8 HOD, Article V refers simply to \"Officer,\" which includes all 21 members of the Board, among 9 whom are the President, President-Elect, Immediate Past President, Secretary, Speaker and Vice 10 Speaker of the HOD, collectively referred to in this report as \"Officers.\" The composition, 11 appointment, tenure, vacancy process and reporting requirements for the Committee are covered 12 under the AMA Bylaws. Bylaw 2.13.4.5 provides: 13 14 The Committee shall present and annual report to the House of Delegates recommending the 15 level of total compensation for the Officers for the following year. The recommendations of the 16 report may be adopted, not adopted, or referred back to the Committee, and may be amended 17 for clarification only with the concurrence of the Committee. 18 19 At A-00, the Committee and the Board jointly adopted the American Compensation Association's 20 definition of total compensation which was added to the Glossary of the AMA Constitution and 21 Bylaws. Total compensation is defined as the complete reward/recognition package awarded to an 22 individual for work performance, including: (a) all forms of money or cash compensation; 23 (b) benefits; (c) perquisites; (d) services; and (e) in-kind payments. 24 25 Since the inception of this Committee, its reports document the process the Committee follows to 26 ensure that current or recommended Officer compensation is based on sound, fair, cost-effective 27 compensation practices as derived from research and use of independent external consultants, 28 expert in Board compensation. Reports beginning in December 2002 documented the principles the 29 Committee followed in creating its recommendations for Officer compensation. 30 31 At A-08, the HOD approved changes that simplified compensation practices with increased 32 transparency and consistency. At A-10, Reference Committee F requested that this Committee 33 recommend that the HOD affirm a codification of the current compensation principle, which 34 occurred at I-10. At that time, the HOD affirmed that this Committee has and will continue to base 35 its recommendations for Officer compensation on the principle of the value of work performed, 36 Compensation Committee Rep. A-22 -- page 2 of 4 consistent with IRS guidelines and best practices recommended by the Committee's external 1 independent consultant, who is expert in Board compensation. 2 3 At A-11, the HOD approved the alignment of Medical Student and Resident Officer compensation 4 with that of all other Officers (excluding Presidents and Chair) because these positions perform 5 comparable work. 6 7 Immediately following A-11, the Committee retained Mr. Don Delves, founder of the Delves 8 Group, to update his 2007 research by providing the Committee with comprehensive advice and 9 counsel on Officer compensation. The updated compensation structure was presented and approved 10 by the HOD at I-11 with an effective date of July 1, 2012. 11 12 The Committee's I-13 report recommended and the HOD approved the Committee's 13 recommendation to provide a travel allowance for each President to be used for upgrades because 14 of the significant volume of travel representing our AMA. 15 16 At I-16, based on results of a comprehensive compensation review conducted by Ms. Becky Glantz 17 Huddleston, an expert in Board Compensation with Willis Towers Watson, the HOD approved the 18 Committee's recommendation of modest increases to the Governance Honorarium and Per Diems 19 for Officer Compensation, excluding the Presidents and Chair, effective July 1, 2017. At A-17 the 20 HOD approved modifying the Governance Honorarium and Per Diem definition so that Internal 21 Representation, greater than eleven days, receives a per diem. 22 23 At A-18, based on comprehensive review of Board leadership compensation, the HOD approved 24 the Committee's recommendation to increase the President, President-elect, Immediate Past-25 President, Chair, and Chair-elect honoraria by 4% effective July 1, 2018. 26 27 At A-18 and A-19, the House approved the Committee's recommendation to provide a Health 28 Insurance stipend to President(s) who are under Medicare eligible age when the President(s) and 29 their covered dependents, not Medicare eligible, lose the President's employer provided health 30 insurance during their term as President. Should the President(s) become Medicare eligible while in 31 office, they received an adjusted Stipend to provide insurance coverage to their dependents not 32 Medicare eligible. 33 34 The Committee's I-19 report recommended and the HOD approved the Committee's 35 recommendation to increase the Governance Honorarium and Per Diem for Officers, excluding 36 Presidents and Chair, by approximately 3% each effective July 1, 2020. 37 38 FINDINGS 39 40 At I-21, this Committee recommended that an upgrade allowance in the amount of $1250 for all 41 Officers except President, President-elect and Immediate Past President (\"Leadership\") be piloted 42 between November 17, 2021 through April 17, 2022. Use of the upgrade allowance for Officers 43 would comport with the current definition in the travel policy and the Board travel and expense 44 standing rules. The Committee committed to reporting on the use of the upgrade allowance during 45 the pilot and reports that during the six-month pilot, six Officers used the upgrade allowance in 46 amounts ranging from $30 - $616. In addition, Board Representation Office staff reported that 47 Officers were very appreciative of the availability of the upgrade allowance. 48 49 Demand for air travel has risen since the beginning of 2022. NPR (National Public Radio) reported 50 in April 2022 that based on consumer spending demand for travel this past February was 6% higher 51 Compensation Committee Rep. A-22 -- page 3 of 4 than in February 2019 and was 18% higher than January 2022. In addition, as of April 18, 2022 the 1 CDC's January 29, 2021 Order requiring masks on public transportation and at transportation hubs 2 was lifted by court order. And as of May 1, the CDC website showed the number of Covid-19 3 cases slowly increasing. 4 5 Our Officers are traveling to represent the AMA while continuing to represent the AMA in 6 podcasts, on webinars, and other media to advocate on behalf of physicians and patients. Based on 7 use of the upgrade allowance during the pilot and feedback from the Officers, and to continue to 8 minimize the risks associated with crowded flights and the ease of transmission of COVID-19, the 9 Committee recommends implementing an upgrade allowance for each Officer, excluding the three 10 Presidents, in the amount of $2500 per term beginning July 1, 2022. Use of the upgrade allowance 11 will comport with the current definition in the travel and expense standing rules and will be 12 included in the annual report of Officer Compensation presented annually to the House of 13 Delegates. 14 15 The Committee commends and thanks our Officers for their representation of the AMA. 16 17 RECOMMENDATIONS 18 19 1. That there be no changes to the Officers' compensation for the period beginning July 1, 2022 20 through June 30, 2023. (Directive to Take Action.) 21 22 2. That the travel policy and the Board travel and expense standing rules be amended by addition, 23 shown with underscores as follows: 24 25 Transportation 26 a. Air: AMA policy on reimbursement for domestic air travel for members of the Board is 27 that the AMA will reimburse for coach fare only. The Presidents (President, Immediate 28 Past President and President Elect) will each have access to an individual $5000 term 29 allowance (July 1 to June 30) and all other Officers will each have access to $2500 term 30 allowance (July 1 to June 30) to use for upgrades as each deems appropriate, typically 31 when traveling on an airline with non-preferred status. The unused portion of the 32 allowance is not subject to carry forward or use by any other Officer and remains the 33 property of the AMA. In rare instances it is recognized that short notice assignments may 34 require up to first class travel because of the lack of availability of coach seating, and this 35 will be authorized when necessary by the Board Chair, prior to travel. Business Class 36 airfare is authorized for foreign travel on AMA business. (Also see Rule IV -Invitations, 37 B\u2014Foreign, for policy on foreign travel). (Directive to Take Action) 38 39 3. That the remainder of the report be filed. 40 Fiscal Note: Estimated cost for July 1, 2022 - June 30, 2023 is a maximum of $52,500 if all Presidents and Officers use the whole allowance.

To protect patient privacy, these data elements reside in databases stripped of 3 patient identifying information (PII) making it extremely difficult to consistently reassemble the 4 fragment s back into a complete picture for research; and 5 6 Whereas, At the time patients present for care, identifying information (e.g. name, date of birth, 7 social security number if available, etc.) could be transformed into a privacy ensuring National 8 Cancer Registry Identifier (NCRI) using novel cryptographic solution (patent pending) that 9 includes a combination of established techniques (hash functions, blinding functions, single use 10 transactional tokens); and 11 12 Whereas, Creating a privacy -ensuring, unique canc er research identifier could travel with the 13 anonymous fragments of medical information currently collected by large databases, and 14 therefore allow the fragments to be reunited into a complete, yet anonymous cancer journey that 15 researchers can study to improve care; and 16 17 Whereas, The proposed initiative would build on existing data -transfer relationships between 18 health care facilities and quality improvement databases. For example, as medical facilities 19 submit information to various databases (e.g. Medicare, National Cancer Database, Society of 20 Thoracic Surgeons Database, etc.) as part of current workflow, the NCRI would remain 21 associated with the transferred medical information (but PII would not leave the health care 22 entity); and 23 24 Whereas, Requests for d ata could be handled by a separate entity serving as the honest broker 25 that would curate, link, and distribute the data in compliance with state and federal data use 26 agreements; and 27 28 Whereas, Nearly half of the 1.8 million cancer patients diagnosed each y ear in the U.S. will 29 have their lives shortened by cancer, highlighting the ongoing urgent need for cancer research 30 which is felt by the public, the medical community, and policymakers; and 31 32 Whereas, Prospective clinical trials are considered the gold- standard for cancer research, and 33 advances from trials have transformed cancer care. However, clinical trials typically require 34 more than 5 years and several million dollars to conduct; and 35 36 Whereas, There is simply not enough time or money to test all of the important aspects of 37 cancer care. The NCRI will dramatically increase the speed and power of real -world research; 38 and 39 Resolution: 021 (A-22) Page 2 of 2 Whereas, A nonprofit entity could be established to oversee the NCRI process including 1 managing grant funding, subcontracting to private entities to oversee specific functions (e.g. the 2 identifier workflow, and data curation and research distribution), privacy assurance, security, 3 and compliance. The nonprofit entity would engage federal policy makers, cancer organizations, 4 patient advocac y groups and the data science community for support, access and authorization 5 to move forward; therefore be it 6 7 RESOLVED, That in order to increase the power of medical research, our American Medical 8 Association propose a novel approach to linking medical information while still maintaining 9 patient confidentiality through the creation of a National Cancer Research Identifier (NCRI) 10 (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 11 12 RESOLVED, That our AMA encourage the formation of an organization or organizations to 13 oversee the NCRI process, specific functions, and engagement of interested parties to improve 14 care for patients with cancer.

The effec tive guidelines 32 for organ allocation do not include disability status in non- discrimination section 5.4.A 11; and 33 34 Whereas, Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibit discrimination 35 against people with disabilities in all programs, activities and services of public entities and 36 prohibit private places of public accommodation from discriminating against people with 37 disabilities3; and 38 Resolution: 022 (A-22) Page 2 of 2 Whereas, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits federally funded programs 1 including hospitals from denying qualified individuals the opportunity to participate in or benefit 2 from federally funded programs, services, or other benefits, denying access to programs, 3 services, benefits or opportunities to participate as a result of physi cal barriers, and denying 4 employment opportunities they are otherwise entitled or qualified4; and 5 6 Whereas, Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, 7 color, national origin, sex, age, or disability in certain health programs or activities and ensures 8 physical access for individuals with disabilities to healthcare facilities and appropriate 9 communication technology to assist persons who are visually or hearing impaired12; therefore 10 be it 11 12 RESOLVED, T hat our American Medical Association support equitable inclusion of people with 13 Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) in eligibility for transplant surgery (New HOD 14 Policy) ; and be it further 15 16 RESOLVED, That our AMA support individuals with ID D having equal access to organ 17 transplant services and protection from discrimination in rendering these services (New HOD 18 Policy) ; and be it further 19 20 RESOLVED, That our AMA support the goal of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation 21 Network (OPTN) in adding disability status to their Nondiscrimination policy under the National 22 Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (New HOD Policy) ; and be it further 23 24 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with relevant stakeholders to distribute antidiscrimination 25 education materials for healthcare providers related to equitable inclusion of people with IDD in 26 eligibility for transplant surgery.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY D-105.995 Protecting Social Media Users by Updating FDA Guidelines Our AMA will lobby the Food and Drug Adm inistration to: (1) update regulations to ensure closer regulation of paid endorsements of drugs or medical devices by individuals on social media; and (2) develop guidelines to ensure that compensated parties on social media websites provide information that includes the risks and benefits of specific drugs or medical devices and off -use prescribing in every related social media communication in a manner consistent with advertisement guidelines on traditional media forms. Res. 209, I -15 3.1.5 Professional ism in Relationships with Media Ensuring that the public is informed promptly and accurately about medical issues is a valuable objective. However, media requests for information about patients can pose concerns about patient privacy and confidentiality, among other issues. Physicians who speak on health- related matters on behalf of organizations should be aware of to institutional guidelines for communicating with media, where they exist. To safeguard patient interests when working with representative of the media, all physicians should: (a) Obtain consent from the patient or the patient's authorized representative before releasing information. (b) Release only information specifically authorized by the patient or patient's representative or that is p art of the public record. Resolution: 025 (A- 22) Page 3 of 4 (c) Ensure that no statement regarding diagnosis or prognosis is made except by or on behalf of the attending physician. (d) Refer any questions regarding criminal activities or other police matters to the proper authorities AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: IV Identification of Physicians by the Media H -485.991 It is the policy of our AMA to communicate to the media that when a physician is interviewed or provides commentary he or she be specifically identified with the appropriate initials \"MD\" or \"DO\" after his or her name; and that others be identified with the appropriate degrees after their names. Res. 601, I -01; Reaffirmation I -09; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 09, A -19 Ethical Physician Conduct in the Media D -140.957 1. Our AMA will study disciplinary pathways for physicians who violate ethical responsibilities through their position on a media platform. 2. Our AMA will release a statement affirming the professional obligation of physicians in the media to provide quality medical advice supported by evidence- based principles and transparent to any conflicts of interest, while denouncing the dissemination of dubious or inappropriate medical information through the public media including television, radio, internet, and print media. Res. 16, A -15; Modified: CEJA Rep. 02, I -17 8.11 Health Promotion and Preventive Care Medicine and public health share an ethical foundation stemming from the essential and direct role that health plays in human flourishing. While a physician's role tends to focus on diagnosing and treating illness once it occurs, physicians also have a professional commitment to prevent disease and promote health and well- being for their patients and the community. The clinical encounter provides an opportunity for the physician to engage the patient in the process of health promotion. Effective elements of this process may include educating and motivating patients regarding healthy lifestyle, helping patients by assessing their needs, preferences, and readiness for change and recommending appropriate preventive care measures. Implementing effective health promotion practices is consistent with physicians' duties to patients and also with their responsibilities as stewards of health care resources. While primary care physicians are typically the patient's main source for health promotion and disease prevention, specialists can play an important role, particularly when the specialist has a close or long- standing relationship with the patient or when recommended action is particularly relevant for the condition that the specialist is treating. Additionally, while all physicians must balance a commitment to individual patients with the health of the public, physicians who work solely or primarily in a public health capacity should uphold accepted standards of medical professionalism by implementing policies that appropriately balance individual liberties with the social goals of public health policies. Health promotion should be a collaborative, patient -centered process that promotes trust and recognizes patients' self -directed roles and responsibilities in maintaining health. In keeping with their professional commitment to the health of patients and the public, physicians should: (a) Keep current with preventive care guidelines that apply to their patients and ensure that the interventions they recommend are well supported by the best available evidence. (b) Educate patients about relevant modifiable risk factors. (c) Recommend and encourage patients to have appropriate vaccinations and screenings. (d) Encourage an open dialogue regarding circumstances that may make it difficult to manage chronic conditions or maintain a healthy lifestyle, such as transportation, work and home environments, and social support systems. (e) Collaborate with the patient to develop recommendations that are most likely to be effective. (f) When appropriate, delegate health promotion activities to other professionals or other resources available in the community who can help counsel and educate patients. Resolution: 025 (A- 22) Page 4 of 4 (g) Consider the health of the community when treating their own patients and identify and notify public health authorities if and when they notice patterns in patient health that may indicate a health risk for others. (h) Recognize that modeling health behaviors can help patients make changes in their own lives. Collectively, physicians should: (i) Promote training in health promotion and disease prevention during medical school, residency and in continuing medical education. (j) Ad vocate for healthier schools, workplaces and communities. (k) Create or promote healthier work and training environments for physicians. (l) Advocate for community resources designed to promote health and provide access to preventive services. (m) Support research to improve the evidence for disease prevention and health promotion. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: V,VII , Issued 2016 Code of Medic al Ethics Opinion 9.6.4 Sale of Health -Related Products The sale of health- related products by physicians can offer convenience for patients, but can also pose ethical challenges. \"Health- related products\" are any products other than prescription items that, according to the manufacturer or distributor, benefit health. \"Selling\" refers to dispensing items from the physician's office or website in exchange for money or endorsing a product that the patient may order or purchase elsewhere that results in remuneration for the physician. Physician sale of health- related products raises ethical concerns about financial conflict of interest, risks placing undue pressure on the patient, threatens to erode patient trust, undermine the primary obligation of physicians to serve the interests of their patients before their own, and demean the profession of medicine. Physicians who choose to sell health- related products from their offices or through their office website or other online venues have ethical obligations to: (a) Offer only products whose claims of benefit are based on peer -reviewed literature or other sources of scientific review of efficacy that are unbiased, sound, systematic, and reliable. Physicians should not offer products whose claims to benefit lack scientific validity. (b) Address conflict of interest and possible exploitation of patients by: 1. Fully disclosing the nature of their financial interest in the sale of the product(s), either in person or through written notification, and informing patients of the availability of the product or other equivalent products elsewhere. 2. Limiting sales to products that serve immediate and pressing needs of their patients (e.g., to avoid requiring a patient on crutches to travel to a local pharmacy to purchase the product). Distributing products free of charge or at cost makes products readily available and helps to eliminate the elements of personal gain and financial conflict of interest that may interfere, or appear to interfere with the physician's independent medical judgment. (c) Provide information about the risks, benefits, and limits of scientific knowledge regarding the products in language that is understandable to patients. (d) Avoid exclusive distributorship arrangements that make the products available only through physician offices. Physicians should encourage manufacturers to make products widely accessible to patients. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: II AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 126 (A-22) Introduced by: Idaho Subject: Providing Recommended Vaccines Under Medicare Parts B And C Referred to: Reference Committee A Whereas, Many vaccines are recommended for routine use by the Advisory Committee for 1 Immunization Practices (ACIP) for Medicare- eligible beneficiaries; and 2 3 Whereas , Medicare patients usually have the opportunity to obtain recommended routine 4 vaccines at their usual source of care in the outpatient medical home; and 5 6 Whereas, The AMA believes that all public and private insurers should include immunizations 7 recommended by ACIP as a covered benefit and that patients should receive all immunizations 8 recommended by ACIP; and 9 10 Whereas, Under Section 2713 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, all private 11 health plans are required to cover, without cost sharing, ACIP recommended routine 12 immunizations ; and 13 14 Whereas, Medicare currently does not cover some ACIP recommended routine vaccines under 15 parts B and C which results in the outpatient medical home being excluded from providing 16 recommended routine vaccines to Medicare beneficiaries; therefore be it 17 18 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support the expansion of coverage of all 19 Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ( ACIP) recommended immunizations for routine 20 use as a covered benefit by all public and private health plans (New HOD Policy); and be it 21 further 22 23 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 24 (CMS), and Congress if necessary, for expanded coverage of all ACIP recommended 25 immunizat ions for routine use to be a covered benefit without patient cost under Medicare parts 26 B and C for Medicare beneficiaries.

It is AMA policy that all persons, regardless of economic and insurance status, receive all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) -recommended vaccines as soon as possible foll owing publication of these recommendations in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). 2. Our AMA will continue to work with the federal government, Congress, and other stakeholders to improve liability protection for vaccine manufacturers and health care professionals who provide immunization services and to examine and improve compensation mechanisms for patients who were legitimately injured by a vaccine. 3. Our AMA will continue to work with the federal government, Congress, and other appropriate stakeholders to enhance public opinion of vaccines and to monitor and ensure the continued safety of existing and newly approved vaccines (including providing adequate resources for post-approval survei llance) so as to maintain and improve public confidence in the safety of vaccines. 4. Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders, including vaccine manufacturers, vaccine distributors, the federal government, medical specialty societies, and third par ty payers, to guarantee a robust vaccine delivery infrastructure (including but not limited to, the research and development of new vaccines, the ability to track the real -time supply status of ACIP - recommended vaccines, and the timely distribution of ACIP -recommended vaccines to providers). 5. Our AMA will work with appropriate federal and state agencies and private sector entities to ensure that state Medicaid agencies and private insurance plans pay health care professionals at least the approved Relativ e Value Unit (RVU) administration Medicare rates for payment when they administer ACIP -recommended vaccines. 6. Our AMA will work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to address barriers associated with Medicare recipients receiving li ve zoster vaccine and the routine boosters Td and Tdap in physicians' offices. 7. Our AMA will work through appropriate state entities to ensure all health insurance plans rapidly include newly ACIP -recommended vaccines in their list of covered benefits, and to pay health care professionals fairly for the purchase and administration of ACIP -recommended vaccines. 8. Our AMA will urge Medicare to include Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Acellular Pertussis) under Medicare Part B as a national public health measure to help prevent the spread of Pertussis. 9. Until compliance of AMA Policy H- 440.875(6) is actualized to the AMA's satisfaction regarding the tetanus vaccine, our AMA will aggressively petition CMS to include tetanus and Tdap at both the \"Welcome to Medicare\" and Annual Medicare Wellness visits, and other clinically appropriate encounters, as additional \"triggering event codes\" (using the AT or another modifier) that allow for coverage and payment of vaccines to Medicare recipients. 10. Our AMA will aggress ively petition CMS to include coverage and payment for any vaccinations administered to Medicare patients that are recommended by the ACIP, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), or based on prevailing preventive clinical health guidelines.

Our AMA advocates for adequate payment to health care providers, including 26 primary care and mental health, and addiction treatment professionals, to encourage 27 improved access to comprehensive physical and behavioral health care services to 28 juveniles and adults throughout the incarceration process from intake to re -entry into 29 the community. 30 2. Our AMA advocates and requires a smooth transition including partnerships and 31 information sharing between correctional systems, community health systems and 32 state ins urance programs to provide access to a continuum of health care services for 33 juveniles and adults in the correctional system. 34 3. Our AMA encourages state Medicaid agencies to accept and process Medicaid 35 applications from juveniles and adults who are incar cerated. 36 4. Our AMA encourages state Medicaid agencies to work with their local departments 37 of corrections, prisons, and jails to assist incarcerated juveniles and adults who may 38 not have been enrolled in Medicaid at the time of their incarceration to apply and 39 receive an eligibility determination for Medicaid. 40 5. Our AMA advocates for states to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid eligibility 41 of juveniles and adults upon intake into the criminal legal system and throughout the 42 incarceration process, and to reinstate coverage when the individual transitions back 43 into the community. 44 6. Our AMA advocates for Congress to repeal the \"inmate exclusion\" of the 1965 45 Social Security Act that bars the use of federal Medicaid matching funds from covering 46 healthcare services in jails and prisons. 47 7.Our AMA advocates for Congress and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 48 (CMS) to revise the Medicare statute and rescind related regulations that prevent 49 payment for medical care furnished to a Medicare benefici ary who is incarcerated or in 50 custody at the time the services are delivered. 51 Resolution: 127 (A- 22) Page 3 of 4 8.

Our AMA acknowledges that structural racism and bias negatively impact the ability to provide optimal health care, including maternity care, for people of color. 2. Our AMA encourages physicians to raise awareness among colleagues, residents and fellows, staff, and hospital administrators about the prevalence of racial and ethnic inequities and the effect on health outcomes, work to eliminate these inequities, and prom ote an environment of trust. 3. Our AMA encourages physicians to pursue educational opportunities focused on embedding equitable, patient -centered care for patients who are pregnant and/or within 12 months postpartum into their clinical practices and encourages physician leaders of health care teams to support similar appropriate professional education for all members of their teams. 4. Our AMA will continue to monitor and promote ongoing research regarding the impacts of societal (e.g., racism or unaffordable health insurance), geographical, facility -level (e.g., hospital quality), clinician -level (e.g., implicit bias), and patient -level (e.g., comorbidities, chronic stress Resolution: 221 (A-22) Page 3 of 3 or lack of transportation) barriers to optimal care that contribute to adverse and disparate maternal health outcomes, as well as research testing the effectiveness of interventions to address each of these barriers. 5. Our AMA will promote the adoption of federal standards for clinician collection of patient - identified race and ethnicity information in clinical and administrative data to better identify inequities. The federal data collection standards should be: (a) informed by research (including real-world testing of technical standards and standardized definitions of race and ethnicit y terms to ensure that the data collected accurately reflect diverse populations and highlight, rather than obscure, critical distinctions that may exist within broad racial or ethnic categories), (b) carefully crafted in conjunction with clinician and pat ient input to protect patient privacy and provide non - discrimination protections, and (c) lead to the dissemination of best practices to guide respectful and non- coercive collection of accurate, standardized data relevant to maternal health outcomes. 6. Ou r AMA supports the development of a standardized definition of maternal mortality and the allocation of resources to states and Tribes to collect and analyze maternal mortality data (i.e., Maternal Mortality Review Committees and vital statistics) to enabl e stakeholders to better understand the underlying causes of maternal deaths and to inform evidence- based policies to improve maternal health outcomes and promote health equity. 7. Our AMA encourages hospitals, health systems, and state medical associations and national medical specialty societies to collaborate with non- clinical community organizations with close ties to minoritized and other at -risk populations to identify opportunities to best support pregnant persons and new families. 8. Our AMA encourages the development and funding of resources and outreach initiatives to help pregnant individuals, their families, their communities, and their workplaces to recognize the value of comprehensive prepregnancy, prenatal, peripartum, and postpartum care. These resources and initiatives should encourage patients to pursue both physical and behavioral health care, strive to reduce barriers to pursuing care, and highlight care that is available at little or no cost to the patient. 9. Our AMA supports adequate payment from all payers for the full spectrum of evidence -based prepregnancy, prenatal, peripartum, and postpartum physical and behavioral health care. 10. Our AMA encourages hospitals, health systems, and states to participate in maternal safety and quality improvement initiatives such as the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health program and state perinatal quality collaboratives. 11. Our AMA will advocate for increased access to risk -appropriate care by encouraging hospitals, health systems, and states to adopt verified, evidence- based levels of maternal care.

Our AMA considers drug shortages to be an urgent public health crisis, and recent shortages have had a dramatic and negative impact on the delivery and safety of appropriate health care to patient s. 2. Our AMA supports recommendations that have been developed by multiple stakeholders to improve manufacturing quality systems, identify efficiencies in regulatory review that can mitigate drug shortages, and explore measures designed to drive greater investment in production capacity for products that are in short supply, and will work in a collaborative fashion with these and other stakeholders to implement these recommendations in an urgent fashion. 3. Our AMA supports authorizing the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to expedite facility inspections and the review of manufacturing changes, drug applications and supplements that would help mitigate or prevent a drug shortage. 4. Our AMA will advocate that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or Congress require drug manufacturers to establish a plan for continuity of supply of vital and life- sustaining medications and vaccines to avoid production shortages whenever possible. This plan should include establishing the necessary resiliency and redundancy in manufacturing capability to minimize disruptions of supplies in foreseeable circumstances including the possibility of a disaster affecting a plant. 5. The Council on Science and Public Health shall continue to evaluate the drug shortage issue, including the impact of group purchasing organizations on drug shortages, and report back at least annually to the House of Delegates on progress made in addressing drug shortages. 6. Our AMA urges continued analysis of the root causes of drug shortages that includes consideration of federal actions, evaluation of manufacturer, Group Purchasing Organization (GPO), and distributor practices, contracting practices by market participants on competition, access to drugs, prici ng, and analysis of economic drivers. 7. Our AMA urges regulatory relief designed to improve the availability of prescription drugs by ensuring that such products are not removed from the market due to compliance issues unless such removal is clearly required for significant and obvious safety reasons. 8. Our AMA supports the view that wholesalers should routinely institute an allocation system that attempts to fairly distribute drugs in short supply based on remaining inventory and considering the customer's purchase history. 9. Our AMA will collaborate with medical specialty society partners and other stakeholders in identifying and supporting legislative remedies to allow for more reasonable and sustainable payment rates for prescription drugs. 10. Our A MA urges that during the evaluation of potential mergers and acquisitions involving pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Federal Trade Commission consult with the FDA to determine whether such an activity has the potential to worsen drug shortages. 11. Our AM A urges the FDA to require manufacturers to provide greater transparency regarding the pharmaceutical product supply chain, including production locations of drugs, and provide more detailed information regarding the causes and anticipated duration of drug shortages. 12. Our AMA supports the collection and standardization of pharmaceutical supply chain data in order to determine the data indicators to identify potential supply chain issues, such as drug shortages. 13. Our AMA encourages global implementation of guidelines related to pharmaceutical product supply chains, quality systems, and management of product lifecycles, as well as expansion of Resolution: 223 (A-22) Page 3 of 3 global reporting requirements for indicators of drug shortages. 14. Our AMA urges drug manufacturers to accelerate the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies such as continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing. 15. Our AMA supports the concept of creating a rating system to provide information about the quality management maturity, resiliency and redundancy , and shortage mitigation plans, of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities to increase visibility and transparency and provide incentive to manufacturers. Additionally, our AMA encourages GPOs and purchasers to contractually require manufacturers to discl ose their quality rating, when available, on product labeling. 16. Our AMA encourages electronic health records (EHR) vendors to make changes to their systems to ease the burden of making drug product changes. 17.

Federal and State programs utilizing shortage designations as criteria for eligibility 10 include: National Health Service Corps, State Loan Repayment Program, NURSE Corps, 11 Federally Qualified Health C enter and Health Center Look -Alike Certification, Medicare 12 Incentive Payment Program, CMS Rural Health Clinics Program, J -1 Visa Waiver and the 13 National Interest Waiver Programs, as well as scoring preferences for various Title VII and 14 VIII grants; and 15 16 Whereas , Due to a rapidly aging population, lack of commensurate increase in medical 17 school and residency positions, early retirement of healthcare professionals from burnout 18 and effects of the pandemic, and a lack of direct incentives to practice in senior living 19 communities, there is an acute shortage of healthcare professionals including Physicians, 20 nurses, and clinical practitioners in skilled nursing facilities. https://www. aamc.org/news - 21 insights/us -physician- shortage- growing; therefore be it 22 23 RESOLVED, That our A merican Medical Associ ation advocate for legislative action directing the 24 United States D epartment of Health and Human Services to designate all skilled nursing 25 facilities, irrespective of their geographic location, as h ealth professional shortage areas and/or 26 medically underserved areas to facilitate recruitment and retention of health profes sionals using 27 the usual and customary support made available for such designations.

Therefore, when there are deficiencies in clinical care of NF 12 residents or NFs' failure to implement resident care policies, the NF residents and their 13 families do not have ready access to NF medical director to request remediation of such 14 deficiencies by overseeing and coordinating clinical care of affected residents; and 15 16 Whereas, W hen such deficiencies in the clinical care of NF residents occur resulting in 17 adverse clinical outcomes, the residents and their families are forced to seek remediation 18 by complaining to their state public health departments bypassing the NF medical director, 19 thereby eliminating an opportunity for early interventions to 'correct the root cause' and to 20 improve quality of care for all NF residents; and 21 22 Whereas , Some NFs may elect to engage medical directors for the sole purpose of 23 referring admissions to their facilities, or medical directors without adequate training or 24 knowledge of geriatric medical principles, bioethics, and the complex regulatory framework 25 in which skilled nursing facilities operate, potentially resulting in bad outcomes and a lack of 26 quality control in these NFs; therefore be it 27 28 RESOLVED, That our A merican Medical Associ ation advocate for the Centers for Medicare & 29 Medicaid Services to promote health care transparency and consumer access to quality 30 health care by hosting a public listing of medical directors of all nursing facilities (NFs) in the 31 country.

(11) legislation and regulatory 22 reform should be supported that establish program integrity/fraud and abuse safe harbors that 23 permit sponsors to cover co- pays/coinsurance/ deductibles , and otherwise not covered clinical 24 care, and non -clinical ancillary costs in the context of nationally approved clinical trials (Modify 25 Current HOD Policy) ; and be it further 26 27 RESOLVED, That our AMA actively advocate for federal and state legislation that would allow 28 coverage of non- clinical ancillary costs by sponsors of clinical trials.

Resolution: 226 (A-22) Page 2 of 2 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Viability of Clinical Research Coverages and Reimbursement H -460.965 Our AMA believes that: (1) legislation and regulatory reform should be pursued to mandate third party payer coverage of patient care costs (including co- pays/c o-insurance/deductibles) of nationally approved (e.g., NIH, VA, ADAMHA, FDA), scientifically based research protocols or those scientifically based protocols approved by nationally recognized peer review mechanisms; (2) third party payers should formally i ntegrate the concept of risk/benefit analysis and the criterion of availability of effective alternative therapies into their decision making processes; (3) third party payers should be particularly sensitive to the difficulty and complexity of treatment decisions regarding the seriously ill and provide flexible, informed and expeditious case management when indicated; (4) its efforts to identify and evaluate promising new technologies and potentially obsolete technologies should be enhanced; (5) its curren t efforts to identify unproven or fraudulent technologies should be enhanced; (6) sponsors (e.g., NIH, pharmaceutical firms) of clinical research should finance fully the incremental costs added by research activities (e.g., data collection, investigators' salaries, data analysis) associated with the clinical trial. Investigators should help to identify such incremental costs of research; (7) supports monitoring present studies and demonstration projects, particularly as they relate to the magnitude (if any ) of the differential costs of patient care associated with clinical trials and with general practice; (8) results of all trials should be communicated as soon as possible to the practicing medical community maintaining the peer reviewed process of publication in recognized medical journals as the preferred means of evaluation and communication of research results; (9) funding of biomedical research by the federal government should reflect the present opportunities and the proven benefits of such research t o the health and economic well being of the American people; (10) the practicing medical community, the clinical research community, patient advocacy groups and third party payers should continue their ongoing dialogue regarding issues in payment for technologies that benefit seriously ill patients and evaluative efforts that will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our nation's health care system; and (11) legislation and regulatory reform should be supported that establish program integrity/fraud and abuse safe harbors that permit sponsors to cover co -pays/coinsurance/ deductibles and otherwise not covered clinical care in the context of nationally approved clinical trials.

and 2 3 Whereas, Outdoor recreation, defined as outdoor leisure time that occurs in urban, human- 4 made, and/or natural environments involving elements of nature such as terrain, plants, wildlife, 5 and water bodies, has been shown to positively impact physical, mental, and social health4-17; 6 and 7 8 Whereas, Outdoor recreation is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular mortality and 9 myopia7,8; and 10 11 Whereas, Compared to recreation in a non -natural environment, recreation in a natural outdoor 12 environment resulted in a 13.4 -15.8% decrease in salivary cortisol levels and a 1.7- 1.9% 13 reduction in systolic blood pressure9; and 14 15 Whereas, A 2018 Oregon study estimated that participation in outdoor recreation produces 16 between $735 million and $1.4 billion in savings per year related to chronic disease10; and 17 18 Whereas, Outdoor recreation can enhance well -being, happiness, and quality of life and 19 improve symptoms related to depression, stress, and post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 20 particularly amongst veterans11-17; and 21 22 Whereas, The National Recreation and Park Association and the CDC recognize the 23 importance of outdoor recreation to public health and support improving access to recreation 24 opportunities and continuing research efforts18,19; and 25 26 Whereas, Public spaces available for outdoor recreation are increasingly threatened by 27 decreased public availability due to oil and gas leases and the impacts of climate change20-22; 28 and 29 30 Whereas, National Park visits increased 16% between 2013 and 2018 and continue to rise, 31 while discretionary and maintenance appropriations have remained stagnant, with nearly $12 32 billion of deferred maintenance accumulated, a trend consistent across public recreation 33 agencies23,24; and 34 35 Whereas, State parks are also affected by decreased spending with parks across Alabama, 36 Montana, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Wyoming, Minnesota, Texas, Utah and other states 37 facing threats of closure and maintenance backlogs24-29; and 38 Resolution: 230 (A-22) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, Decreased appropriations for recreati on spaces may uniquely impact low - 1 socioeconomic and minority communities that already have lower quality public spaces for 2 recreation, decreased accessibility, and increased rates of space loss, despite these groups 3 disproportionately benefiting from outdo or recreation29-35; and 4 5 Whereas, With proven health benefits, outdoor recreation is now being considered as a 6 potential clinical tool via park prescriptions and outdoor organization referrals36; and 7 8 Whereas, Outdoor recreation as therapy has had limited development in clinical application due 9 to insufficient program reach and resources, lack of available recreation spaces, and limited 10 research on the underlying mechanisms, and effective dose and duration12,37; and 11 12 Whereas, Current AMA policies, including H -470.997 and H -135.973, encourage physical 13 activity and environmental stewardship but do not specifically address outdoor recreation, nor 14 do they include the unique exercise independent benefits and activities attributed to outdoor 15 recreation; and 16 17 Wher eas, While AMA policy D -470.993 encourages creation of a set type of exercise venues at 18 the local level, this policy does not include many forms of outdoor recreation spaces and 19 activities, nor does it consider federal and state management of outdoor recreation spaces; and 20 21 Whereas, Our AMA would benefit from clear guidance on how to act on legislation related to 22 outdoor recreation such as H.R. 2435 and S.500/H.R. 1225 which were introduced in the 2019 23 cycle to expand opportunities for treatment and healing of military veterans through outdoor 24 recreation on public lands and to alleviate the maintenance backlog in National Parks and 25 Public Lands, respectively38-40; therefore be it 26 27 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association encourage federal, state and local 28 governments to create new and maintain existing public lands and outdoor spaces for the 29 purposes of outdoor recreation; (Directive to Take Action) and be it further 30 31 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National 32 Institute of Environmental Health Science, National Recreation and Park Association, and other 33 relevant stakeholders to encourage continued research on the clinical uses of outdoor 34 recreation therapy.

Res. 402, A -03; Appended: Res. 927, I -11; Reaffirmed in lieu of Res. 505, A -19 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 231 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Amending Policy H -155.955: Increasing Accessibility to Incontinence Products to include Diaper Tax Exemption Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, Diapers are used by different population groups, including but not limited to young 1 children and those with a variety of medical conditions 1; and 2 3 Whereas, The populations that utilize diapers often overlap with vulnerable patient groups, such 4 as infants/toddlers, the elderly, adults with physical disabilities, and adults with intellectual 5 disabilities, who are unable to independently perform activities of daily living including toilet 6 use1; and 7 8 Whereas, Diapers that are not changed in a timely manner increase the risk of urinary tract 9 infections and diaper dermatitis, especially for extended hours spent in a diaper overnight ; this 10 also creates an environment for the formation of pressure ulcers2-3; and 11 12 Whereas, Up to 36% of families struggle to afford child diapers, and diaper need (defined as the 13 lack of an adequate supply of clean diapers) can limit parents' ability to work, given that many 14 childcare centers require parents to supply diapers as a condition of enrollment3-6; and 15 16 Whereas, An American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) study found that the average cost of 17 diapers is $936 per year, per child, which is over 6% of a federal minimum wage salary of $7.25 18 per hour3,7,; and 19 20 Whereas, An adult can expect to spend $80 -240 per month on diapers, depending on the 21 degree of incontinence and extent of need8,9; and 22 23 Whereas, According to the National Diaper Bank Network, some families pay more in taxes for 24 diapers over a year than the cost of a one -month supply of diapers and, in 2014, the lowest 25 income quintile (with an average after -tax income of $11,000) spent an estimated 14% of its 26 income on diapers10,11; and 27 28 Whereas, Mothers reporting mental health needs were more likely to also report diaper need, 29 and in a population of low -income families in an urban setting, 30% of mothers who reported 30 diaper need were more likely to be Hispanic and older3,6; and 31 32 Whereas, A study of the Vermont WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) Program, a low -income 33 based nutrition program, showed that 32.5% of families in the program reported diaper need12; 34 and 35 36 Whereas, Although the National Diaper Bank Network diaper distribution program assisted 37 280,000 children, it reached only 4% of the 7 million children living in families with incomes at or 38 below 200% of the federal poverty level13; and 39 Resolution: 231 (A- 22) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Medicaid coverage of child diapers deemed medically necessary for incontinence 1 varies among states, with Utah, New Hampshire, and the District of Columbia having no age 2 limit for beginning diaper coverage, while Maine, Kansas, and California begin coverage at 5 3 years14; and 4 5 Whereas, Thir ty-six states charge sales tax on diapers; California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, 6 Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont exempt diapers 7 from taxation; and Maryland and North Dakota exempt adult incontinence products alone13,15; 8 and 9 10 Whereas, In a study of 50,000 households in low -income areas with a change in diaper tax 11 status, implementation of sales tax exemptions for diapers was associated with a 5.4% increase 12 in diaper spending and a 6.2% decrease in spending on children's pain medication, suggesting 13 health benefits as a result of tax exemptions16; and 14 15 Whereas, As of 2021, thirteen states have adopted specific tax exemptions on menstrual 16 products, illustrating the legislative and economic feasibility of exempting necessary hygiene 17 products from taxable goods17; and 18 19 Whereas, Cost savings from the repeal of sales tax on menstrual products have been shown to 20 directly benefit consumers, particularly those of lower -income backgrounds, by shifting the tax 21 break mostly to consumers and away from manufacturers18; and 22 23 Whereas, Congress is currently considering multiple bills to both remove sales tax on diapers as 24 well as make child diapers qualified medical expenses eligible for spending from pre -tax HSAs, 25 HRAs, and FSAs19-21; and 26 27 Whereas, AMA Policy H -270.953 recognizes access to feminine hygiene products used for 28 menstruation and other genital tract secretions as a public health issue and supports the 29 removal of sales tax on all feminine hygiene products; and 30 31 Whereas, AMA Policy H-155.955 supports increased access to affordable incontinence 32 products, but does not contain specific measures for implementation; therefore be it 33 34 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend Policy H -155.955, \"Increasing 35 Accessibility to I ncontinence Products,\" by addition and deletion as follows: 36 37 Increasing Accessibility to Incontinence Products H -155.955 38 Our AMA supports increased access to affordable incontinence products ., the 39 removal of sales tax on child and adult diapers, including single- use and reusable 40 diapers, and the inclusion of child diapers as qualified medical expenses for Health 41 Savings Accounts (HSAs), Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs), and 42 Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs).

CSA Rep. 2, A -99; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 1, Modified: Res. 927, I -18; Reaffirmation: A -19 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 233 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Support for Warning Labels on Firearm Ammunition Packaging Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, Over 45,200 firearm -related deaths occurred in the United States in 2020, equating to 1 13.7 firearm -related deaths per 100,000 population and 124 deaths each day, making it the 2 worst year on record for firearm -related deaths1; and 3 4 Whereas, Firearms are the second- leading cause of death of children in the U.S.2; and 5 6 Whereas, Over half of the firearm -related deaths in the U.S. are due to suicide and access to a 7 firearm increases suicide risk by seven times3; and 8 9 Whereas, Access to a firearm doubles the risk of death by homicide4; and 10 11 Whereas, Women in the U.S. are 25 times more likely to be killed with firearms than in other 12 high- income countries and in homes where domestic violence occurs, a firearm increases the 13 risk of women being killed by five times5; and 14 15 Whereas, Over 40% of Americans live in a household with at least one firearm, but fewer than 16 44% store their firearms unloaded and separate from the ammunition, which is recognized as a 17 best practice to reduce the risk of firearm -related suicide and injury6-10; and 18 19 Whereas, Relatively few federal or state regulations on ammunition exist, despite evidence that 20 reduced availability of ammunition has been associated with reduced firearm -related mortality7-21 12; and 22 23 Whereas, Text -based warning labels have been shown to and may be effective in reducing 24 harmful health behaviors such as consumption of high- sugar or nutritionally poor foods , 25 consumption of alcohol, and misuse of medications13-20; and 26 27 Whereas, A large body of evidence shows graphic warning labels on tobacco packaging 28 consistently reduce tobacco use, are more effective at changing behaviors and cognitive 29 patterns than text -only warnings, and are equally effective for many diverse population 30 subgroups14,21 -34,37,38; and 31 32 Whereas, Graphic pictorial warning labels have also been shown to have greater potential 33 benefits than text -based warnings in reducing alcohol use, sugary drink consumption, and 34 gambling14,21- 34,37,38; and 35 36 Whereas, In May 2019, the #DontLookAway campaign proposed requiring graphic warning 37 labels depicting potential harms on firearm ammunition packaging in the U.S. alongside public 38 health statistics concerning firearm -related harms39,40; and 39 Resolution: 233 (A-22) Page 2 of 10 Whereas, No published studies currently exist concerning warning labels or graphic warning 1 labels on ammunition or firearms packaging; in the U.S., this may be attributable to restrictions 2 on firearms research while in other developed nations it is likely due to strong restrictions on 3 firearm ownership and purchasing, which results in markedly lower firearm ownership and 4 ammunition consumption41-48; and 5 6 Whereas, In 2019, California began implementing Assembly B ill 1525, which requires warning 7 labels detailing firearm risks and firearm regulation laws be included on all packaging of firearms 8 and located on the premises of licensed firearms dealers, illustrating such requirements can be 9 enacted, though no research has yet been published on their effectiveness49; and 10 11 Whereas, Our AMA supports warning labels on packaging of foods high in added sugars (D - 12 150.974), foods containing high fructose corn syrup (D -150.981), wire -bristle grill brushes (D - 13 10.991), detergents (D-60.967), waterbeds and beanbag furniture (H -245.985), indoor tanning 14 equipment (H -440.839), noise- producing toys (H -440.897), energy beverages (D -150.976), 15 latex -containing products (H -480.970), hand -held devices (H -15.952), and nicotine and tobacco 16 products (H -495.973), and our AMA supports graphic warning labels on tobacco packaging (H - 17 495.989); and 18 19 Whereas, Our AMA recognizes firearms as a public health problem (H -145.997) and gun 20 violence as a public health crisis (D -145.995); therefore be it 21 22 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support legislation requiring that 23 packaging for any firearm ammunition produced in, sold in, or exported from the United States 24 carry a legible, boxed warning that includes, at a minimum, (a) text -based statistics and/or 25 graphic picture- based warning labels related to the risks, harms, and mortality associated with 26 firearm ownership and use, and (b) explicit recommendations that ammunition be stored 27 securely and separately from firearms.

Our AMA will issue a statement of support for the newly proposed nutrition labeli ng by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the public comment period. 2. Our AMA will recommend that the FDA further establish a recommended daily value (%DV) for the new added sugars listing on the revised nutrition labels based on previous recommendations from the WHO and AHA). Resolution: 233 (A-22) Page 5 of 10 3. Our AMA will encourage further research into studies of sugars as addictive through epidemiological, observational, and clinical studies in humans. 4. Our AMA encourages the FDA to: (a) develop front -of-package warning labels for foods that are high in added sugars based on the established recommended daily value; and (b) limit the amount of added sugars permitted in a food product containing front -of-package health or nutrient content claims.

The policy of the AMA is to encourage hospitals to incorporate, within their security policies, specific provisions on the presence of firearms in the hospital. The AMA believes the following points merit attention: A. Given that security needs stem from local conditions, firearm policies must be developed with the cooperation and collaboration of the me dical staff, the hospital security staff, the hospital administration, other hospital staff representatives, legal counsel, and local law enforcement officials. Consultation with outside experts, including state and federal law enforcement agencies, or pat ient advocates may be warranted. B. The development of these policies should begin with a careful needs assessment that addresses past issues as well as future needs. C. Policies should, at minimum, address the following issues: a means of identification f or all staff and visitors; restrictions on access to the hospital or units within the hospital, including the means of ingress and egress; changes in the physical layout of the facility that would improve security; the possible use of metal detectors; the use of monitoring equipment such as closed circuit television; the development of an emergency signaling system; signage for the facility regarding the possession of weapons; procedures to be followed when a weapon is discovered; and the means for securing or controlling weapons that may be brought into the facility, particularly those considered contraband but also those carried in by law enforcement personnel. D. Once policies are developed, training should be provided to all members of the staff, with th e level and type of training being related to the perceived risks of various units within the facility. Training to recognize and defuse potentially viole nt situations should be included. E. Policies should undergo periodic reassessment and evaluation. F. Firearm policies should incorporate a clear protocol for situations in which weapons are brought into the hospital. 2.

Res. 410, A -13 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 234 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Updating Policy on Immigration Laws, Rules, Legislation, and Health Disparities Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, The 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) reported that about 10.6 million 1 undocumented immigrant s were living the United States 1; and 2 3 Whereas, Throughout the COVID -19 pandemic, there were at least 48 immigration policy 4 changes that not only affected international travel, student visas, immigration, and asylum 5 processes, but also caused significant confusion for immigration lawyers2-4; and 6 7 Whereas, The suspension of the United States Custom and Immigration Services (USCIS) 8 during the early stages of the COVID -19 pandemic led to a back -up in the processing of 9 necessary documentation, which left many unable to access certain benefits necessary for 10 work, receiving healthcare, and accessing public benefits5; and 11 12 Whereas, The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) suspended all hearings for non- 13 detained individuals on March 18, 2020, which delayed the processing of asylum seekers 14 enrolled in the Migrant Protection Protocols and left them to remain in Mexico in unsanitary 15 conditions that promotes the spread of the virus5; and 16 17 Whereas, The federal government used statutes and the Tariff Act of 1930 in order to create 18 rules from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and CBP that restricted entry 19 at the northern and southern borders and barred asylum seekers from entering the country due 20 to public health threats, despite evidence suggesting that such restrictions are ineffective and 21 may even divert resources from other interventions5; and 22 23 Whereas, Immigration courts closed at the beginning of the COVID -19 pandemic and postponed 24 hearings for detained people, prolonging their stay in detention centers4,5; and 25 26 Whereas, The relief packages that were provided by the government during the pandemic either 27 provided little or no coverage to immigrants and their families, leaving them with few options for 28 testing and treatment5-7; and 29 30 Whereas, The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) failed to make COVID- 19 31 related services available under emergency Medicaid, which means that immigrants are unable 32 to access these services since they cannot apply for non- emergency Medicaid due to 33 immigration eligibility criteria1,5,8; and 34 35 Whereas, The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) act limited the ability to 36 receive a stimulus payment to individuals with a social security number, which limits many 37 immigrants who file taxes using Individual Taxpayer Identification Num bers (ITIN)1,5,8; and 38 Resolution: 234 (A- 22) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, Lapses in work authorization due to slowed processing times and suspension of 1 required processing services may result in immigrants being unemployed or losing benefits 2 offered by their employer; further, undocumented immigran ts typically work low- earning jobs 3 and are unable to receive unemployment insurance or government stimulus checks during 4 national crises5,8,9; and 5 6 Whereas, Both the FFCRA and the CARES act expanded Unemployment Insurance (UI) 7 programs, but due to lapses in work authorizations, many immigrants may either not qualify or 8 lose access to this vital benefit1; and 9 10 Whereas, Skeletal and dental maturity are assessed from hand- wrist radiographs and dental x - 11 rays, which together are compared to growth charts to determine the age of an individual10; and 12 13 Whereas, Estimated chronological age determined from growth charts, hand- wrist radiographs, 14 and dental x -rays may not correlate with the true chronological age of an individual due to 15 population and geography -specifi c factors, including nutritional intake, environmental exposure, 16 and genetics to such an extent that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends against 17 using hand- wrist radiographs to determine the age of refugees10-14; and 18 19 Whereas, International records highlight the wide variety in growth charts used in different 20 countries, in part due to different genetics, nutrition, medical conditions, and environmental 21 exposures15-17; and 22 23 Whereas, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and 24 Human Services (HHS) can request new skeletal and dental x -ray imaging to establish the age 25 of an individual crossing the border, though the DHS handbook states that medical images may 26 be used only when no other means of verifying chronological age (records from birth, baptism, 27 school, healthcare, statements by the person in question or family members) exist18-20; and 28 29 Whereas, According to Food and Drug Administration recommendations, performing x -rays on 30 children comes with greater risk of radiation- related illness and should only be used to answer a 31 clinical question or to guide treatment19; and 32 33 Whereas, As part of the 2009 Appropriations Bill, Congress stated its concern that Immigration 34 and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had not stopped using fallible bone and dental forensics for 35 child age determination and has since decreased their use of age determination exams 21,22; 36 and 37 38 Whereas, In 2018, ICE decreased its number of age determination exams to less than 50; 39 meanwhile, HHS incr eased its utilization of the exams for those in the care of the Office of 40 Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to almost 700, almost double the number granted to both 41 agencies in each of the prior two years22; and 42 43 Whereas, Minors who are incorrectly classified as adults due to dental and x -ray imaging are 44 held in adult detention centers while waiting for their cases to be heard and therefore are not 45 held in the least restrictive setting, in violation of the Flores settlement agreement23,24; and 46 47 Whereas, Attorneys r epresenting minors report that their clients' supporting documentation was 48 not used and were instead placed in adult detention centers solely based on x -ray images for 49 months until federal judges ruled that ICE and HHS could not classify their immigrant clients as 50 adults based solely on imaging25; and 51 Resolution: 234 (A-22) Page 3 of 6 Whereas, AMA policy recognizes unique health needs of immigrants and refugees (H -350.957) 1 and opposes rules deter immigrants from utilizing non- cash public benefits (D -440.927) but 2 does not address protections for immigrants during national crises; and 3 4 Whereas, AMA policy advocates that healthcare for minors in detention centers should be 5 directed solely towards bettering heatlh (H -65.958) and that medical records should not be used 6 for immigration enforcement (H -315.966); therefore be it 7 8 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association, i n order to prioritize the unique health 9 needs of immigrants, asylees, refugees, and migrant workers during national crises, such as a 10 pandemic: 11 (1) oppose the slowing or halting of the release of individuals and families that are currently part 12 of the immigration process; 13 (2) oppose continual detention when the health of these groups is at risk and supports releasing 14 immigrants on recognizance, community support, bonding, or a formal monitoring program 15 during national crises that impose a health risk; 16 (3) support the extension or reauthorization of visas that were valid prior to a national crisis if the 17 crisis causes the halting of immigration processing; and 18 (4) oppose utilizing public health concerns to deny of significantly hinder eligibility for asylum 19 status to immigrants , refugees, or migrant workers without a viable, medically sound alternative 20 solution; (New HOD Policy) and be it further 21 22 RESOLVED, That our AMA support discontinuation of the use of non- medically necessary 23 dental and bone forensics to assess an immigrant's age.

Our AMA will advocate for the timely processing of visas for all physicians, including residents, fellows, and physicians in i ndependent practice. 6. Our AMA will work with other stakeholders to study the current impact of immigration reform efforts on residency and fellowship programs, physician supply, and timely access of patients to health care throughout the U.S. Alt.

Res. 013, A -19 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 235 (A-22) Introduced by: Ohio Subject: Improving the Veterans Health Administration Referrals for Veterans for Care outside the VA System Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, Scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs regarding wait times and access to 1 referral for specialty care resulted in reforms permitting expedited referral of VA patients to 2 doctors outside the VA system if prompt care could not be provided within the system ; and 3 4 Whereas, A whistleblower -prompted VA internal investigation confirmed that in 2017 alone, for 5 2,538 veterans, doctors outside the VA system were terminating services to the veterans and/or 6 referring them to collection agencies, and impacting their credit profiles, because the VA was 7 not providing the indicated pay for serv ices provided; and 8 9 Whereas, I nvestigation also determined that the software system for managing travel 10 reimbursement for the veterans referred outside the VA for care is obsolete, resulting in 11 $224 million in improper travel reimbursements in 2017 alone; and 12 13 Whereas, The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs plans a hearing this spring to address 14 these issues ; therefore be it 15 16 RESOLVED, The our American Medical Association advocate for reform of the veterans' health 17 administration t o provide timely and complete payment for veterans' care received outside the 18 VA system and accurate and efficient management of travel reimbursement for that care. 19 (Directive to Take Action) 20 Fiscal Note: Modest - between $1,000 - $5,000 Received: 05/10/22 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION Introduced by: Ohio Subject: Out-of-Network Care Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, Many patients receive care from physicians who are not in their insurance company's 1 restrictive network for multiple reasons; and 2 3 Whereas, This leads to out -of-netw ork bills that are unexpected both to patients and physicians, 4 especially in Emergency situations; and 5 6 Whereas, There are multiple potential legislative solutions being considered both at the national 7 and state levels to address this problem; and 8 9 Whereas, AMA Policy H -285.904 only addresses permitting mediation in those instances where 10 a physician's unique background or skills (e.g. the Gould Criteria) are not accounted for within a 11 minimum coverage standard; therefore be it 12 13 RESOLVED, That our Ameri can Medical Association amend, by substitution, AMA Policy 14 H-285.904, \" Out-of-Network Care,\" item H, to read as follows: 15 16 H. Mediation should be permitted in those instances where a physician's unique 17 background or skills (e.g. the Gould Criteria) are not accounted for within a 18 minimum coverage standard. 19 20 H. Mediation and/or Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) should be permitted in 21 all circumstances as an option or alternative to come to payment resolution 22 between insurers and providers.

Our AMA adopts the following principles related to unanticipated out -of-network care: A. Patients must not be financially penalized for receiving unanticipated care from an out -of- network provider. B. Insurers must meet appropriate network adequacy standards that include adequate patient access to care, including access to hospital -based physi cian specialties. State regulators should enforce such standards through active regulation of health insurance company plans. C. Insurers must be transparent and proactive in informing enrollees about all deductibles, copayments and other out -of-pocket cos ts that enrollees may incur. D. Prior to scheduled procedures, insurers must provide enrollees with reasonable and timely access to in -network physicians. Resolution: 236 (A-22) Page 2 of 2 E. Patients who are seeking emergency care should be protected under the \"prudent layperson\" legal st andard as established in state and federal law, without regard to prior authorization or retrospective denial for services after emergency care is rendered. F. Out -of-network payments must not be based on a contrived percentage of the Medicare rate or rates determined by the insurance company. G. Minimum coverage standards for unanticipated out -of-network services should be identified. Minimum coverage standards should pay out -of-network providers at the usual and customary out-of-network charges for servic es, with the definition of usual and customary based upon a percentile of all out -of-network charges for the particular health care service performed by a provider in the same or similar specialty and provided in the same geographical area as reported by a benchmarking database. Such a benchmarking database must be independently recognized and verifiable, completely transparent, independent of the control of either payers or providers and maintained by a non- profit organization. The non- profit organization shall not be affiliated with an insurer, a municipal cooperative health benefit plan or health management organization. H. Mediation should be permitted in those instances where a physician's unique background or skills (e.g. the Gould Criteria) are not ac counted for within a minimum coverage standard. 2. Our AMA will advocate for the principles delineated in Policy H -285.904 for all health plans, including ERISA plans. 3. Our AMA will advocate that any legislation addressing surprise out of network medical bills use an independent, non -conflicted database of commercial charges.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 239 (A-22) Introduced by: Idaho Subject: Virtual Services When Patients Are Away From Their Medical Home Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, Virtual telemedicine care is a tool that can increase access, lower cost, and improve 1 the quality of healthcare; and 2 3 Whereas, Due to rapid changes in virtual technology, and increasing patient mobility, the 4 practice of medicine may need to occur across state lines to facilitate continuity of care for Idaho 5 patients who are receiving care from an Idaho licensed physician; and 6 7 Whereas, Continuity of care is defined by the American Academy of Family Physicians as, \"the 8 process by which the patient and his/her physician- led care team are cooperatively involved in 9 ongoing health care management toward the shared goal of high- quality, cost -effective medical 10 care; \" and 11 12 Whereas, Two elements have been shown to predict the best healthcare outcomes - health 13 insurance coverage and a usual source of continuity of care; and 14 15 Whereas, Idaho law requires a physician to be licensed in Idaho and establish a physician- 16 patient relationship in accordance with Idaho law in order to treat patients located in Idaho using 17 telehealth technology; and 18 19 Whereas, The practitioner who the patient has an established relationship with at their medical 20 home is in the best position to provide continuity of care, particularly if enabling technology is 21 available; and 22 23 Whereas, Health insurance coverage, including Medicare Advantage part C, is often restricted 24 to networks defined by regional or state boundaries; therefore be i t 25 26 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support Medicare coverage of virtual 27 continuity of care follow -up services for patients within the physician's established medical home 28 when the patient has an established relationship with the provider and such care is not 29 prohibited by the state in which the patient is geographically situated at the time of service 30 (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 31 32 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 33 (CMS), and Congress if necessary, to cover virtual continuity follow -up care services provided 34 by a patient's established medical home or usual source of care, as if they were in person, even 35 if the patient is temporarily located outside of the region or state of their medical home. 36 (Directive to Take Action) 37 Resolution: 239 (A-22) Page 2 of 3 Fiscal Note: Modest - between $1,000 - $5,000 Received: 05/11/ 22 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Coverage of and Payment for Telemedicine H -480.946 1. Our AMA believes that telemedicine services should be covered and paid for if they abide by the following principles: a) A valid patient -physician relationship must be established before the provision of telemedicine services, through: - A face -to-face examination, if a face -to-face encounter would otherwise be required in the provision of the same service not delivered via telemedicine; or - A consultation with another physician who has an ongoing patient -physician relationship with the patient. The physician who has established a valid physician- patient relationship must agree to supervise the patient's care; or - Meeting standards of establishing a patient -physician relationship included as part of evidence- based clinical practice guidelines on telemedicine developed by major medical specialty societies, such as those of radiology and pathology. Exceptions to the foregoing include on- call, cross coverage situations; emergency medical treatment; and other exceptions that become recognized as meeting or improving the standard of care. If a medical home does not exist, telemedicine providers should facilitate the identification of medical homes and treating physicians where in- person services can be delivered in coordination with the telemedicine services. b) Physicians and other health practitioners delivering telemedicine services must abide by state licensure laws and state medical practice laws and requirements in the state in which the patient receives services. c) Physicians and other health practitioners delivering telemedici ne services must be licensed in the state where the patient receives services, or be providing these services as otherwise authorized by that state's medical board. d) Patients seeking care delivered via telemedicine must have a choice of provider, as required for all medical services. e) The delivery of telemedicine services must be consistent with state scope of practice laws. f) Patients receiving telemedicine services must have access to the licensure and board certification qualifications of the health care practitioners who are providing the care in advance of their visit. g) The standards and scope of telemedicine services should be consistent with related in- person services. h) The delivery of telemedicine services must follow evidence- based practice guidelines, to the degree they are available, to ensure patient safety, quality of care and positive health outcomes. i) The telemedicine service must be delivered in a transparent manner, to include but not be limited to, the identification of the patient and physician in advance of the delivery of the service, as well as patient cost -sharing responsibilities and any limitations in drugs that can be prescribed via telemedicine. j) The patient's medical history must be collected as part of the provision of any telemedicine service. k) The provision of telemedicine services must be properly documented and should include providing a visit summary to the patient. l) The provision of telemedicine services must include care coordination with the patient's medical home and/or existing treating physicians, which includes at a minimum identifying the patient's existing medical home and treating physicians and providing to the latter a copy of the medical record. Resolution: 239 (A-22) Page 3 of 3 m) Physicians, health professionals and entities that deliver telemedicine services must establish protocols for referrals for emergency services. 2. Our AMA believes that delivery of telemedicine services must abide by laws addressing the privacy and security of patients' medical information. 3. Our AMA encourages additional research to develop a stronger evidence base for telemedicine. 4. Our AMA supports additional pilot programs in the Medicare program to enable coverage of telemedicine services, including, but not limited to store- and-forward telemedicine. 5. Our AMA supports demonstration projects under the auspices of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to address how telemedicine can be integrated into new payment and delivery models. 6. Our AMA encourages physicians to verify that their medical liability insurance policy covers telemedicine services, including telemedicine services provided across state lines if applicable, prior to the delivery of any telemedicine service. 7. Our AMA encourages national medical specialty societies to leverage and potentially collaborate in the work of national telemedicine organizations, such as the American Telemedicine Association, in the area of telemedicine technical standards, to the extent practicable, and to take the lead in the development of telemedicine clinical practice guidelines.

Wehri, MD, Delegate Subject: Physician Payment Reform & Equity (PPR & E) Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, Physicians in independent practice are running small businesses and employ tens of 1 thousands of American workers ; and 2 3 Whereas, According to the Medicare Economic Index, the cost of running a medical practice 4 increased 39 percent from 2001 to 2021; and 5 6 Whereas, The U.S. economy has entered a new inflationary cycle and the cost of retaining staff 7 for a physician's office continues to inc rease with inflation; and 8 9 Whereas, According to data from the Medicare Trustees, Medicare physician pay has increased 10 just 11 percent over the last 20 years while Medicare hospital payments increased by 60% from 11 2001 to 2021; and 12 13 Whereas, Adjusted for inflation, Medicare physician pay declined 20 percent from 2001 to 2021, 14 while hospital payment far surpassed inflation in this period; and 15 16 Whereas, Cost/price pressures have reduced the number of independent practice physicians, 17 and have threatened the viability of independent medical practice; and 18 19 Whereas, The loss of the private practice of medicine will have a profound impact on the 20 availability of high- quality, cost -effective medical care for many patients across this nation; and 21 22 Whereas, Improved payments for physician work will aid all physicians, both independent and 23 employed, as increased payment for physician services will also improve the value of RVUs that 24 our employed physician colleagues depend on for their compensation; and 25 26 Whereas, Aur AMA has long had policy on improving payments for physician work, but it has 27 little to show in terms of concrete actions and results to accomplish said policy ; therefore be it 28 29 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association define Physician Payment Reform and 30 Equity (PPR & E) as \"improvement in physician payment by Medicare and other third- party 31 payers so that physician reimbursement covers current office practice expenses at rates that 32 are fair and equitable, and that said equity include annual updates in payment rates\" (Directive 33 to Take Action) ; and be it further 34 35 RESOLVED, That our AMA place Physician Payment Reform and Equity as the single highest 36 advocacy priority of our organization (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 37 Resolution: 240 (A-22) Page 2 of 2 RESOLVED, That our AMA use every resource at its disposal (including but not limited to 1 elective, legislative, regulatory, and lobbying efforts) to advocate for an immediate increase in 2 Medicare physician paym ents to help cover the expense of office practice (Directive to Take 3 Action); and be it further 4 5 RESOLVED, That in addition to an immediate increase in Medicare physician payments, our 6 AMA advocate for a statutory annual update in such payments that would equal or exceed the 7 Medicare Economic Index or the Consumer Price Index, whichever is most advantageous in 8 covering the continuously inflating costs of running an office practice (Directive to Take Action); 9 and be it further 10 11 RESOLVED, That our AMA establi sh a Task Force appointed by the Board of Trustees to 12 outline a specific set of steps that are needed to accomplish the goals of Physician Payment 13 Reform and Equity and report back to the HOD at the 2022 Interim Meeting regarding that plan 14 (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 15 16 RESOLVED, That our report back to the HOD at each subsequent meeting regarding their 17 progress on meeting the goals of Physician Payment Reform and Equity , until Physician 18 Payment Reform and Equity is accomplished.

This is confirmation of referral/authorization only;\" and 15 16 Whereas, This is unfair to the patient and physician who proceed in good faith to do the testing 17 or procedure or provide the medication; therefore be it 18 19 RESOLVED, That once the physician's office has received prior authorization for testing, a 20 procedure, or a medication, the insurance company should not be permitted to refuse payment 21 for that test or procedure or medication unless the patient is no longer insured by that company 22 at the time the test or procedure is done or the medication is given; and be it further 23 24 RESOLVED, That a health insuring corporation or utilization review organization that authorizes 25 a proposed admission, treatment, or health care service by a participating provider based upon 26 the complete and accurate submission of all necessary information relative to an el igible 27 enrollee should not retroactively deny this authorization if the provider renders the health care 28 service in good faith and pursuant to the authorization and all of the terms and conditions of the 29 provider's contract with the health insuring corporation, and be it further 30 31 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association seek federal legislation/rules to prohibit 32 denial of payment by a Medicare Advantage plan for a previously prior approved medication, 33 procedure, or test unless the patient is no longer insured by that company at the time of service 34 (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 35 36 RESOLVED, That our AMA redistribute its model legislation on retrospective denial of payment 37 to all state societies, especially those who have not already passed such legislation. (Directive 38 to Take Action) 39 Fiscal Note: Modest - between $1,000 - $5,000 Received: 05/10 /22 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DELEGATES 318 (A-22) Introduced by: Oklahoma Subject: CME for Preceptorship Referred to: Reference Committee C Whereas, Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits are vital to all physicians; and 1 2 Whereas, Being a \"preceptor\" for medical students, residents, fellows, and other allied health 3 professional students requires countless hours of preparation; and 4 5 Whereas, The American Osteopathic Association (AOA) offers category 1B credit to its 6 members for participation in the AOA Didactic and Preceptor Program; and 7 8 Whereas, 60 AOA categor y 1B credits may be applied to the required 120 hours of CME for 9 AOA physicians; and 10 11 Whereas, The American Academy of Family Physicians offers CME credits to its members for 12 teaching of medical students, residents, and other allied health professional students; and 13 14 Whereas, The AMA does not recognize the AOA credits awarded for teaching and being a 15 preceptor; and 16 17 Whereas, Recognizing such efforts would encourage more physicians to be involved in 18 preceptor programs, which in turn would expose more student s to the world of private practice 19 and the practice of medicine in more rural and underserved areas; therefore be it 20 21 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association study formulating a plan, in collaboration 22 with other interested bodies, to award AMA Category 1 credits to physicians who serve as 23 preceptors and teach medical students, residents, fellows, and other allied health professional 24 students training in Liaison Committee on Medical Education/Accreditation Council for Graduate 25 Medical Education accre dited institutions (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 26 27 RESOLVED, That our AMA devise a method of converting those credits awarded by other 28 organizations into AMA recognized credits for the purpose of CME.

(Direc tive to Take Action) 36 Minimal - less than $1,000 Received: 05/10 /22 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 320 (A-22) Introduced by: Michigan Subject: Tuition Cost Transparency Referred to: Reference Committee C Whereas, In 2018, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) reported that 76 1 percent of medical students graduated with a median loan debt of $200,000. Compared to the 2 median medical student debt of $50,000 in 1992, there is an approximate 220 percent increase 3 in medical school debt, even after accounting for the rate of inflation; and 4 5 Whereas, The capitalizing interest rates of Stafford Subsidized loans increased from 1.87 6 percent prior to 2006, to a current fixed rate of 6.87 percent, thereby exacerbating the rising 7 debt of medical students; and 8 9 Whereas, Higher levels of medical school debt are associated with worse academic outcomes 10 in undergraduate medical education, negative effects on mental well -being, and higher levels of 11 stress; and 12 13 Whereas, Higher medical school debt influences the way medical students approach major life 14 choices; students with higher aggregate amounts of debt were more likely to delay marriage or 15 having children and disagree that they would choose to become a physician again; and 16 17 Whereas, Medical students with higher debt compared to their peers were more likely to choose 18 a specialty with a higher annual income, were less likely to choose primary care, and less likely 19 to plan to practice in underserved locations; and 20 21 Whereas, The number of graduate medical students exceeds the number of available post 22 graduate year positions. The increasing number of students not matching, and the increase in 23 medical student debt can make medical school seem more of a financial risk; and 24 25 Whereas, The American Medical Association (AMA) supports continued assessment of the 26 value of graduate medical education (GME) and transparency of federal funding, which is 27 received by GME institutions; and 28 29 Whereas, Undergraduate medical students are not provided specific breakdowns of tuition costs 30 or reasons for tuition increases; and 31 32 Whereas, The AMA supports improving the systematic reporting of undergraduate medical 33 student expenditures to determine which items are included and the ranges of costs; therefore 34 be it 35 36 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association collaborate with organizations such as the 37 Association of American Medical Colleges in creating transparency in tuition costs of 38 undergraduate medical education institutions (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 39 Resolution: 320 (A-22) Page 2 of 5 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with other national organizations to improve the affordability of 1 medical education.

Our AMA will actively collaborate with appropriate stakeholder organizations, (including Association of American Medical Colleges, American Hospital Association, state medical societies, medical specialty societies/associations) to advocate for the preservation, stability and expansion of full funding for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education (GME) positions from all existing sources (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, CDC and others). Resolution: 320 (A-22) Page 3 of 5 2. Our AMA will actively advocate for the stable provision of matching federal funds for state Medicaid programs that fund GME positions. 3. Our AMA will actively seek congressional action to remove the caps on Medicare funding of GME positions for resident physicians that were imposed by the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997 (BBA - 1997). 4. Our AMA will strenuousl y advocate for increasing the number of GME positions to address the future physician workforce needs of the nation. 5. Our AMA will oppose efforts to move federal funding of GME positions to the annual appropriations process that is subject to instability and uncertainty. 6. Our AMA will oppose regulatory and legislative efforts that reduce funding for GME from the full scope of resident educational activities that are designated by residency programs for accreditation and the board certification of their graduates (e.g. didactic teaching, community service, off -site ambulatory rotations, etc.). 7. Our AMA will actively explore additional sources of GME funding and their potential impact on the quality of residency training and on patient care. 8. Our AMA w ill vigorously advocate for the continued and expanded contribution by all payers for health care (including the federal government, the states, and local and private sources) to fund both the direct and indirect costs of GME. 9. Our AMA will work, in coll aboration with other stakeholders, to improve the awareness of the general public that GME is a public good that provides essential services as part of the training process and serves as a necessary component of physician preparation to provide patient car e that is safe, effective and of high quality. 10. Our AMA staff and governance will continuously monitor federal, state and private proposals for health care reform for their potential impact on the preservation, stability and expansion of full funding for the direct and indirect costs of GME. 11. Our AMA: (a) recognizes that funding for and distribution of positions for GME are in crisis in the United States and that meaningful and comprehensive reform is urgently needed; (b) will immediately work with Co ngress to expand medical residencies in a balanced fashion based on expected specialty needs throughout our nation to produce a geographically distributed and appropriately sized physician workforce; and to make increasing support and funding for GME progr ams and residencies a top priority of the AMA in its national political agenda; and (c) will continue to work closely with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, Association of American Medical Colleges, American Osteopathic Association, and other key stakeholders to raise awareness among policymakers and the public about the importance of expanded GME funding to meet the nation's current and anticipated medical workforce needs. 12. Our AMA will collaborate with other organizations to explore evidence- based approaches to quality and accountability in residency education to support enhanced funding of GME. 13. Our AMA will continue to strongly advocate that Congress fund additional graduate medical education (GME) positions for the most critical workforce needs, especially considering the current and worsening maldistribution of physicians. 14. Our AMA will advocate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services allow for rural and other underserved rotations in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) -accredited residency programs, in disciplines of particular local/regional need, to occur in the offices of physicians who meet the qualifications for adjunct faculty of the residency program's sponsoring institution. 15. Our AMA encourages the ACGME to reduce barriers to rural and other underserved community experiences for graduate medical education programs that choose to provide such training, by adjusting as needed its program requirements, such as continuity requirements or limitations on time spent away from the primary residency site. 16. Our AMA encourages the ACGME and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) to continue to develop and disseminate innovative methods of training physicians efficiently that f oster the skills and inclinations to practice in a health care system that rewards team- based care and social accountability. 17. Our AMA will work with interested state and national medical specialty societies and other appropriate stakeholders to share a nd support legislation to increase GME funding, enabling a state to accomplish one or more of the following: (a) train more physicians to meet state and regional workforce needs; (b) train physicians who will practice in physician shortage/underserved areas; or (c) train physicians in undersupplied specialties and subspecialties in the state/region. 18. Our AMA supports the ongoing efforts by states to identify and address changing physician workforce needs within the GME landscape and continue to broadly advocate for innovative pilot programs that will Resolution: 320 (A-22) Page 4 of 5 increase the number of positions and create enhanced accountability of GME programs for quality outcomes. 19. Our AMA will continue to work with stakeholders such as Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), ACGME, AOA, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians, and other specialty organizations to analyze the changing landscape of future physician workforce needs as well as the number and variety of GME positions necessary t o provide that workforce. 20. Our AMA will explore innovative funding models for incremental increases in funded residency positions related to quality of resident education and provision of patient care as evaluated by appropriate medical education organi zations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 21. Our AMA will utilize its resources to share its content expertise with policymakers and the public to ensure greater awareness of the significant societal value of graduate medic al education (GME) in terms of patient care, particularly for underserved and at -risk populations, as well as global health, research and education. 22. Our AMA will advocate for the appropriation of Congressional funding in support of the National Healthc are Workforce Commission, established under section 5101 of the Affordable Care Act, to provide data and healthcare workforce policy and advice to the nation and provide data that support the value of GME to the nation. 23. Our AMA supports recommendations to increase the accountability for and transparency of GME funding and continue to monitor data and peer -reviewed studies that contribute to further assess the value of GME. 24. Our AMA will explore various models of all -payer funding for GME, especially as the Institute of Medicine (now a program unit of the National Academy of Medicine) did not examine those options in its 2014 report on GME governance and financing. 25. Our AMA encourages organizations with successful existing models to publicize and share strategies, outcomes and costs. 26. Our AMA encourages insurance payers and foundations to enter into partnerships with state and local agencies as well as academic medical centers and community hospitals seeking to expand GME. 27. Our AMA will develop, along with other interested stakeholders, a national campaign to educate the public on the definition and importance of graduate medical education, student debt and the state of the medical profession today and in the future. 28. Our AMA will collaborate with other stakeholder organizations to evaluate and work to establish consensus regarding the appropriate economic value of resident and fellow services. 29. Our AMA will monitor ongoing pilots and demonstration projects, and explore the feasibility of broader implementation of proposals that show promise as alternative means for funding physician education and training while providing appropriate compensation for residents and fellows. 30. Our AMA will monitor the status of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's response to public comments solicited regarding the 2014 IOM report, Graduate Medical Education That Meets the Nation's Health Needs, as well as results of ongoing studies, including that requested of the GAO, in order to formulate new advocacy strategy for GME funding, and will report back to the House of Delegates regularly on important changes in the landscape of GME funding. 31. Our AMA will advocate to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to adopt the concept of \"Cap- Flexibility\" an d allow new and current Graduate Medical Education teaching institutions to extend their cap-building window for up to an additional five years beyond the current window (for a total of up to ten years), giving priority to new residency programs in underserved areas and/or economically depressed areas. 32. Our AMA will: (a) encourage all existing and planned allopathic and osteopathic medical schools to thoroughly research match statistics and other career placement metrics when developing career guidance plans; (b) strongly advocate for and work with legislators, private sector partnerships, and existing and planned osteopathic and allopathic medical schools to create and fund graduate medical education (GME) programs that can accommodate the equivalent num ber of additional medical school graduates consistent with the workforce needs of our nation; and (c) encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), and other accrediting bodies, as part of accreditation of allopathic and osteopathic medical schools, to prospectively and retrospectively monitor medical school graduates' rates of placement into GME as well as GME completion. 33. Our AMA encourages the Secretary of the U.S. Department o f Health and Human Services to coordinate with federal agencies that fund GME training to identify and collect information needed to effectively evaluate how hospitals, health systems, and health centers with residency programs are Resolution: 320 (A-22) Page 5 of 5 utilizing these financia l resources to meet the nation's health care workforce needs. This includes information on payment amounts by the type of training programs supported, resident training costs and revenue generation, output or outcomes related to health workforce planning ( i.e., percentage of primary care residents that went on to practice in rural or medically underserved areas), and measures related to resident competency and educational quality offered by GME training programs.

Our AMA urges medical schools, residency training programs, medical specialty boards, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and medical group practices to incorporate and/or encourage development of leave policies, including parental, family, and medical leave policies, as part of the physician's standard benefit agreement. 2. Recommended components of parental leave policies for medical students and physicians include: (a) Resolution: 323 (A-22) Page 3 of 5 duration of leave allowed before and after delivery; (b) category of leave credited; (c) whether leave is paid or unpaid; (d) whether provision is made for continuation of insurance benefits during leave, and who pays the premium; (e) whether sick leave and vacation time may be accrued from year to year or used in advance; (f) how much time must be made up in order to be considered board eligible; (g) whether make-up time will be paid; (h) whether schedule accommodati ons are allowed; and (i) leave policy for adoption. 3. AMA policy is expanded to include physicians in practice, reading as follows: (a) residency program directors and group practice administrators should review federal law concerning maternity leave for guidance in developing policies to assure that pregnant physicians are allowed the same sick leave or disability benefits as those physicians who are ill or disabled; (b) staffing levels and scheduling are encouraged to be flexible enough to allow for coverage without creating intolerable increases in other physicians' workloads, particularly in residency programs; and (c) physicians should be able to return to their practices or training programs after taking parental leave without the loss of status. 4. Our AMA encourages residency programs, specialty boards, and medical group practices to incorporate into their parental leave policies a six -week minimum leave allowance, with the understanding that no parent should be required to take a minimum leave. 5. Residency program directors should review federal and state law for guidance in developing policies for parental, family, and medical leave. 6. Medical students and physicians who are unable to work because of pregnancy, childbirth, and other related medical conditions should be entitled to such leave and other benefits on the same basis as other physicians who are temporarily unable to work for other medical reasons. 7. Residency programs should develop written policies on parental leave, family leave, and medical leave for physicians. Such written policies should include the following elements: (a) leave policy for birth or adoption; (b) duration of leave allowed before and after delivery; (c) category of leave credited (e.g., sick, vacation, parental, unpaid leave, short term disability); (d) whether leave is paid or unpaid; (e) whether provision is made for continuation of insurance benefits during leave and who pays for premiums; (f) whether sick leave and vacation time may be accrued from year to year or used in advance; (g) extended leave for resident physicians with extraordinary and long- term personal or family medical tragedies for periods of up to one year, without loss of previously accepted residency positions, for devastating conditions such as terminal illness, permanent disability, or complications of pregnancy that threaten maternal or fetal life; (h) how time can be made up in order for a resident physician to be considered board eligible; (i) what period of leave would result in a resident phy sician being required to complete an extra or delayed year of training; (j) whether time spent in making up a leave will be paid; and (k) whether schedule accommodations are allowed, such as reduced hours, no night call, modified rotation schedules, and permanent part -time scheduling. 8. Our AMA endorses the concept of equal parental leave for birth and adoption as a benefit for resident physicians, medical students, and physicians in practice regardless of gender or gender identity. 9. Staffing levels and scheduling are encouraged to be flexible enough to allow for coverage without creating intolerable increases in the workloads of other physicians, particularly those in residency programs. 10. Physicians should be able to return to their practices or training programs after taking parental leave, family leave, or medical leave without the loss of status. 11. Residency program directors must assist residents in identifying their specific requirements (for example, the number of months to be made up) because of leave for eligibility for board certification and must notify residents on leave if they are in danger of falling below minimal requirements for board eligibility. Program directors must give these residents a complete list of requirements to be complet ed in order to retain board eligibility. 12. Our AMA encourages flexibility in residency training programs, incorporating parental leave and alternative schedules for pregnant house staff. 13. In order to accommodate leave protected by the federal Family a nd Medical Leave Act, our AMA encourages all specialties within the American Board of Medical Specialties to allow graduating residents to extend training up to 12 weeks after the traditional residency completion date while still maintaining board eligibil ity in that year. 14. These policies as above should be freely available online and in writing to all applicants to medical school, residency or fellowship.

CME Rep. 10, A -06; Reaffirmed: CME Rep. 01, A -16. Strategies for Enhancing Diversity in the Physician Workforce H -200.951 Our AMA: (1) supports increased diversity across all specialties in the physician workforce in the categories of race, ethnicity, disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic origin, and rurality; (2) commends the Institute of Medicine (now known as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine) for its report, \"In the Nation's Compelling Interest: Ensuring Diversity in the Health Care Workforce,\" and supports the concept that a racially and ethnically diverse educational experience results in better educational outcomes; (3) encourages the development of evidence- informed programs to build role models among academic leadership and faculty for the mentorship of students, residents , and fellows underrepresented in medicine and in specific specialties; (4) encourages physicians to engage in their communities to guide, support, and mentor high school and undergraduate students with a calling to medicine; (5) encourages medical schools, health care institutions, managed care and other appropriate groups to adopt and utilize activities that bolster efforts to include and support individuals who are underrepresented in medicine by developing policies that articulate the value and importance of diversity as a goal that benefits all participants, cultivating and funding programs that nurture a culture of diversity on campus, and recruiting faculty and staff who share this goal; and (6) continue to study and provide recommendations to improve the future of health equity and racial justice in medical education, the diversity of the health workforce, and the outcomes of marginalized patient populations.

Our AMA, independently and in collaboration with other groups such as the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), will actively work and advocate for funding at the federal and state levels and in the private sector to support the following: (a) Pipeline programs to prepare and motivate members of underrepresented groups to enter medical school; (b) Diversity or minority affairs offices at medical schools; (c) Financial aid programs for students from groups that are underrepresented in medicine; and (d) Financial support programs to recruit and develop faculty members from underrepresented groups. 2. Our AMA will work to obtain full restoration and protection of federal Title VII funding, and similar state funding programs, for the Centers of Excellence Program, Health Careers Opportunity Program, Area Health Education Centers, and ot her programs that support physician training, recruitment, and retention in geographically -underserved areas. 3. Our AMA will take a leadership role in efforts to enhance diversity in the physician workforce, including engaging in broad- based efforts that involve partners within and beyond the medical profession and medical education community. 4. Our AMA will encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Education to assure that medical schools demonstrate compliance with its requirements for a diverse student body and faculty. 5. Our AMA will develop an internal education program for its members on the issues and possibilities involved in creating a diverse physician population. 6. Our AMA will provide on- line educational materials for its membership that address diversity issues in patient care including, but not limited to, culture, religion, race and ethnicity. 7. Our AMA will create and support programs that introduce elementary through high school students, especially those from groups that are underrepresented in medicine (URM), to healthcare careers. 8. Our AMA will create and support pipeline programs and encourage support services for URM college students that will support them as they move through college, medical school and residency programs. 9. Our AMA will recommend that medical school admissions committees use holistic assessments of admission applicants that take into account the diversity of preparation and the variety of talents that applicants bring to their education. 10. Our AMA will advocate for the tracking and reporting to interested stakeholders of demographic information pertaining to URM status collected from Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) Resolution: 323 (A-22) Page 5 of 5 applications through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). 11. Our AMA w ill continue the research, advocacy, collaborative partnerships and other work that was initiated by the Commission to End Health Care Disparities. 12. Our AMA opposes legislation that would undermine institutions' ability to properly employ affirmative action to promote a diverse student population. 13. Our AMA will work with the AAMC and other stakeholders to create a question for the AAMC electronic medical school application to identify previous pipeline program (also known as pathway program) participation and create a plan to analyze the data in order to determine the effectiveness of pipeline programs.

Res. 207, I -18; Reaffirmation: A -19; Appended: A -19; Appended: Res. 319, A - 19; Modified: CME Rep. 5, A -21 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 324 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Sexual Harassment Accreditation Standards for Medical Training Programs Referred to: Reference Committee C Whereas, Sexual harassment is defined as \"sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and 1 other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when (l) such conduct interferes with an 2 individual's work or academic performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work 3 or academic environment or (2) accepting or rejecting such conduct affects or may be perceived 4 to affect employment decisions or academic evaluations concerning the individual\" by the AMA 5 Journal of Ethics and is \"unethical...[and] raise[s] concerns because of inherent inequalities in 6 the status and power that medical supervisors wield in relation to medical trainees and may 7 adversely affect patient care\"1; and 8 9 Whereas, According to the 2018 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 10 and Medicine, 49.6% of female students in medical school or in graduate school for a 11 healthcare field have reported having experienced sexual harassment during their training2; and 12 13 Whereas, Female medical students are 220 % more likely to experience unwanted crude 14 behavior from faculty or staff compared to female students studying non- scientific fields2; and 15 16 Whereas, At one medical program, female medical students were more likely than their male 17 colleagues to be physically sexually harassed and to be harassed by a person of higher 18 professional status, resulting in 79% of female survivors and 45% of male survivors saying that 19 the experience of sexual harassment created a \"hostile environment\" or interfered with work 20 performa nce3; and 21 22 Whereas, Sexual harassment during training has been shown to have a significant impact on 23 the specialty and residency program choices of female trainees4; and 24 25 Whereas, Female residents are more likely to experience sexual harassment during graduate 26 medical education in fields such as surgery and emergency medicine compared to other 27 specialties, with one study finding that 70.8% of female general surgery residents reported 28 experiencing sexual harassment during training2,5; and 29 30 Whereas, Female residents are more likely to experience sexual harassment in male- dominated 31 workplaces, especially when leadership is male- dominated, and male physicians continue to be 32 dramatically overrepresented in healthcare leadership positions, with 84% to 85% of depar tment 33 chair and medical dean appointments in 2013 to 2014, despite approximately equal female 34 entrance into medicine2,6-9; and 35 36 Whereas, Experiencing sexual harassment has been linked to poor job -related outcomes such 37 as work withdrawal, a decrease in commitment to the organization, and reduction of job 38 satisfaction, and sexual harassment has a stronger negative impact on a woman's well -being 39 Resolution: 324 (A-22) Page 2 of 11 through psychological consequences such as anxiety and depression compared to general job 1 stressors such as workload and meeting deadlines2,10; and 2 3 Whereas, Sexual harassment continues to be a problem in medicine despite federal protection 4 such as Title VII, Title IX, and the Clery Act, which intend to protect victims of sexual 5 harassment from gender discrimination and unwanted sexual attention11-14; and 6 7 Whereas, Under Title IX, educational institutions are required to provide students and trainees 8 with resources for reporting sexual harassment, including information on their rights under Title 9 IX, how to contact the institution's Title IX coordinator , and how to file a complaint of sexual 10 harassment, and the institution must also have a policy how it will investigate and respond to 11 reported allegations of sexual harassment15; and 12 13 Whereas, Legal protections do not adequately protect trainees from covert retaliation, and fear 14 of retaliation accounts for 28% of the approximately 79% of cases of sexual harassment that go 15 unreported11; and 16 17 Whereas, In the absence of an institutional culture that promotes sexual harassment training at 18 all levels and the im portance of incident reporting as part of the solution to mitigate sexual 19 harassment, sexual harassment training and reporting methods are not effective at reducing 20 sexual harassment of medical trainees16-18; and 21 22 Whereas, A recent survey of pediatric, gas troenterology, and internal medicine residents 23 revealed that only 43% knew of institutional policies to support sexual harassment victims and a 24 2017 AAMC survey of medical students found that only 21% of students reported experiences 25 of sexual harassment, with 37% of those not reporting stating \"I did not think anything would be 26 done about it\" and 9% of those not reporting stating \"I did not know what to do\"11,19; and 27 28 Whereas, The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) serves as the accrediting body 29 that holds all medical schools to 12 standards which ensure graduates have been adequately 30 trained to begin graduate medical education20; and 31 32 Whereas, The LCME does not explicitly address sexual harassment in the written standards for 33 Anti-Discrimination and Student Mistreatment21; and 34 35 Whereas, LCME Standard 12 does explicitly address the need for medical schools to provide 36 \"effective student services to all medical students to assist them in achieving the program's 37 goals for its students\"21; and 38 39 Whereas, LCME Standard 12.3: Personal Counseling/Well -Being Programs states that, \"A 40 medical school has in place an effective system of personal counseling for its medical students 41 that includes programs to promote their well -being and to fac ilitate their adjustment to the 42 physical and emotional demands of medical education,\" thereby establishing precedent for 43 specific standards on student well -being including for the concerns addressed herein21; and 44 45 Whereas, The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) serves as the 46 accrediting body that evaluates all residency and fellowship programs to ensure programs meet 47 the established quality standards for each specialty and subspecialty22; and 48 49 Whereas, The ACGME requires residency and fellowship programs to maintain a professional 50 environment free from sexual harassment, but does not explicitly state how that standard is 51 evaluated23,24; therefore be it 52 Resolution: 324 (A- 22) Page 3 of 11 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association encourage the LCME and ACGME to 1 create a standard for accreditation that includes sexual harassment training, policies, and 2 repercussions for sexual harassment in undergraduate and graduate medical programs; 3 (Directive to Take Action) and be it further 4 5 RESOLVED, That o ur AMA encourage the LCME and ACGME to assess: 1) medical trainees' 6 perception of institutional culture regarding sexual harassment and preventative trainings and 2) 7 sexual harassment prevalence, reporting, investigation of allegations, and Title IX resour ce 8 utilization in order to recommend best practices.

Sexual harassment in the practice of medicine is unethical. Sexual harassment exploits inequalities in status and power, abuses the rights and trust of those who are subjected to such conduct; interferes with an individual's work performance, and may influence or be perceived as influencing professional advancement in a manner unrelated to clinical or academic performance harm professional working relationships, and create an intimidating or hostile work environ ment; and is likely to jeopardize patient care. Sexual relationships between medical supervisors and trainees are not acceptable, even if consensual. The supervisory role should be eliminated if the parties wish to pursue their relationship. Physicians sho uld promote and adhere to strict sexual harassment policies in medical workplaces. Physicians who participate in grievance committees should be broadly representative with respect to gender identity or sexual orientation, profession, and employment status, have the power to enforce harassment policies, and be accessible to the persons they are meant to serve. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: II,IV,VII The Opinions in this chapter are offered as ethics guidance for physicians and are not intended to establi sh standards of clinical practice or rules of law. Issued: 2016 Principles for Advancing Gender Equity in Medicine H -65.961 Principles for Advancing Gender Equity in Medicine: Our AMA: 1. declares it is opposed to any exploitation and discrimination in the workplace based on personal characteristics (i.e., gender); 2. affirms the concept of equal rights for all physicians and that the concept of equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the U.S. Government or by any state on account of gender; 3. endorses the principle of equal opportunity of employment and practice in the medical field; 4. affirms its commitment to the full involvement of women in leadership roles throughout the federation, and encourages all c omponents of the federation to vigorously continue their efforts to recruit women members into organized medicine; 5. acknowledges that mentorship and sponsorship are integral components of one's career advancement, and encourages physicians to engage in s uch activities; 6. declares that compensation should be equitable and based on demonstrated competencies/expertise and not based on personal characteristics; 7. recognizes the importance of part -time work options, job sharing, flexible scheduling, re- entry , and contract negotiations as options for physicians to support work -life balance; 8. affirms that transparency in pay scale and promotion criteria is necessary to promote gender equity, and as such academic medical centers, medical schools, hospitals, gr oup practices and other physician employers should conduct periodic reviews of compensation and promotion rates by gender and evaluate protocols for advancement to determine whether the criteria are discriminatory; and 9. affirms that medical schools, inst itutions and professional associations should provide training on leadership development, contract and salary negotiations and career advancement strategies that include an analysis of the influence of gender in these skill areas. Our AMA encourages: (1) state and specialty societies, academic medical centers, medical schools, hospitals, group practices and other physician employers to adopt the AMA Principles for Advancing Gender Equity in Medicine; and (2) academic medical centers, medica l schools, hospitals, group practices and other physician employers to: (a) adopt policies that prohibit harassment, discrimination and retaliation; (b) provide anti -harassment training; and (c) prescribe disciplinary and/or corrective action should violat ion of such policies occur. BOT Rep. 27, A -19 Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events H -140.837 It is the policy of the American Medical Association that all attendees of AMA hosted meetings, events and other activities are expected to exhibit respec tful, professional, and collegial behavior during such meetings, events and activities, including but not limited to dinners, receptions and social gatherings held Resolution: 324 (A-22) Page 5 of 11 in conjunction with such AMA hosted meetings, events and other activities. Attendees should exercise consideration and respect in their speech and actions, including while making formal presentations to other attendees, and should be mindful of their surroundings and fellow participants. Any type of harassment of any attendee of an AMA hosted meeting, event and other activity, including but not limited to dinners, receptions and social gatherings held in conjunction with an AMA hosted meeting, event or activity, is prohibited conduct and is not tolerated. The AMA is committed to a zero tolerance f or harassing conduct at all locations where AMA business is conducted. This zero tolerance policy also applies to meetings of all AMA sections, councils, committees, task forces, and other leadership entities (each, an \"AMA Entity\"), as well as other AMA -sponsored events. The purpose of the policy is to protect participants in AMA -sponsored events from harm. Definition Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct whether verbal, physical or visual that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, marital status, citizenship or otherwise, and that: (1) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment; (2) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's participation in meetings or proceedings of the HOD or any AMA Entity; or (3) otherwise adversely affects an individual's participation in such meetings or proceedings or, in the case of AMA staff, such individual's employment opportunities or tangible job benefits. Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written, electronic, or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group and that is placed on walls or elsewhere on the AMA's premises or at the site of any AMA meeting or circulated in connection with any AMA meeting. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment also constitutes discrimination, and is unlawful and is absolutely prohibited. For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment includes: - making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other verbal, physical, or visual conduct of a sexual nature; and - creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment or otherwise unreasonably interfering with an individual's participation in meetings or proceedings of the HOD or any AMA Entity or, in the case of AMA staff, such individual's work performance, by instances of such conduct. Sexual harassment may include such conduct as explicit sexual propositions, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments or gestures, descriptive comments about an individual's physical appearance, electronic stalking or lewd messages, displays of foul or obscene printed or visual material, and any unwelcome physical contact. Retaliation against anyone who has reported harassment, submits a complaint, reports an incident witnessed, or participates in any way in the investigation of a harassment claim is forbidden. Each complaint of harassment or retaliation will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. To the fullest extent possible, the AMA will keep complaints and the terms of their resolution confidential. Operational Guidelines The AMA shall, through the Office of General Counsel, implement and maintain mechanisms for reporting, investigation, and enforcement of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events in accordance with the following: 1. Conduct Liaison and Committee on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events (CCAM) The Office of General Counsel will appoint a \"Conduct Liaison\" for all AMA House of Delegates meetings and all other AMA hosted meetings or activities (such as meetings of AMA councils, sections, the RVS Update Committee (RUC), CPT Editorial Panel, or JAMA Editorial Boards), with responsibility for receiving reports of alleged policy violations, conducting investigations, and initiating both immediate and longer -term consequences for such violations. The Conduct Liaison appointed for any meeting will have the appropriate training and experience to serve in this capacity, and may be a third party or an in- house AMA resource with assigned responsibility for this role. The Conduct Liaison will be (i) on- site at all House of Delegates meetings and other large, national AMA meetings and (ii) on call for smaller meetings and activities. Appointments of the Conduct Liaison for each meeting shall ensure appropriate independence and neutrality, and avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest, in investigation of alleged policy violations and in decisions on consequences for policy violations. The AMA shall establish and maintain a Committee on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events (CCAM), to be comprised of 5- 7 AMA members who are nominated by the Office of General Counsel (or through a nomination process facilitated by the Office of General Counsel) and approved by the Board of Trustees. Resolution: 324 (A-22) Page 6 of 11 The CCAM should include one member of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA); provided, however, that such CEJA member on the CCAM shall be recused from discussion and vote concerning referral by the CCAM of a matter to CEJA for further review and action. The remaining members may be appointed from AMA membership generally, with emphasis on maximizing the diversity of membership. Appointments to the CCAM shall ensure appropriate independence and neutrality, and avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest, in deci sions on consequences for policy violations. Appointments to the CCAM should be multi -year, with staggered terms. 2. Reporting Violations of the Policy Any persons who believe they have experienced or witnessed conduct in violation of Policy H -140.837, \"Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events,\" during any AMA House of Delegates meeting or other activities associated with the AMA (such as meetings of AMA councils, sections, the RVS Update Committee (RUC), CPT Editorial Panel or JAMA Editorial Boards) should promptly notify the (i) Conduct Liaison appointed for such meeting, and/or (ii) the AMA Office of General Counsel and/or (iii) the presiding officer(s) of such meeting or activity. Alternatively, violations may be reported using an AMA reporting hotli ne (telephone and online) maintained by a third party on behalf of the AMA. The AMA reporting hotline will provide an option to report anonymously, in which case the name of the reporting party will be kept confidential by the vendor and not be released to the AMA. The vendor will advise the AMA of any complaint it receives so that the Conduct Liaison may investigate. These reporting mechanisms will be publicized to ensure awareness. 3. Investigations All reported violations of Policy H -140.837, \"Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events,\" pursuant to Section 2 above (irrespective of the reporting mechanism used) will be investigated by the Conduct Liaison. Each reported violation will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. Whenever possible, the Conduc t Liaison should conduct incident investigations on- site during the event. This allows for immediate action at the event to protect the safety of event participants. When this is not possible, the Conduct Liaison may continue to investigate incidents following the event to provide recommendations for action to the CCAM. Investigations should consist of structured interviews with the person reporting the incident (the reporter), the person targeted (if they are not the reporter), any witnesses that the repor ter or target identify, and the alleged violator. Based on this investigation, the Conduct Liaison will determine whether a violation of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events has occurred. All reported violations of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events, and the outcomes of investigations by the Conduct Liaison, will also be promptly transmitted to the AMA's Office of General Counsel (i.e. irrespective of whether the Conduct Liaison determines that a violation has occurred). 4. Disciplinary Action If the Conduct Liaison determines that a violation of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events has occurred, the Conduct Liaison may take immediate action to protect the safety of event participants, which may include having the violator removed from the AMA meeting, event or activity, without warning or refund. Additionally, if the Conduct Liaison determines that a violation of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events has occurred, the Conduct Liaison shall report any such violation to the CCAM, together with recommendations as to whether additional commensurate disciplinary and/or corrective actions (beyond those taken on- site at the meeting, event or activity, if any) are appropriate. The CCAM will review all incident reports, perform further investigation (if needed) and recommend to the Office of General Counsel any additional commensurate disciplinary and/or corrective action, which may include but is not limited to the following: - Prohibiting the violator from att ending future AMA events or activities; - Removing the violator from leadership or other roles in AMA activities; - Prohibiting the violator from assuming a leadership or other role in future AMA activities; - Notifying the violator's employer and/or spons oring organization of the actions taken by AMA; - Referral to the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) for further review and action; - Referral to law enforcement. The CCAM may, but is not required to, confer with the presiding officer(s) of app licable events activities in making its recommendations as to disciplinary and/or corrective actions. Consequence for policy violations will be commensurate with the nature of the violation(s). 5. Confidentiality Resolution: 324 (A- 22) Page 7 of 11 All proceedings of the CCAM should be kept as confidential as practicable. Reports, investigations, and disciplinary actions under Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events will be kept confidential to the fullest extent possible, consistent with usual business practices. 6. Assent to Policy As a condition of attending and participating in any meeting of the House of Delegates, or any council, section, or other AMA entities, such as the RVS Update Committee (RUC), CPT Editorial Panel and JAMA Editorial Boards, or other AMA hosted meeting or activ ity, each attendee will be required to acknowledge and accept (i) AMA policies concerning conduct at AMA HOD meetings, including the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events and (ii) applicable adjudication and disciplinary processes for violations of such policies (including those implemented pursuant to these Operational Guidelines), and all attendees are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with these policies. Additionally, individuals elected or appointed to a leadership role in the AMA or its affiliates will be required to acknowledge and accept the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events and these Operational Guidelines. [Editor's note: Violations of this Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events may be reported at 800.398.1496 or online at https://www.lighthouse- services.com/ama . Both are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Please note that situations unrelated to this Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events should n ot be reported here. In particular, patient concerns about a physician should be reported to the state medical board or other appropriate authority.] BOT Rep. 23, A -17 Appended: BOT Rep. 20, A -18 Modified: BOT Rep. 10, A -19; Modified: CCB Rep. 2, I-20 CME Rep. 7, A -03 Modified and Appended: BOT Rep. 16, A -12 Teacher -Learner Relationship In Medical Education H -295.955 The AMA recommends that each medical education institution have a widely disseminated policy that: (1) sets forth the expected standards of behavior of the teacher and the learner; (2) delineates procedures for dealing with breaches of that standard, including: (a) avenues for complaints, (b) procedures for investigation, (c) protection and confidentiality, (d) sanctions; and (3) outlines a mechanism for prevention and education. The AMA urges all medical education programs to regard the following Code of Behavior as a guide in developing standards of behavior for both teachers and learners in their own institutions, with appropriate provisions for grievance procedures, investigative methods, and maintenance of confidentiality. CODE OF BEHAVIOR The teacher -learner relationship should be based on mutual trust, respect, and responsibility. This relationship should be carried out in a professional manner, in a learning environment that places strong focus on education, high quality patient care, and ethical conduct. A number of factors place demand on medical school faculty to devote a greater proportion of their time to revenue- generating activity. Greater severity of illness among inpatients also places heavy demands on residents and fellows. In the face of sometimes conflicting demands on their time, educators must work to preserve the priority of education and place appropriate emphasis on the critical role of teacher. In the teacher -learner relationship, each party has certain legitimate expectations of the other. For example, the learner can expect that the teacher will provide instruction, guidance, inspiration, and leadership in learning. The teacher expects the learner to make an appropriate professional investment of energy and intellect to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to become an effective physician. Both parties can expect the other to prepare appropriately for the educational interaction and to discharge their responsibilities in the educational relationship with unfailing honesty. Certain behaviors are inherently destructive to the teacher -learner relationship. Behaviors such as violence, sexual harassment, inappropriate discrimination based on personal characteristics must never be tolerated. Other behavior can also be inappropriate if the effect interferes with professional development. Behavior patterns such as making habitual demeaning or derogatory remarks, belittling comments or destructive criticism fall into this category. On the behavioral level, abuse may be operationally defined as behavior by medical school faculty, residents, or students which is consensually disapproved by society and by the academic community as either exploitive or punishing. Examples of inappropriate behavior are: physical punishment or physical threats; sexual harassment; discrimination based on race, religion, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, and physical disabilities; repeated episodes of psychological punishment of a student by a particular superior (e.g., public humiliation, threats and intimidation, removal of privileges); grading used to punish a student rather than Resolution: 324 (A-22) Page 8 of 11 to evaluate objective performance; assigning task s for punishment rather than educational purposes; requiring the performance of personal services; taking credit for another individual's work; intentional neglect or intentional lack of communication. On the institutional level, abuse may be defined as policies, regulations, or procedures that are socially disapproved as a violation of individuals' rights. Examples of institutional abuse are: policies, regulations, or procedures that are discriminatory based on race, religion, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, and physical disabilities; and requiring individuals to perform unpleasant tasks that are entirely irrelevant to their education as physicians. While criticism is part of the learning process, in order to be effective and const ructive, it should be handled in a way to promote learning. Negative feedback is generally more useful when delivered in a private setting that fosters discussion and behavior modification. Feedback should focus on behavior rather than personal characteris tics and should avoid pejorative labeling. Because people's opinions will differ on whether specific behavior is acceptable, teaching programs should encourage discussion and exchange among teacher and learner to promote effective educational strategies. P eople in the teaching role (including faculty, residents, and students) need guidance to carry out their educational responsibilities effectively. Medical schools are urged to develop innovative ways of preparing students for their roles as educators of other students as well as patients. BOT Rep. ZZ, I -90 Reaffirmed by CME Rep. 9, A -98 Reaffirmed: CME Rep. 2, I -99 Modified: BOT Rep. 11, A -07 Reaffirmed: CME Rep. 9, A -13; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 9, I -20 Recommendations for Future Directions for Medical Education H -295.995 Our AMA supports the following recommendations relating to the future directions for medical education: (1) The medical profession and those responsible for medical education should strengthen the general or broad components of both undergraduate and graduate medical education. All medical students and resident physicians should have general knowledge of the whole field of medicine regardless of their projected choice of specialty. (2) Schools of medicine should accept the principle a nd should state in their requirements for admission that a broad cultural education in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, as well as in the biological and physical sciences, is desirable. (3) Medical schools should make their goals and objectives k nown to prospective students and premedical counselors in order that applicants may apply to medical schools whose programs are most in accord with their career goals. (4) Medical schools should state explicitly in publications their admission requirements and the methods they employ in the selection of students. (5) Medical schools should require their admissions committees to make every effort to determine that the students admitted possess integrity as well as the ability to acquire the knowledge and ski lls required of a physician. (6) Although the results of standardized admission testing may be an important predictor of the ability of students to complete courses in the preclinical sciences successfully, medical schools should utilize such tests as only one of several criteria for the selection of students. Continuing review of admission tests is encouraged because the subject content of such examinations has an influence on premedical education and counseling. (7) Medical schools should improve thei r liaison with college counselors so that potential medical students can be given early and effective advice. The resources of regional and national organizations can be useful in developing this communication. (8) Medical schools are chartered for the uni que purpose of educating students to become physicians and should not assume obligations that would significantly compromise this purpose. (9) Medical schools should inform the public that, although they have a unique capability to identify the changing me dical needs of society and to propose responses to them, they are only one of the elements of society that may be involved in responding. Medical schools should continue to identify social problems related to health and should continue to recommend solutio ns. (10) Medical school faculties should continue to exercise prudent judgment in adjusting educational programs in response to social change and societal needs. (11) Faculties should continue to evaluate curricula periodically as a means of insuring that graduates will have the capability to recognize the diverse nature of disease, and the potential to provide preventive and comprehensive medical care. Medical schools, within the framework of their respective institutional goals Resolution: 324 (A-22) Page 9 of 11 and regardless of the organ izational structure of the faculty, should provide a broad general education in both basic sciences and the art and science of clinical medicine. (12) The curriculum of a medical school should be designed to provide students with experience in clinical medicine ranging from primary to tertiary care in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings, such as university hospitals, community hospitals, and other health care facilities. Medical schools should establish standards and apply them to all components of the clinical educational program regardless of where they are conducted. Regular evaluation of the quality of each experience and its contribution to the total program should be conducted. (13) Faculties of medical schools have the responsibility to evaluate the cognitive abilities of their students. Extramural examinations may be used for this purpose, but never as the sole criterion for promotion or graduation of a student. (14) As part of the responsibility for granting the MD degree, faculties of medical schools have the obligation to evaluate as thoroughly as possible the non- cognitive abilities of their medical students. (15) Medical schools and residency programs should continue to recognize that the instruction provided by volunteer and part -time members of the faculty and the use of facilities in which they practice make important contributions to the education of medical students and resident physicians. Development of means by which the volunteer and part -time faculty can express their professional viewpoints regarding the educational environment and curriculum should be encouraged. (16) Each medical school should establish, or review already established, criteria for the initial appointment, continuation of appointment, and promotion of all categories of faculty. Regular evaluation of the contribution of all faculty members should be conducted in accordance with institutional policy and practice. (17a) Faculties of medical schools should reevaluate the current elements of their fourth or final ye ar with the intent of increasing the breadth of clinical experience through a more formal structure and improved faculty counseling. An appropriate number of electives or selected options should be included. (17b) Counseling of medical students by faculty and others should be directed toward increasing the breadth of clinical experience. Students should be encouraged to choose experience in disciplines that will not be an integral part of their projected graduate medical education. (18) Directors of residency programs should not permit medical students to make commitments to a residency program prior to the final year of medical school. (19) The first year of postdoctoral medical education for all graduates should consist of a broad year of general training. (a) For physicians entering residencies in internal medicine, pediatrics, and general surgery, postdoctoral medical education should include at least four months of training in a specialty or specialties other than the one in which the resident has been appointed. (A residency in family practice provides a broad education in medicine because it includes training in several fields.) (b) For physicians entering residencies in specialties other than internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, and family practice, the first postdoctoral year of medical education should be devoted to one of the four above- named specialties or to a program following the general requirements of a transitional year stipulated in the \"General Requirements\" section of the \"Essent ials of Accredited Residencies.\" (c) A program for the transitional year should be planned, designed, administered, conducted, and evaluated as an entity by the sponsoring institution rather than one or more departments. Responsibility for the executive di rection of the program should be assigned to one physician whose responsibility is the administration of the program. Educational programs for a transitional year should be subjected to thorough surveillance by the appropriate accrediting body as a means of assuring that the content, conduct, and internal evaluation of the educational program conform to national standards. The impact of the transitional year should not be deleterious to the educational programs of the specialty disciplines. (20) The ACGME, individual specialty boards, and respective residency review committees should improve communication with directors of residency programs because of their shared responsibility for programs in graduate medical education. (21) Specialty boards should be aware of and concerned with the impact that the requirements for certification and the content of the examination have upon the content and structure of graduate medical education. Requirements for certification should not be so specific that they inhibit program directors from exercising judgment and flexibility in the design and operation of their programs. (22) An essential goal of a specialty board should be to determine that the standards that it has set for certification continue to assure that successful candidates possess the knowledge, skills, and the commitment to upgrade continually the quality of medical care. Resolution: 324 (A-22) Page 10 of 11 (23) Specialty boards should endeavor to develop a consensus concerning the significance of certification by specialty and publicize it so that the purposes and limitations of certification can be clearly understood by the profession and the public. (24) The importance of certification by specialty boards requires that communication be improved between the specialty boards and the medical profession as a whole, particularly between the boards and their sponsoring, nominating, or constituent organizations and also between the boards and their diplomates. (25) Specialty boards should consider having members of the public participate in appropriate board activities. (26) Specialty boards should consider having physicians and other professionals from related disciplines participate in board activities. (27) The AMA recommends to state licensing authorities that they require individual applicants, to be eligible to be licensed to practice medicine, to possess the degree of Doctor of Medicine or its equivalent from a school or program that meets the standards of the LCME or accredited by the American Osteopathic Association, or to demonstrate as individuals, comparable academic and personal achievements. All applicants for full and unrestricted licensure should provide evidence of the satisfactory completion of at least one year of an accredited program of graduate medical education in the US. Satisfactory completion should be based upon an assessment of the applicant's knowledge, problem- solving ability, and clinical skills in the general field of medicine. The AMA recommends to legislatures and governmental regulatory authorities that they not impose re quirements for licensure that are so specific that they restrict the responsibility of medical educators to determine the content of undergraduate and graduate medical education. (28) The medical profession should continue to encourage participation in continuing medical education related to the physician's professional needs and activities. Efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of such education should be continued. (29) The medical profession and the public should recognize the difficulties related to an objective and valid assessment of clinical performance. Research efforts to improve existing methods of evaluation and to develop new methods having an acceptable degree of reliability and validity should be supported. (30) Methods currently being used to evaluate the readiness of graduates of foreign medical schools to enter accredited programs in graduate medical education in this country should be critically reviewed and modified as necessary. No graduate of any medical school should be admitted to or continued in a residency program if his or her participation can reasonably be expected to affect adversely the quality of patient care or to jeopardize the quality of the educational experiences of other residents or of students in educational programs w ithin the hospital. (31) The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates should be encouraged to study the feasibility of including in its procedures for certification of graduates of foreign medical schools a period of observation adequate for th e evaluation of clinical skills and the application of knowledge to clinical problems. (32) The AMA, in cooperation with others, supports continued efforts to review and define standards for medical education at all levels. The AMA supports continued parti cipation in the evaluation and accreditation of medical education at all levels. (33) The AMA, when appropriate, supports the use of selected consultants from the public and from the professions for consideration of special issues related to medical educat ion. (34) The AMA encourages entities that profile physicians to provide them with feedback on their performance and with access to education to assist them in meeting norms of practice; and supports the creation of experiences across the continuum of medi cal education designed to teach about the process of physician profiling and about the principles of utilization review/quality assurance. (35) Our AMA encourages the accrediting bodies for MD - and DO -granting medical schools to review, on an ongoing basis , their accreditation standards to assure that they protect the quality and integrity of medical education in the context of the emergence of new models of medical school organization and governance. (36) Our AMA will strongly advocate for the rights of medical students, residents, and fellows to have physician- led (MD or DO as defined by the AMA) clinical training, supervision, and evaluation while recognizing the contribution of non- physicians to medical education. (37) Our AMA will publicize to medical s tudents, residents, and fellows their rights, as per Liaison Committee on Medical Education and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education guidelines, to physician- led education and a means to report violations without fear of retaliation.

Our AMA supports the concept that accreditation standards for undergraduate and graduate medical education should adopt a common competency framework that is based in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competency domains. 2. Our AMA recommends that the relevant associations, including the AMA, Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and Ameri can Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), along with the relevant accreditation bodies for undergraduate medical education (Liaison Committee on Medical Education, Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation) and graduate medical education (ACGME, AOA) develop strategies to: a. Identify guidelines for the expected general levels of learners' competencies as they leave medical school and enter residency training. b. Create a standardized method for feedback from medical school to premedical institutions and from the residency training system to medical schools about their graduates' preparedness for entry. c. Identify areas where accreditation standards overlap between undergraduate and graduate medical education (e.g., standards rel ated to the clinical learning environment) so as to facilitate coordination of data gathering and decision- making related to compliance. All of these activities should be codified in the standards or processes of accrediting bodies. 3. Our AMA encourages development and implementation of accreditation standards or processes that support utilization of tools (e.g., longitudinal learner portfolios) to track learners' progress in achieving the defined competencies across the continuum. 4. Our AMA supports the concept that evaluation of physicians as they progress along the medical education continuum should include the following: (a) assessments of each of the six competency domains of patient care, medical knowledge, interpersonal and c ommunication skills, professionalism, practice- based learning and improvement, and systems -based practice; and (b) use of assessment instruments and tools that are valid and reliable and appropriate for each competency domain and stage of the medical education continuum. 5. Our AMA encourages study of competency -based progression within and between medical school and residency. a. Through its Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative, our AMA should study models of competency -based progression wi thin the medical school. b. Our AMA should work with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to study how the Milestones of the Next Accreditation System support competency -based progression in residency. 6. Our AMA encourages re search on innovative methods of assessment related to the six competency domains of the ACGME/American Board of Medical Specialties that would allow monitoring of performance across the stages of the educational continuum. 7. Our AMA encourages ongoing research to identify best practices for workplace- based assessment that allow performance data related to each of the six competency domains to be aggregated and to serve as feedback to physicians in training and in practice. CME Rep. 4, A -14 Appended: CME R ep. 10, A -15 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 325 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Single Licensing Exam Series for Osteopathic and Allopathic Medical Students Referred to: Reference Committee C Whereas, The Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX) USA is a 1 licensing exam series that is currently required by the Commission on Osteopathic College 2 Accreditation (COCA) to be taken by all osteopathic medical students in order to graduate from 3 a COCA -accredited medical school 1; and 4 5 Whereas, The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) is a licensing exam 6 series that is currently taken by all allopathic medical students and some osteopathic medical 7 students2; and 8 9 Whereas, In 1997, 363 osteopathic medical student first -time test takers completed USMLE 10 Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) and by 2020, that number had increased more than 11 23-fold, significantly outpacing the 3 -fold growth in osteopathic medical school enrollment, so 12 that in 2020 70% of the first -time test -taking osteopathic students who took COMLEX Level 1 13 also took USMLE Step 12,3,4; and 14 15 Whereas, The growing trend of osteopathic students choosing to take the USMLE series in 16 addition to the COMLEX USA series further exacerbates the osteopathic medical student debt 17 burden, adding an approximate total of $6,131,840 in additional examination fees for 18 osteopathic test takers during 2019- 20202,5; and 19 20 Whereas, An increasing number of osteopathic medical schools have mandated students to 21 complete the USMLE and COMLEX USA series prior to graduation, despite evidence that a 22 minimal number of licensing examinations already significantly increase rates of stress, anxiety, 23 and depression amongst medical students6; and 24 25 Whereas, Two high- stakes licensing examinations establishing the same competency create 26 redundancy, as evident by strong correlation between USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 and respective 27 COMLEX Level 1 and 2 scores for residency applicants7,8,9; and 28 29 Whereas, Although USMLE Step 1 and the COMLEX USA Level 1 will change to a pass/fail 30 scoring system by 2022, the USMLE Step 2 CK will remain a scored exam10; and 31 32 Whereas, In 2014, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), American Association of 33 Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), and the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical 34 Education (ACGME) agreed to transition to a single accreditation system to increase 35 collaboration among the medical education community, reduce costs and increase efficiency, 36 and provide consistency11; and 37 Resolution: 325 (A- 22) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, The AOA has recognized the importance of modernizing board certification exams, 1 and are offering a new pathway of board certification that does not include and/or require 2 Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT), emphasizing the similarities between the allopathic 3 and osteopathic professions12; and 4 5 Whereas, Although the AMA has adopted policy H -295.876, Equal Fees for Osteopathic and 6 Allopathic Medical Students, which is currently being enacted by the AMA Council of Medical 7 Education, there is evidence that ACGME programs have and continue to discriminate against 8 osteopathic medical students who did not to take the USMLE series when selecting candidates 9 for away rotations and residencies13,14; and 10 11 Whereas, Nearly 20% of ACGME program directors do not utilize the COMLEX USA series and 12 require t he USMLE series as part of the residency selection process, putting osteopathic 13 medical students who elect not take USMLE series at a significant disadvantage11,13; and 14 15 Whereas, Many ACGME program directors, and a majority of program directors in certain 16 specialties such as emergency medicine, consider it to be important for osteopathic students to 17 apply with USMLE series scores, and that in these specialties, osteopathic students who take 18 the USMLE series have a 20% better match rate13,15; and 19 20 Whereas, Despite previously -enacted advocacy efforts regarding AMA resolution H -275.013, 21 The Grading Policy for Medical Licensure Examination, calling for equal recognition of the 22 COMLEX USA and USMLE series as licensing exams, recent data shows that 54% of VSAS 23 participating institutions require USMLE Step 1 scores for away rotations13; and 24 25 Whereas, The National Student Osteopathic Medical Association (SOMA) adopted resolution S - 26 20-30, Single Licensing Exam , encouraging the National Board of Osteopathic Medical 27 Examiners (NBOME), National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), and Federation of State 28 Medical Boards (FSMB) to develop a single licensing examination series for all medical students 29 with an additional osteopathic specific subject test for osteopat hic medical students16,17; and 30 31 Whereas, Although the Coalition for Physician Accountability's Undergraduate Medical 32 Education- Graduate Medical Education Review Committee offered the solutions of standardized 33 score conversion between USMLE and the COMLEX -USA series, historically program directors 34 have required USMLE scores despite the long standing availability of COMLEX percentile 35 converters by the NBOME18,19; and 36 37 Whereas, SOMA has advocated to the COCA to adjust their continuing accreditation standards 38 such that Element 6.12 no longer requires the COMLEX USA series to be passed prior to 39 graduation from an Osteopathic medical school, rather Osteopathic medical students must pass 40 a new single licensing exam developed by the NBOME, FSMB, and NBME20; therefore be it, 41 42 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association encourage the development of a single 43 licensing examination series for all medical students attending a medical school accredited by 44 the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) or the Commission on Osteopathic 45 College Accreditation (COCA), with a separate, additional osteopathic -specific subject test for 46 osteopathic medical students.

Modified: Speakers Rep. 01, A -17; Appended: CME Rep. 3, A -21 Alternatives to the Federation of State Medical Boards Recommendations on Licensure H -275.934 Our AMA adopts the following principles:(1) Ideally, all medic al students should successfully complete Steps 1 and 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) or Levels 1 and 2 of the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX USA) prior to entry into residency training. At a minimum, individuals entering residency training must have successfully completed Step 1 of the USMLE or Level 1 of COMLEX USA. There should be provision made for students who have not completed Step 2 of the USMLE or Level 2 of the COMLEX USA to do so during the first year of residency training. (2) All applicants for full and unrestricted licensure, whether graduates of U.S. medical schools or international medical graduates, must have completed one year of accredited graduate medical education (GME) in the U.S., have passed all licensing examinations (USMLE or COMLEX USA), and must be certified by their residency program director as ready to advance to the next year of GME and to obtain a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine. The candidate for licensure should have had education that provided exposure to general medical content. (3) There should be a training permit/educational license for all resident physicians who do not yet have a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine. To be eligible for an initial training permit/educational license, the resident must have completed Step 1 of the USMLE or Level 1 of COMLEX USA. (4) Residency program directors shall report only those actions to state medical licensing boards that are reported for all licensed physicians. (5) Residency program directors should receive training to ensure that they understand the process for taking disciplinary action against resident physicians, and are aware of procedures for dismissal of residents and for due proc ess. This requirement for residency program directors should be enforced through Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accreditation requirements. (6) There should be no reporting of actions against medical students to state medical licensin g boards. (7) Medical schools are responsible for identifying and remediating and/or disciplining medical student unprofessional behavior, problems with substance abuse, and other behavioral problems. as well as gaps in student knowledge and skills. (8) Th e Dean's Letter of Evaluation should be strengthened and standardized, to serve as a better source of information to residency programs about applicants.

Res. 306, I -20 The Grading Policy for Medical Licensure Examinations H -275.953 1. Our AMA's representatives to the ACGME are instructed to promote the principle that selection of residents should be based on a broad variety of evaluative criteria, and to propose that the ACGME General Require ments state clearly that residency program directors must not use NBME or USMLE ranked passing scores as a screening criterion for residency selection. 2. Our AMA adopts the following policy on NBME or USMLE examination scoring: (a) Students receive \"pass/ fail\" scores as soon as they are available. (If students fail the examinations, they may request their numerical scores immediately.) (b) Numerical scores are reported to the state licensing authorities upon request by the applicant for licensure. At this time, the applicant may request a copy of his or her numerical scores. (c) Scores are reported in pass/fail format for each student to the medical school. The school also receives a frequency distribution of numerical scores for the aggregate of their students. Resolution: 325 (A-22) Page 6 of 6 3. Our AMA will co -convene the appropriate stakeholders to study possible mechanisms for transitioning scoring of the USMLE and COMLEX exams to a Pass/Fail system in order to avoid the inappropriate use of USMLE and COMLEX scores for screening residency applicants while still affording program directors adequate information to meaningfully and efficiently assess medical student applications, and that the recommendations of this study be made available by the 2019 Interim Meeting of the AMA House of De legates. 4. Our AMA will: (a) promote equal acceptance of the USMLE and COMLEX at all United States residency programs; (b) work with appropriate stakeholders including but not limited to the National Board of Medical Examiners, Association of American Med ical Colleges, National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and American Osteopathic Association to educate Residency Program Directors on how to interpret and use COMLEX scores; and (c) work with Residency Program Directors to promote higher COMLEX utilization with residency program matches in light of the new single accreditation system. 5. Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders to release guidance for residency and fellowship program direc tors on equitably comparing students who received 3-digit United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 or Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination of the United States Level 1 scores and students who received Pass/Fail scores.

and 2 3 Whereas, In one meta -analysis, the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among 4 medical students was 27%, with only 16% of those who screened positive seeking psychiatric 5 treatment; residents report depression at rates of 21- 43%, with rates increasing over t ime3,5; and 6 7 Whereas, Matriculating medical students have lower rates of depression and burnout compared 8 to the general population, a trend that quickly reverses when they begin medical school; 9 similarly, the first year of residency is associated with a 16% increase in depressive symptoms, 10 highlighting a need for additional support during that transition5-7; and 11 12 Whereas, Rates of burnout - a contributor to depression, relationship problems, and substance 13 use - are higher in all medical trainees compared to the general population8,9; and 14 15 Whereas, Suicide rates in medical trainees are difficult to estimate due to lack of high- quality 16 data, particularly in the medical student population7,8,10; and 17 18 Whereas, A study on causes of death in residents revealed suicide to be the second leading 19 cause (second only to cancer), and the leading cause of death for male residents11; and 20 21 Whereas, There is limited data on depression, anxiety, and suicide in post -graduate physicians, 22 much of which comes from older data and s mall- scale studies, although a 2020 meta- analysis 23 subsequently found that suicide remains a leading cause of mortality for physicians when 24 compared to other causes (i.e., cardiovascular disease, cancer), despite a general decrease in 25 physician suicide rates since 1980; more recently, the Medscape Physician Burnout and Suicide 26 Report has become a powerful tool to track mental health trends anonymously within our 27 profession in real time12-15; and 28 29 Whereas, Overall, there are limited robust studies about medical student, resident, and 30 physician suicide, as noted in a 2015 JAMA Psychiatry viewpoint calling for a national response 31 regarding studies of depression and suicide in medical trainees16; and 32 33 Whereas, Increasing professional demands and worsening burnout related to the COVID- 19 34 pandemic highlight the importance of collecting accurate, real -time data on our profession's 35 mental health to inform efforts on mitigating risks and preventing suicide17; and 36 37 Whereas, For allopathic medical school accreditation, the LCME requires that institutions 38 \"include programs that promote student wellbeing;\" for osteopathic medical school accreditation, 39 COCA requires that the institution \"must develop and implement policies and procedures as well 40 Resolution: 326 (A- 22) Page 2 of 4 as provide the human and physical resources required to support and promote health and 1 wellness;\" for residency, ACGME requires \"Institution, must ensure healthy and safe learning 2 and working environments that promote resident well -being\"18-20; and 3 4 Whereas, Wellness initiatives in medical schools and residency programs can vary widely in 5 format \u2014usually with preventative, reactive, and cultural programming, and rarely with structural 6 programming\u2014and effectiveness, and often face barriers such as insufficient financial or 7 administrative support21-23; and 8 9 Whereas, A public database of wellness initiatives of each medical school and residency would 10 allow programs to display their own initiatives as well as gather ideas and contact information to 11 more rapidly and effectively implement new ones; therefore be it 12 13 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend D-345.983, \" Study of Medical 14 Student, Resident, and Physician Suicide,\" by addition to read as follows: 15 16 D-345.983 - STUDY OF MEDICAL STUDENT, RESIDENT, AND PHYSI CIAN SUICIDE 17 Our AMA will: (1) explore the viability and cost -effectiveness of regularly collecting 18 National Death Index (NDI) data and confidentially maintaining manner of death 19 information for physicians, residents, and medical students listed as deceased in the 20 AMA Physician Masterfile for long -term studies; (2) monitor progress by the Association 21 of American Medical Colleges, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic 22 Medicine, and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to 23 collect data on medical student and resident/fellow suicides to identify patterns that 24 could predict such events; (3) support the education of faculty members, residents and 25 medical students in the recognition of the signs and symptoms of burnout and 26 depression and supports access to free, confidential, and immediately available stigma- 27 free mental health and substance use disorder services;

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Study of Medical Student, Resident, and Physician Suicide D -345.983 Our AMA will: (1) explore the viability and cost -ef fectiveness of regularly collecting National Death Index (NDI) data and confidentially maintaining manner of death information for physicians, residents, and medical students listed as deceased in the AMA Physician Masterfile for long- term studies; (2) monitor progress by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to collect data on medical student and resident/fellow suicides to identify patterns that could predict such events; (3) support the education of faculty members, residents and medical students in the recognition of the signs and symptoms of burnout and depression and supports access to free, confidential, and immediately available stigma- free mental health and substance use disorder s ervices; and (4) collaborate with other stakeholders to study the incidence of and risk factors for depression, substance misuse and addiction, and suicide among physicians, residents, and medical students. CME Rep. 06, A -19 Access to Confidential Health Services for Medical Students and Physicians H -295.858 1. Our AMA will ask the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, American Osteopathic Association, and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to encourage medical schools and residency/fellowship programs, respectively, to: A. Provide or facilitate the immediate availability of urgent and emergent access to low -cost, confidential health care, including mental health and substance use disorder counseling services, that: (1) include appropriate follow -up; (2) are outside the trainees' grading and evaluation pathways; and (3) are available (based on patient preference and need for assurance of confidentiality) in reasonable proximity to the education/training site, at an external site, or through telemedicine or other virtual, online means; B. Ensure that residency/fellowship programs are abiding by all duty hour restrictions, as these regulations exist in part to ensure the mental and physical health of trainees; C. Encourage and promote routine health screening among medical students and resident/fellow physicians, and consider designating some segment of already -allocated personal time off (if necessary, during scheduled work hours) specifically for routine health screening and preventive services, including physical, mental, and dental care; and Resolution: 326 (A- 22) Page 4 of 4 D. Remind trainees and practicing physicians to avail themselves of any needed resources, both within and external to their institution, to provide for their mental and physical health and well -being, as a component of their professional obligation to ensure their own fitness for duty and the need to prioritize patient safety and quality of care by ensuring appropriate self -care, not working when sick, and following generally accepted guidelines for a healthy lifestyle. 2. Our AMA will urge state medical boards to refrain from asking applicants about past history of mental health or substance use disorder diagnosis or treatment, and only focus on current impairment by mental illness or addiction, and to accept \"safe haven\" non- reporting for physicians seeking licensure or relicensure who are undergoing treatment for mental health or addiction issues, to help ensure confidentiality of such treatment for the individual physician while providing assurance of patient safety. 3. Our AMA encourages medical schools to create mental health and substance abuse awareness and suicide prevention screening programs that would: A. be available to all medical students on an opt -out basis; B. ensure anonymity, confidentiality, and protection from administrative action; C. provide proactive intervention for identified at -risk students by mental health and addiction professionals; and D. inform students and faculty about personal mental health, substance use and addiction, and other risk factors that may contribute to suicidal ideation. 4. Our AMA: (a) encourages state medical boards to consider physical and mental conditions similarly; (b) encourages state medical boards to recognize that the presence of a mental health condition does not necessarily equate with an impaired ability to practice medicine; and (c) encourages state medical societies to advocate that state medical boards not sanction physicians based solely on the presence of a psychiatric disease, irrespective of treatment or behavior. 5. Our AMA: (a) encourages study of medical student mental health, including but not limited to rates and risk factors of depression and suicide; (b) encourages medical schools to confidentially gather and release information regarding reporting rates of depression/suicide on an opt -out basis from its students; and (c) will work with other interested parties to encourage research into identifying and addressing modifiable risk factor s for burnout, depression and suicide across the continuum of medical education. 6. Our AMA encourages the development of alternative methods for dealing with the problems of student - physician mental health among medical schools, such as: (a) introduction to the concepts of physician impairment at orientation; (b) ongoing support groups, consisting of students and house staff in various stages of their education; (c) journal clubs; (d) fraternities; (e) support of the concepts of physical and mental well - being by heads of departments, as well as other faculty members; and/or (f) the opportunity for interested students and house staff to work with students who are having difficulty. Our AMA supports making these alternatives available to students at the earliest possible point in their medical education. 7. Our AMA will engage with the appropriate organizations to facilitate the development of educational resources and training related to suicide risk of patients, medical students, residents/fellows, practicing physicians, and other health care professionals, using an evidence- based multidisciplinary approach.

To preserve the quality of their performance, physicians have a responsibility to maintain their healt h and wellness, broadly construed as preventing or treating acute or chronic diseases, including mental illness, disabilities, and occupational stress. To fulfill this responsibility individually, physicians should: (a) Maintain their own health and wellness by: (i) following healthy lifestyle habits; (ii) ensuring that they have a personal physician whose objectivity is not compromised. (b) Take appropriate action when their health or wellness is compromised, including: (i) engaging in honest assessment of their ability to continue practicing safely; (ii) taking measures to mitigate the problem; (iii) taking appropriate measures to protect patients, including measures to minimize the risk of transmitting infectious disease commensurate with the seriousness of the disease; (iv) seeking appropriate help as needed, including help in addressing substance abuse. Physicians should not practice if their ability to do so safely is impaired by use of a controlled substance, alcohol, other chemical agent or a health c ondition. Collectively, physicians have an obligation to ensure that colleagues are able to provide safe and effective care, which includes promoting health and wellness among physicians. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I,II,IV AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 327 (A-22) Introduced by: New Jersey Subject: Leadership Training Must Become an Integral Part of Medical Education Referred to: Reference Committee C \"No one other than physicians can do what physicians do.

In 1889 at Johns Hopkins Hospital, 2 William Osler, MD, established America's first formal residency program with interns and 3 residents residing in the hospital. Fellows stayed for additional years of training, and these roles 4 and references remain relevant; and 5 6 Whereas, Physicians pursuing specialty board certification are required to complete 7 standardized and accredited training referred to as residency, with the possibility for further sub - 8 specialized training referred to as fellowship; and 9 10 Whereas, Some postgraduate training programs for nonphysician clinicians, including 11 podiatrists, pharmacists, advanced practice registered nurses, and psychologists have started 12 using the same nomenclature, labeling their programs as residencies and fellowships; and 13 14 Whereas, The curricula for postgraduate medical training programs are well -defined and 15 standardized through a national accreditation process and informed by board- certification 16 requirements. The postgraduate training pathways for other health professionals do not require 17 the same rigor as medicine. They often are not standardized, and the content is vastly more 18 limited than medicine in depth, scope, and duration. The broad application of these terms to a 19 diversity of programs without the same complexity of training creates the potential for 20 misconceptions among the general public; and 21 22 Whereas, Using these terms to blur the lines between the training of physicians and other health 23 professions do not accurately reflect the distinctions between the training models and can 24 demean the definition of the field of medicine. These misconceptions also are used to support 25 scope- of-practice expansions in health professions outside medicine; and 26 27 Whereas, A survey of the public revealed confusion about which cl inicians have medical 28 degrees or degrees of osteopathic medicine, and favored transparency of training; and 29 30 Whereas, The American Academy of Dermatology has stated that labeling nonphysician training 31 programs as residencies or fellowships is misleading and this terminology should apply only to 32 physician training programs; and 33 34 Whereas, In the patient care setting, the role of individual health care practitioners should be 35 clearly identified to patients and other health care practitioners. Name tags that identify 36 residents or fellows as physicians distinguishes them from other health care practitioners and 37 clarifies their role on the health care team; and 38 Resolution: 329 (A- 22) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, The American Academy of Emergency Medicine has stated that training programs for 1 physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses should avoid use of the terms 2 resident and fellow; and 3 4 Whereas, A national discussion by the American Medical Association is needed to prevent the 5 continued distortion of these terms by nonphysician groups; therefore be it 6 7 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association hold a national discussion about the 8 historical value and current nature of the terms \"residency\" and \"fellowship\" to describe 9 physician postgraduate training and address the ramifications of nonphysician clinician groups 10 using similar nomenclature that can confuse the general public.

(2) The physician is responsible for managing the health care of patients in all practice settings. (3) Health care services delivered in an integrated practice must be within the scope of each practitioner's professional license, as defined by state law. (4) In an integrated practice with a nurse practitioner, the physician is responsible for supervising and coordinating care and, with the appropriate input of the nurse practitioner, ensuring the quality of health care provided to patients. (5) The extent of involvement by the nurse practitioner in initial assessment, and implementation of treatment will depend on the complexity and acuity of the patients' condition, as determined by the supervising/collaborating physician. (6) The role of the nurse practitioner in the delivery of care in an integrated practice should be defined through mutually agreed upon written practice protocols, job descriptions, and written contracts. Resolution: 329 (A-22) Page 3 of 3 (7) These practice protocols should delineate the appropriate involvement of the two professionals in the care of patients, based on the complexity and acuity of the patients' condition. (8) At least one physician in the integrated practice must be immediately available at all times for supervision and consultation when needed by the nurse practitioner. (9) Patient s are to be made clearly aware at all times whether they are being cared for by a physician or a nurse practitioner. (10) In an integrated practice, there should be a professional and courteous relationship between physician and nurse practitioner, with mutual acknowledgment of, and respect for each other's contributions to patient care. (11) Physicians and nurse practitioners should review and document, on a regular basis, the care of all patients with whom the nurse practitioner is involved. Physicians and nurse practitioners must work closely enough together to become fully conversant with each other's practice patterns.

and 5 6 Whereas, The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change has warned that the \"rapidly 7 changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life, exposing vulnerable 8 populations to extremes of weather, altering patterns of infectious disease, and compromising 9 food security, safe drinking water, and clean air\" earning it the title of the \"greatest public health 10 challenge of the 21st century\"2-4; and 11 12 Whereas, The U.S. health sector is responsible for an estimated 8.5% of national carbon 13 emissions - stemming directly from the operations of healthcare facilities (scope 1) and indirectly 14 from both purchased sources of energy, heating, and cooling (scope 2) and the supply chain of 15 healthcare services and goods (scope 3)5, and 16 17 Whereas, Our AMA is a member of the Steering Committee of the A ction Collaborative on 18 Decarbonizing the Health Sector, which is part of the National Academy of Medicine Grand 19 Challenge on Climate Change, Human Health, & Equity; whose four strategic objectives are to: 20 (1) communicate the climate crisis as a public health and equity crisis, (2) develop a roadmap 21 for systems transformation, (3) catalyze the health sector to reduce its climate footprint and 22 ensure its resilience, and (4) accelerate research and innovation at the intersection of climate, 23 health and equity6; and 24 25 Whereas, In August 2021, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services announced the 26 creation of the new Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), tasked with taking on 27 the health impacts of climate change and its effects such as extreme weather; and 28 29 Whereas, Our AMA does not currently have a strategic plan to respond to the climate health 30 crisis and most physician practices are not prepared to decarbonize our practices in alignment 31 with emerging national goals and regulations; and 32 33 Whereas, The longer -term health benefits of addressing climate change have been well 34 documented: preventing roughly 4.5 million deaths, 3.5 million hospitalizations and emergency 35 room visits and approximately 300 million lost workdays in the U.S. over the next 50 years, and 36 a rapid shift to a 2\u00baC pathway could reduce the toll of air pollution, which leads to nearly 37 250,000 premature deaths per year in the US, by 40% in just a decade 7,8,9; and 38 Resolution: 420 (A- 22) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, The World Health Organization estimates that direct damage to health (not including 1 costs of damage mediated by effects on agriculture, water, and sanitation) will reach $2- 4billion 2 per year by 203010, and 3 4 Whereas, Across all climate- related risks, children, older adults, low -income communities, 5 outdoor workers, minoritized communities, and communities burdened by poor environmental 6 quality are disproportionately affected 11-14; and 7 8 Whereas, 'Climate justice' is a term used for framing global warming as an ethical and political 9 issue, rather than one that is purely environmental or physical in nature by relating the effects of 10 climate change to concepts of justice, particularly environmental justice and social justice and 11 by examining issues such as equality, human rights; collective rights, and the historical 12 respons ibilities for climate change15, and 13 14 Whereas, To avoid the worst consequences of climate change by keeping global warming from 15 pre-industrial levels to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), as outlined by the 16 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will require global greenhouse gas (GHG) 17 emissions to have peaked by 2020 and net zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest, 18 highlighting that we are in a \"vanishing window of opportunity for meaningful action\"16,17,18; and 19 20 Whereas, Physicians are uniquely trusted messengers with a responsibility to advocate for 21 science- based policies to safeguard health in the face of any public health crisis19; and 22 23 Whereas, Our AMA House of Delegates has adopted multiple policies addressing clim ate 24 change -135.973), but 25 these policies fall short of actively coordinating strategic physician advocacy and leadership on 26 the scale necessary for such a health crisis; and 27 28 Whereas, In the face of the existential threat that the climate crisis poses, these policies have 29 not been leveraged to fulfill our AMA's Declaration of Professional Responsibility which commit 30 our profession to \"[earning] society's trust in the healing profession\" by \"[educating] the public 31 and polity about present and future threats to the health of humanity\" and \"[advocating] for 32 social, economic, educational, and political changes that ameliorate suffering and contribute to 33 human well -being\" ( H-140.900) ; therefore, be it 34 35 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association declare climate change a public health 36 crisis that threatens the health and well- being of all individuals (Directive to Take Action); and be 37 it further 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA protect patients by advocating for policies that: (1) limit global 40 warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, (2) reduce US greenhouse gas emissions, and 41 (3) achi eve a reduced -emissions economy (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 42 43 RESOLVED, That our AMA develop a strategic plan for how we will enact our climate change 44 policies including advocacy priorities and strategies to decarbonize physician practices and the 45 health sector with report back to the House of Delegates at the 2023 Annual Meeting.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY H-135.919 Climate Change Education Across the Medical Education Continuum Our AMA: (1) supports teaching on climate change in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education such that trainees and practicing physicians acquire a basic knowledge of the science of climate change, can describe the risks that climate change poses to human health, and counsel patients on how to protect themselves from the health risks posed by climate change; (2) will make available a prototype presentation and lecture notes on the intersection of climate change and health for use in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education; and (3) will communicate this policy to the appropriate accrediting organizations such as the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. [Res. 302, A-1 9] H-135.938 Global Climate Change and Human Health Our AMA: 1. Supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth assessme nt report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant. These climate changes will create conditions that affect public health, with disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and the poor. 2. Supports educating the medical community on the potential adverse public health effects of global climate change and incorporating the health implications of climate ch ange into the spectrum of medical education, including topics such as population displacement, heat waves and drought, flooding, infectious and vector -borne diseases, and potable water supplies.3. (a) Recognizes the importance of Resolution: 420 (A- 22) Page 4 of 5 physician involvement in policymaking at the state, national, and global level and supports efforts to search for novel, comprehensive, and economically sensitive approaches to mitigating climate change to protect the health of the public; and (b) recognizes that whatever the etiol ogy of global climate change, policymakers should work to reduce human contributions to such changes. 4. Encourages physicians to assist in educating patients and the public on environmentally sustainable practices, and to serve as role models for promoting environmental sustainability. 5. Encourages physicians to work with local and state health departments to strengthen the public health infrastructure to ensure that the global health effects of climate change can be anticipated and responded to more eff iciently, and that the AMA's Center for Public Health Preparedness and Disaster Response assist in this effort. 6. Supports epidemiological, translational, clinical and basic science research necessary for evidence- based global climate change policy decisions related to health care and treatment.

Citation: (Res. 512, A -04; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -14) AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 422 (A-22) Introduced by: Minority Affairs Section, National Medical Association Subject: Voting as a Social Determinant of Health Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, Social determinants of health are the non- medical unavoidable patient life conditions 1 that directly influence healthcare risks and account for 30% -55% of healthcare outcomes1-3; and 2 3 Whereas, Citizens from historically excluded backgrounds are more affected by barriers to 4 voting than White citizens: in states that have strict voting ID laws, Latino turnout drops by 9.3%, 5 Black turnout by 8.6%, and Asian turnout by 12.5% after implementation of these laws 6 compared to previous voter turnout statistics4; and 7 8 Whereas, Experiencing barriers to participating in the electoral process is correlated with an 9 increased likelihood of being uninsured. In a national study on disparities in voter access, it was 10 demonstrated that an increase in barriers to voting access is associated with a 25% overall 11 greater probability of being uninsured5-9; and 12 13 Whereas, Individuals who experience voter suppression have disproportionately worse health 14 outcomes, and these disparities largely affect people of color. Given that Healthy People 2020 15 identified civic participation as a social determinant of health6,10- 13; and 16 17 Whereas, Inequitable distribution of res ources and disproportionate negative health outcomes 18 are closely associated, such that socioeconomic variables in a community can predict low voter 19 turnout, including but not limited to demographics, household income, age, and residential 20 mobility6,11; and 21 22 Whereas, Overt and covert methods have been used for voter suppression, especially against 23 historically marginalized populations. The National Conference of State Legislatures found that 24 almost 70% of states require some form of state identification in order to vote which has been 25 shown to be a barrier among African Americans, the poor, and youth. Non- White voter turnout is 26 less restricted in states with strict voter ID laws, demonstrated by the decrease in voter turnout 27 for primary elections specifically in non- White populations following their implementation4,14; and 28 29 Whereas, In the 2016 elections the majority of voters were non- Hispanic, White females aged 30 45-65, with a family income of $100,000 or more15; and 31 32 Whereas, In the election of 2020, White voter turnout was 70.9%, significantly more than the 33 58.4% of non- White voters who made it to the polls; demonstrating that barriers to voting in a 34 global pandemic still disproportionately affect non -White voters more16; and 35 36 Whereas, Communities that have been historically and are currently excluded on the basis of 37 race and socioeconomic status experience significantly more barriers to voter participation, 38 which perpetuated for generations and correlate with rates of health insurance coverage among 39 these groups. National data from multivariate analyses on voter participation and social 40 Resolution: 422 (A-22) Page 2 of 5 determinants of health demonstrate that a lack of medical insurance is significantly correlated 1 with decreased likelihood of voting. In a study on two major US cities demonstrating this trend, it 2 was found that individuals with any insurance had an overall voter participation of 24%, 3 compared to 3% in those that were uninsured17; and 4 5 Whereas, in 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was implemented to increase 6 the number of Americans with health insurance and substantially decrease healthcare 7 associated costs. In 2012, the supreme court declared that the expansion of Medicaid, one of 8 the goals of the Affordable Care Act, would be optional for individual states despite the provision 9 of funding for this expansion18; and 10 11 Whereas, Today there are 12 remaining states that have chosen not to expand Medicaid 12 despite overwhelming support for Medicaid expansion and the federal funding available to do 13 so. Many of these states have utilized gerrymandering as a means to modify the evidence of 14 public opinion and manipulate the voice of the people19; and 15 16 Whereas, Those without health insurance are more likely to support government healthcare 17 programs, yet in the 2016 presidential election, voter turnout for uninsured Americans was 18 34%20; and 19 20 Whereas, almost 40% of the voting- eligible American population did not vote in 2015, with 21 significant gaps in voter turnout existing along racial, educational, and income -level lines, largely 22 attributable to voting restrictions and feelings of alienation from the government7; and 23 24 Whereas, The relationship between health and voter participation perpetuate inequities in 25 health, social, and economic policy, further wo rsening health disparities. Historical examples of 26 initiatives that increase civic participation and improve health include the women's suffrage 27 movement which led to an increase in funding for women's health programming and a decrease 28 in child mortality b y eight to 15% . Another example exists in the removal of literacy tests in 29 1965, which expanded the number of Black voters, increasing government funding to areas with 30 larger Black populations and shifting voting patterns within these communities4,7,8,14, 16, 21 -24; and 31 32 Whereas, Voting between the ages of 18 -24 is associated with fewer risky health behaviors by 33 instilling a sense of self -efficacy and increasing social connectedness. Voting is also correlated 34 with fewer depressive symptoms in adulthood8,9; and 35 36 Whereas, Individuals who vote as a form of civic participation self -report a better state of health 37 than those who do not vote as well as those who abstain from voting report a poorer state of 38 health19,23; and 39 40 Whereas, Options for interventions that allow voter registration in clinical settings exist and have 41 been successful in registering patients to vote. In a community clinic model, 89% of those who 42 were eligible to vote were registered with clinic -based voter registration11-13, 21; and 43 44 Whereas, B etween 2006 and 2018, physicians voted approximately 14% less than the general 45 population26; and 46 47 Whereas, Additional research must examine the multidimensional impact of promotion of voter 48 registration and civic participation on the longitudinal health ou tcomes of patients; therefore be it 49 Resolution: 422 (A- 22) Page 3 of 5 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association acknowledge voting is a social 1 determinant of health and significantly contributes to the analyses of other social determinants 2 of health as a key metric (New HOD Policy); and be it further 3 4 RESOLVED, That our AMA recognize gerrymandering as a partisan effort that functions in part 5 to limit access to health care, including but not limited to the expansion of comprehensive 6 medical insurance coverage, and negatively impacts health outcomes (New HOD Policy); and 7 be it further 8 9 RESOLVED, That our AMA collaborate with appropriate stakeholders and provide resources to 10 firmly establish a relationship between voter participation and health outcomes.

Citation: Res. 001, A -18 Racism as a Public Health Threat H -65.952 1. Our AMA acknowledges that, although the primary drivers of racial health inequity are systemic and structural racism, racism and unconscious bias within medical research and health care delivery have caused and continue to cause harm to marginalized communities and society as a whole. 2. Our AMA recognizes racism, in its systemic, cultural, interpersonal, and other forms, as a serious threat to public health, to the advancement of health equity, and a barrier to appropriate medical care. 3. Our AMA will identify a set of current, best practices for healthcare institutions, physician practices, and academic medical centers to recognize, address, and mitigate the effects of racism on patients, providers, international medical graduates, and populations. Resolution: 422 (A-22) Page 5 of 5 4. Our AMA encourages the development, implementation, and evaluation of undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education programs and curricula that engender greater understanding of: (a) the causes, influences, and eff ects of systemic, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal racism; and (b) how to prevent and ameliorate the health effects of racism. 5. Our AMA: (a) supports the development of policy to combat racism and its effects; and (b) encourages governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations to increase funding for research into the epidemiology of risks and damages related to racism and how to prevent or repair them. 6. Our AMA will work to prevent and combat the influences of racism and bias in innovative health technologies. Citation: Res. 5, I- 20 Health Plan Initiatives Addressing Social Determinants of Health H -165.822 Our AMA: 1. recognizing that social determinants of health encompass more than health care, encourages new and continued partnerships among all levels of government, the private sector, philanthropic organizations, and community - and faith- based organizations to address non - medical, yet critical health needs and the underlying social determinants of health; 2. supports continued eff orts by public and private health plans to address social determinants of health in health insurance benefit designs; 3. encourages public and private health plans to examine implicit bias and the role of racism and social determinants of health, including through such mechanisms as professional development and other training; 4. supports mechanisms, including the establishment of incentives, to improve the acquisition of data related to social determinants of health, while minimizing burdens on patients and physicians; 5. supports research to determine how best to integrate and finance non -medical services as part of health insurance benefit design, and the impact of covering non -medical benefits on health care and societal costs; and 6. encourages cover age pilots to test the impacts of addressing certain non- medical, yet critical health needs, for which sufficient data and evidence are not available, on health outcomes and health care costs. Citation: CMS Rep. 7, I -20; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 5, I -21 Expanding Access to Screening Tools for Social Determinants of Health/Social Determinants of Health in Payment Models H -160.896 Our AMA supports payment reform policy proposals that incentivize screening for social determinants of health and referral to communi ty support systems. Citation: BOT Rep. 39, A -18; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 10, A -19 Health, In All Its Dimensions, Is a Basic Right H -65.960 Our AMA acknowledges: (1) that enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, in all its dimensions, including health care is a basic human right; and (2) that the provision of health care services as well as optimizing the social determinants of health is an ethical obligation of a civil society.

Ecological changes will result in increased temperature extremes, natural 16 disasters, wildfires, vector -borne disease, sea level rise, food insecurity, and more; and 17 18 Whereas, Environmental justice is closely tied to social determinants of healt h; thus, interventions 19 to improve public environmental health must be rooted in participatory and distributive justice, 20 prioritizing those currently facing the greatest disadvantage; and 21 22 Whereas, Healthcare costs can be directly tied to the health of our environment, as climate 23 change and environmental pollutants lead to increased hospitalizations and emergency room 24 visits, which are especially expensive and resource- consuming; and 25 26 Whereas, Research suggests that asthma hospitalizations can be decreased w ith intervention. In 27 2009, there was a sharp decline in asthma hospitalization rates (57%) in two Baltimore zip codes 28 where there was a large reduction in pollution from nearby coal -fired power plants; and 29 30 Whereas, Physicians have a special obligation to participate in climate health advocacy and 31 policy intervention based on an ethical framework of seven criteria: expertise, proximity, 32 effectiveness, low risk or cost, unique role, severity of outcome, and public trust. Physicians have 33 expertise in treating illnesses related to environmental determinants and climate change and are 34 often first responders with proximity to those who require care. Their advocacy poses low risk to 35 themselves, and they can be effective advocates as they have unique medical expert ise. By 36 speaking on the severity of the health consequences of climate change, physicians can uphold 37 public trust; and 38 Resolution: 424 (A- 22) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, The current AMA policy H -135.938 1) supports the findings of the Intergovernmental 1 Panel on Climate Change's fourth assessment report, 2) supports educating the medical 2 community on the health implications of climate change, 3) recognizes the importance of 3 physician involvement in climate policymaking, 4) encourages physicians to assist in educating 4 patients on environmental sustainability, and 5) supports research necessary for evidence- based 5 climate change policy decisions; and 6 7 Whereas, The current AMA policy H -135.938 lacks explicit statement of the importance of 8 physician assessment of environmental determinants of health faced by their patients; and, 9 Whereas, physician assessment of environmental determinants will improve patient outcomes 10 and prevent future development and exacerbation of disease, especially for patients from low - 11 income communities or communities of color; and 12 13 Whereas, Previous studies have shown great physician interest in environmental health, but a 14 lack of confidence in their ability to take an environmental history. Currently, there is no 15 systematic documentation of environmental risk factors in the medical record and environmental 16 factors are often not specifically investigated and highlighted as a cause of disease; and 17 18 Whereas, A survey study of 500 primary care physicians showed that only 27.8% correctly 19 recognized all health effects related to environmental exposures, and those who recognized the 20 importance of the environment were significantly more likely to have knowledge of environmental 21 risk factors related to respiratory disease. Less than one third of physicians provided educational 22 material a bout environmental and public health to their patients, and those who asked their 23 patients about environmental exposures were significantly more likely to believe that 24 environmental health history is a useful tool to prevent environmental health exposures; therefore 25 be it 26 27 RESOLVED, T hat our American Medical Association amend policy H -135.938, \"Global Climate 28 Change and Human Health,\" by addition to read as follows: 29 30 Our AMA: 31 1. Supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourt h 32 assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is 33 undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions 34 are significant. These climate changes will create conditions that affect public 35 health, with disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, including children, 36 the elderly, and the poor. 37 2. Supports educating the medical community on the potential adverse public health 38 effects of global climate change and incorporating the health implications of climate 39 change into the spectrum of medical education, including topics such as population 40 displacement, heat waves and drought, flooding, infectious and vector -borne 41 diseases, and potable water supplies. 42 3. (a) Recognizes the importance of physician involvement in policymaking at the 43 state, national, and global level and supports efforts to search for novel, 44 comprehensive, and economically sensitive approaches to mitigating climate 45 change to protect the health of the public; and (b) recognizes that whateve r the 46 etiology of global climate change, policymakers should work to reduce human 47 contributions to such changes. 48 4. Encourages physicians to assist in educating patients and the public on 49 environmentally sustainable practices, and to serve as role models f or promoting 50 environmental sustainability. 51 Resolution: 424 (A- 22) Page 3 of 4 5. Encourages physicians to work with local and state health departments to 1 strengthen the public health infrastructure to ensure that the global health effects of 2 climate change can be anticipated and responded to more efficiently, and that the 3 AMA's Center for Public Health Preparedness and Disaster Response assist in this 4 effort. 5 6. Supports epidemiological, translational, clinical and basic science research 6 necessary for evidence -based global climate change pol icy decisions related to 7 health care and treatment . 8 7. Encourages physicians to assess for environmental determinants of health in 9 patient history -taking and encourages the incorporation of assessment for 10 environmental determinants of health in patient history -taking into physician 11 training.

(Directive to Take Action) 34 Fiscal Note: Moderate - between $5,000 - $10,000 Received: 05/11 /22 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DELEGATES Resolution: 426 (A-22) Introduced by: Michigan Subject: Mental Health First Aid Training Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a course that teaches the identification, 1 understanding, and appropriate response to signs of mental illnesses and substance use 2 disorders, providing the skills needed to reach out and provide initial help and support persons 3 who may be developing a mental health or substance use problem or experiencing a crisis; and 4 5 Whereas, There are an estimated 46.6 million adults (about 1 in 5 Americans aged 18 or older) 6 with a mental illness, and more than 20 percent (about 1 in 5) of children have had a seriously 7 debilitating mental disorder; and 8 9 Whereas, Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death overall in the U.S. and the second leading 10 cause of death among people aged 15- 34; and 11 12 Whereas, Mood disorders are the third most common cause of hospitalization in the U.S. for 13 youth and adults aged 18- 44; and 14 15 Whereas, There are 65.9 million physician office visits with mental disorders as the prim ary 16 diagnosis annually; and 17 18 Whereas, United Kingdom medical students who underwent the eLearning course of MHFA 19 showcased the potential to improve students' mental health first aid skills and confidence in 20 helping others; and 21 22 Whereas, 27.2 percent of medical students show signs and symptoms of depression and of 23 them, 11.1 percent are suicidal, yet only 16 percent of those screening positive for depression 24 seek psychiatric treatment; and 25 26 Whereas, Online and face- to-face versions of MHFA have shown to improve outcomes for 27 medical and nursing students with mental health problems such as preventing high failure rates 28 and discontinuation of study, and the knowledge from the training was shown to potentially help 29 them with their future careers; and 30 31 Whereas, In a survey of 2,000 U.S. physicians, approximately 50 percent believed they at one 32 point met criteria for a mental health disorder but did not seek treatment; and 33 34 Whereas, MHFA training programs in the U.S. have been shown to increase knowledge of 35 prevalence rates, cardinal signs and symptoms of common mental health diagnoses, and 36 confidence in being able to apply interventional skills; and 37 38 Whereas, In a MHFA pre -survey, health care providers reported the same level of confidence 39 when dealing with mental health as compared to the general public; and 40 Resolution: 426 (A-22) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, Current performance in the management of mental illness in primary care settings is 1 described by the rule of diminishing halves: \"only half the patients with a threshold disorder are 2 recognized; only half of those recognized are treated; and only half of those treated are 3 effectively treated;\" and 4 5 Whereas, A meta- analysis of 90 independent reports demonstrated that mental health 6 intervention programs amongst higher education students showed significant improvement of 7 social -emotional skills, self -perception, and academic and behavior performance, especially 8 when combined with supervised skills practice; and 9 10 Whereas, The number of behavior and mental health- related visits in the Emergency 11 Departm ent (ED) has seen a 44.1 percent increase over the last decade and has now reached 12 an estimated one in every six ED visits; and despite this increase, there still remains a lack of 13 compensatory mental health education to meet the new demand; and 14 15 Whereas, Emergency Medicine (EM) residents care for 1- 2 patients per day with psychiatric or 16 behavioral health complaints, yet more than half (55 percent) of them report their perception of 17 involvement to be minimal -to-none in the management and care of these patients (beyond 18 medical clearance), and 84 percent of them report they are more comfortable with treating a 19 patient's physical illness than their mental illness; and 20 21 Whereas, Fifty -nine percent of surveyed EM residents across the U.S. believed that their 22 program should have offered more psychiatric education in order to better equip them with tools 23 about how to handle psychiatric emergencies of all kinds, as only 13 percent reported \"well 24 prepared\" to do so; and 25 26 Whereas, Rates of mental health disorders are r ising, and in many cases, the need far exceeds 27 the resources available; and 28 29 Whereas, The national shortage of psychiatrists is linked to a lack of exposure to clinical 30 psychiatry in medical school curricula; and 31 32 Whereas, Psychiatry enrichment activities in medical school are shown to increase student 33 interest in and understanding of the specialty; and 34 35 Whereas, MHFA has shown to decrease negative attitudes and stigma, and increase supportive 36 behaviors towards people struggling with mental health; and 37 38 Whereas, Mental health education programs for health professionals: general practitioners, 39 psychiatrists, junior medical staff, psychologists, nurses, and social workers, led to an increase 40 in perceived knowledge of mental illness and improvements in attitude toward mental illness; 41 and 42 43 Whereas, Many treatments are available to reduce the symptoms and disabilities of mental 44 illness, yet stigma discourages patients to pursue care as a means to avoid potential 45 discrimination; and 46 47 Whereas, Primary care provider s who endorsed stigmatizing ideas surrounding mental illness 48 were found to be less likely to refer patients to needed follow -up services for comorbid physical 49 conditions; and 50 Resolution: 426 (A-22) Page 3 of 6 Whereas, First year medical students who received additional mental health educat ion revealed 1 favorable attitudinal changes in terms of psychiatric services, human rights of the mentally ill, 2 patients' independence in social life, and causes and characteristics of mental illness; and 3 4 Whereas, After four years of medical education medi cal students associated mental illness with 5 stigma, stereotypes, and stress, in contrast to their initial interest in psychiatry before beginning 6 their clinical curriculum; and 7 8 Whereas, A study of fourth year medical students showed that exposure to patients with mental 9 illnesses during psychiatric clerkship did not improve their attitudes towards mental illness and 10 psychiatric conditions as compared to before the clerkship, suggesting more educational 11 training is needed; and 12 13 Whereas, Fourth year medical students who successfully completed their psychiatry clerkship 14 and showed interest in pursuing psychiatry, endorsed that stigma, stereotypes, and stress 15 adversely affected their attitude toward mental illness and willingness to care for patients with 16 mental illness; and 17 18 Whereas, A meta- analysis of randomized controlled trials concerning the incorporation of 19 mental health interventions into higher education showed evidence of long -term sustainability; 20 and 21 22 Whereas, The International Association of Medical Colleges and World Federation for Medical 23 Education require that medical schools incorporate into the curriculum contributions of medical 24 psychology that would enable effective communication, clinical decision- making and ethical 25 practice; and 26 27 Whereas , In the \"Mental Health Competencies for Pediatric Practice\" Policy Statement, the 28 American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that \"pediatricians pursue quality improvement 29 and maintenance of certification activities that enhance their mental health practic e, prioritizing 30 suicide prevention\" and \"advocate for innovations in medical school education, residency and 31 fellowship training, and continuing medical education activities to increase the knowledge base 32 and skill level for future pediatricians in accordance with mental health competencies;\" and 33 34 Whereas, The 114th U.S. Congress HR 1877/S711 bill proposes authorization of $20 million for 35 Mental Health First Aid Training programs to primary care professionals, students, emergency 36 services personnel, police officers, and others with the goal of improving Americans' mental 37 health, reducing stigma around mental illness, and helping people who may be at risk for suicide 38 or self -harm and referring them to appropriate treatment; therefore be it 39 40 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support physician acquisition of 41 emergency mental health response skills by promoting education courses for physicians, 42 fellows, residents, and medical students including, but not limited to, mental health first aid 43 training ( Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 44 45 RESOLVED, That our AMA reaffirm AMA Policy D -345.994 and H -345.984.

Our AMA will work with: (A) mental health organizations, state, specialty, and local medical societies and public health groups to encourage patients to discuss mental health concerns with their physicians; and (B) the Department of Education and state education boards and encourage them to adopt basic mental health education designed specif ically for preschool through high school students, as well as for their parents, caregivers and teachers. 2. Our AMA will encourage the National Institute of Mental Health and local health departments to examine national and regional variations in psychiat ric illnesses among immigrant, minority, and refugee populations in order to increase access to care and appropriate treatment.

Our AMA encourages: (a) medical schools, primary care residencies, and other training programs as appropriate to include the appropriate knowledge and skills to enable graduates to recognize, diagnose, and treat depression and other mental illnesses, either as the chief complaint or with another general medical condition; (b) all physicians providing clinical care to acquire the same knowledge and skills; and (c) additional research into the course and out comes of patients with depression and other mental illnesses who are seen in general medical settings and into the development of clinical and systems approaches designed to improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, any approaches designed to manage care by r eduction in the demand for services should be based on scientifically sound outcomes research findings. 2. Our AMA will work with the National Institute on Mental Health and appropriate medical specialty and mental health advocacy groups to increase public awareness about depression and other mental illnesses, to reduce the stigma associated with depression and other mental illnesses, and to increase patient access to quality care for depression and other mental illnesses. 3. Our AMA: (a) will advocate for the incorporation of integrated services for general medical care, mental health care, and substance use disorder care into existing psychiatry, addiction medicine and primary care training programs' clinical settings; (b) encourages graduate medical education programs in primary care, psychiatry, and addiction medicine to create and expand opportunities for residents and fellows to obtain clinical experience working in an integrated behavioral health and primary care model, such as the collaborative care m odel; and (c) will advocate for appropriate reimbursement to support the practice of integrated physical and mental health care in clinical care settings. 4.Our AMA recognizes the impact of violence and social determinants on womens mental health.

The mental health field is vast and includes a network of factors involving the life of the indiv idual, the community and the nation. Any program designed to combat psychiatric illness and promote mental health must, by the nature of the problems to be solved, be both ambitious and comprehensive. (2) The AMA recognizes the important stake every physic ian, regardless of type of practice, has in improving our mental health knowledge and resources. The physician participates in the mental health field on two levels, as an individual of science and as a citizen. The physician has much to gain from a knowledge of modern psychiatric principles and techniques, and much to contribute to the prevention, handling and management of emotional disturbances. Furthermore, as a natural community leader, the physician is in an excellent position to work for and guide ef fective mental health programs. (3) The AMA will be more active in encouraging physicians to become leaders in community planning for mental health. (4) The AMA has a deep interest in fostering a general attitude within the profession and among the lay public more conducive to solving the many problems existing in the mental health field.

Our AMA will ask the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, American Osteopathic Association, and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to Resolution: 426 (A-22) Page 6 of 6 encourage medical schools and residency/fellowship programs, respectively, to: A. Provide or facilitate the immediate availability of urgent and emergent access to low -cost, confidential health care, including mental health and substance use disorder counseling services, that: (1) include appropriate follow -up; (2) are outside the trainees' grading and evaluation pathways; and (3) are available (based on patient preference and need for assurance of confidentiality) in reasonable proximity to the education/training site, at an external site, or through telemedicine or other virtual, online means; B. Ensure that residency/fellowship programs are abiding by all duty hour restrictions, as these regulations exist in part to ensure the mental and physical health of trainees; C. Encourage and promote routine health screening among medical students and resident/fellow physicians, and consider designating some segment of already -allocated personal time off (if necessary, during scheduled work hours) specifically for routine health screening and preventive services, including physical, mental, and dental care; and D. Remind trainees and practicing physicians to avail themselves of any needed resources, both within and external to their institution, to provide for their mental and physical health and well -being, as a component of their professional obligation to ensure their own fitness for duty and the need to prioritize patient safety and quality of care by ensuring appropriate self -care, not working when sick, and following generally accepted guidelines for a healthy lifestyle. 2. Our AMA will urge state medical boards to refrain from asking applicants about past history of mental health or substance use disorder diagnosis or treatment, and only focus on current impairment by mental illness or addiction, and to accept \"safe haven\" non- reporting for physicians seeking licensure or relicensure who are undergoing treatment for mental health or addiction issues, to help ensure confidentiality of such treatment for the individual physician while providing assurance of patient safety. 3. Our AMA encourages medical schools to create mental health and substance abuse awareness and suicide prevention screening programs that would: A. be available to all medical students on an opt -out basis; B. ensure anonymity, confidentiality, and protection from administrative action; C. provide proactive intervention for identified at -risk students by mental health and addiction professionals; and D. inform students and faculty about personal mental health, substance use and addiction, and other risk factors that may contribute to suicidal ideation. 4. Our AMA: (a) encourages state medical boards to consider physical and mental conditions similarly; (b) encourages state medical boards to recognize that the presence of a mental health condition does not necessarily equate with an impaired ability to practice medicine; and (c) encourages state medical societies to advocate that state medical boards not sanction physic ians based solely on the presence of a psychiatric disease, irrespective of treatment or behavior. 5. Our AMA: (a) encourages study of medical student mental health, including but not limited to rates and risk factors of depression and suicide; (b) encourages medical schools to confidentially gather and release information regarding reporting rates of depression/suicide on an opt -out basis from its students; and (c) will work with other interested parties to encourage research into identifying and addressin g modifiable risk factors for burnout, depression and suicide across the continuum of medical education. 6.Our AMA encourages the development of alternative methods for dealing with the problems of student - physician mental health among medical schools, suc h as: (a) introduction to the concepts of physician impairment at orientation; (b) ongoing support groups, consisting of students and house staff in various stages of their education; (c) journal clubs; (d) fraternities; (e) support of the concepts of phys ical and mental well - being by heads of departments, as well as other faculty members; and/or (f) the opportunity for interested students and house staff to work with students who are having difficulty. Our AMA supports making these alternatives available t o students at the earliest possible point in their medical education. 7.Our AMA will engage with the appropriate organizations to facilitate the development of educational resources and training related to suicide risk of patients, medical students, residents/fellows, practicing physicians, and other health care professionals, using an evidence- based multidisciplinary approach.

(a) Expresses its strong disapproval of any consumption of \"nonalcoholic beer\" by 31 persons under 21 years of age, which creates an image of drinking alcoholic beverages 32 and thereby may encourage the illegal underaged use of alcohol; (b) recommends that 33 health education labels be used on all alcoholic beverage containers and in all alcoholic 34 beverage advertising (with the messages focusing on the hazards 35 of alcohol consumption by specific population groups especially at risk, such as 36 pregnant women, as well as the dangers of irresponsible use to all sectors of the 37 populace); and (c) recommends that the alcohol beverage industry be encouraged to 38 accurately label all product containers as to ingredients, preservatives, and ethanol 39 content (by percent, rather than by proof); and (d) advocates that the alcohol beverage 40 industry be required to include pictorial health warnings on alcoholic beverages . 41 (3.) Actively supports and will work for a total statutory prohibition of advertising of all 42 alcoholic beverages except for inside retail or wholesale outlets. Pursuant to that goal, 43 our AMA (a) supports continued research, educational, and promotional activities 44 dealing with issues of alcohol advertising and health education to provide more 45 definitive evidence on whether, and in what manner, advertising contributes 46 to alcohol abuse; (b) opposes the use of the radio and television to promote drinking; 47 (c) will work with state and local medical societies to support the elimination of 48 advertising of alcoholic beverages from all mass transit systems; (d) urges college and 49 univer sity authorities to bar alcoholic beverage companies from sponsoring athletic 50 events, music concerts, cultural events, and parties on school campuses, and from 51 advertising their products or their logo in school publications; and (e) urges its 52 Resolution: 427 (A- 22) Page 3 of 4 constituent state associations to support state legislation to bar the promotion of 1 alcoholic beverage consumption on school campuses and in advertising in school 2 publications. 3 (4.) (a) Urges producers and distributors of alcoholic beverages to discontinue 4 advertising directed toward youth, such as promotions on high school and college 5 campuses; (b) urges advertisers and broadcasters to cooperate in eliminating television 6 program content that depicts the irresponsible use of alcohol without showing its 7 adverse consequences (examples of such use include driving after drinking, drinking 8 while pregnant, or drinking to enhance performance or win social acceptance); (c) 9 supports continued warnings against the irresponsible use of alcohol and challenges 10 the liquor, beer, and wine trade groups to include in their advertising specific warnings 11 against driving after drinking; and (d) commends those automobile and alcoholic 12 beverage companies that have advertised against driving while under the influence 13 of alcohol.

Citation: CSA Rep. 1, A -04; Reaffirmation A -08; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 01, A -18 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 428 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Amending H -90.968 to Expand Policy on Medical Care of Persons with Disabilities Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, According to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and The ADA 1 Amendments Act of 2008, disability is defined as \"physical or mental impairment that 2 substantially limits one or more major life activities, a person who has a history or record of such 3 an impairment, or a person who is perceived by others as having such an impairment\" 1-3; and 4 5 Whereas, The World Health Organization defines disability broadly as an \"interaction between 6 individuals with a health condition and personal and environmental factors\", which 7 acknowledges the individualistic and contextual nature of disability4; and 8 9 Whereas, The disability justice movement recognizes disability (including but not limited to 10 developmental, intellectual, physical, sensory, learning, and psychiatric disability ) as a 11 component of diversity and identity that intersects with other forms of diversity and identity 12 (including but not limited to social class, race, age, gender identity, and geographic location)5; 13 and 14 15 Whereas, Studies report approximately 12 to 30% of the United States' population has a 16 disability4,6-8; and 17 18 Whereas, Similar to other oppressed minority groups, people with disabilities have experienced 19 a long- shared history of marginalization and discrimination in society and medicine, and as a 20 result, continue to experience health disparities and social determinants of poor health6,8-11; 21 and 22 23 Whereas, Physicians of all specialties will treat patients with a range of disability, yet many 24 physicians hold implicit and explicit biases, such that studies demonstrate that healthcare 25 providers consistently ass ume a lesser quality of life for people with disabilities than what is self - 26 reported5,8-9; and 27 28 Whereas, In a 2019- 2020 survey of United States' physicians, less than half (40.4%) were 29 confident they could provide the same quality of care for those with a disability, around half 30 (56.5%) strongly agreed that they welcome patients with disability into their practices, and less 31 than one fifth (18.1%) strongly agreed that the healthcare system often treats these patients 32 unfairly8; and 33 34 Whereas, Research demonstrates that physicians and medical students report a lack of comfort 35 in interviewing and examining patients with disabilities, often translating to poor outcomes and 36 negative attitudes toward working with this population5-6,12-19; and 37 Resolution: 428 (A-22) Page 2 of 8 Whereas, Disability curricula in undergraduate medical education is highly variable, such that a 1 2015 survey estimated that less than 23% of medical schools provide any disability -focused 2 training5,19-20; and 3 4 Whereas, Even though disability core competencies and curricula ex ist at some institutions, no 5 standardized disability curriculum currently exists across undergraduate medical education or 6 graduate medical education5,21; and 7 8 Whereas, The Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the Accreditation Council for 9 Graduate Medical Education do not require disability training curricula as an accreditation 10 requirement for undergraduate medical education or graduate medical education programs 11 respectively22-23; and 12 13 Whereas, Major reports, most notably the Surgeon Gene ral's 2005 \"Call to Action\", the Institute 14 of Medicine's 2007 \"The Future of Disability in America\", and the National Council on Disability's 15 2015 \"The Current State of Health Care for People with Disabilities\", all call for improvements in 16 the training of healthcare providers in order to address health disparities for people with 17 disabilities1,3-4,6,9,24 -28; and 18 19 Whereas, Section 5307 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act specifically requires 20 the development, evaluation, and dissemination of disability cultural competency curricula for 21 training in health professions schools and continuing education programs19,29; and 22 23 Whereas, Disability studies scholars and activists advocate for disability -conscious medical 24 education, training, and practice t hat includes critical disability studies, a multidisciplinary 25 academic field which \"explores the social, political, and cultural contexts of disability\"5,12,31, and 26 27 Whereas, Several medical schools have created and evaluated model disability curricula and 28 the Alliance for Disability in Health Care Education has developed disability competencies that 29 could provide a framework for implementing disability curricula at other institutions22,32- 34; and 30 31 Whereas, Research demonstrates that disability curricula ar e well- received by students, reduce 32 bias, and improve health professionals' confidence with working with patients with disabilities35-33 36; and 34 35 Whereas, Research demonstrates that incorporation of people with disabilities as patient - 36 instructors, or standardized patients, is beneficial to student learning and addresses the harmful 37 reduction of people to their disabilities that may result from a non- disabled actor playing a 38 role33,37- 40; and 39 40 Whereas, These changes are even more urgent since the COVID -19 pand emic has further 41 exposed ableism in medicine and continues to exacerbate the health disparities experienced by 42 people with disabilities5,8; and 43 44 Whereas, While AMA policy \"A Study to Evaluate Barriers to Medical Education for Trainees 45 with Disabilities D- 295.929\" has the potential to revise technical standards and remove outdated 46 standards rooted in bias, it only addresses the need to expand inclusion of people with 47 disabilities within medical education, training, and practice, but does not go far enough to 48 include care and treatment outlined in curricula and continuing education; and 49 50 Whereas, While AMA policy \"Medical Care of Persons with Developmental Disabilities 51 H-90.968\" advocates for medical curricula involving the care and treatment of those with 52 Resolution: 428 (A- 22) Page 3 of 8 developmental disabilities, it is too narrow in its definition of disability to address the lack of 1 training that contributes to salient health inequities for an extremely diverse demographic that 2 shares experiences of stigma and discrimination in all arenas of public life; therefore be it 3 4 RESOLVED, That, in order to address the shared healthcare barriers of people with disabilities 5 and the need for curricula in medical education on the care and treatment of people with a 6 range of disabilities, our America n Medical Association amend by addition and deletion 7 H-90.968 \"Medical Care of Persons with Developmental Disabilities\" to include those with a 8 broad range of disabilities while retaining goals specific to the needs of those with 9 developmental disabilities : 10 11 Medical Care of Persons with Developmental Disabilities, H- 90.968 12 1. Our AMA encourages: (a) clinicians to learn and appreciate variable presentations of 13 complex functioning profiles in all persons with developmental disabilities including but 14 not limit ed to physical, sensory, developmental, intellectual, learning, and psychiatric 15 disabilities and chronic illnesses; (b) medical schools and graduate medical education 16 programs to acknowledge the benefits of education on how aspects in the social model 17 of disability (e.g. ableism) can impact the physical and mental health of persons with 18 Developmental Dd isabilities; (c) medical schools and graduate medical education 19 programs to acknowledge the benefits of teaching about the nuances of uneven skill sets, 20 often found in the functioning profiles of persons with developmental disabilities, to 21 improve quality in clinical care; (d) education of physicians on how to provide and/or 22 advocate for quality, developmentally appropriate and accessible medical, social and 23 living support for patients with developmental disabilities so as to improve health 24 outcomes; (e) medical schools and residency programs to encourage faculty and trainees 25 to appreciate the opportunities for exploring diagnostic and therapeutic challenges while 26 also accruing significant personal rewards when delivering care with professionalism to 27 persons with profound developmental disabilities and multiple co -morbid medical 28 conditions in any setting; (f) medical schools and graduate medical education programs 29 to establish and encourage enrollment in elective rotations for medical students and 30 residents at health care facilities specializing in care for the developmentally disabled; 31 and (g) cooperation among physicians, health & human services professionals, and a 32 wide variety of adults with developmental disabilities to implement priorities and quality 33 improvements for the care of persons with developmental disabilities. 34 2. Our AMA seeks: (a) legislation to increase the funds available for training physicians 35 in the care of individuals with intellectual disabilities /developmentally disabled individuals , 36 and to increase the reimbursement for the health care of these individuals; and (b) 37 insurance industry and government reimbursement that reflects the true cost of health 38 care of individuals with intellectual disabilities /developmentally disabled individuals . 39 3. Our AMA entreats health care professionals, parents, and others participating in 40 decision- making to be guided by the following principles: (a) All people with 41 developmental disabilities, regardless of the degree of their disability, should have access 42 to appropriate and affordable medical and dental care throughout their lives; and (b) An 43 individual's medical condition and welfare must be the basis of any medical decision. Our 44 AMA advocates for the highest quality medical care for persons with profound 45 developmental disabilities; encourages support for health care facilities whose primary 46 mission is to meet the health care needs of persons with profound developmental 47 disabilities; and informs physicians that when they are presented with an opportunity to 48 care for patients with profound developmental disabilities, that there are resources 49 available to them. 50 4. Our AMA will continue to work with medical schools and their accrediting/licensing 51 bodies to encourage disability related competencies/objectives in medical school 52 Resolution: 428 (A- 22) Page 4 of 8 curricula so that medical professionals are able to effectively communicate with patients 1 and colleagues with disabilities, and are able to provide the most clinically competent and 2 compassionate care for patients with disabilities. 3 4. Our AMA will collaborate with appropriate stakeholders to create a model general 4 curriculum/objective that (a) incorporates critical disability studies; and (b) includes 5 people with disabilities as patient instructors in formal training sessions and preclinical 6 and clinical instruction. 7 5. Our AMA recognizes the importance of managing the health of children and adults with 8 dev elopmental and intellectual disabilities as a part of overall patient care for the entire 9 community. 10 6. Our AMA supports efforts to educate physicians on health management of children 11 and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as well as the consequences 12 of poor health management on mental and physical health for people with intellectual and 13 developmental disabilities. 14 7. Our AMA encourages the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, Commission of 15 Osteopathic College Accreditation, and allopathic and osteopathic medical schools to 16 develop and implement a curriculum on the care and treatment of people with a range of 17 developmental disabilities. 18 8. Our AMA encourages the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and 19 graduate medical education programs to develop and implement curriculum on providing 20 appropriate and comprehensive health care to people with a range of developmental 21 disabilities. 22 9. Our AMA encourages the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, 23 specialty boards, and other continuing medical education providers to develop and 24 implement continuing programs that focus on the care and treatment of people with a 25 range of developmental disabilities. 26 10. Our AMA will advocate that the Health Resources and Services Administration 27 include persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) as a medically 28 underserved population. 29 11. Specific to people with developmental and intellectual disabilities, a uniquely 30 underserved population, our AMA encourages: (a) medical schools and graduate medic al 31 education programs to acknowledge the benefits of teaching about the nuances of 32 uneven skill sets, often found in the functioning profiles of persons with developmental 33 and intellectual disabilities, to improve quality in clinical education; (b) medical schools 34 and graduate medical education programs to establish and encourage enrollment in 35 elective rotations for medical students and residents at health care facilities specializing 36 in care for individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities; and (c) cooperation 37 among physicians, health and human services professionals, and a wide variety of adults 38 with intellectual and developmental disabilities to implement priorities and quality 39 improvements for the care of persons with intellectual and dev elopmental disabilities. 40 (Modify Current HOD Policy) 41 Fiscal Note: Moderate - between $5,000 - $10,000 Received: 05/11/22 References: 1.

BOT Rep. 29, A -18 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 429 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Increasing Awareness and Reducing Consumption of Food and Drink of Poor Nutritional Quality Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, The World Health Organization (WHO) urges member states \"to identify the most 1 suitable policy approach to reduce the impact on children of marketing of foods high in saturated 2 fats, trans -fatty acids, free sugars, or salt\" 1,2; and 3 4 Whereas, The Federal Tax Code allows advertising costs to be deducted as a regular business 5 expense for tax purposes and avoid taxation at the corporate tax rate3; and 6 7 Whereas, The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association recommend 8 changing federal tax law to prohibit food and beverage companies from deducting all or part of 9 the cost of marketing unhealthy products4; and 10 11 Whereas, Targeted advertising to children is defined as those advertisements that appear 12 alongside television programs with an audience share of at least 30% for children aged 2- 11 13 years or 20% for adolescents aged 12- 17 years5; and 14 15 Whereas, Television advertising heavily informs children's food knowledge, preferences, 16 purchase requests, and consumption patterns, and is associated with increased consumption of 17 sugary snacks and beverages, as well as excess calorie intake, and a majority of food- related 18 advertisements viewed by American youth feature primarily unhealthy categories of food6-7; and 19 20 Whereas, The Council of Better Business Bureaus launched the Children's Food and Beverage 21 Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) in 2006 to create a coalition of food and beverage companies, 22 including 17 of the nation's largest food companies, pledging to promote healthier foods and 23 beverages, based first on company -defined and then uniform standards; however, there has 24 been no significant improvement in the nutritional quality of foods marketed to children since the 25 CFBAI's launch, indicating that industry self -regulation is insufficient 8; and 26 27 Whereas, The Interagency Working Group (IWG) on Food Marketed to Children (with 28 representatives from the Federal Trade Commission, the Centers for Disease Control and 29 Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the United States Department of Agriculture) 30 was established in 2009 to draft \"voluntary nutrition principles to guide industry self -regulatory 31 efforts to improve the nutritional profile of foods that are most heavily marketed to children\"9; 32 and 33 34 Whereas, The IWG recommends that foods and beverages marketed to children should provide 35 a meaningful contribution to a healthful diet and should not surpass certain limits for nutrients, 36 including saturated fat, trans fat, added sugars, and sodium, not counting naturally occurring 37 nutrients9; and 38 Resolution: 429 (A-22) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, Nearly all products featured in CFBAI company -member advertisements and 80- 90% 1 of non -CFBAI company advertisements seen on children's programming are nutritionally poor 2 foods, indicating that IWG guidelines are not being followed3; and 3 4 Whereas, Elimination of tax subsidies for advertisements that promote nutritionally poor foods 5 and beverages among children is considered one of the most cost -effective interventions 6 against childhood obesity3,10,11; and 7 8 Whereas, It is estimated that eliminating the tax subsidy would yield an aggregate decrease of 9 2.14 million BMI units in the population, resulting in a net gain of 4,528 quality -adjusted life 10 years over a 10 -year period3; and 11 12 Whereas, \"Added sugar\" refers to any sugars added to a food product during processing and/or 13 packaging such as artificial sweeteners, syrup, honey, or concentrated fruit and vegetable juices 14 that are not naturally occurring12,13; and 15 16 Whereas, The health impact of excessive consumption of sugar and sugary foods has been well 17 documented over the last 20 years, with numerous studies showing that overconsumption is 18 linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes14,15; and 19 20 Whereas, Heavily processed foods, which are higher in added sugars, are easier to mass 21 produce and distribute and have longer shelf lives, making them more viable options in low- 22 income areas, and processed foods are disproportionately marketed towards lower income 23 communities and communities of color16; and 24 25 Whereas, Studies on the Berkeley California SSB tax show that the consumption of cheaper 26 untaxed products increased while taxed SSB consumption decreased, while overall consumer 27 spending per visit did not, indicating consumers were able to shift to other foods after the tax17; 28 and 29 30 Whereas, Hungary and Mexico introduced taxes on items with unhealthy levels of sodium, 31 sugar, or unhealthy saturated fats; in Mexico, within one year there was a 12% reduction in 32 purchases of taxed products, with the reduction reaching as high as 17% in lower 33 socioeconomic brackets, and these results were sustained over time; in Hungary, a 27% 34 reduction in sales tax affected products was observed after implementation of the tax, and it 35 was found that manufacturers were entirely removing or greatly decreasing added sugars in 36 response18-20; and 37 38 Whereas, There is precedent for directing revenue f rom sugar taxes back toward improving 39 nutrition in communities, to avoid these taxes harming lower socioeconomic status communities, 40 as the Berkely SSB tax yielded over $1.4M in tax revenue its first year that was allocated for 41 child nutrition and communit y health programs; further, the Sugar Drinks Tax Act of 2021 42 (SWEET Act), introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on April 21st, 2021, would 43 direct revenue would be used to support the School Breakfast Program, a state -run breakfast 44 programs in s chools and residential childcare institutions17,21,22; and 45 46 Whereas, Our AMA supports taxes on SSBs to reduce their consumption (H -150.927), but has 47 not addressed the equally important issue of food products with added sugars; therefore be it 48 Resolution: 429 (A- 22) Page 3 of 6 RESOLVED, Tha t our American Medical Association advocate for the end of tax subsidies for 1 advertisements that promote among children the consumption of food and drink of poor 2 nutritional quality, as defined by appropriate nutritional guiding principles (Directive to Ta ke 3 Action) ; and be it further 4 5 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend H -150.927, \"Strategies to Reduce the Consumption of 6 Beverages with Added Sweeteners\" by addition to read as follows: 7 8 H-150.927 - STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE CONSUMPTION OF FOOD AND 9 BEVERAGES WITH ADDED SWEETENERS 10 Our AMA: (1) acknowledges the adverse health impacts of sugar - s weetened 11 beverage (SSB) consumption and food products with added sugars, and support 12 evidence- based strategies to reduce the consumption of SSBs and food products with 13 added sugars, including but not limited to, excise taxes on SSBs and food products 14 with added sugars, removing options to purchase SSBs and food products with added 15 sugars in primary and secondary schools, the use of warning labels to inform 16 cons umers about the health consequences of SSB consumption and food products 17 with added sugars, and the use of plain packaging; (2) encourages continued 18 research into strategies that may be effective in limiting SSB consumption and food 19 products with added sug ars, such as controlling portion sizes; limiting options to 20 purchase or access SSBs and food products with added sugars in early childcare 21 settings, workplaces, and public venues; restrictions on marketing SSBs and food 22 products with added sugars to children; and changes to the agricultural subsidies 23 system; (3) encourages hospitals and medical facilities to offer healthier beverages, 24 such as water, unflavored milk, coffee, and unsweetened tea, for purchase in place of 25 SSBs and apply calorie counts for beverages in vending machines to be visible next 26 to the price; and (4) encourages physicians to (a) counsel their patients about the 27 health consequences of SSB consumption and food products with added sugars and 28 replacing SSBs and food products with added sugars with healthier beverage and 29 food choices, as recommended by professional society clinical guidelines; and (b) 30 work with local school districts to promote healthy beverage and food choices for 31 students ; and (5) recommends that taxes on food and beverage products with added 32 sugars be enacted in such a way that the economic burden is borne by companies 33 and not by individuals and families with limited access to food alternatives; and (6) 34 supports that any excise taxes are reinvested in community programs promoting 35 health.

Resolution: 429 (A- 22) Page 6 of 6 CSAPH Rep. 03, A -17 Taxes on Beverages with Added Sweeteners H -150.933 1. Our AMA recognizes the complexity of factors contributing to the obesity epidemic and the need for a multifaceted approach to reduce the prevalence of obesity and improve public health. A key component of such a multifaceted approach is improved consumer education on the adverse healt h effects of excessive consumption of beverages containing added sweeteners. Taxes on beverages with added sweeteners are one means by which consumer education campaigns and other obesity -related programs could be financed in a stepwise approach to address ing the obesity epidemic. 2. Where taxes on beverages with added sweeteners are implemented, the revenue should be used primarily for programs to prevent and/or treat obesity and related conditions, such as educational ad campaigns and improved access to potable drinking water, particularly in schools and communities disproportionately effected by obesity and related conditions, as well as on research into population health outcomes that may be affected by such taxes. 3. Our AMA will advocate for continued research into the potentially adverse effects of long- term consumption of non- caloric sweeteners in beverages, particularly in children and adolescents. 4. Our AMA will: (a) encourage state and local medical societies to support the adoption of state and l ocal excise taxes on sugar -sweetened beverages, with the investment of the resulting revenue in public health programs to combat obesity; and (b) assist state and local medical societies in advocating for excise taxes on sugar -sweetened beverages as reques ted. CSAPH Rep. 5, A -12, Reaffirmation A -13, Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 03, A -17, Appended: Res. 414, A -17 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 430 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Longitudinal Capacity -Building to Address Climate Action and Justice Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, The most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1 found that \"human- induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate 2 extremes in every region across the globe\"1; and 3 4 Whereas, The first installment of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report observed that \"global 5 surface temperature will continue to increase until at least the mid- century under all emissions 6 scenarios considered,\" and \"global warming of 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C will be exceeded during the 21st 7 century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the 8 coming decades\"1; and 9 10 Whereas, Limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C is dependent upon reaching net zero carbon dioxide 11 emissions globally by around year 2050, as well as a significant reduction in non- carbon dioxide 12 drivers1; and 13 14 Whereas, The deleterious health implications of climate change are well -characterized and 15 range from heat -related illness and death to vector -borne diseases to food - and water -borne 16 illnesses2,3; and 17 18 Whereas, Between 2000 and 2017, there were 158 hospital evacuations in the United States, 19 55.2% of which required the evacuation of more than 100 patients, and 72.2% of these 20 evacuations were due to natural, climate -sensitive events such as hurricanes (65 evacuations), 21 wildfires (21 evacuations), floods (10 evacuations), and storms (8 evacuations)4,5; and 22 23 Whereas, Extreme weather events precipitated and exacerbated by climate change have 24 myriad negative repercussions for the healthcare system, such as causing health facility 25 damage and closures, transportation disruptions, power outages, displacement of health 26 professionals, supply chain disruptions, and overcrowding of hospitals5,6; and 27 28 Whereas, The detrimental effects caused by climate change are inequitably distributed and 29 disproportionately borne by marginalized and minoritized populations due to more substantial 30 exposures and less capacity to mitigate the dangers of global warming7,8; and 31 32 Whereas, Inequities in access to healthcare, transportation infrastructure, energy production 33 resources, and spending on climate mitigation and resilience measures drive the disparate 34 impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities, resulting in reduced capacity to respond 35 to its dangerous effects7-12; and 36 37 Whereas, Older adults, Black and Indigenous populations, people with chronic illnesses or 38 mobility challenges, geographically isolated communities, socioeconomically disadvantaged 39 populations including low -income countries, and children are particularly vulnerable to poorer 40 Resolution: 430 (A-22) Page 2 of 8 health outcomes due to the harmful impacts of climate change, and children will suffer the 1 longest exposures to these effects3,7,10,12,13; and 2 3 Whereas, Climate justice has been defined as \"a local, national, and global movement to protect 4 at-risk populations who are disproportionately affected by climate change,\" recognizing that 5 there are grave disparities between the communities most responsible for generating its 6 destructive repercussions and those most burdened by its adverse ef fects10,12,13; and 7 8 Whereas, Heat -related mortality, including deaths from heat stress, heatstroke, and heat -related 9 exacerbations of cardiovascular and respiratory disease, in people older than 65 years has 10 increased by 53.7% in the past 20 years (resulti ng in 296,000 deaths in 2018), and people with 11 disabilities and pre- existing medical conditions are most likely to be impacted8; and 12 13 Whereas, Rising temperatures endanger the global food supply, with the global yield potential 14 for major crops such as maiz e, winter wheat, soybean, and rice decreasing from 1981 to 2019 15 by 1.8 -5.6%, intensifying under -nourishment and malnutrition with the most significant impacts 16 on low - and middle- income countries already suffering from high rates of food insecurity8; and 17 18 Whereas, The United States healthcare system is a major contributor to greenhouse gas 19 emissions and its injurious impact on the climate is escalating, with emissions derived from the 20 United States health sector increasing by six percent from 2010 to 2018, w hen the greenhouse 21 gas and toxic air pollutant emissions from the health system caused the loss of 388,000 22 disability -adjusted life- years14; and 23 24 Whereas, The healthcare sector is responsible for 4.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, 25 emitting 2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually as of 2014, and the United 26 States produces both the highest rate of emissions from its healthcare system (7.6% of its total 27 climate footprint) and the highest total contribution to emissions (546 million me tric tons of 28 carbon dioxide equivalent)15; and 29 30 Whereas, In 2018, greenhouse gas emissions from the healthcare supply chain comprised over 31 80% of the emissions from the United States healthcare sector, representing 453 million metric 32 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, and electric power generation, transmission, and distribution 33 produced 29.4% of greenhouse gas emissions from the United States healthcare system14; and 34 35 Whereas, The United States healthcare sector has the highest per capita greenhouse gas 36 emissions of any country worldwide, at 1,693 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per 37 capita14; and 38 39 Whereas, Because of the significant contributions of the healthcare sector to global greenhouse 40 gas emissions, the decarbonization of the healthcare system constitutes an imperative to reach 41 net zero emissions by 2050 and improve global health equity14,15; and 42 43 Whereas, As noted in the 2020 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change, 44 \"Doctors, nurses, and the broader profession have a central role in health system adaptation 45 and mitigation, in understanding and maximizing the health benefits of any intervention, and in 46 communicating the need for an accelerated response\"8; and 47 48 Whereas, Extant AMA policy \"concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing 49 adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant\" (H - 50 135.938), \"urges Congress to adopt a comprehensive, integrated natural resource and energy 51 utilization policy that will promote more efficie nt fuel use and energy production\" (H -135.977), 52 Resolution: 430 (A-22) Page 3 of 8 and \"supports initiatives to promote environmental sustainability and other efforts to halt global 1 climate change\" (H -135.923); and 2 3 Whereas, The AMA has committed to exploring environmentally sustainable practices for the 4 distribution of the Journal of the American Medical Association (D-135.968) and moving \"in a 5 timely, incremental, and fiscally responsible manner, to the extent allowed by their legal and 6 fiduciary duties, to end all financial investments or relationships (divestment) with companies 7 that generate the majority of their income from the exploration for, production of, transportation 8 of, or sale of fossil fuels\" (D -135.969); and 9 10 Whereas, The AMA currently lacks the organizational capacity to engage in health- oriented 11 climate advocacy that meets the scale of the global climate crisis; therefore be it 12 13 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association: (1) Declare climate change an urgent 14 public health emergency that threatens the health and well -being of all individuals; (2) 15 Aggressively advocate for prompt passage of legislation and policies that limit global warming to 16 no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre -industrial levels and address the health and social 17 impacts of climate change through rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions aimed at 18 carbon neutrality by 2050, rapid implementation and incentivization of clean energy solutions, 19 and significant investments in climate resilience through a climate justice lens; (3) Study 20 opportunities for local, state, and federal policy interventions and advocacy to proactively 21 respond to the emerging climate health crisis and advance climate justice with report back to the 22 House of Delegates; and (4) Consider the establishment of a longi tudinal task force or 23 organizational unit within the AMA to coordinate and strengthen efforts toward advocacy for an 24 equitable and inclusive transition to a net -zero carbon society by 2050, with report back to the 25 House of Delegates.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Global Climate Change and Human Health H -135.938 Our AMA: 1. Supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant. These climate changes will c reate conditions that affect public health, with disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and the poor. 2. Supports educating the medical community on the potential adverse public health effects of global climate change and incorporating the health implications of climate change into the spectrum of medical education, including topics such as population displacement, heat waves and drought, flooding, infectious and vector -borne diseases, and potable water supplies . 3. (a) Recognizes the importance of physician involvement in policymaking at the state, national, and global level and supports efforts to search for novel, comprehensive, and economically sensitive approaches to mitigating climate change to protect the health of the public; and (b) recognizes that whatever the etiology of global climate change, policymakers should work to reduce human contributions to such changes. 4. Encourages physicians to assist in educating patients and the public on environmentally sustainable practices, and to serve as role models for promoting environmental sustainability. 5. Encourages physicians to work with local and state health departments to strengthen the public health infrastructure to ensure that the global health effects of climate change can be anticipated and responded to more efficiently, and that the AMA's Center for Public Health Preparedness and Disaster Response assist in this effort. 6. Supports epidemiological, translational, clinical and basic science research n ecessary for evidence- based global climate change policy decisions related to health care and treatment.

Establishing such standards at the level necessary to protect the public health. Establishing such standards at a level \"allowing an adequate margin of safety,\" as provided in current law, should be maintained, but more scientific research should be conducted on the health effects of the standards currently set by the EPA. (2) The AMA supports continued protection of certain geographic areas (i.e., those with air quality better than the national standards) from significant quality deterioration by requiring strict, but reasonable, emission limitations for new sources. (3) The AMA endorses a more effective hazardous pollutant program to allow for efficient control of serious health hazards posed by airborne toxic pollutants. (4) The AMA believes that more research is needed on the causes and effects of acid rain, and that the procedures to control pollution from another state need to be improved. (5) The AMA believes that attaining the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide is necessary for the long- term benefit of the public health. Emission limitations for motor vehicles should be supported as a long- term goal until appropriate peer -reviewed scientific data demonstrate that the limitations are not required to protect the public health.

and 10 11 Whereas, Three out of four incarcerated females in the United States are of childbearing age 12 and already mothers, and up to 80% of incarcerated females report being heterosexually active 13 without consistent contraceptive methods prior to being arrested, and this can lead to being 14 pregnant before entering incarceration2,4; and 15 16 Whereas, In 2016 a survey of 22 state prisons found 3.8% of new admissions were pregnant 17 people, and in a similar survey conducted at U.S. jails, 3% of admissions were pregnant people, 18 which suggest a national jail admission rate of pregnant people to be around 55,000 a year4,5; 19 and 20 21 Whereas, Limited data is available regarding health outcomes of incarcerated pregnant people 22 despite the high frequency of pre -existing health conditions in incarcerated populations and the 23 established relationship between incarceration and exacerbation of pre- existing medical 24 conditions6-9; and 25 26 Whereas, State and federal Maternal Mortality Review Committees and the CDC's surveillance 27 reports on maternal mortality and morbidity use data from surveillance of perinatal outcomes to 28 improve understanding of disparities among racial groups and inform the development of 29 policies and initiatives aimed at meeting the needs of high- risk populations, but data on 30 incarceration status is not included in this surveillance8-20; and 31 32 Whereas, Quality improvement research can improve care for vulnerable populations, and data 33 from surveillance of perinatal outcomes and studies regarding the accessibility and quality of 34 healthcare available to pregnant incarcerated people would expand the current knowledge of 35 disparities within this particularly vulnerable group21-24; and 36 37 Whereas, There are currently no standard methodologies or requirements for collecting data on 38 incarcerated pregnant people and, prior to 2016, had been no organized review of pregnancy 39 outcomes of incarcerated people in the United States25; and 40 Resolution: 431 (A- 22) Page 2 of 9 Whereas, Incarcerated pregnant people are often deprived of prenatal care, adequate nutrition, 1 access to appropriate accommodations, and timely medical care, all of which are known to 2 contribute to poor health outcomes7,8,26- 31; and 3 4 Whereas, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has established 5 guidelines on prenatal and postnatal care for incarcerated women, including assessing 6 pregnancy risk, providing medication- assisted treatment for opioid use disorder in pregnant 7 people, and avoiding the use of restraints on people who are pregnant or within six weeks of 8 postpartum, but data show that many incarcerated women do not receive care in accordance 9 with these guidelines8,25,32; and 10 11 Whereas, Only a small number of states, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and 12 Oklah oma, have explicit standards of care for incarcerated pregnant mothers, such as specific 13 lab tests, frequency of prenatal visits with an obstetrician, and screening for high-risk 14 pregnancies33-35; and 15 16 Whereas, The US Government Accountability Office reported in 2021 that the US Marshals 17 Service and Bureau of Prisons' Detention Standards and Policies either do not align or only 18 partially align with national guidance recommendations on the treatment and care of pregnant 19 people, and the US Bureau of Prisons and most state correctional facilities do not require 20 specific or explicit guidelines for perinatal care or nutrition36,37; and 21 22 Separation of Infants and Postpartum People in Incarceration 23 24 Whereas, In the US, when a pregnant person gives birth while incarcerated, the infant is often 25 separated from the parent soon after birth to be placed in kinship care, foster care, or given up 26 for adoption, which can lead to the termination of parental rights38; and 27 28 Whereas, The United States is one of only four nations which routinely separate infants from 29 postpartum pregnant people, and many other nations including the United Kingdom and Canada 30 offer Mother -Baby Units in prisons or jails to keep infants with their caregiver for a given period 31 of time39; and 32 33 Whereas, In United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) report Implementation Handbook for the 34 Convention on the Rights of the Child 3rd edition, UNICEF states that children should not be 35 separated from their mother due to incarceration because of the child's wellbeing and right to 36 family life and that if the mother is incarcerated the infant should be present in the prison or jail if 37 possible38; and 38 39 Whereas, Separation of infants from pregnant persons post -partum can have negative effects 40 for the baby, including altered heart rate, impaired infant -parent bonding, lower rates of 41 successful breastfeeding, and impaired social and emotional development, as well as negatively 42 affected parental well- being40-44; and 43 44 Whereas, The immediate separation of newborns from their parent during the postpartum period 45 is associated with long- lasting deficits in maternal feelings of competency, infant self -regulation, 46 and the mother -infant relationship, while interventions that enhance mother -infant contact are 47 associated with short - and long- term improved neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in 48 newborns and children43; and 49 Resolution: 431 (A- 22) Page 3 of 9 Whereas, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes the policy of 1 immediate separation of infants from pregnant persons postpartum, stating that people who give 2 birth while incarcerated should be allowed the maximum time for parent -infant bonding and 3 further that immediately separating infants from incarcerated parents for non- medical reasons is 4 unnecessary, punitive, and harmful40; and 5 6 Whereas, Eleven states offer alternatives to immediate separation, such as prison nursery 7 programs, which is a living arrangement located within a correctional facility in which an 8 imprisoned parent and their infant can consistently co- reside with the parent as the primary 9 caregiver during some or all of the mother's sentence44,45; and 10 11 Whereas, Alternatives to immediate separation, like prison nursery programs, have been shown 12 to potentially increase infant -parent attachment and bonding, reduce recidivism, and improve 13 parents' self -esteem and child rearing skills44,45; and 14 15 Whereas, In May 2021, Minnesota became the first state to oppose the immediate separation of 16 infants from incarcerated pregnant people through passing the Healthy Start Act, which allowed 17 incarcerated pregnant people to be placed in community -based programs such as halfway 18 houses during the late term of their pregnancy and up to one year after46; and 19 20 Whereas, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American 21 Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a 22 baby's life47,48; and 23 24 Breastfeeding in Incarceration 25 26 Whereas, Breast milk has established benefits for the baby, including reduced risks of infection, 27 such as otitis media and pneumonia; other health conditions, such as obesity, type 1 and type 2 28 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); as well as established 29 benefits of breastfeeding and breast milk expression for the mother, including reduced risk of 30 breast and ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension47-50; and 31 32 Whereas, Breastfeeding has been associated with improved cognitive and emotional abilities, 33 increased brain development in children, and i mproved mother -child relationship51; and 34 35 Whereas, The cost of infant formula is up to $1,500 per year; alternatively, feeding a baby with 36 pasteurized donor human milk costs an average of $4.50 per ounce, and further, the cost of 37 healthcare in a breastfed baby's first year of life is, on average, $331 less than a formula- fed 38 baby52-56; and 39 40 Whereas, Pumping breast milk can promote a greater maternal -infant bond and improve the 41 health of both the mother and infant57; and 42 43 Whereas, A woman's right to breastfeed or express breast milk in any private or public location 44 is protected by law in all 50 states of the United States; however, for mothers in prison, there 45 are significant barriers to expressing and storing breast milk, such as requiring presence of a 46 prison guard, time restrictions, and insufficient equipment58,59; and 47 48 Whereas, Restricting mothers from breastfeeding and/or expressing breast milk while 49 incarcerated will decrease their milk supply, hindering their ability to directly breastfeed60; and 50 Resolution: 431 (A- 22) Page 4 of 9 Wher eas, In 2017, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care called on correctional 1 facilities to support programs for incarcerated women to breastfeed their babies directly or pump 2 breast milk and store it for later delivery to the infant61; and 3 Wher eas, The protections for incarcerated mothers to express milk may be established on a 4 state -by-state basis, but only California, Connecticut, New Mexico, New York, and Washington 5 have laws offering protections, although still with limitations58,62- 67; and 6 7 Whereas, Our AMA supports initiatives to promote early intervention for healthcare needs of 8 children with incarcerated parents (H- 60.903) and has supported research on bonding programs 9 for women prisoners and their newborn children (H -430.990) since 1997, but does not oppose 10 the separation of infants and postpartum people; and 11 12 Whereas, Our AMA acknowledges the importance of access to healthcare for incarcerated 13 individuals (D -430.997, H- 430.986, H -430.997) and has supported standards to improve the 14 safety of pregnant incarcerated people (H -420.957), and our AMA has policies in support of 15 breastfeeding (H -245.982), though these policies do not specify protecting an incarcerated 16 mother's right to express milk; therefore be it 17 18 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association encourage research efforts to characterize 19 the health needs for pregnant inmates, including efforts that utilize data acquisition directly from 20 pregnant inmates (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 21 22 RESOLVED, That our AMA support legislation requiring all correctional facilities, including those 23 that are privately -owned, to collect and report pregnancy -related healthcare statistics with 24 transparency in the data collection process (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 25 26 RESOLVED, That our AMA oppose the immediate separation of infants from incarcerated 27 pregnant individuals post- partum; (Directive to Take Action) and be it further 28 29 RESOLVED, That our AMA support solutions, such as community -based programs, which allow 30 infants and incarcerated postpartum individuals to remain together (Directive to Take Action) ; 31 and be it further 32 33 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -430.990 by addition to read as follows: 34 35 Bonding Programs for Women Prisoners and their Newborn Children H -430.990 36 Because there are insufficient data at this time to draw conclusions about the long- term 37 effects of prison nursery programs on mothers and their children, the AMA supports and 38 encourages further research on the impact of infant bonding programs on incarcerated 39 women and their children. However, since there are established benefits of breast milk 40 for infants and breast milk expression for mothers, the AMA advocates for policy and 41 legislation that extends the right to breastfeed and/or pump and store breast milk to 42 include incarcerated mothers. The AMA recognizes the prevalence of mental health and 43 substance abuse problems among incarcerated women and continues to support 44 access to appropriate services for women in prisons. The AMA recognizes that a large 45 majority of incarcerated females who may not have developed appropriate parenting 46 skills are mothers of children under the age of 18. The AMA encourages correctional 47 facilities to provide parenting skills and breastfeeding/breast pumping training to all 48 female inmates in preparation for their release from prison and return to their children. 49 The AMA supports and encourages further investigation into the long- term effects of 50 prison nurseries on mothers and their children.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Support for Health Care Services to Incarcerated Persons D -430.997 Our AMA will: (1) express its support of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care Standards that improve the quality of health care services, including mental health services, delivered to the nation's correctional facilities; (2) encourage all correctional systems to support NCCHC accreditation; (3) encourage the NCCHC and its AMA representative to work with departments of corrections and public officials to find cost effective and efficient methods to increase cor rectional health services funding; (4) continue support for the programs and goals of the NCCHC through continued support for the travel expenses of the AMA representative to the NCCHC, with this decision to be reconsidered every two years in light of other AMA financial commitments, organizational memberships, and programmatic priorities;(5) work with an accrediting organization, such as National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) in developing a strategy to accredit all correctional, detention and juvenile facilities and will advocate that all correctional, detention and juvenile facilities be accredited by the NCCHC no later than 2025 and will support funding for correctional facilities to assist in this effort; and (6) support an incarcerated person's right to: (a) accessible, comprehensive, evidence-based contraception education; (b) access to reversible contraceptive methods; and (c) autonomy over the decision- making process without coercion.

A Appended: Res. 421, A-19; Appended: Res. 426, A -19 Health Care While Incarcerated H -430.986 1. Our AMA advocat es for adequate payment to health care providers, including primary care and mental health, and addiction treatment professionals, to encourage improved access to comprehensive physical and behavioral health care services to juveniles and adults throughout the incarceration process from intake to re-Resolution: 431 (A-22) Page 8 of 9 entry into the community. 2. Our AMA advocates and requires a smooth transition including partnerships and information sharing between correctional systems, community health systems and state insurance programs to provide access to a continuum of health care services for juveniles and adults in the correctional system. 3. Our AMA encourages state Medicaid agencies to accept and process Medicaid applications from juveniles and adults who are incarcerated. 4. Our A MA encourages state Medicaid agencies to work with their local departments of corrections, prisons, and jails to assist incarcerated juveniles and adults who may not have been enrolled in Medicaid at the time of their incarceration to apply and receive an eligibility determination for Medicaid. 5. Our AMA advocates for states to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid eligibility of juveniles and adults upon intake into the criminal legal system and throughout the incarceration process, and to reinstate coverage when the individual transitions back into the community. 6. Our AMA advocates for Congress to repeal the \"inmate exclusion\" of the 1965 Social Security Act that bars the use of federal Medicaid matching funds from covering healthcare services in jails and prisons. 7. Our AMA advocates for Congress and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to revise the Medicare statute and rescind related regulations that prevent payment for medical care furnished to a Medicare beneficiary who is incarcerated or in custody at the time the services are delivered. 8. Our AMA advocates for necessary programs and staff training to address the distinctive health care needs of women and adolescent females who are incarcerated, including gynecological care and obs tetrics care for individuals who are pregnant or postpartum. 9. Our AMA will collaborate with state medical societies, relevant medical specialty societies, and federal regulators to emphasize the importance of hygiene and health literacy information sessi ons, as well as information sessions on the science of addiction, evidence- based addiction treatment including medications, and related stigma reduction, for both individuals who are incarcerated and staff in correctional facilities. 10. Our AMA supports: (a) linkage of those incarcerated to community clinics upon release in order to accelerate access to comprehensive health care, including mental health and substance use disorder services, and improve health outcomes among this vulnerable patient population, as well as adequate funding; and (b) the collaboration of correctional health workers and community health care providers for those transitioning from a correctional institution to the community. 11. Our AMA advocates for the continuation of federal fun ding for health insurance benefits, including Medicaid, Medicare, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, for otherwise eligible individuals in pre- trial detention. 12. Our AMA advocates for the prohibition of the use of co- payments to access healthcare services in correctional facilities. CMS Rep. 02, I -16; Appended: Res. 417, A -19; Appended: Res. 420, A -19; Modified: Res. 216, I -19; Reaffirmed: Res. 229, A -21 Shackling of Pregnant Women in Labor H -420.957 1. Our AMA supports language recently adopted by the New Mexico legislature that \"an adult or juvenile correctional facility, detention center or local jail shall use the least restrictive restraints necessary when the facility has actual or constructive knowledge that an inmate is in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy. No restraints of any kind shall be used on an inmate who is in labor, delivering her baby or recuperating from the delivery unless there are compelling grounds to believe that the inmate presents: - An immediate and serious threat of harm to herself, staff or others; or - A substantial flight risk and cannot be reasonably contained by other means. If an inmate who is in labor or who is delivering her baby is restrained, only the least restrictive restraints necessary to ensure safet y and security shall be used.\" 2. Our AMA will develop model state legislation prohibiting the use of shackles on pregnant women unless flight or safety concerns exist. Res. 203, A -10; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 04, A -20 Bonding Programs for Women Prisoners and their Newborn Children H -430.990 Because there are insufficient data at this time to draw conclusions about the long- term effects of prison nursery programs on mothers and their children, the AMA supports and encourages further research on the impact of i nfant bonding programs on incarcerated women and their children. The AMA recognizes the prevalence of mental health and substance abuse problems among incarcerated women and continues to support access to appropriate services for women in prisons. The AMA recognizes that a large majority of female inmates who may not have developed appropriate parenting skills are mothers of children under the age of 18. The AMA encourages correctional facilities to provide parenting skills training to all female inmates in preparation for their release from prison and return to their children. The AMA supports and encourages further investigation into the long- term effects of prison nurseries on mothers and their children. Resolution: 431 (A-22) Page 9 of 9 CSA Rep. 3, Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 3, A -07; R eaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 01, A -17 Standards of Care for Inmates of Correctional Facilities H -430.997 Our AMA believes that correctional and detention facilities should provide medical, psychiatric, and substance misuse care that meets prevailing community st andards, including appropriate referrals for ongoing care upon release from the correctional facility in order to prevent recidivism.

I CEJA Rep. 8, A -09; Reaffirmation: I -09; Modified in lieu of Res. 502, A -12; Reaffirmation: I -12 Support for Breastfeeding H -245.982 1. Our AMA: (a) recognizes that breastfeeding is the optimal form of nutrition for most infants; (b) endorses the 2012 policy statement of American Academy of Pediatrics on Breastfeeding and the use of Human Milk, which delineates various ways in which physicians and hospitals can promote, protect, and support breastfeeding practices; (c) supports working with other interested organizations in actively seeking t o promote increased breastfeeding by Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC Program) recipients, without reduction in other benefits; (d) supports the availability and appropriate use of breast pumps as a cost - effective tool t o promote breast feeding; and (e) encourages public facilities to provide designated areas for breastfeeding and breast pumping; mothers nursing babies should not be singled out and discouraged from nursing their infants in public places. 2. Our AMA: (a) promotes education on breastfeeding in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education curricula; (b) encourages all medical schools and graduate Resolution RS -056 (I -20) Page 5 of 6 medical education programs to support all residents, medical st udents and faculty who provide breast milk for their infants, including appropriate time and facilities to express and store breast milk during the working day; (c) encourages the education of patients during prenatal care on the benefits of breastfeeding; (d) supports breastfeeding in the health care system by encouraging hospitals to provide written breastfeeding policy that is communicated to health care staff; (e) encourages hospitals to train staff in the skills needed to implement written breastfeeding policy, to educate pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding, to attempt early initiation of breastfeeding, to practice \"rooming- in,\" to educate mothers on how to breastfeed and maintain lactation, and to foster breastfeeding support groups and services; (f) supports curtailing formula promotional practices by encouraging perinatal care providers and hospitals to ensure that physicians or other appropriately trained medical personnel authorize distribution of infant formula as a me dical sample only after appropriate infant feeding education, to specifically include education of parents about the medical benefits of breastfeeding and encouragement of its practice, and education of parents about formula and bottle- feeding options; and (g) supports the concept that the parent's decision to use infant formula, as well as the choice of which formula, should be preceded by consultation with a physician. 3. Our AMA: (a) supports the implementation of the WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding at all birthing facilities; (b) endorses implementation of the Joint Commission Perinatal Care Core Measures Set for Exclusive Breast Milk Feeding for all maternity care facilities in the US as measures of breastfeeding initiation, exclusivit y and continuation which should be continuously tracked by the nation, and social and demographic disparities should be addressed and eliminated; (c) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about six months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complement ary food are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant; (d) recommends the adoption of employer programs which support breastfeeding mothers so that they may safely and privately express br east milk at work or take time to feed their infants; and (e) encourages employers in all fields of healthcare to serve as role models to improve the public health by supporting mothers providing breast milk to their infants beyond the postpartum period. 4. Our AMA supports the evaluation and grading of primary care interventions to support breastfeeding, as developed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). 5.

(2) Practicing physicians should become familiar with authoritative clinical preventive services guidelines and routinely implement them as appropriate to the age, gender, and individual risk/environmental factors applicable to the patients in the practice at every opportunity, including episodic/acute care visits. (3) Where appropriate, clinical preventive services recommendations should be based on outcomes -based research and effectiveness data.

and 3 4 Whereas, A 2019 study published in The Lancet found that \"when enforced by free and fair 5 elections, democracies are more likely than autocracies to lead to health gains for causes of 6 mortality (e.g., cardiovas cular diseases and transport injuries) that have not been heavily 7 targeted by foreign aid and require health- care delivery\"5; and 8 9 Whereas, Multiple studies have shown a clear positive correlation between electoral integrity in 10 democracies and improvements in indicators of population health, including infant mortality, 11 mortality from cardiovascular disease and other communicable diseases, and tuberculosis6-9; 12 and 13 14 Whereas, A recent study including data from 168 countries from 1960 through 2010 found a 15 positive association between democracy and life expectancy that remained even after 16 controlling for potential confounders like gross domestic product (GDP) per capita10; and 17 18 Whereas, An analysis of the shift to electronic voting in Brazil, which disproportionately enabled 19 the poor and less well -educated to participate in elections, showed the change led to increases 20 in health spending that increased utilization of prenatal care and decreased the number of 21 children being born at low weight, suggesting that increasing access to meaningful elections can 22 improve population health11; and 23 24 Whereas, A 2018 analysis comparing different Indian states across core attributes of democracy 25 showed that having higher voter turnout and more political parties were both significantly 26 associated with reductions in infant mortality12; and 27 28 Whereas, One study showed that the presence of competitive elections in autocracies was 29 associated with better life expectancy and rates of infant mortality as compared to autocracies 30 without competitive elections13; and 31 32 Whereas, Studies have shown that democracies may enhance the beneficial effects of various 33 societal transformations, including trade liberalization and foreign aid, on population health14-17; 34 and 35 36 Whereas, Studies have shown that democracies may suppress the harmful effects of a variety 37 of negative economic indicators and disasters, including storms, floods, droughts, and other 38 environmental disruptions, extreme price volatility, and excessive mining and mineral extracti on, 39 on overall population health18-20; and 40 Resolution: 433 (A- 22) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, An August 2021 analysis of 170 countries over the time period from 1990 to 2019 1 published in Health Affairs indicated that democratic quality and universal health coverage have 2 a statistically significant positive association, with free and fair elections identified as having the 3 strongest association with higher universal health coverage21; and 4 5 Whereas, A 2020 BMJ study of 17 countries found that decreases in democratic traits, including 6 free and fair elections, freedom of expression, freedom of civil and political association, between 7 2000 and 2010 were associated with lower life expectancy, reduced progress toward universal 8 health coverage, and increased out -of-pocket spending on healthcare22; and 9 10 Wher eas, The annual Freedom House reports, which rate the political and civil rights of 11 countries around the globe, have tracked a steady decline in multiple dimensions of democracy 12 in the United States from 2010 to 202023-25; and 13 14 Whereas, From November 2020 to January 2021, multiple key government officials attempted 15 to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election through a variety of mechanisms26-30; and 16 17 Whereas, During the counting of electoral votes on January 6- 7, 2021, hundreds of 18 Representativ es and Senators in Congress voted to reject electoral votes from key states in an 19 attempt which, if it had been successful, would have overturned the results of the 2020 20 presidential election31-33; and 21 22 Whereas, Multiple state legislatures have since passed laws that provide unprecedented control 23 over state and local elections and could permit those legislatures to subvert election results34-37; 24 and 25 26 Whereas, These antidemocratic trends in the United States directly threaten the ability of 27 physicians and their patients to make their voices heard, thereby depriving them of a key 28 avenue to maximize their health and well- being; therefore be it 29 30 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association unequivocally support the democratic 31 process, wherein representatives are regularly chosen through free and fair elections, as 32 essential for maximizing the health and well -being of all Americans (New HOD Policy) ; and be it 33 further 34 35 RESOLVED, That our AMA strongly oppose attempts to subvert the democratic process 36 (Directive t o Take Action) ; and be it further 37 38 RESOLVED, That our AMA assert that every candidate for political office and every officeholder 39 in the public trust must support the democratic process and never take steps or support steps 40 by others to subvert it.

Our AMA recognizes trauma- informed care as a practice that recognizes the widespread impact of trauma on patients, identifies the signs and symptoms of trauma, and treats patients by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices and seeking to avoid re- traumatization. 2. Our AMA supports: a. evidence- based primary prevention strategies for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs); b. evidence- based trauma- informed care in all medical settings that focuses on the prevent ion of poor health and life outcomes after ACEs or other trauma at any time in life occurs; c. efforts for data collection, research and evaluation of cost -effective ACEs screening tools without additional burden for physicians; d. efforts to educate physi cians about the facilitators, barriers and best practices for providers implementing ACEs screening and trauma- informed care approaches into a clinical setting; and e. funding for schools, behavioral and mental health services, professional groups, communi ty and government agencies to support patients with ACEs or trauma at any time in life. 3. Our AMA supports the inclusion of ACEs and trauma- informed care into undergraduate and graduate medical education curricula. Res. 504, A -19; Appended: CSAPH Rep. 3, A-21 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 435 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Support Removal of BMI as a Standard Measure in Medicine and Recognizing Culturally -Diverse and Varied Presentations of Eating Disorders Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, Body mass i ndex (BMI) is used across medicine as a screening tool to classify 1 individuals as underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obese, and is calculated from a 2 person's height and weight; it is a screening tool in healthcare that is frequently utilized as a 3 surrogate estimation of body fat through the measurement of total body weight rather than total 4 body fat 1,2,3; and 5 6 Whereas, Underlying assumptions are that BMI directly correlates to levels of body fat 7 (adiposity); however, many factors besides body fat (adiposity) impact BMI, including muscle 8 mass, gender, and race/ethnicity, and such factors limit the ability of BMI to be used to reliably 9 predict general health and disease risk4; and 10 11 Whereas, There is minimal evidence supporting the clinical utility of BMI; however, in many 12 clinical settings certain BMI ranges are broadly correlated with increased rates of morbidity and 13 mortality secondary to several different disease processes without consideration of individual 14 and population level differences5; and 15 16 Whereas, Numerous medical specialty organizations recognize several measures as a useful 17 adjunct or alternative to BMI that could be used clinically, including waist circumference, relative 18 fat mass, body adiposity index, and the body volume index, all of which have been studied in 19 the literature6-15; and 20 21 Whereas, The development of BMI was based solely on those of European descent in an effort 22 to define the characteristics of the \"normal man;\" 16 and 23 24 Whereas, The development of BMI and its apparent association with specific disease pr ocesses 25 were based on primarily white males of European descent and is not a standardized across 26 racial and ethnic groups and has limited predictive validity in these groups4,6,17; and 27 28 Whereas, The association between BMI levels and risks varies among different racial groups; 29 for example, there is a link between BMI and metabolic abnormalities in the white population, 30 but this association is not found among other racial groups18; and 31 32 Whereas, BMI has been shown to have a low sensitivity for body fat mass and may lead to 33 inadequate prevention of obesity -related health complications, especially in at- risk populations 34 such as women and children16,19,20; and 35 36 Whereas, BMI categorization fails to serve as a predictor for obesity in white, Black or Hispanic 37 women either pre- or post -menopause21, 22; and 38 Resolution: 435 (A-22) Page 2 of 9 Whereas, Despite limited evidence for its clinical validity, BMI is used as an indicator of eating 1 disorder presence and severity, which impairs access to treatment and is not predictive of the 2 severi ty of eating disorder psychology, and in fact may be inversely correlated23-26; and 3 4 Whereas, The DSM -V defines a binge -eating episode as \"eating, in a discrete period of time, an 5 amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a si milar period of time 6 under similar circumstances,\" and binge eating disorder is the most prevalent eating disorder in 7 the United States with a lifetime prevalence of 2.8%27,28; and 8 9 Whereas, Recent evidence has shown significant differences in the prevalence of binge- eating 10 symptoms in non -Hispanic White populations and non- Hispanic Black populations29; and 11 12 Whereas, Rates of obesity, body satisfaction, and depression vary among ethnic groups, 13 causing heterogeneity in the prevalence of eating disorders within these groups, and some 14 studies suggest that the increased risk of disordered eating in ethnic minority adolescents may 15 result from higher levels of stress due to minority status30,31,32; and 16 17 Whereas, Research has shown that men and ethnic /racial minorities are significantly less likely 18 to seek help for binge eating disorders than women or non- Hispanic White people33; and 19 20 Whereas, Studies have documented lower rates of treatment for eating disorders among some 21 specific diverse populations due to differences in clinical presentation, differences in help- 22 seeking patterns, and clinician error or bias34-36; and 23 24 Whereas, Stigma associated with a health care provider's assessment of body weight is 25 associated with medication nonadherence, mistrus t of the provider, and avoidance of medical 26 care37; and 27 28 Whereas, Inclusive, non- stigmatizing approaches to health promotion must also acknowledge 29 the social and economic determinants of health and take into consideration the patient's lived 30 environment for physicians to help patients achieve meaningful and sustainable health goals37; 31 and 32 33 Whereas, A recent overview of Cochrane systematic reviews has shown that of all studied 34 psychosocial interventions, the cognitive behavioral approach was most effective for binge- 35 eating disorder, bulimia, nervosa, and night eating syndrome38; and 36 37 Whereas, Research suggests culturally sensitive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is both 38 feasible and efficacious; for example, a qualitative study has shown that cu lturally adapted CBT- 39 guided self -help has been well received and is a feasible treatment for Mexican American 40 women with binge- eating disorder39,40,41; and 41 42 Whereas, Our AMA has set precedents for supporting additional research on the efficacy of 43 screening for obesity using indicators other than BMI in the pursuit of improving various clinical 44 outcomes across populations (H -440.866) and increased funding for research on the diagnosis 45 of eating disorders (H -150.928); and 46 47 Whereas, In 2013 the AMA Council on Science and Public Health (CSAPH) released a report 48 that recognized the need for better measures of obesity than BMI and rescinded policy 49 D-440.971, \"Recommendations for Physician and Community Collaboration on the Management 50 of Obesity\" which encouraged physicians to incorporate BMI in the routine adult physical 51 Resolution: 435 (A- 22) Page 3 of 9 examination; this recommendation demonstrated our AMA's recognition of the lack of evidence 1 supporting the routine clinical use of BMI42; and 2 3 Whereas, Binge- eating is the most prominent presentation of eating disorders, particularly in 4 minority populations, but is not specified in current AMA policy despite less prevalent 5 presentations such as weight restriction being specified; therefore, be it 6 7 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association recognize the significant limitations and 8 potential harms associated with the widespread use of body mass index (BMI) in clinical 9 settings and supports its use only in a limited screening capacity when used in conjunction with 10 other more valid measures of health and wellness (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 11 12 RESOLVED, That our AMA support the use of validated, easily obtained alternatives to BMI 13 (such as relative fat mass, body adiposity index, and the body volume index) for estimating risk 14 of weight -related disease (New HOD Policy); and be it further 15 16 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -440.866, \"T he Clinical Utility of Measuring Body 17 Mass Index and Waist Circumference in the Diagnosis and Management of Adult Overweight 18 and Obesity ,\" by addition and deletion to read as follows: 19 20 The Clinical Utility of Measu ring Body Mass Index Weight, Adiposity, and Waist 21 Circumference in the Diagnosis and Management of Adult Overweight and Obesity, 22 H-440.866 23 Our AMA supports: 24 (1) greater emphasis in physician educational programs on the risk differences among 25 ethnic and age within and between demographic groups at varying weights and levels 26 of adiposity BMI and the importance of monitoring waist circumference in all individuals 27 with BMIs below 35 kg/m2; 28 (2) additional research on the efficacy of screening for overweight and obesity, using 29 different indicators, in improving various clinical outcomes across populations, including 30 morbidity, mortality, mental health, and prevention of further weight gain; and 31 (3) more research on the efficacy of screening and interventions by physicians to 32 promote healthy lifestyle behaviors, including healthy diets and regular physical activity, 33 in all of their patients to improve health and minimize disease risks. (Modify Current 34 HOD Policy) ; and be it further 35 36 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -150.965, by addition to read as follows in order 37 to support increased recognition of disordered eating behaviors in minority populations and 38 culturally appropriate interventions: 39 40 H-150.965 - EATING DISORDERS 41 The AMA (1) adopts the position that overemphasis of bodily thinness is as deleterious 42 to one's physical and mental health as obesity; (2) asks its members to help their 43 patients avoid obsessions with dieting and to develop balanced, individualized 44 approaches to f inding the body weight that is best for each of them; (3) encourages 45 training of all school -based physicians, counselors, coaches, trainers, teachers and 46 nurses to recognize unhealthy eating, binge- eating, dieting, and weight restrictive 47 behaviors in adolescents and to offer education and appropriate referral of adolescents 48 and their families for culturally -informed interventional counseling; and (4) participates 49 in this effort by consulting with appropriate and culturally informed educational and 50 counseling materials pertaining to unhealthy eating, binge- eating, dieting, and weight 51 restrictive behaviors.

Our AMA will: (a) assume a leadership role in collaborating with other interested organizations, including national medical specialty societies, the American Public Health Association, the Cen ter for Science in the Public Interest, and the AMA Alliance, to discuss ways to finance a comprehensive national program for the study, prevention, and treatment of obesity, as well as public health and medical programs that serve vulnerable populations; (b) encourage state medical societies to collaborate with interested state and local organizations to discuss ways to finance a comprehensive program for the study, prevention, and treatment of obesity, as well as public health and medical programs that serve vulnerable populations; and (c) continue to monitor and support state and national policies and regulations that encourage healthy lifestyles and promote obesity prevention. 2. Our AMA, consistent with H -440.842, Recognition of Obesity as a Disease, wi ll work with national specialty and state medical societies to advocate for patient access to and physician payment for the full continuum of evidence- based obesity treatment modalities (such as behavioral, pharmaceutical, psychosocial, nutritional, and surgical interventions). 3. Our AMA will: (a) work with state and specialty societies to identify states in which physicians are restricted from providing the current standard of care with regards to obesity treatment; and (b) work with interested state medi cal societies and other stakeholders to remove out -of-date restrictions at the state and federal level prohibiting healthcare providers from providing the current standard of care to patients affected by obesity.

Res. 811, I - 14Appended: Res. 201, A -18 H-320.953: Definitions of \"Screening\" and \"Medical Necessity\" (1) Our AMA defines screening as: Health care services or products provided to an individual without apparent signs or symptoms of an illness, injury or disease for the purpose of identifying or excluding an undiagnosed illness, disease, or condition. (2) Our AMA recognizes that federal law (EMTALA) includes the distinct use of the word screening in the term \"medical screening examination\"; \"The process required to reach, with reasonable clinical confidence, the point at which it can be determined whether a medical emergency does or does not exist.\" (3) Our AMA defines medical necessity as: Health care services or product s that a prudent physician would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing or treating an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms in a manner that is: (a) in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice; (b) clinic ally appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration; and (c) not primarily for the economic benefit of the health plans and purchasers or for the convenience of the patient, treating physician, or other health care provider. (4) Our AM A incorporates its definition of \"medical necessity\" in relevant AMA advocacy documents, including its \"Model Managed Care Services Agreement.\" Usage of the term \"medical necessity\" must be consistent between the medical profession and the insurance indust ry. Carrier denials for non- covered services should state so explicitly and not confound this with a determination of lack of \"medical necessity\". (5) Our AMA encourages physicians to carefully review their health plan medical services agreements to ensure that they do not contain definitions of medical necessity that emphasize cost and resource utilization above quality and clinical effectiveness. (6) Our AMA urges private sector health care accreditation organizations to develop and incorporate standards that prohibit the use of definitions of medical necessity that emphasize cost and resource utilization above quality and clinical effectiveness. (7) Our AMA advocates that determinations of medical necessity shall be based only on information that is avail able at the time that health care products or services are provided. (8) Our AMA continues to advocate its policies on medical necessity determinations to government agencies, managed care organizations, third party payers, and private sector health care accreditation organizations.

Res. 420, A -13 H-425.994: Medical Evaluations of Healthy Persons The AMA supports the following principles of healthful living and proper medical care: (1) The periodic evaluation of healthy individuals is important for the early detection of disease and for the recognition and correction of certain risk factors that may presage disease. (2) The optimal frequency of the periodic evaluation and the procedures to be performed vary with the patient's age, socioeconomic status, heredity, and other individual factors. Nevertheless, the evaluation of a healthy person by a physician can serve as a convenient reference point for preventive services and for counseling about healthful living and known risk factors. (3) These r ecommendations should be modified as appropriate in terms of each person's age, sex, occupation and other characteristics. All recommendations are subject to modification, depending upon factors such as the sensitivity and specificity of available tests and the prevalence of the diseases being sought in the particular population group from which the person comes. (4) The testing of individuals and of population groups should be pursued only when adequate treatment and follow -up can be arranged for the abnor mal conditions and risk factors that are identified. (5) Physicians need to improve their skills in fostering patients' good health, and in dealing with long recognized problems such as hypertension, obesity, anxiety and depression, to which could be added the excessive use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs. (6) Continued investigation is required to determine the usefulness of test procedures that may be of value in detecting disease among asymptomatic populations. CSA Rep. D, A -82; Reaffirmed: CLRPD A -13; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 03, I -17 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 436 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Training and Reimbursement for Firearm Safety Counseling Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, Firearm ownership is embedded within United States (US) culture with nearly 22% of 1 individuals owning a firearm and 35% living in a household with firearms1; and 2 3 Whereas, The incidence of firearm -related mortality in the U.S. has increased in a 15- year period, 4 from 10.3 deaths per 100,000 in 2007 to 13.7 deaths per 100,000 in 20202; and 5 6 Whereas, Firearm -related hospitalizations (FRHs) contribute to substantial physical morbidity, 7 psychological and societal costs, and higher risk of subsequent violent victimization and crime 8 perpetration3; and 9 10 Whereas, Firearm injuries create a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality on people 11 of color, highlighting racial disparities in firearm access and health outcomes7-11; and 12 13 Whereas, Over 4 billion dollars were spent on firearm injuries in emergency departments from 14 2006- 2016, demonstrating the significant and increasing economic burden of gun violence in the 15 US12-15; and 16 17 Whereas, Physician- led firearm counseling was ruled protected under First Amendment rights by 18 Wollschlaeger v. Governor, State of Florida, which invalidated Florida's Firearm Owners' Privacy 19 Act that prevented physicians from asking patients about firearm ownership16; and 20 21 Whereas, Although organizations including the AMA and American Academy of Pediatrics 22 (AAP) agree that physicians should counsel patients on firearm safety, only 25% of fam ily 23 physicians, psychiatrists, and internists provide this counseling very often or often17-18; and 24 25 Whereas, One study reported that only 15% of physicians documented firearm counseling 26 discussions with patients, naming factors including lack of physician training, time constraints, 27 and fear of offending patients and families19-22; and 28 29 Whereas, A study of pediatrics resident physicians demonstrated that after a workshop about 30 firearm safety counseling, residents were 5 times more likely to counsel their patients on 31 firearms and had greater comfort during the discussion, due to increased knowledge on 32 recommendations and safe storage22; and 33 34 Whereas, Physician firearm counseling, when combined with firearm safety devices, has 35 demonstrated improvements in firearm storage in patients' homes from increased availability of 36 locks and safes and increased patient education23; and 37 Resolution: 436 (A- 22) Page 2 of 9 Whereas, The American Foundation for Firearm Injury Reduction in Medicine (AFFIRM) has 1 convened a working group to develop curricula to help educate future physicians about firearms 2 safety24; and 3 4 Whereas, Numerous medical schools, including Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine 5 at Hofstra/Northwell, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, McGovern Medical School, Miller 6 School of Medicine, and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have already 7 incorporated firearm -related injury prevention education into their curriculum25; and 8 9 Whereas, Individuals at greater risk for firearm injury include those involved in intimate -partner 10 violence and community violence, or those with mental illness, suicidal ideation, and cognitive 11 decline26-28; and 12 13 Whereas, Efficient use of physician time and resources can be encouraged through 14 implementation of screening of individuals who are at higher risk for firearm injury29-31; and 15 16 Whereas, Examples of reimbursement for other preventive education have demonstrated that 17 increased counseling by physicians and improved patient health outcomes; for example, 18 preventive smoking cessation counseling increased cessation rates by 30%, and since the 19 Affordable Care Act included smoking cessation counseling coverage in 2014, more people 20 have quit smoking32-33; and 21 22 Whereas, Smoking cessation counseling, which is reimbursed independently by insurance 23 companies, can prevent over 50,000 smoking- attributable fatalities and reduce smoking 24 prevalence by 5.5 percentage points, and firearm counseling would be expected to follow this 25 same trend34; and 26 27 Whereas, Medicaid and Medicare value- based reimbursement of preventative services has 28 been shown to improve health outcomes through rewarding quality care from primary care 29 physicians35; and 30 31 Whereas, Physician decision- making has been linked to financial incentives, suggesting that 32 value- based payments specifically for firearm safety counseling may drive increased rates of 33 counseling and improved health outcomes, similar to other preventive care reimbursement 34 strategies36; and 35 36 Whereas, Although the 2021 ICD- 10-CM diagnosis code Z71.89 encompasses other specified 37 counseling, this does not cover specific topics such as firearm storage and prevention of 38 firearm -related injuries37; and 39 40 Whereas, Other preventive counseling efforts, including smoking cessation, alcohol misuse, 41 dental health, diet, and sexually transmitted diseases, have their own designated ICD -10 42 codes37-38; and 43 44 Whereas, For the high- risk subpopulation of older adults, firearm counseling could be 45 incorporated into a patient's Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) to be billed under the 46 preventive services modifier and to provide remuneration for physicians providing counseling39; 47 and 48 49 Whereas, AMA Policies H -145.990, H -145.975, and H -145.976 address the need for firearm 50 injury prevention, safe firearm storage, and improved physician counseling and dissemination of 51 Resolution: 436 (A- 22) Page 3 of 9 educational materials, but do not address inclusion in medical curricula or specify how 1 physicians should be reimbursed for such efforts; and 2 3 Whereas, Physicians should be incentivized to provide firearm safety counseling for patients 4 through a combination of education and appropriate compensation for their time and efforts, 5 contributing to reduced morbidity and mortality from firearms; therefore be it 6 7 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support the inclusion of gun violence 8 epidemiology and evidence- based firearm -related injury prevention education in medical school 9 curricula (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 10 11 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend Policy H -145.976, \"Firearm Safety Counseling in Physician- 12 Led Health Care Teams ,\" by addition to read as follows: 13 14 Firearm Safety Counseling in Physician- Led Health Care Teams, H -145.976 15 1. Our AMA: (a) will oppose any restrictions on physicians' and other members of the 16 physician- led health care team's ability to inquire and talk about firearm safety issues 17 and risks with their patients; (b) will oppose any law restricting physicians' and other 18 members of the physician- led health care team's discussions with patients and their 19 families about firearms as an intrusion into medical privacy; and (c) encourages 20 dissemination of educational materials related to firearm safety to be used in 21 undergraduate medical education. 22 2. Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders to develop state- specific guidanc e 23 for physicians on how to counsel patients to reduce their risk for firearm -related injury or 24 death, including guidance on when and how to ask sensitive questions about firearm 25 ownership, access, and use, and clarification on the circumstances under which 26 physicians are permitted or may be required to disclose the content of such 27 conversations to family members, law enforcement, or other third parties. 28 3. Our AMA will support the development of reimbursement structures that incentivize 29 physicians to counsel patients on firearm -related injury risk and prevention.

Our patients require a sufficient, well -trained supply of primary care physicians --family physicians, general internists, general pediatricians, and obstetricians/gynec ologists --to meet the nation's current and projected demand for health care services. Resolution: 436 (A-22) Page 8 of 9 2. To help accomplish this critical goal, our American Medical Association (AMA) will work with a variety of key stakeholders, to include federal and state legislators and regulatory bodies; national and state specialty societies and medical associations, including those representing primary care fields; and accreditation, certification, licensing, and regulatory bodies from across the continuum of medical education (under graduate, graduate, and continuing medical education). 3. Through its work with these stakeholders, our AMA will encourage development and dissemination of innovative models to recruit medical students interested in primary care, train primary care physici ans, and enhance both the perception and the reality of primary care practice, to encompass the following components: a) Changes to medical school admissions and recruitment of medical students to primary care specialties, including counseling of medical s tudents as they develop their career plans; b) Curriculum changes throughout the medical education continuum; c) Expanded financial aid and debt relief options; d) Financial and logistical support for primary care practice, including adequate reimbursement , and enhancements to the practice environment to ensure professional satisfaction and practice sustainability; and e) Support for research and advocacy related to primary care. 4. Admissions and recruitment: The medical school admissions process should reflect the specific institution's mission. Those schools with missions that include primary care should consider those predictor variables among applicants that are associated with choice of these specialties. 5. Medical schools, through continued and expanded recruitment and outreach activities into secondary schools, colleges, and universities, should develop and increase the pool of applicants likely to practice primary care by seeking out those students whose profiles indicate a likelihood of practicing in primary care and underserved areas, while establishing strict guidelines to preclude discrimination. 6. Career counseling and exposure to primary care: Medical schools should provide to students career counseling related to the choice of a primary care specialty, and ensure that primary care physicians are well - represented as teachers, mentors, and role models to future physicians. 7. Financial assistance programs should be created to provide students with primary care experiences in ambulatory settings, especially in underserved areas. These could include funded preceptorships or summer work/study opportunities. 8. Curriculum: Voluntary efforts to develop and expand both undergraduate and graduate medical education programs to educate primary care physic ians in increasing numbers should be continued. The establishment of appropriate administrative units for all primary care specialties should be encouraged. 9. Medical schools with an explicit commitment to primary care should structure the curriculum to s upport this objective. At the same time, all medical schools should be encouraged to continue to change their curriculum to put more emphasis on primary care. 10. All four years of the curriculum in every medical school should provide primary care experiences for all students, to feature increasing levels of student responsibility and use of ambulatory and community -based settings. 11. Federal funding, without coercive terms, should be available to institutions needing financial support to expand resources for both undergraduate and graduate medical education programs designed to increase the number of primary care physicians. Our AMA will advocate for public (federal and state) and private payers to a) develop enhanced funding and related incentives from al l sources to provide education for medical students and resident/fellow physicians, respectively, in progressive, community -based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes (such as the patient -centered medical home and the chronic care model) to enhance primary care as a career choice; b) fund and foster innovative pilot programs that change the current approaches to primary care in undergraduate and graduate medical education, especially in urban and rural underserved areas; and c) evaluate these efforts for their effectiveness in increasing the number of students choosing primary care careers and helping facilitate the elimination of geographic, racial, and other health care disparities. 12. Medical schools and teaching hospitals in underserved areas should promote medical student and resident/fellow physician rotations through local family health clinics for the underserved, with financial assistance to the clinics to compensate their teaching efforts. 13. The curriculum in primary care res idency programs and training sites should be consistent with the objective of training generalist physicians. Our AMA will encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to (a) support primary care residency programs, including communit y hospital -based programs, and (b) develop an accreditation environment and novel pathways that promote innovations in graduate medical education, using progressive, community -based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes (such as the pat ient-centered medical home and the chronic care model). 14. The visibility of primary care faculty members should be enhanced within the medical school, and positive attitudes toward primary care among all faculty members should be encouraged. 15. Support for practicing primary care physicians: Administrative support mechanisms should be developed to assist primary care physicians in the logistics of their practices, along with enhanced efforts to reduce Resolution: 436 (A-22) Page 9 of 9 administrative activities unrelated to patient care, to help ensure professional satisfaction and practice sustainability. 16. There should be increased financial incentives for physicians practicing primary care, especially those in rural and urban underserved areas, to include scholarship or loan repayment programs, relief of professional liability burdens, and Medicaid case management programs, among others. Our AMA will advocate to state and federal legislative and regulatory bodies, among others, for development of public and/or private incentive program s, and expansion and increased funding for existing programs, to further encourage practice in underserved areas and decrease the debt load of primary care physicians. The imposition of specific outcome targets should be resisted, especially in the absence of additional support to the schools. 17. Our AMA will continue to advocate, in collaboration with relevant specialty societies, for the recommendations from the AMA/Specialty Society RVS Update Committee (RUC) related to reimbursement for E&M services an d coverage of services related to care coordination, including patient education, counseling, team meetings and other functions; and work to ensure that private payers fully recognize the value of E&M services, incorporating the RUC -recommended increases adopted for the most current Medicare RBRVS. 18. Our AMA will advocate for public (federal and state) and private payers to develop physician reimbursement systems to promote primary care and specialty practices in progressive, community -based models of int egrated care focused on quality and outcomes such as the patient -centered medical home and the chronic care model consistent with current AMA Policies H -160.918 and H -160.919. 19. There should be educational support systems for primary care physicians, especially those practicing in underserved areas. 20. Our AMA will urge urban hospitals, medical centers, state medical associations, and specialty societies to consider the expanded use of mobile health care capabilities. 21. Our AMA will encourage the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to explore the use of telemedicine to improve access to and support for urban primary care practices in underserved settings. 22. Accredited continuing medical education providers should promote and establish continuing medical education courses in performing, prescribing, interpreting and reinforcing primary care services. 23. Practicing physicians in other specialties --particularly those practicing in underserved urban or rural areas -- should be provided the opportunity to gain specific primary care competencies through short -term preceptorships or postgraduate fellowships offered by departments of family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, etc., at medical schools or teaching hospitals. In addition, part -time traini ng should be encouraged, to allow physicians in these programs to practice concurrently, and further research into these concepts should be encouraged. 24. Our AMA supports continued funding of Public Health Service Act, Title VII, Section 747, and encourages advocacy in this regard by AMA members and the public. 25. Research: Analysis of state and federal financial assistance programs should be undertaken, to determine if these programs are having the desired workforce effects, particularly for students from disadvantaged groups and those that are underrepresented in medicine, and to gauge the impact of these programs on elimination of geographic, racial, and other health care disparities. Additional research should identify the factors that deter students and physicians from choosing and remaining in primary care disciplines. Further, our AMA should continue to monitor trends in the choice of a primary care specialty and the availability of primary care graduate medical education positions. The r esults of these and related research endeavors should support and further refine AMA policy to enhance primary care as a career choice. CME Rep. 04, I -18 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 516 (A-22) Introduced by: Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society Subject: Oppose \"Mild Hyperbaric\" Facilities from Delivering Unsupported Clinical Treatments Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, So called \"mild hyperbaric facilities\" have become numerous in the very recent past 1 consisting of at least 288 locations in 31 states in the United States; and 2 3 Whereas, These centers are treating and charging clients mostly for scientifically unsupported 4 disease entities and conditions without any or with inadequate evidence and wit hout intention to 5 analyze results and add to the compendium of medical knowledge; and 6 7 Whereas, These centers take advantage of vulnerable populations including those suffering 8 from autism, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and post -stroke injuries; and 9 10 Whereas, These centers offer clients improvement in general health and wellness without any 11 substantiating science or even reasonably predicated mechanisms; and 12 13 Whereas, When \"mild hyperbaric\" centers do treat conditions in which published experience and 14 scientific evidence support the use of hyperbaric oxygen, they fail to use time- tested protocols. 15 Typically, their treatments deliver pressures just over 1.0 ATA (atmospheres absolute) and less 16 than 1.4 ATA. They also fail to deliver inhaled oxygen conc entrations near 100% oxygen to the 17 patient. Both of these fall very short of time -tested treatment parameters; and 18 19 Whereas, Treatments are offered without physician oversight or prescription, and without 20 appropriately trained staff; and 21 22 Whereas, Treatments are delivered often in unsafe environments with inadequately trained staff 23 and without required safety and fire suppression equipment in chambers that are not FDA - 24 certified and for which no 510K application has been made; therefore be it 25 26 RESOLVED, Th at our American Medical Association oppose the operation of \"mild hyperbaric 27 facilities\" unless and until effective treatments can be delivered in safe facilities with 28 appropriately trained staff including physician supervisi on and prescription and only when the 29 intervention has scientific support or rationale.

The magnitude of these 2 practices is documented to be widespread, occurring in at least 288 centers in 31 states ; and 3 4 Whereas Pressure vessels (chambers) employed by these center s are not typically inspected, 5 certified, or approved by the appropriate standards and regulatory agencies including the FDA 6 and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers). Many chambers are being imported 7 from foreign countries. At least two U.S. co mpanies are also involved in design, manufacture , 8 and sales of inadequately designed chambers. In both cases, the manufacturers do not seek 9 the required certification of pressure vessels for human occupancy inappropriately marketing 10 these as medical hyperb aric chambers with no valid FDA 510K clearance; and 11 12 Whereas, These treatments are being conducted without physician supervision or prescription. 13 In the event of chamber integrity failure, patients are subject to serious injury and even death by 14 barotrauma . Furthermore , additional complications including hypoglycemic reactions and 15 unrecognized cardiac emergencies can occur and require immediate physician recognition and 16 intervention ; and 17 18 Whereas, Without regard to the inherent risk of fire in this special environment, most of these 19 facilities operate with chambers installed into business spaces not adherent to the safety 20 regulations of the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) and not protected by sprinkler 21 systems, alarms or other safety equi pment ; and 22 23 Whereas The staff delivering the actual hyperbaric exposures in \"mild hyperbaric facilities\" are 24 not receiving comprehensive training in chamber operation, safety and emergency prevention; 25 and 26 27 Whereas, Heath Canada has already banned future sales of soft sided mild hyperbaric 28 chambers often used in \"mild hyperbaric\" applications and called for the recall of those already 29 sold; and 30 31 Whereas, These centers often promote and advertise false and misleading applications in the 32 treatment in non- compl iance with FDA regulations ; therefore be it 33 34 RESOLVED, T hat our American Medical Association oppose the operation of unsafe \"Mild 35 Hyperbaric Facilities\" (New HOD Policy); and be it further 36 Resolution: 517 (A-22) Page 2 of 2 RESOLVED, T hat our AMA work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other 1 regulatory bodies to close these facilities until and unless they adopt and adhere to all 2 established safety regulations, adhere to the established principles of the practice of hyperbaric 3 oxygen under the prescription and oversight of a licensed and trained physician, and ensure 4 that staff are appropriately trained and adherent to applicable safety regulations.

and 9 10 Whereas , Oral contraceptives can have important non- contraceptive benefits, including 11 decreasing risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer, treating heavy menstrual bleeding and 12 dysmenorrhea, and reducing pelvic pain due to endometriosis;2 and 13 14 Whereas , Barriers to access are one reason for inconsistent or nonuse of contraception and 15 the requirement for a prescription can be an obstacle for some contraceptive users; and 16 17 Whereas , A national survey of 1,385 women reported that among the 68% of individuals who 18 had ever tried to obtain a prescription for hormonal contraception, 29% had problems 19 accessing the initial prescription or refills, reporting obstacles including challenges in obtaining 20 an appointment or getting to a clinic, the health care provider requiring a clinic visit, 21 examination, or Pap test, and not having a regular physician or clinic;3 and 22 23 Whereas , Surveys repeatedly have demonstrated interest among adolescents and adult 24 women in over -the-counter access to oral contraceptives,4-6 including a 2011 national survey 25 about views on over -the-counter oral contraceptives,7 a nationally representative, cross - 26 sectional online survey of approximately 2,500 females (aged 15- 44 years),8 and focus group 27 data from adolescent females and adult women;9-10 and 28 29 Whereas , Progestin- only emergency contraception (EC) is already available without a 30 prescription for people of all ages in the United States; and 31 32 Whereas , Pelvic and breast examinations, cervical cancer screening, and sexually transmitted 33 infection screening are not required before initiating hormonal contraception;11-14 and 34 35 Whereas , Studies have shown that women can accurately use checklists to determine if they 36 have contraindications to hormonal contraception; in one study, 96% of cases evaluated 37 demonstrated agreement between a women's assessment of her contraindications using a 38 checklist and a clinician's independent evaluation, and women often take a more conservative 39 approach compared with clinicians;15-16 and 40 Resolution: 518 (A- 22) Page 2 of 5 Whereas , Data support that progestin- only hormonal methods are generally safe and carry no 1 or minimal risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE);17 and 2 3 Whereas , The VTE risk with combined oral contraceptive use is small compared with the 4 increased risk of VTE during pregnancy and the postpartum period;18 and 5 6 Whereas, Oral contraceptive pills are safe and effective for adolescent users, there is no 7 scientific rationale for limiting access to a future over -the-counter oral contraceptive product by 8 age, and over -the-counter access to hormonal contraception has the potential to reduce barriers 9 and increase hormonal contraceptive use for adolescents; 19 and 10 11 Whereas , An Oral Contraceptives Over -the-Counter Working Group was formed in 2004 with 12 the aims \"to improve access to contraception and reduce disparities in reproductive health 13 outcomes by making a low -cost oral contraceptive product available OTC in the United States;\" 14 and 15 16 Whereas , Over 100 o rganizations have signed onto the Oral Contraceptives Over -the-Counter 17 Working Group's statement of purpose, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, ACOG, 18 the National Hispanic Medical Association, the North American Society for Pediatric and 19 Adolesc ent Gynecology, and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine;20 and 20 21 Whereas , Policy statements from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the 22 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and American Public Health 23 Associat ion (APHA) support OTC oral contraceptive access;21-23 and 24 25 Whereas , In December 2016, Ibis Reproductive Health announced a partnership with HRA 26 Pharma to conduct the research needed and submit an application to the FDA to bring a 27 progestin- only oral contraceptive pill to the Unites States OTC market;24 and 28 29 Whereas, Current AMA Policy directs our AMA to encourage manufacturers of oral 30 contraceptives to submit the required application and supporting evidence to the US Food and 31 Drug Administration for the Agency to consider approving a switch in status from prescription 32 to over -the-counter for such products; and 33 34 Whereas, HRA Pharma completed its final testing phase in 2021 on a progestin- only oral 35 contraceptive and is expected to file a formal application for over -the-counter approval with the 36 U.S. Food and Drug Administration before the end of 2022;25 therefore be it 37 38 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend policy D -75.995, \"Over -the- 39 Counter Access to Oral Contraceptives,\" by addition and deletion to read as follows: 40 41 Our AMA: 42 1.

(2) Our AMA continues to advocate vigorously for a stable, continuing base of funding and support for all aspects of clinical research within the research programs of all relevant federal agenci es, including the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense. (3) The AMA believes it is an inherent obligati on of capitation programs and managed care organizations to invest in broad -based clinical research (as well as in health care delivery and outcomes research) to assure continued transition of new developments from the research bench to medical practice. The AMA strongly encourages these groups to make significant financial contributions to support such research. (4) Our AMA continues to encourage medical schools a) to support clinical research; b) to train and develop clinical researchers; c) to recognize the contribution of clinical researchers to academic medicine; d) to assure the highest quality of clinical research; and e) to explore innovative ways in which clinical researchers in academic health centers can actively involve practicing physicians in c linical research. (5) Our AMA encourages and supports development of community and practice- based clinical research networks.

and 5 6 Whereas, Human milk sharing, also known as using donor human milk, provides access to 7 breast milk for mothers who cannot provide enough for their infants, especially preterm infants 8 in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)3; and 9 10 Whereas, Donor human milk provides nutrients comparable to a mother's own milk, yielding 11 positive effects on neurodevelopment and tolerance of feedings, as well as reduced risk of 12 sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, reduced length of stay in the NICU, and direct cost savings 13 4, 5; and 14 15 Whereas, Informal or peer milk sharing, defined as the practice of donating or receiving donor 16 human milk directly peer -to-peer, is growing in popularity, with tens of thousands of informal 17 milk exchanges occurring via Facebook groups each year and national surveys of milk sharing 18 participants finding that as many as 64% of respondents have obtained donor breast milk 19 informally6-11 ; and 20 21 Whereas, Informal milk sharing is associated with many quality concerns, such as dilution with 22 non-human milk which infants are unable to properly digest for the first year of life3, 12, 13; and 23 24 Whereas, Informal milk sharing also carries many safety risks including contamination via 25 infectious or toxic environmental agents, with several studies finding that a significant number 26 of informally shared human milk samples were colonized with disease- causing pathogens, 27 including aerobic bacteria, gram -negative bacteria, and coliform bacteria14, 15, 16, 17; and 28 29 Whereas, These safety risks are of special concern with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID - 30 19) pandemic as it cannot be confirmed whether safety precautions known to protect against 31 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) transmission\u2014including 32 wearing a mask while expressing milk, washing hands and equipment thoroughly, and 33 pasteurizing donor milk \u2014have been taken with informally shared milk18, 19; and 34 35 Whereas, Non -profit milk banks, which are regulated by the Human Milk Banking Association of 36 North America (HMBANA), serve as a safe alternative to informal milk sharing by provi ding 37 breast milk that is screened, pooled, tested, and pasteurized to be provided to infants in need20; 38 and 39 Resolution: 520 (A- 22) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Non -profit milk banks are associated with many limitations in accessibility, including 1 limited distribution as only 25 non -profit milk bank s operate in the United States due to 2 limitations in donor supply and access to funding3, 21, 22, 23; and 3 4 Whereas, Already -limited milk supplies at non -profit milk banks are being further strained during 5 the COVID -19 pandemic due to inadequate staffing, challenges with donor recruitment, and 6 safety concerns about donor milk24; and 7 8 Whereas, Access to non -profit milk bank breast milk is also limited by cost, as this milk 9 generally costs $3 -$5 per ounce, and although Medicaid, the Special Supplemental Nutrition 10 Program for Women, Infants, and Children, and other aid- providing programs can help to cover 11 costs, this coverage varies by state25, 26; and 12 13 Whereas, The majority of the public is unable to access non -profit milk bank breast milk as a 14 prescription is often required to receive this milk and the majority of non -profit milk bank breast 15 milk is provided to NICUs due to limitations in supply3, 27; and 16 17 Whereas, Concerns have risen about informal milk sharing outcompeting milk banks for receipt 18 of human milk donations, and studies have found that women who participate in milk sharing 19 are much more likely to have donated informally than to have donated to a milk bank 5-10, 28, 29; 20 and 21 22 Whereas, The AAP, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Milk Bank 23 Association, HMBANA, and the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine have released statements 24 within the last 5 years discouraging informal milk sharing in favor of milk banking3, 8, 9, 27, 30, 31; 25 and 26 27 Whereas, The AMA has existing policy supporting breastfeeding (H -245.982) and breast milk 28 banking (H -245.972) but these policies and the policy statements they support make no mention 29 of informal milk sharing or donation to milk banks; therefore be it 30 31 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association discourage the practice of informal milk 32 sharing when said practice does not rise to health and safety standards comparable to those of 33 milk banks, including but not limited to screening of donors and/or milk pasteurization (New 34 HOD Polic y); and be it further 35 36 RESOLVED, That our AMA encourage breast milk donation to regulated human milk banks 37 instead of via informal means (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA support further research into the status of milk donation in the U.S. 40 and how rates of donation for regulated human milk banks may be improved.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Breast Milk Banking H -245.972 Our AMA encourages breast milk banking. Res. 443, A -07; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 01, A- 17 AMA Support for Breastfeeding H -245.982 1. Our AMA: (a) recognizes that breastfeeding is the optimal form of nutrition for most infants; (b) endorses the 2012 policy statement of American Academy of Pediatrics on Breastfeeding and the use of Human Milk, which delineates various ways in which physicians and hospitals can promote, protect, and support breastfeeding practices; (c) supports working with other interested organizations in actively seeking to promote increased breastfeeding by Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC Program) recipients, without reduction in other benefits; (d) supports the availability and appropriate use of breast pumps as a cost -effective tool to promote breast feeding; and (e) encourages public facilities to provide designated areas for breastfeeding and breast pumping; mothers nursing babies should not be singled out and discouraged from nursing their infants in public places. 2. Our AMA: (a) promotes education on breastfeeding in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education curricula; (b) encourages all medical schools and graduate medical education programs to support all residents, medical students and faculty who provide breast milk for their infants, including appropriate time and facilities to express and store breast milk during the working day; (c) encourages the education of patients during prenatal care on the benefits of breastfeeding; (d) supports breastfeeding in the health care system by encouraging hospitals to provide written breastfeeding policy that is communicated to health care staff; (e) encourages hospitals to train staff in the skills needed to Resolution: 520 (A- 22) Page 4 of 4 implement written breastfeeding policy, to educate pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding, to attempt early initiation of breastfeeding, to practice \"rooming- in,\" to educate mothers on how to breastfeed and maintain lactation, and to foster breastfeeding support groups and services; (f) supports curtailing formula promotional practices by encouraging perinatal care providers and hospitals to ensure that physicians or other appropriately trained medical personnel authorize distribution of infant formula as a medical sample only after appropriate infant feeding education, to specifically include education of parents about the medical benefits of breastfeeding and encouragement of its practice, and education of parents about formula and bottle- feeding options; and (g) supports the concept that the parent's decision to use infant formula, as well as the choice of which formula, should be preceded by consultation with a physician. 3. Our AMA: (a) supports the implementation of the WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding at all birthing facilities; (b) endorses implementation of the Joint Commission Perinatal Care Core Measures Set for Exclusive Breast Milk Feeding for all maternity care facilities in the US as measures of breastfeeding initiation, exclusivity and continuation which should be continuously tracked by the nation, and social and demographic disparities should be addressed and eliminated; (c) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about six months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary food are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant; (d) recommends the adoption of employer programs which support breastfeeding mothers so that they may safely and privately express breast milk at work or take time to feed their infants; and (e) encourages employers in all fields of healthcare to serve as role models to improve the public health by supporting mothers providing breast milk to their infants beyond the postpartum period. 4. Our AMA supports the evaluation and grading of primary care interventions to support breastfeeding, as developed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). 5. Our AMA's Opioid Task Force promotes educational resources for mothers who are breastfeeding on the benefits and risks of using opioids or medication- assisted therapy for opioid use disorder, based on the most recent guidelines.

(2) Our AMA continues to advocate vigorously for a s table, continuing base of funding and support for all aspects of clinical research within the research programs of all relevant federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense. (3) The AMA believes it is an inherent obligation of capitation programs and managed care organizations to invest in broad-based clinical research (as well as in health care delivery and outcomes research) to assure continued transition of new developments from the research bench to medical practice. The AMA strongly encourages these groups to make significant financial contributions to support such research. (4) Our AMA continues to encourage medical schools a) to support clinical research; b) to train and develop clinical researchers; c) to recognize the contribution of clinical researchers to academic medicine; d) to assure the highest quality of clinical resear ch; and e) to explore innovative ways in which clinical researchers in academic health centers can actively involve practicing physicians in clinical research. (5) Our AMA encourages and supports the development of community and practice- based clinical research networks. CSA Rep. 2, I -96; CSA Rep. 13, I Rep. 4, I- 08; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -18 Physician Involvement in Research : Opinion E- 7.1.1 Biomedical and health research is intended to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and the welfare of society and future patients, rather than to th e specific benefit of the individuals who participate as research subjects. However, research involving human participants should be conducted in a manner that minimizes risks and avoids unnecessary suffering. Because research depends on the willingness of participants to accept risk, they must be able to make informed decisions about whether to participate or continue in a given protocol. Physician researchers share their responsibility for the ethical conduct of research with the institution that carries out research. Institutions have an obligation to oversee the design, conduct, and dissemination of research to ensure that scientific, ethical, and legal standards are upheld. Institutional review boards (IRBs) and individual investigators should ensure that each participant has been appropriately informed and has given voluntary consent. Physicians who are involved in research with human participants have an ethical obligation to ensure that participants' interests are protected and to safeguard pa rticipants' welfare, safety, and comfort. To fulfill these obligations, individually, physicians who are involved in research should: (a) Participate only in those studies for which they have relevant expertise. (b) Ensure that voluntary consent has been o btained from each participant or from the participant's legally authorized representative if the participant lacks the capacity to consent, in keeping with ethics guidance. This requires that: (i) prospective participants receive the information they need to make well -considered decisions, including informing them about the nature of the research and potential harms involved; (ii) physicians make all reasonable efforts to ensure that participants understand the research is not intended to benefit th em individually; (iii) physicians also make clear that the individual may refuse to participate or may withdraw from the protocol at any time. (c) Assure themselves that the research protocol is scientifically sound and meets ethical guidelines for research with h uman participants. Informed consent can never be invoked to justify an unethical study design. (d) Demonstrate the same care and concern for the well -being of research participants that they would for patients to whom they provide clinical care in a therap eutic relationship. Physician researchers should advocate for access to experimental interventions that have proven effectiveness for patients. (e) Be mindful of conflicts of interest and assure themselves that appropriate safeguards are in place to protec t the integrity of the research and the welfare of human participants. (f) Adhere to rigorous scientific and ethical standards in conducting, supervising, and disseminating the results of the research. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I, II, III, V Issue d: 2016 Organ Donation D-370.985 Our AMA will study potential models for increasing the United States organ donor pool.

CSA Rep. D, I -80; CLRPD Rep. B, I -90; CSAPH Rep.1, A -12 Ethical Considerations in the Allocation of Organs and Other Sc arce Medical Resources Among Patients H-370.982 Our AMA has adopted the following guidelines as policy: (1) Decisions regarding the allocation of scarce medical resources among patients should consider only ethically appropriate criteria relating to medica l need. (a) These criteria include likelihood of benefit, urgency of need, change in quality of life, duration of benefit, and, in some cases, the amount of resources required for successful treatment. In general, only very substantial differences among patients are ethically relevant; the greater the disparities, the more justified the use of these criteria becomes. In making quality of life judgme nts, patients should first be prioritized so that death or extremely poor outcomes are avoided; then, patients should be prioritized according to change in quality of life, but only when there are very substantial differences among patients. (b) Research should be pursued to increase knowledge of outcomes and thereby improve the accuracy of these criteria. (c) Non -medical criteria, such as ability to pay, social worth, perceived obstacles to treatment, patient contribution to illness, or past use of resources should not be considered. (2) Allocation decisions should respect the individuality of patients and the par ticulars of individual cases as much as possible. (a) All candidates for treatment must be fully considered according to ethically appropriate criteria relating to medical need, as defined in Guideline 1. (b) When very substantial differences do not exist among potential recipients of treatment on the basis of these criteria, a \"first -come- first-served\" approach or some other equal opportunity mechanism should be employed to make final allocation decisions. (c) Though there are several ethically acceptable strategies for implementing these criteria, no single strategy is ethically mandated. Acceptable approaches include a three- tiered system, a minimal threshold approach, and a weighted formula. (3) Decision making mechanisms should be objective, flexible, and consistent to ensure that all patients are treated equally. The nature of the physician -patient relationship entails that physicians of patients competing for a scarce resource must remain advocates for their patients, and therefore should not make the actual allocation decisions. (4) Patients must be informed by their physicians of allocation criteria and procedures, as well as their chances of receiving access to scarce resources. This information should be in addition to all the customary information regarding the risks, benefits, and alternatives to any medical procedure. Patients denied access to resources have the right to be informed of the reasoning behind the decision. (5) The allocation procedures of institutions controlling scarce resources sho uld be disclosed to the public as well as subject to regular peer review from the medical profession. (6) Physicians should continue to look for innovative ways to increase the availability of and access to scarce medical resources so that, as much as poss ible, beneficial treatments can be provided to all who need them. (7) Physicians should accept their responsibility to promote awareness of the importance of an increase in the organ donor pool using all available means. CEJA Rep.

Our AMA supports seeking the cooperation of the National Advisory Council on Aging of the National Institutes of Health in recommending t o physicians, hospitals, institutes of scientific learning, universities, and most importantly the American people the necessity of autopsy for pathological correlation of the results of the immeasurable scientific advancements which have occurred in recen t years. Our AMA believes that the information garnered from such stringent scientific advancements and correlation, as well as coalitions, should be used in the most advantageous fashion; and that the conclusions obtained from such investigations should be widely shared with the medical and research community and should be interpreted by these groups with the utmost scrutiny and objectivity. 2. Our AMA: (a) supports the efforts of the Institute of Medicine and other national organizations in formulating na tional policies to modernize and promote the use of autopsy to meet present and future needs of society; (b) promotes the use of updated autopsy protocols for medical research, particularly in the areas of cancer, cardiovascular, occupational, and infectious diseases; (c) promotes the revision of standards of accreditation for medical undergraduate and graduate education programs to more fully integrate autopsy into the curriculum and require postmortems as part of medical educational programs; (d) encourages the use of a national computerized autopsy data bank to validate technological methods of diagnosis for medical research and to validate death certificates for public health and the benefit of the nation; (e) requests The Joint Commission to consider am ending the Accreditation Manual for Hospitals to require that the complete autopsy report be made part of the medical record within 30 days after the postmortem; (f) supports the formalization of methods of reimbursement for autopsy in order to identify po stmortem examinations as medical prerogatives and necessary medical procedures; (g) promotes programs of education for physicians to inform them of the value of autopsy for medical legal purposes and claims processing, to learn the likelihood of effects of disease on other family members, to establish the cause of death when death is unexplained or poorly understood, to establish the protective action of necropsy in litigation, and to inform the bereaved families of the benefits of autopsy; and (h) promotes the incorporation of updated postmortem examinations into risk management and quality assurance programs in hospitals. 3. Our AMA reaffirms the fundamental importance of the autopsy in any effective hospital quality assurance program and urges physicians and hospitals to increase the utilization of the autopsy so as to further advance the cause of medical education, research and quality assurance. 4. Our AMA representatives to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education ask that autopsy rates and student p articipation in autopsies continue to be monitored periodically and that the reasons that schools do or do not require attendance be collected. Our AMA will continue to work with other interested groups to increase the rate of autopsy attendance. 5. Our AMA requests that the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) and other accrediting bodies encourage the performance of autopsies to yield benchmark information for all managed care entities seeking accreditation. 6. Our AMA calls upon all third- party payers, including CMS, to provide adequate payment directly for autopsies, and encourages adequate reimbursement by all third- party payers for autopsies. 7. It is the policy of our AMA: (a) that the performance of autopsies constitutes the practice of me dicine; and (b) in conjunction with the pathology associations represented in the AMA House, to continue to implement all the recommendations regarding the effects of decreased utilization of autopsy on medical education and research, quality assurance programs, insurance claims processing, and cost containment. 8. Our AMA affirms the importance of autopsies and opposes the use of any financial incentives for physicians who acquire autopsy clearance. CCB/CLRPD Rep. 3, A- 14 Endorsement of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (2006) H -370.968 Our AMA endorses the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 2006 and urges all constituent state medical societies to work with donation stakeholders, including organ procurement organizations, eye banks, tissue banks, and other do nation -related organizations, toward persuading their state legislatures to adopt UAGA (2006) in place of earlier versions of the UAGA.

Res. 012, A -19 Organ Donation After Cardiac Death Code of Medical E- 6.1.2 Increasing the supply of organs available for transplant serves the interests of patients and the public and is in keeping wi th physicians' ethical obligation to contribute to the health of the public and to support access to medical care. Physicians should support innovative approaches to increasing the supply of organs for transplantation while balancing this obligation with their duty to protect th e interests of their individual patients. Organ donation after cardiac death is one approach being undertaken to make greater numbers of transplantable organs available. In what is known as \"controlled\" donation after cardiac death, a patient who has decid ed to forgo life -sustaining treatment (or the patient's authorized surrogate when the patient lacks decision -making capacity) may be offered the opportunity to discontinue life support under conditions that would permit the patient to become an organ donor by allowing organs to be removed promptly after death is pronounced. Organ retrieval under this protocol thus differs from usual procedures for cadaveric donation when the patient has died as a result of catastrophic illness or injury. Resolution: 521 (A- 22) Page 6 of 7 Donation after cardiac death raises a number of special ethical concerns, including how and when death is declared, potential conflicts of interest for physicians in managing the withdrawal of life support for a patient whose organs are to be retrieved for transplantation, and the use of a surrogate decision maker. In light of these concerns, physicians who participate in retrieving organs under a protocol of donation after cardiac death should observe the following safeguards: (a) Promote the development of and adhere to cli nical criteria for identifying prospective donors whose organs are reasonably likely to be suitable for transplantation. (b) Promote the development of and adhere to clear and specific institutional policies governing donation after cardiac death. (c) Avoi d actual or perceived conflicts of interest by: (i) ensuring that the health care professionals who provide care at the end of life are distinct from those who will particip ate in retrieving organs for transplant; (ii) ensuring that no member of the transplant team has any role in the decision to withdraw treatment or the pronouncement of death (d) Ensure that the decision to withdraw life -sustaining treatment is made prior to and independent of any offer of opportunity to donate organs (unless organ donati on is spontaneously broached by the patient or surrogate). (e) Obtain informed consent for organ donation from the patient (or surrogate), including consent specifically to the use of interventions intended not to benefit the patient but to preserve organs in order to improve the opportunity for successful transplantation. (f) Ensure that relevant standards for good clinical practice and palliative care are followed when implementing the decision to withdraw a life -sustaining intervention. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I,III,V Issued: 2016 Studying Financial Incentives for Cadaveric Organ Donation E-6.1.3 Physicians' ethical obligations to contribute to th e health of the public and to support access to medical care extend to participating in efforts to increase the supply of organs for transplantation. However, offering financial incentives for don ation raises ethical concerns about potential coercion, the voluntariness of decisions to donate, and possible adverse consequences, including reducing the rate of altruistic organ donation and unduly encouraging perception of the human body as a source of profit. These concerns merit further study to determine whether, overall, the benefits of financial incentives for organ donation outweigh their potential harms. It would be appropriate to carry out pilot studies among limited populations to investigate t he effects of such financial incentives for the purpose of examining and possibly revising current policies in the light of scientific evidence. Physicians who develop or participate in pilot studies of financial incentives to increase donation of cadaveric organs shoul d ensure that the study: (a) Is strictly limit ed to circumstances of voluntary cadaveric donation with an explicit prohibition of the selling of organs. (b) Is scientifically well designed and clearly defines measurable outcomes and time frames in a written protocol. (c) Has been developed in consultation with the population among whom it is to be carried out. (d) Has been reviewed and approved by an appropriate oversight body, such as an institutional review board, and is carried out in keeping with guidelines for ethical research. (e) Offers incentives of only modest value and at the lowest level that can reasonably be expected to increase organ donation. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I, III, V, VII, VIII, IX, Issued: 2016 Presumed Consent & Mandated Choice for Organs from Deceased Donors E-6.1.4 Organ transplantation offers hope for patients suffering end -stage organ failure. However, the supply of organs for transplantation is inadequate to meet the clinical need. Proposals to increase donation have included studying possible financial incentives for donation and changing the approach to consent for cadaveric donation through \"presumed con sent\" and \"mandated choice.\" Both presumed consent and mandated choice models contrast with the prevailing traditional model of voluntary consent to donation, in which prospective donors indicate their preferences, but the models raise distinct ethical con cerns. Under presumed consent, deceased individuals are presumed to be organ donors unless they have indicated their refusal to donate. Donations under presumed consent would be ethically appropriate only if it could be determined that individuals were aware of the presumption that they were willing to donate organs and if effective and easily accessible mechanisms for documenting and honoring refusals to donate had been established. Physicians could proceed with organ procurement based on presumed consent only after verifying that there was no documented prior refusal and that the family was not aware of any objection to donation by the deceased. Under mandated choice, individuals are required to express their preferences regarding donation at the time they execute a state -regulated task. Donations under mandated choice would be ethically appropriate only if an individual's choice was made on the basis of a meaningful exchange of information about organ donation in keeping with the principles of informed consent. Physicians could proceed with organ procurement based on mandated choice only after verifying that the individual's consent to donate was documented. These models merit further study to determine whether either or both can be implemented in a way that meets fundamental ethical criteria for informed consent and provides clear evidence that their benefits outweigh the ethical concerns. Physicians who propose to develop or participate in pilot studies of presumed consent or mandated choice should ensure that the study adheres to the following guidelines: (a) Is scientifically well designed and defines clear, measurable outcomes in a written protocol. (b) Has been developed in consultation with the population among whom it is to be carried out. Resolution: 521 (A- 22) Page 7 of 7 (c) Has been reviewed and approved by an appropriate oversight body and is carried out in keeping with guidelines for ethical research. Unless there are data that suggest a positive effect on donation, neither presumed consent nor mandated choice for cadaveric organ donation should be widely implemented. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I,III,V , Issued: 2016 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 522 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Encouraging Research of Testosterone and Pharmacological Therapies for Post-Menopausal Individuals with Decreased Libido Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, The most recent epidemiological research shows that approximately 40% of women 1 in the United States have sexual concerns, with 12% reporting distressing sexual problems 1; 2 and 3 4 Whereas, It is estimated that 1.2 billion women worldwide will be menopausal or 5 postmenopausal by the year 20302; and 6 7 Whereas, Sexual dysfunction in women can manifest in a number of ways, such as impaired 8 arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, pain with sexual activity, or Hypoactive Sexual Desire 9 Disorder (HSDD), which is defined as a deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for 10 sexual activity that may cause personal distress or interpersonal difficulty1,3; and 11 12 Whereas, Decreased libido in women is currently evaluated and treated using the 13 biopsychosocial model to account for biological, psychological, interpersonal, and sociocultural 14 factors, yet some women may have decreased libido that is refractory to standard treatments1,4; 15 and 16 17 Whereas, Testosterone plays a key role in maintaining libido in women, as evidenced by 18 numerous studies that show testosterone significantly improves various aspects of libido in 19 androgen- deficient, premenopausal, naturally post -menopausal, and surgically post - 20 menopausal women, and testosterone levels in postmenopausal women are 50% lower 21 compared to premenopausal women5-10; and 22 23 Whereas, A large meta -analysis, comprised of 43 articles, 36 randomized controlled trials, and 24 8,480 naturally or surgically post -menopausal women monitored for at least 12 weeks, indicated 25 that use of testosterone significantly increased various aspects o f sexual function such as 26 sexual frequency, sexual desire, pleasure, and orgasms, irrespective of concurrent use 27 estrogens, with no statistically significant increase in adverse events11-13; and 28 29 Whereas, A double- blinded, placebo- controlled clinical tria l with 53 postmenopausal women 30 with low libido who were given 10 milligrams of testosterone gel per day for three months, in 31 addition to their ongoing hormone replacement therapy, did not show any significant adverse 32 effects and showed a positive effect on psychological well -being6; and 33 34 Whereas, Doses of testosterone therapy that approximate physiologically premenopausal 35 concentrations in postmenopausal women have been associated with mild increase in acne, 36 body and facial hair growth but not with hair loss, clitoromegaly or changes in voice, but safety 37 data is not available beyond 24 months and further studies are needed to evaluate potential 38 long- term adverse effects13,14; and 39 Resolution: 522 (A-22) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, The effective dosage of testosterone for postmenopausal women has not been 1 elucidated, as a study of 71 surgically menopausal women suggested that positive change in 2 sexual function is achieved only with supraphysiologic dosing, while in 2019, a group of experts 3 from leading women's health societies worldwide published a consensus statement supporting 4 the benefit of testosterone therapy in doses that approximate physiologic concentrations in 5 premenopausal women14,15; and 6 7 Whereas, Clinical practice guidelines published by the Endocrine Society and the American 8 College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend a 3 to 6 month trial of testosterone 9 therapy for postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of HSDD, with close monitoring for 10 overuse and cessation of therapy if unresponsive after 6 months, but no current United States 11 Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved testosterone treatments exist for women with 12 HSDD16; and 13 14 Whereas, Compounded and off -label medications such as flibanserin and bremelanotide have 15 been prescribed for many years for both men and women who want to boost levels of sexual 16 desire, arousal, and orgasm; however, these two medications received FDA approval for use in 17 pre-menopausal women only, in 2015 and 2019 respectively17; and 18 19 Whereas, Although there are many FDA -approved testosterone preparations fo r men, and 20 internationally accepted use of testosterone products in women, none are currently approved for 21 women in the United States, further highlighting gender biases in healthcare and medical 22 research that are evident from the incomplete understanding of pathophysiology of women's 23 sexual response and its treatment13,18; and 24 25 Whereas, As evidenced by Code of Ethics 8.5 clause (i), the AMA supports \"research that 26 examines health care disparities, including research on the unique health needs of all gender s, 27 ethnic groups, and medically disadvantaged populations, and the development of quality 28 measures and resources to help reduce disparities;\" and 29 30 Whereas, Due to the lack of FDA -approved medications for treating decreased libido in 31 postmenopausal women, physicians are often reluctant to prescribe medications unless 32 prompted by the patient and are forced to resort to modifying androgen formulations created for 33 men, which can make dosing difficult when using these preparations for postmenopausal 34 women17,18; and 35 36 Whereas, Compounded or off -label medications like bremelanotide and flibanserin are 37 expensive for patients as they are not covered by insurance or available at discounted rates, 38 leaving many postmenopausal women to live with HSDD17; therefore be it 39 40 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association encourage expansion of research on the 41 use of testosterone therapy and other pharmacological interventions in treatment of decreased 42 libido in postmenopausal individuals.

Differences in treatment that are not directly related to differences in individual patients' clinical needs or preferences constitute inappropriate variations in health care. Such variations may contribute to health outcomes that are considerably worse in members of some populations than those of members of majority populations. This represents a significant challenge for physicians, who ethically are called on to provide the same quality of care to all patients without regard to medically irrelevant personal characteristics. To fulfill this professional obligation in their individual practices physicians should: (a) Provide care that meets patient needs and respects patient preferences. (b) Avoid stereotyping patients. (c) Examine their own practices to ensure that inappropriate considerations about race, gender identify, sexual orientation, sociodemographic factors, or other nonclinical factors, do not affect clinical judgment. (d) Work to eliminate biased behavior toward patients by other health care professionals and staff who come into contact with patients. (e) Encourage shared decision making. (f) Cultivate effective communication and trust by seeking to better understand factors that can influence patients' health care decisions, such as cultural traditions, health beliefs and health literacy, language or other barriers to communication and fears or misperceptions about the health care system. The medical profession has an ethical responsibility to: Resolution: 522 (A-22) Page 4 of 4 (g) Help increase awareness of health care disparities. (h) Strive to increase the diversity of the physician workforce as a step toward reducing health care disparities. (i) Support research that ex amines health care disparities, including research on the unique health needs of all genders, ethnic groups, and medically disadvantaged populations, and the development of quality measures and resources to help reduce disparities. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I,IV,VII,VIII,IX Principles for the Implementation of clinical practice guidelines at the Local/State/Regional Level H-410.980 Our AMA has adopted the following principles regarding the implementation of clinical practice guidelines at the local/state/regional level: (1) Rel evant physician organizations and interested physicians shall have an opportunity for input/comment on all issues related to the local/state/regional implementation of clinical practice guidelines, including: issue identification; issue refinement, identif ication of relevant clinical practice guidelines, evaluation of clinical practice guidelines, selection and modification of clinical practice guidelines, implementation of clinical practice guidelines, evaluation of impact of implementation of clinical pra ctice guidelines, periodic review of clinical practice guideline recommendations, and justifications for departure from clinical practice guidelines.. (2) Effective mechanisms shall be established to ensure opportunity for appropriate input by relevant physician organizations and interested physicians on all issues related to the local/state/regional implementation of clinical practice guidelines, including: effective physician notice prior to implementation, with adequate opportunity for comment; and an adequate phase- in period prior to implementation for educational purposes. (3) clinical practice guidelines that are selected for implementation at the local/state/regional level shall be limited to practice parameters that conform to established principles, including relevant AMA policy on practice parameters. (4) Prioritization of issues for local/state/regional implementation of clinical practice guidelines shall be based on various factors, including: availability of relevant and high quality practice par ameter(s), significant variation in practice and/or outcomes, prevalence of disease/illness, quality considerations, resource consumption/cost issues, and professional liability considerations. (5) clinical practice guidelines shall be used in a manner that is consistent with AMA policy and with their sponsors' explanations of the appropriate uses of their clinical practice guidelines, including their disclaimers to prevent inappropriate use. (6) clinical practice guidelines shall be adapted at the local/st ate/regional level, as appropriate, to account for local/state/regional factors, including demographic variations, patient case mix, availability of resources, and relevant scientific and clinical information. (7) clinical practice guidelines implemented at the local/state/regional level shall acknowledge the ability of physicians to depart from the recommendations in clinical practice guidelines, when appropriate, in the care of individual patients. (8) The AMA and other relevant physician organizations should develop principles to assist physicians in appropriate documentation of their adherence to, or appropriate departure from, clinical practice guidelines implemented at the local/state/regional level. (9) clinical practice guidelines, with adequate expl anation of their intended purpose(s) and uses other than patient care, shall be widely disseminated to physicians who will be impacted by the clinical practice guidelines. (10) Information on the impact of clinical practice guidelines at the local/state/regional level shall be collected and reported by appropriate medical organizations. CMS Rep. D, A -93; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 10, A -03; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 4, A -13 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 523 (A-22) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Improving Research Standards, Approval Processes, and Post -Market Surveillance Standards for Medical Devices Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, Thirty -two million Americans, or 1 in 10, have at least one medical device 1; and 1 2 Whereas, A medical device is defined within the Food Drug & Cosmetic Act as \"... an 3 instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other 4 similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory...intended for use in the 5 diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of 6 disease..., or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body...and which does not 7 achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action...[and] is not dependent 8 upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes\"2; and 9 10 Whereas, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has three regulatory classifications for 11 medical devices: Class I (minimal potential harm), Class II (moderate risk of harm), and Class III 12 (potential high risk of illness or injury)2-3; and 13 14 Whereas, The FDA approves the safety and efficacy of medical devices through three major 15 processes, one of which is Premarket Notification (PMN), also known as the 510(k) approval 16 pathway or 510(k) exception4; and 17 18 Whereas, The 510(k) approval pathway \"is intended to support the FDA's public health mission 19 by meeting two important goals: making available to consumers devices that are safe and 20 effective, and fostering innovation in the medical device industry\"5; and 21 22 Whereas, A Class II device can be cleared to market by submission and FDA review through 23 the 510(k) exception if that device is substantially equivalent to a \"predicate device\", even if the 24 \"predicate device\" had not been recently tested4,6,7; and 25 26 Whereas, Using predicate devices for safety and efficacy standards may not accurately reflect 27 modern performance and safety standards8; and 28 29 Whereas, A number of devices approved via the 510(k) exception were later found to be less 30 efficacious than anticipated or even unsafe in their indicated usage, including transvaginal and 31 surgical meshes, metal -on-metal hip implants, and bioresorbable vascular scaffolds9-13; and 32 33 Whereas, Medical devices cleared through the 510(k) exception comprise more than two-thirds 34 of the products recalled by the FDA for safety concerns14; and 35 36 Whereas, There were attempts to improve the 510(k) pathway via the Safety of Untested and 37 New Devices Act of 2012 (SOUND Device Act) and again in 2019, but predicate devices have 38 remained the standard to evaluate device safety and efficacy15,16; and 39 Resolution: 523 (A- 22) Page 2 of 8 Whereas, One way to improve medical device standards is to mandate that 510(k) devices 1 demonstrate improved safety and effectiveness compared to marketed devices for the same 2 clinical purpose16; and 3 4 Whereas, Post -market surveillance is a critical component of medical device safety and 5 effectiveness because: 1) adverse events may not become apparent until the device has been 6 widely disseminated, and 2) increased emphasis on priority reviews and shortening premarket 7 approval times has decreased the standard of medical device approvals16,17; and 8 9 Whereas, Current post -market surveillance only identifies a small fraction of adverse events 10 because it is based on mandated reports and passive surveillance16; and 11 12 Whereas, Post -market surveillance can be improved by giving conditional approval and 13 collecting data, including confirmatory trials16; 14 15 Whereas, Curr ent policy (H -100.992) only outlines the AMA's position on approval processes for 16 biological drugs, but does not cover medical devices; therefore be it 17 18 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support improvements to the Food and 19 Drug Administration 510(k) exception to ensure the safety and efficacy of medical devices to: (a) 20 make more stringent guidelines for which devices can qualify for the 510(k) exceptions; (b) 21 mandate all 510(k) devices demonstrate equivalent or improved safety and effectiveness 22 compared to market devices for the same clinical purpose (New HOD Policy) ; and be it further 23 24 RESOLVED, That our AMA support stronger post -market surveillance requirements of medical 25 devices, including but not limited to (a): conditional approval of devices until sufficient post - 26 market surveillance data determining device safety can be collected, followed by confirmatory 27 trials, and (b) a publicly available summary of medical devices approved under expedited 28 programs along with associated clinical trial data and list of reported adverse events (New HOD 29 Policy) ; and be it further 30 31 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -100.992 to include medical devices by addition to 32 read as follows: 33 34 FDA, H- 100.992 35 1. Our AMA reaffirms its support for the principles that: 36 (a) an FDA decision to approve a new drug or medical device, to withdraw a drug o r 37 medical device's approval, or to change the indications for use of a drug or medical 38 device must be based on sound scientific and medical evidence derived from 39 controlled t rials, real -world data (RWD) fit for regulatory purpose, and/or postmarket 40 incident reports as provided by statute; 41 (b) this evidence should be evaluated by the FDA, in consultation with its Advisory 42 Committees and expert extramural advisory bodies; and 43 (c) any risk/benefit analysis or relative safety or efficacy judgments should not be 44 grounds for limiting access to or indications for use of a drug or medical device unless 45 the weight of the evidence from clinical trials, RWD fit for regulatory purpose, and post 46 market reports shows that the drug or medical device is unsafe and/or ineffective for 47 its labeled indications.

Implantable devices can also enable physicians to identify patients rapidly and expedite access to patients' medical records. Devices that transmit patient information wirelessly to remote receiving stations can offer convenience for both patients and physicians, enhance the efficiency and quality of care, and promote increased access to care, but also raise concerns about safety and the confidentiality of patient information. Individually, physicians who employ remote sensing and monitoring devices in providing patient care should: Resolution: 523 (A-22) Page 4 of 8 (a) Determine whether using one or more such devices is appropriate in light of individual patients' medical needs and circumstances, including patients' ability to use the chosen device appropriately. (b) Explain how the device(s) will be used in the patient's care and what will be expected of the patient in using the technology, and disclose any limitations, risks, or medical uncertainties associated with the device(s) and data transmission. (c) Obtain the patient's or surrogate's informed consent before implementing the device in treatment. Collectively, physicians should: (d) Support research into the safety, efficacy, and possible non-medical uses of remote sensing and monitoring devices, including devic es intended to transmit biometric data and implantable radio frequency ID devices. (e) Advocate for appropriate oversight of remote sensing and monitoring devices. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I, III, V Issued: 2016 Reprocessing of Single -Use Medic al Devices H -480.959 1. Our AMA: (a) supports the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance titled \"Enforcement Priorities for Single- Use Devices Reprocessed by Third Parties and Hospitals\" that was issued on August 2, 2000; (b) supports the development of device- specific standards for the reuse and reprocessing of single- use medical devices involving all appropriate medical and professional organizations and the medical device industry; (c) encourages increased research by the appropriate organizations and federal agencies into the safety and efficacy of reprocessed single-use medical devices; and (d) supports the proper reporting of all medical device failures to the FDA so that surveillance of adverse events can be improved. 2. Our AMA strongly opposes any rules or regulations regarding the repair or refurbishment of medical tools, equipment, and instruments that are not based on objective scientific data. CSA Rep. 3, I -00; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -10; Appended: Res. 217, I -17 Required Reporting of Adverse Events 8.8 Physicians' professional commitment to advance scientific knowledge and make relevant information available to patients, colleagues, and the public carries with it the responsibility to report suspected adverse events resulting from the use of a drug or medical device. Mandated pre- and post -marketing studies provide basic safeguards for public health but are inherently limited in their ability to detect rare or unexpected consequences of use of a drug or medical device. Thus spontaneous reports of adverse events, especially rare or delayed effects or effects in vulnerable populations are irreplaceable as a source of information about the safety of drugs and devices. As the professionals who prescribe and monitor the use of drugs and medi cal devices, physicians are best positioned to observe and communicate about adverse events. Cases in which there is clearly a causal relationship between use of a drug/device and an adverse event, especially a serious event, will be rare. Physicians need not be certain that there is such an event, or even that there is a reasonable likelihood of a causal relationship, to suspect that an adverse event has occurred. A physician who suspects that an adverse reaction to a drug or medical device has occurred ha s an ethical responsibility to: (a) Communicate that information to the professional community through established reporting mechanisms. (b) Promptly report serious adverse events requiring hospitalization, death, or medical or surgical intervention to the appropriate regulatory agency. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I, V, VII Issued: 2016 Use of Wireless Radio -Frequency Devices in Hospitals H-215.972 Our AMA encourages: (1) collaborative efforts of the Food and Drug Administration, American Hospital Association, American Society for Healthcare Engineering, Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, Emergency Care Research Institute, and other appropriate organizations to develop consistent guidelines for the use of wireless radio-freq uency transmitters (e.g., cellular telephones, two-way radios) in hospitals and standards for medical equipment and device manufacturers to ensure electromagnetic compatibility between radio-frequency transmitters and medical devices; and that our AMA work with these organizations to increase awareness among physicians and patients about electromagnetic compatibility and electromagnetic interference in hospital environments; (2) hospital administrators to work with their clinical/biomedical engineering staf f, safety committees, and other appropriate personnel to adopt and implement informed policies and procedures for (a) managing the use of wireless radio-frequency sources in the hospital, particularly in critical patient care areas; (b) educating staff, patients, and visitors about risks of electromagnetic interference (EMI); (c) reporting actual or suspected EMI problems; and (d) testing medical devices for susceptibility to EMI when electromagnetic compatibility information is lacking; (3) medical device and electronic product manufacturers to design and test their products in conformance with current electromagnetic immunity standards and inform users about possible symptoms of electromagnetic interference (EMI). If a possibility of EMI problems affecting medical devices exists, steps should be taken to ensure that all sources of electromagnetic energy are kept at sufficient distance; and (4) physicians to become knowledgeable about electromagnetic compatibility and electromagnetic interference (EMI), recognize EMI as a potential problem in hospital environments, and report suspected EMI problems to the Food and Drug Administration MedWatch program or appropriate hospital personnel. CSA Rep 4, A -00; Reaffirmed: CSAPH A-20 Resolution: 523 (A-22) Page 5 of 8 Medical Device Safety and Physician Responsibility H-480.972 The AMA supports: (1) the premise that medical device manufacturers are ultimately responsible for conducting the necessary testing, research and clinical investigation and scientifically proving the safety and efficacy of medical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration; and (2) conclusive study and development of Center for Devices and Radiological Health/Office of Science and Technology recommendations regarding safety of ar ticle surveillance and other potentially harmful electronic devices with respect to pacemaker use.

Our AMA will monitor market developments in mobile health (mHeal th), including the development and uptake of mHealth apps, in order to identify developing consensus that provides opportunities for AMA involvement. 2. Our AMA will continue to engage with stakeholders to identify relevant guiding principles to promote a vibrant, useful and trustworthy mHealth market. 3. Our AMA will make an effort to educate physicians on mHealth apps that can be used to facilitate patient communication, advice, and clinical decision support, as well as resources that can assist physician s in becoming familiar with mHealth apps that are clinically useful and evidence based. 4. Our AMA will develop and publicly disseminate a list of best practices guiding the development and use of mobile medical applications. 5. Our AMA encourages further research integrating mobile devices into clinical care, particularly to address challenges of reducing work burden while maintaining clinical autonomy for residents and fellows. 6. Our AMA will collaborate with the Liaison Committee on Medical Education an d Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to develop germane policies, especially with consideration of potential financial burden and personal privacy of trainees, to ensure more uniform regulation for use of mobile devices in medical educati on and clinical training. 7. Our AMA encourages medical schools and residency programs to educate all trainees on proper hygiene and professional guidelines for using personal mobile devices in clinical environments. CSAPH Rep. 5, A -14; Appended: Res. 201, A -15; Appended: Res. 305, I -16; Modified: Res. 903, I -19 Interoperability of Medical Devices H -480.953 Our AMA believes that intercommunication and interoperability of electronic medical devices could lead to important advances in patient safety and patient care, and that the standards and protocols to allow such seamless intercommunication should be developed fully with these advances in mind. Our AMA also recognizes that, as in all technological advances, interoperability poses safety and medico- legal challenges as well. The development of standards and production of interoperable equipment protocols should strike the proper balance to achieve optimum patient safety, efficiency, and outcome benefit while preserving incentives to ensure continuing innov ation. Res. 519, A -09; Reaffirmation: I -15; Reaffirmed: Rep. 05, I -16 Medical Device \"Use Before Dates\" D -480.977 Our AMA will encourage the US Food and Drug Administration to clearly define and interpret the definition and meaning of the \"use before date\" for medical devices.

BOT Action in response to referred for decision Res. 502, A -06; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 01, A -16 Protecting Social Media Users by Updating FDA Guidelin es D -105.995 Our AMA will lobby the Food and Drug Administration to: (1) update regulations to ensure closer regulation of paid endorsements of drugs or medical devices by individuals on social media; and (2) develop guidelines to ensure that compensated parties on soc ial media websites provide information that includes the risks and benefits of specific drugs or medical devices and off -use prescribing in every related social media communication in a manner consistent with advertisement guidelines on traditional media f orms. Res. 209, I -15 Resolution: 523 (A- 22) Page 6 of 8 Patient Access to Treatments Prescribed by Their Physicians H -120.988 1. Our AMA confirms its strong support for the autonomous clinical decision-making authority of a physician and that a physician may lawfully use an FDA approved drug product or medical device for an off -label indication when such use is based upon sound scientific evidence or sound medical opinion; and affirms the position that, when the prescription of a drug or use of a device represents safe and effective therapy, third party payers, including Medicare, should consider the intervention as clinically appropriate medical care, irrespective of labeling, should fulfill their obligation to their beneficiaries by covering such therapy, and be required to cover appropriate 'off -label' uses of drugs on their formulary. 2. Our AMA strongly supports the important need for physicians to have access to accurate and unbiased information about off -label uses of drugs and devices, while ensuring that manufacturer -sponsored pro motions remain under FDA regulation. 3. Our AMA supports the dissemination of generally available information about off -label uses by manufacturers to physicians. Such information should be independently derived, peer reviewed, scientifically sound, and tr uthful and not misleading. The information should be provided in its entirety, not be edited or altered by the manufacturer, and be clearly distinguished and not appended to manufacturer -sponsored materials. Such information may comprise journal articles, books, book chapters, or clinical practice guidelines. Books or book chapters should not focus on any particular drug. Dissemination of information by manufacturers to physicians about off -label uses should be accompanied by the approved product labeling and disclosures regarding the lack of FDA approval for such uses, and disclosure of the source of any financial support or author financial conflicts. 4. Physicians have the responsibility to interpret and put into context information received from any sour ce, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, before making clinical decisions (e.g., prescribing a drug for an off -label use). 5. Our AMA strongly supports the addition to FDA -approved labeling those uses of drugs for which safety and efficacy have been dem onstrated. 6. Our AMA supports the continued authorization, implementation, and coordination of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act.

Res. 610, I -04, Modified: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -14 Availability of Professionals for Research H -460.982 (1) In its determination of personnel and training needs, major public and private research foundations, including the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, should consider the future research opportunities in the biomedical sciences as well as the marketplace demand for new researchers. (2) The number of physicians in research training programs should be increased by expanding research opportunities during medical school, through the use of short -term training grants and through the establishment of a cooperative network of research clerkships for students attending less research- intensive schools. Participation in research training programs should be increased by providing financial incentives for research centers, academic physicians, and medical students. (3) The current annual production of PhDs trained in the biomedical sciences should be maintained. (4) The numbers of nurses, dentists, and other health professionals in research training programs should be increased. (5) Members of the industrial community should increase their philanthropic financial support to the nation's biomedical research enterprise. Concentration of support on the training of young investigators should be a major thrust of increased Resolution: 523 (A-22) Page 7 of 8 funding. The pharmaceutical and medical device industries should increase substantially their intr amural and extramural commitments to meeting postdoctoral training needs. A system of matching grants should be encouraged in which private industry would supplement the National Institutes of Health and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration sponsored Career Development Awards, the National Research Service Awards and other sources of support. (6) Philanthropic foundations and voluntary health agencies should continue their work in the area of training and funding new investigators. Private foundations and other private organizations should increase their funding for clinical research faculty positions. (7) The National Institutes of Health and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration should modify the renewal grant application system by lengthening the funding period for grants that have received high priority scores through peer review. (8) The support of clinical research faculty from the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Support Grants (institutional grants) should be increased from its current one percent. (9) The academic medical center, which provides the multidisciplinary research environment for the basic and clinical research faculty, should be regarded as a vital medical resource and be assured adequate funding in recognition of the research costs incurred.

NN, A -87, Reaffirmed: Sunset Report, I -97, Reaffirmed: CSA 13, I -99, Reaffirmed: CME Rep. 4, I-08, Modified: Res. 305, A -12, Modified: CME Rep. 2, A -12 Comparative Effectiveness R esearch H -460.909 A. Value. Value can be thought of as the best balance between benefits and costs, and better value as improved clinical outcomes, quality, and/or patient satisfaction per dollar spent. Improving value in the US health care system will require both clinical and cost information. Quality comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER) will improve health care value by enhancing physician clinical judgment and fostering the delivery of patient -centered care. B. Independence. A federally sponsored CER entity should be an objective, independent authority that produces valid, scientifically rigorous research. C. Stable Funding. The entity should have secure and sufficient funding in order to maintain the necessary infrastructure and resour ces to produce quality CER. Funding source(s) must safeguard the independence of a federally sponsored CER entity. D. Rigorous Scientifically Sound Methodology. CER should be conducted using rigorous scientific methods to ensure that conclusions from such research are evidence-based and valid for the population studied. The primary responsibility for the conduct of CER and selection of CER methodologies must rest with physicians and researchers. E. Transparent Process. The processes for setting research priorities, establishing accepted methodologies, selecting researchers or research organizations, and disseminating findings must be transparent and provide physicians and researchers a central and significant role. F. Significant Patient and Physician Oversight Role. The oversight body of the CER entity must provide patients, physicians (MD, DO), including clinical practice physicians, and independent scientific researchers with substantial representation and a central decision-making role(s). Both physicians and patients are uniquely motivated to provide/receive quality care while maximizing value. G. Conflicts of Interest Disclosed and Minimized. All conflicts of interest must be disclosed, and safeguards developed to minimize actual, potential and perceived conflicts of interest to ensure that stakeholders with such conflicts of interest do not undermine the integrity and legitimacy of the research findings and conclusions. H. Scope of Research. CER should include long term and short -term assessments of diagnostic and treatment modalities for a given disease or condition in a defined population of patients. Diagnostic and treatment modalities should include drugs, biologics, imaging and laboratory tests, medical devices, health services, or combinations. It should not be limited to new treatments. In addition, the findings should be re- evaluated periodically, as needed, based on the development of new alternatives and the emergence of new safety or efficacy data. The priority areas of CER should be on hig h volume, high cost diagnosis, treatment, and health services for which there is significant variation in practice. Research priorities and methodology should factor in any systematic variations in disease prevalence or response across groups by race, ethnicity, gender, age, geography, and economic status. I. Dissemination of Research. The CER entity must work with health care professionals and health care professional organizations to effectively disseminate the results in a timely manner by significantly expanding dissemination capacity and intensifying efforts to communicate to physicians utilizing a variety of strategies and methods. All research findings must be readily and easily accessible to physicians as well as the public without limits imposed by the federally supported CER entity. The highest priority should be placed on targeting health care professionals and their organizations to ensure rapid dissemination to those who develop diagnostic and treatment plans. J. Coverage and Payment. The CER entity must not have a role in making or recommending coverage or payment decisions for payers. K. Patient Variation and Physician Discretion. Physician discretion in the treatment of individual patients remains central to the practice of medicine. CER evi dence cannot adequately address the wide array of patients with their unique clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and certain genetic characteristics. In addition, patient autonomy and choice may play a significant role in both CER findings and diagnos tic/treatment planning in the clinical setting. As a result, sufficient information should be made available on the limitations and exceptions of CER studies so that physicians who are making individualized treatment plans will be able to differentiate pat ients to whom the study findings apply from those for whom the study is not representative.

Our AMA reaffirms its support for the principles that: (a) an FDA decision to approve a new drug, to withdraw a drug's approval, or to change the indications for use of a drug must be based on sound scientific and medical evidence derived from controlled trials, real -world data (RWD) fit for regulatory purpose, and/or postmarket incident reports as provided by statute; (b) this evidence should be evaluated by the FDA, in consultation with its Advisory Committees and expert extramural advisory bodies; and (c) any risk/benefit analysis or relative safety or efficacy judgments should not be grounds for limiting access to or indications for use of a drug unless the weight of the evidence from clinical trials, RWD fit for regulatory purpose, and postmarket reports shows that the drug is unsafe and/or ineffective for its labeled indications. 2. The AMA believes that social and economic concerns and disputes per se should not be permitted to play a significant part in the FDA's decision- making process in the cou rse of FDA devising either general or product specific drug regulation. 3. It is the position of our AMA that the Food and Drug Administration should not permit political considerations or conflicts of interest to overrule scientific evidence in making pol icy decisions; and our AMA urges the current administration and all future administrations to consider our best and brightest scientists for positions on advisory committees and councils regardless of their political affiliation and voting history.

and 2 3 Whereas, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that non- 4 athletic TBIs affect diverse patient populations2,3; and 5 6 Whereas, 64.4% of TBIs are non -sports related , caused by activities of daily living, traffic or 7 work -related accidents, falls, motor vehicle crashes, recreation, acts of interpersonal violence, 8 and blast injuries 4,5,6; and 9 10 Whereas, Studies show that adult patients with non- athletic TBIs experience increased mortality 11 rates and long- term consequences such as increased incidence of post -concussion symptoms7; 12 and 13 14 Whereas, A study by the Center for Disease Control suggests that rates of pediatric 15 hospitalization and death are higher in non -athletes com pared to that of athletic brain injuries 16 due to a lack of early intervention7,8,9,10; and 17 18 Whereas, Approximately 48% of patients are lost to follow -up three months after hospitalization 19 for TBIs11; and 20 21 Whereas, Almost 88% victims of domestic violence survivors suffer TBIs, which can lead to 22 devastating and permanent physical, behavioral, and cognitive consequences12; and 23 24 Whereas, Due to a lack of universally accepted diagnostic criteria, clinicians rely on likely 25 mechanism of injury for diagnosis of TBI, which may delay care for victims of domestic violence 26 who often do not report their injuries12,13; and 27 28 Whereas, Victims of domestic violence often face unstable social situations, homelessness, and 29 impaired cognitive states as a result of years of repeated brain injury, thus when they do seek 30 medical care for their injuries, they experience added barriers to follow -up care, such as 31 transportation, communication, and education12; and 32 33 Whereas, 89% of women experiencing an intimate partner violence- related TBI reported post - 34 concussion syndrome, and early intervention for victims of domestic violence with mild TBIs are 35 correlated with a reduction in post -concussive and other residual symptoms14,15; and 36 Whereas, Due to longer time to admission for acute -injury admissions, ethnic minorities, 37 including those with history of homelessness and incarceration, experience inequity in post - 38 Resolution: 524 (A- 22) Page 2 of 5 injury rehabilitation, and are less likely to obtain post -injury hospital admission compared to 1 Non-Hispanic White patients16,17; and 2 3 Whereas, When the severity of injury may not differ significantly between patients of color and 4 white patients, there are non- medical factors including systemic and environmental barriers 5 contributing to the delay in access to acute TBI -rehabilitation in patients of color16; and 6 7 Whereas, Patients with non- athletic TBI are more likely to seek treatment via primary care 8 providers13; and 9 10 Whereas, Over the past year, only 12- 23% of adult female victims report to seeking treatment 11 from their primary care physician for their injuries and subsequent morbidity after experiencing 12 intimate partner violence18; and 13 14 Whereas, Patients who access primary care physicians for post -TBI care may be less likely to 15 receive equitable treatment compared to athletes who have access to athletic trainers, coaches, 16 and specialty physicians with return- to-play models of treatment 19,20; and 17 18 Whereas, Primary care providers who were trained by the CDC's Heads Up program on TBIs 19 were able to improve their patients ' rate of treatment success and symptom recovery13,21; and 20 21 Whereas, Providing patients with information emphasizing the importance of post -injury care, 22 encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, and equipping primary physicians with the tools 23 needed for appropriate treatment and referral services improves patients' functional recovery 24 and treatment success22; and 25 26 Whereas, The treatment tools provided to primary care physicians include screening for 27 neurosurgical emergencies or cervical spine injury and targeted treatment for specific symptoms 28 of post -injury headaches, sleep disturbance, and psychological distress through medication and 29 environmental and behavioral changes13,23; and 30 31 Whereas, The AMA recognizes the need for TBI prevention and remediation of post -injury 32 morbidities (H -470.954); and 33 34 Whereas, Current AMA policy does not emphasize ethnic minorities or victims of domestic 35 violence in existing policy for TBIs, nor does it address post -injury rehabilitation in non- athletic 36 injuries; therefore be it 37 38 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association recognize disparities in the care for 39 traumatic brain injuries, and acknowledge non- athletic traumatic brain injuries as a significant 40 cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly for ethnic minorities and victims of domestic 41 violence; (New HOD Policy) and be it further 42 43 RESOLVED, That our AMA support increased access to traumatic brain injury resources in 44 primary care settings which advocate for early intervention, encourage follow- up retention of 45 patients for post -injury rehabilitation, and improved patient quality of life.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY H-470.954 Reduction of Sports Related Injury and Concussion 1. Our AMA will: (a) work with appropriate agencies and organizations to promote awareness of programs to reduce concussion and other sports -related injuries across the lifespan; and (b) promote awareness that even mild cases of traumatic brain injury may have serious and prolonged consequences. 2. Our AMA supports the adoption of evidence-based, age- specific guidelines on the evaluation and management of concussion in all athletes for use by physicians, other health professionals, and athletic organizations. Resolution: 524 (A-22) Page 4 of 5 3. Our AMA will work with appropriate state and specialty medical societies to enhance opportunities for continuing education regar ding professional guidelines and other clinical resources to enhance the ability of physicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage concussions and other sports -related injuries. 4. Our AMA urges appropriate agencies and organizations to support research to: ( a) assess the short - and long-term cognitive, emotional, behavioral, neurobiological, and neuropathological consequences of concussions and repetitive head impacts over the life span; (b) identify determinants of concussion and other sports -related injuries in pediatric and adult athletes, including how injury thresholds are modified by the number of and time interval between head impacts and concussions; (c) develop and evaluate effective risk reduction measures to prevent or reduce sports - related injuries and concussions and their sequelae across the lifespan; and (d) develop objective biomarkers to improve the identification, management, and prognosis of athletes suffering from concussion to reduce the dependence on self -reporting and inform evidence-base d, age-specific guidelines for these patients. 5. Our AMA supports research into the detection, causes, and prevention of injuries along the continuum from subconcussive head impacts to conditions such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CSAPH Rep. 3, A -15; Appended: Res. 905, I -16 H-470.984 Brain Injury in Boxing The AMA supports the following series of steps designed to protect amateur and professional boxers from injuries: (1) Encourage the establishment of a \"National Registry of Boxers\" for al l amateur and professional boxers, including \"sparring mates,\" in the country. The proposed functions of a computer -based central registry would be to record the results of all licensed bouts, including technical knockouts, knockouts, and other boxing injuries, and to compile injury and win/loss records for individual boxers. (2) Recommend to all boxing jurisdictions that the ring physician should be authorized to stop any bout in progress, at any time, to examine a contestant and, when indicated, to terminate a bout that might, in his opinion, result in serious injury for either contestant. (3) Urge state and local commissions to conduct frequent medical training seminars for all ring personnel. (4) Recommend to all boxing jurisdictions that no amateur or professional boxing bout should be permitted unless: (a) the contest is held in an area where adequate neurosurgical facilities are immediately available for skilled emergency treatment of an injured boxer; (b) a portable resuscitator with oxygen equipment and appropriate endotracheal tubes are available at ringside; and (c) a comprehensive evacuation plan for the removal of any seriously injured boxer to hospital facilities is ready. (5) Inform state legislatures that unsupervised boxing competition between unlicensed boxers in \"tough man\" contests is a most dangerous practice that may result in serious injury or death to contestants, and should be condemned. (6) Urge state and local boxing commissions to mandate the use of safety equipment, such as plastic safety mats and padded cornerposts, and to encourage continued development of safety equipment. (7) Urge state and local boxing commissions to extend all safety measures to sparring partners. (8) Urge state and local boxing commissions to upgrade, standardize and strictly enforce medical evaluations for boxers. CSA Rep. F, A CSA Rep. 3, A -99; Rep. 1, A -09; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 3, A -15 H-515.965 Family and Intimate Partner Violence (1) Our AMA believes that all forms of family and intimate partner violence (IPV) are major public health issues and urges the profession, both individually and collectively, to work with other inter ested parties to prevent such violence and to address the needs of survivors. Physicians have a major role in lessening the prevalence, scope and severity of child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse, all of which fall under the rubric of family violence. To support physicians in practice, our AMA will continue to campaign against family violence and remains open to working with all interested parties to address violence in US society. (2) Our AMA believes that all physicians should be trained in issues of family and intimate partner violence through undergraduate and graduate medical education as well as continuing professional development. The AMA, working with state, county and specialty medical societies as well as academic medical centers and other appropriate groups such as the Association of American Medical Colleges, should develop and disseminate model curricula on violence for incorporation into undergraduate and graduate medical education, and all parties should work for the rapid distribution and adoption of such curricula. These curricula should include coverage of the diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse and provide training on interviewing techniques, risk assessment, safety planning, and procedures for linking with resources to assist survivors. Our AMA supports the inclusion of questions on family violence issues on licensure and certification tests. (3) The prevalence of family violence is sufficiently high and its ongoing character is such that physicians, particularly physicians providing primary care, will encounter survivors on a regular basis. Persons in clinical settings are more likely to have experienced intimate partner and family violence t han non-clinical populations. Thus, to improve clinical services as well as the public health, our AMA encourages physicians to: (a) Routinely inquire about the family violence histories of their patients as this knowledge is essential for effective diagnosis and care; (b) Upon identifying patients currently experiencing abuse or threats from intimates, assess and discuss safety issues with the patient before he or she leaves the office, working with the patient to develop a safety or exit plan for use in an emergency Resolution: 524 (A-22) Page 5 of 5 situation and making appropriate referrals to address intervention and safety needs as a matter of course; (c) After diagnosing a violence-related problem, refer patients to appropriate medical or health care professionals and/or community -based trauma-specific resources as soon as possible; (d) Have written lists of resources available for survivors of violence, providing information on such matters as emergency shelter, medical assistance, mental health services, protective services and legal aid; (e) Screen patients for psychiatric sequelae of violence and make appropriate referrals for these conditions upon identifying a history of family or other interpersonal violence; (f) Become aware of local resources and referral sources that have exper tise in dealing with trauma from IPV; (g) Be alert to men presenting with injuries suffered as a result of intimate violence because these men may require intervention as either survivors or abusers themselves; (h) Give due validation to the experience of IPV and of observed symptomatology as possible sequelae; (i) Record a patient's IPV history, observed traumata potentially linked to IPV, and referrals made; (j) Become involved in appropriate local programs designed to prevent violence and its effects at the community level. (4) Within the larger community, our AMA: (a) Urges hospitals, community mental health agencies, and other helping professions to develop appropriate interventions for all survivors of intimate violence. Such interventions might include individual and group counseling efforts, support groups, and shelters. (b) Believes it is critically important that programs be available for survivors and perpetrators of intimate violence. (c) Believes that state and county medical societies should convene or join state and local health departments, criminal justice and social service agencies, and local school boards to collaborate in the development and support of violence control and prevention activities. (5) With respect to issues of reporting, our AMA strongly supports mandatory reporting of suspected or actual child maltreatment and urges state societies to support legislation mandating physician reporting of elderly abuse in states where such legislation does not currently exist. At the same time, our AMA oppose the adoption of mandatory reporting laws for physicians treating competent, non-elderly adult survivors of intimate partner violence if the required reports identify survivors. Such laws violate basic tenets of medical ethics. If and where mandatory reporting statutes dealing with competent adults are adopted, the AMA believes the laws must incorporate provisions that: (a) do not require the inclusion of survivors' identities; (b) allow competent adult survivors to opt out of the reporting system if identifiers are required; (c) provide that reports be made to public health agencies for surveillance purposes only; (d) contain a sunset mechanism; and (e) evaluate the efficacy of those laws. State societies are encouraged to ensure that all mandatory reporting laws contain adequate protections for the reporting physician and to educate physicians on the particulars of the laws in their states. (6) Substance abuse and family violence are clearly connected. For this reason, our AMA believes that: (a) Given the association between alcohol and family violence, physicians should be alert for the presence of one behavior given a diagnosis of the other. Thus, a physician with patients with alcohol problems should screen for family violence, while physi cians with patients presenting with problems of physical or sexual abuse should screen for alcohol use. (b) Physicians should avoid the assumption that if they treat the problem of alcohol or substance use and abuse they also will be treating and possibly preventing family violence. (c) Physicians should be alert to the association, especially among female patients, between current alcohol or drug problems and a history of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. The association is strong enough to warrant complete screening for past or present physical, emotional, or sexual abuse among patients who present with alcohol or drug problems. (d) Physicians should be informed about the possible pharmacological link between amphetamine use and human violent behavior. The suggestive evidence about barbiturates and amphetamines and violence should be followed up with more research on the possible causal connection between these drugs and violent behavior. (e) The notion that alcohol and controlled drugs cause v iolent behavior is pervasive among physicians and other health care providers. Training programs for physicians should be developed that are based on empirical data and sound theoretical formulations about the relationships among alcohol, drug use, and vio lence. CSA Rep. 7, I -00; Reaffirmed: CSAPH -09; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 01, A -19 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 611 (A-22) Introduced by: Minority Affairs Section, National Medical Association Subject: Continuing Equity Education Referred to: Reference Committee F Whereas, The AMA has recently taken significant steps to achieve optimal health for all in the 1 areas of scholarship, research, philanthropy, advocacy, healthcare delivery, and practice 2 through the adoption and implementation of policies, processes, and programs that center 3 equity, such as the founding of the AMA Center for Health Equity and adoption of several racial 4 justice and equity -oriented policies by the House of Delegates1; and 5 6 Whereas, In May 2021, the Center for Health Equity released its three- year organizational 7 strategic action plan to embed racial justice and advance health equity within the AMA and 8 across medicine, and has since taken the initial steps to operationalize this mission, including 9 the collaborative release of Advancing Health Equity: A Guide to Language, Narrative and 10 Concepts to provide a shared framework for the discussion of health equity issues2-4; and 11 12 Whereas, In response to member requests to expand and deepen their understanding of health 13 equity and racial justice, the AMA Board of Trustees and Speakers arranged for the convening 14 of an Open Forum on Health Equity during the November 2021 (N21) Special Meeting of the 15 House of Delegates (HOD) to facilitate additional opportunities for education and discussion 16 among membership5,6; and 17 18 Whereas, The N21 Health Equity Forum granted HOD members a safe environment to 19 participate in curated education sessions and programming with health equity experts and 20 scholars, providing information exchange and valuable perspective into the importance of 21 learning life- long skills and furthering knowledge to prioritize equity; therefore be it 22 23 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association establish an Open Forum on Health 24 Equity, to be held annually at a House of Delegates Meeting, for members to directly engage in 25 educational discourse and strengthen organizational capacity to advance and operationalize 26 equity.

American Medical Association. October 12, 2021.Resolution: 611 (A-22) Page 2 of 6 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Plan for Continued Progress Toward Health Equity D -180.981 1. Our AMA will develop an organizational unit, e.g., a Center or its equivalent, to facilitate, c oordinate, initiate, and track AMA health equity activities. 2. The Board will provide an annual report to the House of Delegates regarding AMAs health equity activities and achievements. Citation: BOT Rep. 33, A -18 Racism as a Public Health Threat H -65.952 1. Our AMA acknowledges that, although the primary drivers of racial health inequity are systemic and structural racism, racism and unconscious bias within medical research and health care delivery have caused and continue to cause harm to marginalized communities and society as a whole. 2. Our AMA recognizes racism, in its systemic, cultural, interpersonal, and other forms, as a serious threat to public health, to the advancement of health equity, and a barrier to appropriate medical care. 3. Our AMA will identify a set of current, best practices for healthcare institutions, physician practices, and academic medical centers to recognize, address, and mitigate the effects of racism on patients, providers, international medical graduates, and populations. 4. Our AMA encourages the development, implementation, and evaluation of undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education programs and curricula that engender greater understanding of: (a) the causes, influences, and effects of systemic, cultural, in stitutional, and interpersonal racism; and (b) how to prevent and ameliorate the health effects of racism. 5. Our AMA: (a) supports the development of policy to combat racism and its effects; and (b) encourages governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations to increase funding for research into the epidemiology of risks and damages related to racism and how to prevent or repair them. 6. Our AMA will work to prevent and combat the influences of racism and bias in innovative health technologies. Citation: Res. 5, I -20 Racial Essentialism in Medicine D -350.981 1. Our AMA recognizes that the false conflation of race with inherent biological or genetic traits leads to inadequate examination of true underlying disease risk factors, which exacerbates exis ting health inequities. 2. Our AMA encourages characterizing race as a social construct, rather than an inherent biological trait, and recognizes that when race is described as a risk factor, it is more likely to be a proxy for influences including structural racism than a proxy for genetics. 3. Our AMA will collaborate with the AAMC, AACOM, NBME, NBOME, ACGME and other appropriate stakeholders, including minority physician organizations and content experts, to identify and address aspects of medical education and board examinations which may perpetuate teachings, assessments, and practices that reinforce institutional and structural racism. 4. Our AMA will collaborate with appropriate stakeholders and content experts to develop recommendat ions on how to interpret or improve clinical algorithms that currently include race- based correction factors. 5. Our AMA will support research that promotes antiracist strategies to mitigate algorithmic bias in medicine. Citation: Res. 10, I -20 Elimination of Race as a Proxy for Ancestry, Genetics, and Biology in Medical Education, Research and Clinical Practice H -65.953 1. Our AMA recognizes that race is a social construct and is distinct from ethnicity, genetic ancestry, or biology. 2. Our AMA supports ending the practice of using race as a proxy for biology or genetics in medical education, research, and clinical practice. 3. Our AMA encourages undergraduate medical education, graduate medical education, and continuing medical education programs to rec ognize the harmful effects of presenting race as biology in medical education and that they work to mitigate these effects through curriculum change that: (a) demonstrates how the category \"race\" can influence health outcomes; (b) that supports race as a s ocial construct and Resolution: 611 (A-22) Page 3 of 6 not a biological determinant and (c) presents race within a socio- ecological model of individual, community and society to explain how racism and systemic oppression result in racial health disparities. 4. Our AMA recommends that clini cians and researchers focus on genetics and biology, the experience of racism, and social determinants of health, and not race, when describing risk factors for disease. Citation: Res. 11, I -20 Healthcare and Organizational Policies and Cultural Changes to Prevent and Address Racism, Discrimination, Bias and Microaggressions H -65.951 Our AMA adopted the following guidelines for healthcare organizations and systems, including academic medical centers, to establish policies and an organizational culture to prevent and address systemic racism, explicit and implicit bias and microaggressions in the practice of medicine: GUIDELINES TO PREVENT AND ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RACISM, EXPLICIT BIAS AND MICROAGGRESSIONS IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE Health care organizations and systems, including academic medical centers, should establish policies to prevent and address discrimination including systemic racism, explicit and implicit bias and microaggressions in their workplaces. An effective healthcare anti -discrimination polic y should: Clearly define discrimination, systemic racism, explicit and implicit bias and microaggressions in the healthcare setting. Ensure the policy is prominently displayed and easily accessible. Describe the management's commitment to providin g a safe and healthy environment that actively seeks to prevent and address systemic racism, explicit and implicit bias and microaggressions. Establish training requirements for systemic racism, explicit and implicit bias, and microaggressions for all m embers of the healthcare system. Prioritize safety in both reporting and corrective actions as they relate to discrimination, systemic racism, explicit and implicit bias and microaggressions. Create anti -discrimination policies that: - Specify to whom the policy applies (i.e., medical staff, students, trainees, administration, patients, employees, contractors, vendors, etc.). - Define expected and prohibited behavior. - Outline steps for individuals to take when they feel they have experienced disc rimination, including racism, explicit and implicit bias and microaggressions. - Ensure privacy and confidentiality to the reporter. - Provide a confidential method for documenting and reporting incidents. - Outline policies and procedures for investigating and addressing complaints and determining necessary interventions or action. These policies should include: - Taking every complaint seriously. - Acting upon every complaint immediately. - Developing appropriate resources to resolve complaints. - Creating a procedure to ensure a healthy work environment is maintained for complainants and prohibit and penalize retaliation for reporting. - Communicating decisions and actions taken by the organization following a complaint to all affected parties. - Document training requirements to all the members of the healthcare system and establish clear expectations about the training objectives. In addition to formal policies, organizations should promote a culture in which discrimination, including systemi c racism, explicit and implicit bias and microaggressions are mitigated and prevented. Organized medical staff leaders should work with all stakeholders to ensure safe, discrimination- free work environments within their institutions. Tactics to help create this type of organizational culture include: Surveying staff, trainees and medical students, anonymously and confidentially to assess: - Perceptions of the workplace culture and prevalence of discrimination, systemic racism, explicit and implicit bias and microaggressions. - Ideas about the impact of this behavior on themselves and patients. Integrating lessons learned from surveys into programs and policies. Encouraging safe, open discussions for staff and students to talk freely about problems and/or Resolution: 611 (A-22) Page 4 of 6 encounters with behavior that may constitute discrimination, including racism, bias or microaggressions. Establishing programs for staff, faculty, trainees and students, such as Employee Assistance Programs, Faculty Assistance Programs, and Student Assistance Programs, that provide a place to confidentially address personal experiences of discrimination, systemic racism, explicit or implicit bias or microaggressions. Providing designated support person to confidentially accompany the person reporting an event through the process. Citation: Res. 003, A -21 Reducing Discrimination in the Practice of Medicine and Health Care Education D -350.984 Our AMA will pursue avenues to collaborate with the American Public Health Association's National Campai gn Against Racism in those areas where AMA's current activities align with the campaign. Citation: BOT Action in response to referred for decision Res. 602, I -15 Underrepresented Student Access to US Medical Schools H -350.960 Our AMA: (1) recommends that medical schools should consider in their planning: elements of diversity including but not limited to gender, racial, cultural and economic, reflective of the diversity of their patient population; (2) supports the development of new and the enhancement of existing programs that will identify and prepare underrepresented students from the high- school level onward and to enroll, retain and graduate increased numbers of underrepresented students; (3) recognizes some people have been historically underrepresented, excluded from, and marginalized in medical education and medicine because of their race, ethnicity, disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic origin, and rurality, due to racism and other systems of exclusion and discrimination; (4) is committed to promoting truth and reconciliation in medical education as it relates to improving equity; and (5) recognizes the harm caused by the Flexner Report to historically Black medical schools, the diversity of the physician workforce, and the outcomes of minoritized and marginalized patient populations.

Our AMA recognizes racial and ethnic health disparities as a major public health problem in the United States and as a barrier to effective medical diagnosis and treatment. The AMA maintains a position of zero tolerance toward racially or culturally based disparities in care; encourages indi viduals to report physicians to local medical societies where racial or ethnic discrimination is suspected; and will continue to support physician cultural awareness initiatives and related consumer education activities. The elimination of racial and ethni c disparities in health care an issue of highest priority for the American Medical Association. 2. The AMA emphasizes three approaches that it believes should be given high priority: A. Greater access - the need for ensuring that black Americans without adequate health care insurance are given the means for access to necessary health care. In particular, it is urgent that Congress address the need for Medicaid reform. B. Greater awareness - racial disparities may be occurring despite the lack of any intent or purposeful efforts to treat patients differently on the basis of race. The AMA encourages physicians to examine their own practices to ensure that inappropriate considerations do not affect their clinical judgment. In addition, the profession should hel p increase the awareness of its members of racial disparities in medical treatment decisions by engaging in open and broad discussions about the issue. Such discussions should take place in medical school curriculum, in medical journals, at professional conferences, and as part of professional peer review activities. C. Practice parameters - the racial disparities in access to treatment indicate that inappropriate considerations may enter the decision making process. The efforts of the specialty societies, with the coordination and assistance of our AMA, to develop practice parameters, should include criteria that would preclude or diminish racial disparities 3. Our AMA encourages the development of evidence -based performance measures that adequately identif y socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in quality. Furthermore, our AMA supports the use of evidence- based guidelines to promote the consistency and equity of care for all persons. 4. Our AMA: (a) actively supports the development and implementation of training regarding implicit bias, diversity and inclusion in all medical schools and residency programs; (b) will identify and publicize effective strategies for educating residents in all specialties about disparities in their fields related to race, ethnicity, and all populations at increased risk, with particular regard to access to care and health Resolution: 611 (A-22) Page 5 of 6 outcomes, as well as effective strategies for educating residents about managing the i mplicit biases of patients and their caregivers; and (c) supports research to identify the most effective strategies for educating physicians on how to eliminate disparities in health outcomes in all at -risk populations.

Our AMA will provide on- line educational materials for its membership that address diversity issues in patient care inc luding, but not limited to, culture, religion, race and ethnicity. 7. Our AMA will create and support programs that introduce elementary through high school students, especially those from groups that are underrepresented in medicine (URM), to healthcare c areers. 8. Our AMA will create and support pipeline programs and encourage support services for URM college students that will support them as they move through college, medical school and residency programs. 9. Our AMA will recommend that medical school a dmissions committees use holistic assessments of admission applicants that take into account the diversity of preparation and the variety of talents that applicants bring to their education. 10. Our AMA will advocate for the tracking and reporting to inter ested stakeholders of demographic information pertaining to URM status collected from Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). 11. Our AMA will continue the research, advocacy, coll aborative partnerships and other work that was initiated by the Commission to End Health Care Disparities. 12. Our AMA opposes legislation that would undermine institutions' ability to properly employ affirmative action to promote a diverse student populat ion. 13. Our AMA will work with the AAMC and other stakeholders to create a question for the AAMC electronic medical school application to identify previous pipeline program (also known as pathway program) participation and create a plan to analyze the dat a in order to determine the effectiveness of pipeline programs.

d) the implications for interprofessional education and rewarding teamwork; and e) the implications for residents and students who achieve milestones earlier or later than their peers; (11) will work with the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), American Osteopathic Association (AOA), American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), and National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) to evaluate the current available data or propose new studies that would help us learn how many students graduating from US medical schools each year do not enter into a US residency program; how many never enter into a US residency program; whether there is disproportionate impact on individuals of minority racial and ethnic groups; and what careers are pursued by those with an MD or DO degree who do not enter residency programs; (12) will work with the AAMC, AOA, AACOM and appropriate licensing boards to study whether US medical school graduates and international medical graduates who do not enter residency programs may be able to serve unmet national health care needs;

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 614 (A-22) Introduced by: Albert L. Hsu, MD, Delegate Subject: Allowing Virtual Interviews on Non -Holiday Weekends for Candidates for AMA Office Referred to: Reference Committee F Whereas, In Year 1 of the COVID -19 pandemic (in accordance with AMA election guidelines), 1 the Endocrine Section Council of the American Medical Association conducted virtual interviews 2 for 7 of 8 candidates for AMA Board of Trustees and all 5 candidates for AMA Council on 3 Medical Service on Sat ., 30 May , 2020 (and the one BOT candidate with a conflict was able to 4 meet virtually on an alternate and mutually -convenient date); and 5 6 Whereas, In Year 2 of the COVID -19 pandemic (and in accordance with AMA election 7 guidelines), the Endocrine Section Council of the AMA conducted virtual interviews for all 12 8 candidates for AMA President -elect, AMA Board of Trustees, the AMA Council on Science and 9 Public Health, the AMA Council on Constitution and Bylaws, and the AMA Council on Medical 10 Service on Sat ., 22 May , 2021; and 11 12 Whereas, In Year 3 of the COVID -19 pandemic, and in response to action by the AMA House of 13 Delegates, all virtual interviews for Candidates for AMA Elections (President -elect, Board of 14 Trustees, and all Councils) were required to be held between Thur ., 26 May -Sun., 29 May, 15 which was over Memorial Day w eekend; and 16 17 Whereas, In 2022, seven groups have offered virtual interviews to candidates for AMA Office; 18 and 19 20 Whereas, Virtual interviews allow caucuses to meet candidates for AMA Office before the in- 21 person meeting, without the distractions of AMA business and policy -making, networking, and 22 catching up with old friends; and 23 24 Whereas, Virtual interviews allow candidates for AMA office to hone their speeches and 25 presentations before the in- person meeting; and 26 27 Whereas, Current AMA -HOD policy states that: \"Interviews may be conducted only during a 28 window beginning on the Thursday evening two weeks prior to the scheduled Opening Session 29 of the House of Delegates meeting at which elections will take place and must be concluded by 30 that Sunday (four days later);\" and 31 32 Whereas, Memorial Day weekend is a decidedly inconvenient time to conduct virtual interviews, 33 making \"work -life balance\" even more difficult (for both candidates and caucuses alike); 34 therefore be it 35 Resolution: 614 (A- 22) Page 2 of 5 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy G -610.020, \"Rules for AMA Elections,\" by addition 1 and deletion to read as follows: 2 3 Interviews may be conducted only during a window designated by the Speaker 4 beginning on the Thursday evening of a non- holiday weekend at least two weeks 5 but not more than 4 weeks prior to the scheduled Opening Session of the House of 6 Delegates meeting at which elections will take place and must be concluded by 7 that following Sunday (four days later) . (Modify Current HOD Policy) 8 Fiscal Note: Minimal - less than $1,000 Received: 05/11/22 REFERENCES: 1. 2022 AMA Elections Manual RELEVANT AMA POLICY Rules for AMA Elections G -610.020 (1) The Speaker and Vice Speaker of the House of Delegates are responsible for overall administration of our AMA elections, although balloting is conducted under the supervision of the chief teller and the Committee on Rules and Credentials. The Speaker and Vice Speaker will advise candidates on allowable activities and when appropriate will ensure that clarification of these rules is provided to all known candidates. The Speaker, in consultation with the Vice Speaker and the Election Committee, is responsible for declaring a violation of the rul es. (2) Individuals intending to seek election at the next Annual Meeting should make their intentions known to the Speakers, generally by providing the Speaker's office with an electronic announcement \"card\" that includes any or all of the following elements and no more: the candidate's name, photograph, email address, URL, the office sought and a list of endorsing societies. The Speakers will ensure that the information is posted on our AMA website in a timely fashion, generally on the morning of the last day of a House of Delegates meeting or upon adjournment of the meeting. Announcements that include additional information (e.g., a brief resume) will not be posted to the website. Printed announcements may not be distributed in the venue where the House of Delegates meets. Announcements sent by candidates to members of the House are considered campaigning and are specifically prohibited prior to the start of active campaigning. The Speakers may use additional means to make delegates aware of those members intending to seek election . (3) Announcement cards of all known candidates will be projected on the last day of the Annual and Interim Meetings of our House of Delegates and posted on the AMA website as per Policy G-610.020, paragraph 2. Following each meeting, an \"Official Candidate Notification\" will be sent electronically to the House. It will include a list of all announced candidates and all potential newly opened positions which may open as a result of the election of any announced candidate. Additio nal notices will also be sent out following the April Board meeting and on \"Official Announcement Dates\" to be established by the Speaker. (4) Candidates may notify the HOD Office of their intention to run for potential newly opened positions, as well as any scheduled open positions on any council or the Board of Trustees, at any time by submitting an announcement card to the House Office. They will then be included in all subsequent projections of announcements before the House, \"Official Candidate Notific ations,\" and in any campaign activity that had not yet been finalized. All previously announced candidates will continue to be included on each Official Announcement Date. Any candidate may independently announce their candidacy after active campaigning is allowed, but no formal announcement from the HOD office will take place other than at the specified times. Resolution: 614 (A-22) Page 3 of 5 (5) The Federation and members of the House of Delegates will be notified of unscheduled potential newly opened positions that may become available as a result of the election of announced candidates. Candidates will be allowed to announce their intention to run for these positions (6) If a potential newly opened position on the Board or a specified council does not open but there are other open posit ions for the same council or the Board, an election will proceed for the existing open seats. Candidates will be offered the opportunity to withdraw their nomination prior to the vote. If there are no scheduled open seats on the Board or specified council for which a potential newly opened position is announced and if the potential newly opened position does not open (ie., the individual with the unexpired term is not elected to the office they sought), no election for the position will be held. In the event that a prior election results in a newly opened position without a nominated candidate or more positions are open than nominated candidates, the unfilled position/s would remain unfilled until the next annual meeting. (7) The AMA Office of House of Delegates Affairs will provide an opportunity for all announced candidates to submit material to the HOD office which will then be sent electronically by the HOD Office in a single communication to all delegates and alternates. Parameters regarding content and deadlines for submission will be established by the Speaker and communicated to all announced candidates. (8) Our AMA believes that: (a) specialty society candidates for AMA House of Delegates elected offices should be listed in the pre -election materials available to the House as the representative of that society and not by the state in which the candidate resides; (b) elected specialty society members should be identified in that capacity while serving their term of office; and (c) nothing in the above r ecommendations should preclude formal co -endorsement by any state delegation of the national specialty society candidate, if that state delegation should so choose. (9) An Election Manual containing information on all candidates for election shall continue to be developed annually, with distribution limited to publication on our AMA website, typically on the Web pages associated with the meeting at which elections will occur. The Election Manual will provide a link to the AMA Candidates' Page, but links to personal, professional or campaign related websites will not be allowed. The Election Manual provides an equal opportunity for each candidate to present the material he or she considers important to bring before the members of the House of Delegates and should relieve the need for the additional expenditures incurred in making non- scheduled telephone calls and duplicative mailings. The Election Manual serves as a mechanism to reduce the number of telephone calls, mailings and other messages members of the H ouse of Delegates receive from or on behalf of candidates. (10) Active campaigning for AMA elective office may not begin until the Board of Trustees, after its April meeting, announces the candidates for council seats. Active campaigning includes mass outr each activities directed to all or a significant portion of the members of the House of Delegates and communicated by or on behalf of the candidate. If in the judgment of the Speaker of the House of Delegates circumstances warrant an earlier date by which campaigns may formally begin, the Speaker shall communicate the earlier date to all known candidates. (11) The Speaker's Office will coordinate the scheduling of candidate interviews for general officer positions (Trustees, President -Elect, Speaker and Vice Speaker). Groups wishing to conduct interviews must designate their interviewing coordinator and provide the individual's contact information to the Office of House of Delegates Affairs. The Speaker's Office will collect contact information for groups wishing to conduct interviews as well as for candidates and their campaign teams and will provide the information as requested. (12) Interviews conducted with current candidates must comply with the following rules: a. Interviews may be arranged between t he parties once active campaigning is allowed. b. Groups conducting interviews with candidates for a given office must offer an interview to all individuals that have officially announced their candidacy at the time the group's interview schedule is finali zed. Resolution: 614 (A-22) Page 4 of 5 i. A group may meet with a candidate who is a member of their group without interviewing other candidates for the same office. ii. Interviewing groups may, but are not required to, interview late announcing candidates. Should an interview be offered t o a late candidate, all other announced candidates for the same office (even those previously interviewed) must be afforded the same opportunity and medium. iii. Any appearance by a candidate before an organized meeting of a caucus or delegation, other than their own, will be considered an interview and fall under the rules for interviews. c. Groups may elect to conduct interviews virtually or in- person. d. In-person interviews may be conducted between Friday and Monday of the meeting at which elections will take place. e. Virtual interviews are subject to the following constraints: i. Interviews may be conducted only during a window beginning on the Thursday evening two weeks prior to the scheduled Opening Session of the House of Delegates meeting at which elections will take place and must be concluded by that Sunday (four days later). ii. Interviews conducted on weeknights must be scheduled between 5 pm and 10 pm or on weekends between 8 am and 10 pm based on the candidate's local time, unless another mutually acceptable time outside these hours is arranged. iii. Caucuses and delegations scheduling interviews for candidates within the parameters above must offer alternatives to those candidates who have conflicts with the scheduled time. f. Recording of int erviews is allowed only with the knowledge and consent of the candidate. g. Recordings of interviews may be shared only among members of the group conducting the interview. h. A candidate is free to decline any interview request. i. In consultation with th e Election Committee, the Speaker, or where the Speaker is in a contested election, the Vice Speaker, may issue special rules for interviews to address unexpected situations. (13) Every state and specialty society delegation is encouraged to participate in a regional caucus, for the purposes of candidate review activities. (14) Campaign memorabilia may not be distributed in the Not for Official Business (NFOB) bag. (15) Campaign materials may not be distributed by postal mail or its equivalent. The AMA Offi ce of House of Delegates Affairs will no longer furnish a file containing the names and mailing addresses of members of the AMA -HOD. Printed campaign materials will not be included in the \"Not for Official Business\" bag and may not be distributed in the House of Delegates. Candidates are encouraged to eliminate printed campaign materials. (16) A reduction in the volume of telephone calls and electronic communication from candidates and on behalf of candidates is encouraged. The Office of House of Delegates Affairs does not provide email addresses for any purpose. The use of electronic messages to contact electors should be minimized, and if used must include a simple mechanism to allow recipients to opt out of receiving future messages. (17) Campaign expendi tures and activities should be limited to reasonable levels necessary for adequate candidate exposure to the delegates. Campaign memorabilia and giveaways that include a candidate's name or likeness may not be distributed at any time. (18) Campaign sticker s, pins, buttons and similar campaign materials are disallowed. This rule will not apply for pins for AMPAC, the AMA Foundation, specialty societies, state and regional delegations and health related causes that do not include any candidate identifier. These pins should be small, not worn on the badge and distributed only to members of the designated group. General distribution of any pin, button or sticker is disallowed. (19) At any AMA meeting convened prior to the time period for active campaigning, campaign-related expenditures and activities shall be discouraged. Large campaign receptions, luncheons, other formal campaign activities and the distribution of campaign literature and gifts are prohibited. It is permissible for candidates seeking election to engage in individual outreach meant to familiarize others with a candidate's opinions and positions on issues. Resolution: 614 (A-22) Page 5 of 5 (20) Candidates for AMA office should not attend meetings of state medical societies unless officially invited and could accept reimbursement of travel expenses by the state society in accordance with the policies of the society. (21) Group dinners, if attended by an announced candidate in a currently contested election, must be \"Dutch treat\" - each participant pays their own share of the expenses , with the exception that societies and delegations may cover the expense for their own members. This rule would not disallow societies from paying for their own members or delegations gathering together with each individual or delegation paying their own expense. Gatherings of 4 or fewer delegates or alternates are exempt from this rule. (22) A state, specialty society, caucus, coalition, etc. may contribute to more than one party. However, a candidate may be featured at only one party, which includes: (a) being present in a receiving line, or (b) appearing by name or in a picture on a poster or notice in or outside of the party venue. At these events, alcohol may be served only on a cash or no -host bar basis. (23) Displays of campaign posters, signs, and l iterature in public areas of the hotel in which Annual Meetings are held are prohibited because they detract from the dignity of the position being sought and are unsightly. Campaign posters may be displayed at a single campaign reception at which the candidate is featured. No campaign literature shall be distributed in the House of Delegates and no mass outreach electronic messages shall be transmitted after the opening session of the House of Delegates. (24) At the Opening Session of the Annual Meeting, o fficer candidates in a contested election will give a two -minute self -nominating speech, with the order of speeches determined by lot. No speeches for unopposed candidates will be given, except for president -elect. When there is no contest for president -elect, the candidate will ask a delegate to place his or her name in nomination, and the election will then be by acclamation. When there are two or more candidates for the office of president -elect, a two- minute nomination speech will be given by a delegate. In addition, the Speaker of the House of Delegates will schedule a debate in front of the AMA -HOD to be conducted by rules established by the Speaker or, in the event of a conflict, the Vice Speaker. (25) Our AMA (a) requires completion of conflict of interest forms by all candidates for election to our AMA Board of Trustees and councils prior to their election; and (b) will expand accessibility to completed conflict of interest information by posting such information on the \"Members Only\" s ection of our AMA website before election by the House of Delegates, with links to the disclosure statements from relevant electronic documents.

and 7 8 Whereas, Gender -based discrimination and bias are widespread in the medical professional 9 workspace, with the rate of sexual harassment in academic medicine being close to double that 10 of other engineering and science fields2,3; and 11 12 Whereas, Among female trainees, a pproximately 45% experience at least one instance of 13 gender harassment through sexist hostility, and 18% have experienced crude, sexist behavior, 14 and male trainees report 21% and 10% rates respectively1; and 15 16 Whereas, The 2018 NASEM report concludes that \"the cumulative effect of sexual harassment 17 is a significant and costly loss of talent in academic science, engineering, and medicine, 18 which has consequences for advancing the nation's economic and social well -being and its 19 overall public health\"1; and 20 21 Whereas, Victims of sexual harassment often will not report the harassment to their institutions 22 because of fear of retaliation such as being \"labeled as a troublemaker \"4; and 23 24 Whereas, The U.S. Supreme Court recognizes claims for sexual harassment as a form of 25 discrimination based on sex under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 19645; and 26 27 Whereas, The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Select Task Force on the Study of 28 Harassment in the Workplace formed by the U.S. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission 29 in their executive report stated: \"The importance of leadership cannot be overstated - effective 30 harassment prevention efforts, and workplace culture in which harassment is not tolerated, must 31 start with and involve the highest level of management of the company6; and 32 33 Whereas, Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture and Consequences in Academic 34 Science, Engineering and Medicine states that \"organizational tolerance for sexually harassing 35 behavior\" increases the risk of sexual harassment occurring within the organization1; and 36 37 Whereas, Sexual harassment in the professional environment leads to a well -documented loss 38 of productivity and attrition of workers1,7,8; and 39 Resolution: 615 (A-22) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, A study published in Academic Medicine stated that it is imperative to have senior 1 faculty and leadership call out inappropriate behaviors and sexual harassment to serve as role 2 models for their colleagues, trainees, and staff4; and 3 4 Whereas, The American Association of Medical Colleges (AAM C) encourages a culture change 5 as a way to address harassment, which includes training individuals of all genders in bystander 6 intervention3; and 7 8 Whereas, Real -world and experimental evidence shows that the way leadership communicates 9 about sexual assault and sexual harassment strongly influences an organization or group's 10 attitudes toward sexual harassment and violence, with leadership emphasis on addressing 11 sexual harassment resulting in group participants rating the priority of addressing harassm ent 12 higher9,10,11; and 13 14 Whereas, Among those who do report sexual harassment to their employers, nearly half report 15 being dissatisfied with the response12; and 16 17 Whereas, Given that the result of sexual harassment is a net loss of talent and highly trained 18 personnel, the costs of not aggressively addressing sexual harassment in medicine and 19 organized medicine are substantial1; and 20 21 Whereas, Our AMA has a zero -tolerance policy for sexual harassment and expects members to 22 act with decorum at meetings according to the Code of Conduct (H -140.837) and the AMA Code 23 of Medical Ethics (9.1.3) explicitly states that sexual harassment is unethical, however there is 24 no formal training in the AMA on how to prevent/counter sexual harassment or advise members 25 when it occur s;13 and 26 27 Whereas, Our AMA has demonstrated a financial commitment to reducing sexual harassment 28 through previously utilizing outside resources to strengthen our AMA's policies and protections 29 of all AMA members14; and 30 31 Whereas, Our AMA has created a Conti nuing Medical Education module to address sexual 32 harassment in medicine, especially between physicians and their patients15; therefore be it 33 34 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association require all members elected and 35 appointed to national and regional AMA leadership positions to complete AMA Code of Conduct 36 and anti -harassment training, with continued evaluation of the training for effectiveness in 37 reducing harassment within the AMA (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with the Wo men Physician S ection, American Medical 40 Women' s Association, GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality , and other 41 stakeholders to identify an appropriate, evidence- based anti -harassment and sexual 42 harassment prevention training to administer to leadership.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events H -140.837 It is the policy of the American Medical Association that all attendees of AMA hosted meetings, events and other activities are expected to exhibit respectful, professional, and collegial behavior during such meetings, events and activities, including but not limited to dinners, receptions and social gatherings held in conjunction with such AMA hosted meetings, events and other activities. Attendees should exercise consideration and respect in their speech and actions, including while making formal presentations to other attendees, and should be mindful of their surroundings and fellow participants. Any type of harassment of any attendee of an AMA hosted meeting, event and other activity, including but not limited to dinners, receptions and social gatherings held in conjunction with an AMA hosted meeting, event or activity, is prohibited conduct and is not tolerated. The AMA is committed to a zero tolerance for harassing conduct at all locations where AMA business is conducted. This zero tolerance policy also applies to meetings of all AMA sections, councils, committees, task forces, and other leadership entities (each, an \"AMA Entity\"), as well as other AMA -sponsored events. The purpose of the policy is to protect participants in AMA -sponsored events from harm . Definition Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct whether verbal, physical or visual that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, marital status, citizenship or otherwise, and that: (1) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment; (2) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's participation in meetings or proceedings of the HOD or any AMA Entity; or (3) otherwise adversely affects an individual's participation in such meetings or proceedings or, in the case of AMA staff, such individual's employment opportunities or tangible job benefits. Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written, electronic, or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group and that is placed on walls or elsewhere on the AMA's premises or at the site of any AMA meeting or circulated in connection with any AMA meeting. Sexual Harassment Resolution: 615 (A-22) Page 4 of 6 Sexual harassment also constitutes discrimination, and is unlawful and i s absolutely prohibited. For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment includes: - making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other verbal, physical, or visual conduct of a sexual nature; and - creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment or otherwise unreasonably interfering with an individual's participation in meetings or proceedings of the HOD or any AMA Entity or, in the case of AMA staff, such individual's work performance, by instances of such conduct. Sexual harassment may include such conduct as explicit sexual propositions, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments or gestures, descriptive comments about an individual's physical appearance, electronic stalking or lewd messages, displays of foul or obscene printed or visual material, and any unwelcome physical contact. Retaliation against anyone who has reported harassment, submits a complaint, reports an incident witnessed, or participates in any way in the investigation of a harassment claim is forbidden. Each complaint of harassment or retaliation will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. To the fullest extent possible, the AMA will keep complaints and the terms of their resolution confidential. Operational Guidelines The AMA shall, through the Office of General Counsel, implement and maintain mechanisms for reporting, investigation, and enforcement of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events in accordance with the following: 1. Conduct Liaison and Committee on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events (CCAM) The Office of General Counsel will appoint a \"Conduct Liaison\" for all AMA House of Delegates meetings and all other AMA hosted meetings or activities (such as meetings of AMA councils, sections, the RVS Update Committee (RUC), CPT Editorial Panel, or JAMA Editorial Boards), with responsibility for receiving reports of alleged policy violations, conducting investigations, and initiating both immediate and longer -term consequences for such violations. The Conduct Liaison appointed for any meeting will have the appropriate training and experience to serve in this capacity, and may be a third party or an in- house AMA resource with assigned responsibility for this role. The Conduct Liaison will be (i) on- site at all House of Delegates meetings and other large, national AMA meetings and (ii) on call for smaller meetings and activities. Appointments of the Conduct Liaison for each meeting shall ensure appropriate independence and neutrality, and avoid even the appearance of conflict of inte rest, in investigation of alleged policy violations and in decisions on consequences for policy violations. The AMA shall establish and maintain a Committee on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events (CCAM), to be comprised of 5- 7 AMA members who are nominated by the Office of General Counsel (or through a nomination process facilitated by the Office of General Counsel) and approved by the Board of Trustees. The CCAM should include one member of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA). The remaining m embers may be appointed from AMA membership generally, with emphasis on maximizing the diversity of membership. Appointments to the CCAM shall ensure appropriate independence and neutrality, and avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest, in decisions on consequences for policy violations. Appointments to the CCAM should be multi -year, with staggered terms. 2. Reporting Violations of the Policy Any persons who believe they have experienced or witnessed conduct in violation of Policy H -140.837, \"Polic y on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events,\" during any AMA House of Delegates meeting or other activities associated with the AMA (such as meetings of AMA councils, sections, the RVS Update Committee (RUC), CPT Editorial Panel or JAMA Editorial Boards) shoul d promptly notify the (i) Conduct Liaison appointed for such meeting, and/or (ii) the AMA Office of General Counsel and/or (iii) the presiding officer(s) of such meeting or activity. Alternatively, violations may be reported using an AMA reporting hotline (telephone and online) maintained by a third party on behalf of the AMA. The AMA reporting hotline will provide an option to report anonymously, in which case the name of the reporting party will be kept confidential by the vendor and not be released to the AMA. The vendor will advise the AMA of any complaint it receives so that the Conduct Liaison may investigate. These reporting mechanisms will be publicized to ensure awareness. 3. Investigations All reported violations of Policy H -140.837, \"Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events,\" pursuant to Section 2 above (irrespective of the reporting mechanism used) will be investigated by the Conduct Liaison. Each reported violation will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. Whenever possible, the Conduct Liaison should conduct incident investigations on- site during the event. This allows for immediate action at the event to protect the safety of event participants. When this is not possible, the Conduct Liaison may continue to investigate incidents followin g the event to provide recommendations for action to the CCAM. Investigations should consist of structured interviews with the person reporting the incident (the reporter), the person targeted (if they are not the reporter), any witnesses that the reporter or target identify, and the alleged violator. Based on this investigation, the Conduct Liaison will determine whether a violation of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events has occurred. Resolution: 615 (A-22) Page 5 of 6 All reported violations of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events, and the outcomes of investigations by the Conduct Liaison, will also be promptly transmitted to the AMA's Office of General Counsel (i.e. irrespective of whether the Conduct Liaison determines that a violation has occurred). 4. Disciplina ry Action If the Conduct Liaison determines that a violation of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events has occurred, the Conduct Liaison may take immediate action to protect the safety of event participants, which may include having the violator removed from the AMA meeting, event or activity, without warning or refund. Additionally, if the Conduct Liaison determines that a violation of the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events has occurred, the Conduct Liaison shall report any such violati on to the CCAM, together with recommendations as to whether additional commensurate disciplinary and/or corrective actions (beyond those taken on- site at the meeting, event or activity, if any) are appropriate. The CCAM will review all incident reports, perform further investigation (if needed) and recommend to the Office of General Counsel any additional commensurate disciplinary and/or corrective action, which may include but is not limited to the following: - Prohibiting the violator from attending futur e AMA events or activities; - Removing the violator from leadership or other roles in AMA activities; - Prohibiting the violator from assuming a leadership or other role in future AMA activities; - Notifying the violator's employer and/or sponsoring organi zation of the actions taken by AMA; - Referral to the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) for further review and action; - Referral to law enforcement. The CCAM may, but is not required to, confer with the presiding officer(s) of applicable events activities in making its recommendations as to disciplinary and/or corrective actions. Consequence for policy violations will be commensurate with the nature of the violation(s). 5. Confidentiality All proceedings of the CCAM should be kept as confidential as practicable. Reports, investigations, and disciplinary actions under Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events will be kept confidential to the fullest extent possible, consistent with usual business practices. 6. Assent to Policy As a c ondition of attending and participating in any meeting of the House of Delegates, or any council, section, or other AMA entities, such as the RVS Update Committee (RUC), CPT Editorial Panel and JAMA Editorial Boards, or other AMA hosted meeting or activity , each attendee will be required to acknowledge and accept (i) AMA policies concerning conduct at AMA HOD meetings, including the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events and (ii) applicable adjudication and disciplinary processes for violations of suc h policies (including those implemented pursuant to these Operational Guidelines), and all attendees are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with these policies. Additionally, individuals elected or appointed to a leadership role in the AMA or its affiliates will be required to acknowledge and accept the Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events and these Operational Guidelines. [Editor's note: Violations of this Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events may be reported at 800.398.1496 or onl ine at https://www.lighthouse- services.com/ama. Both are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Please note that situations unrelated to this Policy on Conduct at AMA Meetings and Events should not be reported here. In particular, patient concerns about a physician should be reported to the state medical board or other appropriate authority.] BOT Rep. 23, A -17; Appended: BOT Rep. 20, A -18; Modified: BOT Rep. 10, A -19; Modified: CCB Rep. 2, I -20 9.1.3 Sexual Harassment in the Practice of Medicine Sexual harassment can be defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment in the practice of medicine is unethical. Sexual harassment exploits inequalities in status and power, abuses the rights and trust of those who are subjected to such conduct; interferes with an individual's work performance, and may influence or be perceived as influencing professional advancement in a manner unrelated to clinical or academic performance harm professional working relationships, and create an intimidating or hostile work environment; and is likely to jeopardize patient care. Sexual relationships between medical supervisors and trainees are not acceptable, even if consensual. The supervis ory role should be eliminated if the parties wish to pursue their relationship. Physicians should promote and adhere to strict sexual harassment policies in medical workplaces. Physicians who participate in grievance committees should be broadly representative with respect to gender identity or sexual orientation, profession, and employment status, have the power to enforce harassment policies, and be accessible to the persons they are meant to serve. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: II,IV,VII Resolution: 615 (A-22) Page 6 of 6 Advancing G ender Equity in Medicine D -65.989 1. Our AMA will: (a) advocate for institutional, departmental and practice policies that promote transparency in defining the criteria for initial and subsequent physician compensation; (b) advocate for pay structures based on objective, gender -neutral criteria; (c) encourage a specified approach, sufficient to identify gender disparity, to oversight of compensation models, metrics, and actual total compensation for all employed physicians; and (d) advocate for training to identify and mitigate implicit bias in compensation determination for those in positions to determine salary and bonuses, with a focus on how subtle differences in the further evaluation of physicians of different genders may impede compensation and career advancement. 2. Our AMA will recommend as immediate actions to reduce gender bias: (a) elimination of the question of prior salary information from job applications for physician recruitment in academic and private practice; (b) create an awareness campai gn to inform physicians about their rights under the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and Equal Pay Act; (c) establish educational programs to help empower all genders to negotiate equitable compensation; (d) work with relevant stakeholders to host a workshop on the role of medical societies in advancing women in medicine, with co- development and broad dissemination of a report based on workshop findings; and (e) create guidance for medical schools and health care facilities for institutional transparency of compensation, and regular gender -based pay audits. 3. Our AMA will collect and analyze comprehensive demographic data and produce a study on the inclusion of women members including, but not limited to, membership, representation in the House of Delegates, reference committee makeup, and leadership positions within our AMA, including the Board of Trustees, Councils and Section governance, plenary speaker invitations, recognition awards, and grant funding, and disseminate such findings in regular reports to the House of Delegates and making recommendations to support gender equity. 4. Our AMA will commit to pay equity across the organization by asking our Board of Trustees to undertake routine assessments of salaries within and across the organization, while making the necessary adjustments to ensure equal pay for equal work. Res. 010, A -18; Modified: BOT Rep. 27, A -19 Decreasing Sex and Gender Disparities in Health Outcomes H -410.946 Our AMA: (1) supports the use of decision support tools that aim to mitigate gender bias in diagnosis and treatment; and (2) encourages the use of guidelines, treatment protocols, and decision support tools specific to biological sex for conditions in which physiologic and pathophysiologic differences exist between sexes. Res. 005, A-18 AMA Sponsored Leadership Training for Hospital Medical Staff Officers and Committee Chairs H - 225.972 It is the policy of the AMA (1) to offer, both regionally and locally, extensive training and skill development for emerging medical staff leaders t o assure that they can effectively perform the duties and responsibilities associated with medical staff self -governance; and (2) that training and skill development programs for medical staff leaders be as financially self -supporting as feasible.

Res. 608, A -17 The Physician's Right to Engage in Independent Advocacy on Behalf of Patients, the Profession and the Community H-285.910 Our AMA endorses the following clause guaranteeing physician independence and recommends it for insertion into physician employment agreements and independent contractor agreements for physician services: Physician's Right to Engage in Independent Advocacy on Behalf of Patients, the Profession, and the Community In caring for patients and in all matters related to this Agreement, Physician shall have the unfettered right to exercise his/her independent professional judgment and be guided by his/her personal and professional beliefs as to what is in the best interests of patients, the profession, and the community. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit Physician's right or ability to advocate on behalf of patients' interests or on behalf of good patient care, or to exercise his/her own medical judgment. Physician shall not be deemed in breach of this Agreement, nor may Employer retaliate in any way, including but not limited to termination of this Agreement, commencement of any disciplinar y action, or any other adverse action against Physician directly or indirectly, based on Physician's exercise of his/her rights under this paragraph. Res. 8, A -11, Reaffirmed: CEJA Rep. 1, A -21 ACGME Allotted Time Off for Health Care Advocacy and Health Policy Activities H -310.911 Our AMA: 1) urges the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to acknowledge that \"activities in organized medicine\" facilitate competency in professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills, practice -based learning and improvement, and systems -based practice; 2) encourages residency and fellowship programs to support their residents and fellows in their involvement in and pursuit of leadership in organized medicine; and 3) encourages the ACGME and other regulatory bodies to adopt policy that resident and fellow physicians be allotted additional time, beyond scheduled vacation, for scholarly activity time and activities of organized medicine, including but not limited to, health care advocacy and health policy. Res. 317, A -11; Reaffirmed: CME Rep. 1, A -21 AMA Principles for Physician Employment H -225.950 1. Addressing Conflicts of Interest a) A physician's paramount responsibility is to his or her patients. Additionally, given that an employed physician occupies a position of significant trust, he or she owes a duty of loyalty to his or her employer. This divided loyalty can create conflicts of interest, such as financial incentives to over - or under -treat patients, which employed physicians should strive to recognize and address. b) Employed physicians should be free to exercise their personal and professional judgement in voting, speaking and advocating on any manner regarding patient care interests, the profession, health care in the communit y, and the independent exercise of medical judgment. Employed physicians should not be deemed in breach of their employment agreements, nor be retaliated against by their employers, for asserting these interests. Employed physicians also should enjoy academic freedom to pursue clinical research and other academic pursuits within the ethical principles of the medical profession and the guidelines of the organization. c) In any situation where the economic or other interests of the employer are in conflict w ith patient welfare, patient welfare must take priority. d) Physicians should always make treatment and referral decisions based on the best interests of their patients. Employers and the physicians they employ must assure that agreements or understandings (explicit or implicit) restricting, discouraging, or encouraging particular treatment or referral options are disclosed to patients. (i) No physician should be required or coerced to perform or assist in any non- emergent procedure that would be contrary to his/her religious beliefs or moral convictions; and (ii) No physician should be discriminated against in employment, promotion, or the extension of staff or other privileges because he/she either performed or assisted in a lawful, non- emergent procedure, or refused to do so on the grounds that it violates his/her religious beliefs or moral convictions. Resolution: 616 (A-22) Page 4 of 5 e) Assuming a title or position that may remove a physician from direct patient -physician relationships --such as medical director, vice president for m edical affairs, etc. --does not override professional ethical obligations. Physicians whose actions serve to override the individual patient care decisions of other physicians are themselves engaged in the practice of medicine and are subject to professiona l ethical obligations and may be legally responsible for such decisions. Physicians who hold administrative leadership positions should use whatever administrative and governance mechanisms exist within the organization to foster policies that enhance the quality of patient care and the patient care experience. 2. Advocacy for Patients and the Profession a) Patient advocacy is a fundamental element of the patient -physician relationship that should not be altered by the health care system or setting in whi ch physicians practice, or the methods by which they are compensated. b) Employed physicians should be free to engage in volunteer work outside of, and which does not interfere with, their duties as employees. 3. Contracting a) Physicians should be free to enter into mutually satisfactory contractual arrangements, including employment, with hospitals, health care systems, medical groups, insurance plans, and other entities as permitted by law and in accordance with the ethical principles of the medical profession. b) Physicians should never be coerced into employment with hospitals, health care systems, medical groups, insurance plans, or any other entities. Employment agreements between physicians and their employers should be negotiated in good faith. Both parties are urged to obtain the advice of legal counsel experienced in physician employment matters when negotiating employment contracts. c) When a physician's compensation is related to the revenue he or she generates, or to similar factors, the employer should make clear to the physician the factors upon which compensation is based. d) Termination of an employment or contractual relationship between a physician and an entity employing that physician does not necessarily end the patient -physician r elationship between the employed physician and persons under his/her care. When a physician's employment status is unilaterally terminated by an employer, the physician and his or her employer should notify the physician's patients that the physician will no longer be working with the employer and should provide them with the physician's new contact information. Patients should be given the choice to continue to be seen by the physician in his or her new practice setting or to be treated by another physician still working with the employer. Records for the physician's patients should be retained for as long as they are necessary for the care of the patients or for addressing legal issues faced by the physician; records should not be destroyed without notice to the former employee. Where physician possession of all medical records of his or her patients is not already required by state law, the employment agreement should specify that the physician is entitled to copies of patient charts and records upon a specific request in writing from any patient, or when such records are necessary for the physician's defense in malpractice actions, administrative investigations, or other proceedings against the physician. (e) Physician employment agreements should contain provisions to protect a physician's right to due process before termination for cause. When such cause relates to quality, patient safety, or any other matter that could trigger the initiation of disciplinary action by the medical staff, the physician should be afforded full due process under the medical staff bylaws, and the agreement should not be terminated before the governing body has acted on the recommendation of the medical staff. Physician employment agreements should specify whether or not termination of employment is grounds for automatic termination of hospital medical staff membership or clinical privileges. When such cause is non- clinical or not otherwise a concern of the medical staff, the physician should be afforded whatever due process is outlined in the employer's human resources policies and procedures. (f) Physicians are encouraged to carefully consider the potential benefits and harms of entering into employment agreements containing without cause termination provisions. Employers should never terminate agreements without cause when the underlying reason for the termination relates to quality, patient safety, or any other matter that could trigger the initiation of disciplinary action by the medical staff. (g) Physicians are discouraged from entering into agreements that restrict the physician's right to practice medicine for a specified period of time or in a specified area upon termination of employment. (h) Physician employment agreements should contain dispute resolution provisions . If the parties desire an alternative to going to court, such as arbitration, the contract should specify the manner in which disputes will be resolved. 4. Hospital Medical Staff Relations a) Employed physicians should be members of the organized medic al staffs of the hospitals or health systems with which they have contractual or financial arrangements, should be subject to the bylaws of those medical staffs, and should conduct their professional activities according to the bylaws, standards, rules, and regulations and policies adopted by those medical staffs. b) Regardless of the employment status of its individual members, the organized medical staff remains responsible for the provision of quality care and must work collectively to improve patient c are and outcomes. Resolution: 616 (A-22) Page 5 of 5 c) Employed physicians who are members of the organized medical staff should be free to exercise their personal and professional judgment in voting, speaking, and advocating on any matter regarding medical staff matters and should not be deemed in breach of their employment agreements, nor be retaliated against by their employers, for asserting these interests. d) Employers should seek the input of the medical staff prior to the initiation, renewal, or termination of exclusive employment contracts. Refer to the AMA Conflict of Interest Guidelines for the Organized Medical Staff for further guidance on the relationship between employed physicians and the medical staff organization. 5. Peer Review and Performance Evaluations a) All physi cians should promote and be subject to an effective program of peer review to monitor and evaluate the quality, appropriateness, medical necessity, and efficiency of the patient care services provided within their practice settings. b) Peer review should follow established procedures that are identical for all physicians practicing within a given health care organization, regardless of their employment status. c) Peer review of employed physicians should be conducted independently of and without interference from any human resources activities of the employer. Physicians --not lay administrators --should be ultimately responsible for all peer review of medical services provided by employed physicians. d) Employed physicians should be accorded due process protections, including a fair and objective hearing, in all peer review proceedings. The fundamental aspects of a fair hearing are a listing of specific charges, adequate notice of the right to a hearing, the opportunity to be present and to rebut evi dence, and the opportunity to present a defense. Due process protections should extend to any disciplinary action sought by the employer that relates to the employed physician's independent exercise of medical judgment. e) Employers should provide employed physicians with regular performance evaluations, which should be presented in writing and accompanied by an oral discussion with the employed physician. Physicians should be informed before the beginning of the evaluation period of the general criteria t o be considered in their performance evaluations, for example: quality of medical services provided, nature and frequency of patient complaints, employee productivity, employee contribution to the administrative/operational activities of the employer, etc. (f) Upon termination of employment with or without cause, an employed physician generally should not be required to resign his or her hospital medical staff membership or any of the clinical privileges held during the term of employment, unless an independent action of the medical staff calls for such action, and the physician has been afforded full due process under the medical staff bylaws. Automatic rescission of medical staff membership and/or clinical privileges following termination of an employment agreement is tolerable only if each of the following conditions is met: i. The agreement is for the provision of services on an exclusive basis; and ii. Prior to the termination of the exclusive contract, the medical staff holds a hearing, as defined by the medical staff and hospital, to permit interested parties to express their views on the matter, with the medical staff subsequently making a recommendation to the governing body as to whether the contract should be terminated, as outlined in AMA Policy H -225.985; and iii. The agreement explicitly states that medical staff membership and/or clinical privileges must be resigned upon termination of the agreement. 6. Payment Agreements a) Although they typically assign their billing privileges to their employers, employed physicians or their chosen representatives should be prospectively involved if the employer negotiates agreements for them for professional fees, capitation or global billing, or shared savings. Additionally, employed physicians should be informed about the actual payment amount allocated to the professional fee component of the total payment received by the contractual arrangement. b) Employed physicians have a responsibility to assure that bills issued for services they provide are accurat e and should therefore retain the right to review billing claims as may be necessary to verify that such bills are correct. Employers should indemnify and defend, and save harmless, employed physicians with respect to any violation of law or regulation or breach of contract in connection with the employer's billing for physician services, which violation is not the fault of the employee. Our AMA will disseminate the AMA Principles for Physician Employment to graduating residents and fellows and will advocate for adoption of these Principles by organizations of physician employers such as, but not limited to, the American Hospital Association and Medical Group Management Association.

3 and 4 5 Whereas, Of indebted medical students, the mean educational debt of the medical school class 6 of 2021 was $203,062 1; and 7 8 Whereas, Cost is a significant barrier to student participation in the AMA's biannual meetings of 9 the MSS and HOD, in which the AMA -MSS generally meets for two to three days prior to the 10 House of Delegates (HOD) which meets for three or four additional days, with costs for the most 11 recent in- person Annual and Interim HOD meetings as follows: 12 Travel: 13 o ~$350- 550 round -trip airfare for each A -19 and I -19 trips, individually.2 14 Airport Transportation To/From Hotel 2019 HOD Meeting : $35 One way; 15 Two -trip 17 Lodging: o Meeting (Hyatt Regency in Chicago, IL): 19 Single: $255 per night plus tax = $299.34 per night 20 Double: $280 per night plus tax = $328.69 per night 21 o 2019 Interim Meeting (Manchester Grand Hyatt and Mariott Marquis in San 22 Diego, CA): 23 $285 per night plus tax = $321.28 per night.3 24 Food: 25 o 2019 Annual Meeting: 26 Chicago: $34/day.6 27 o 2019 Interim Meeting : 28 San Diego: $33/day.5 29 30 Whereas, All medical students are encouraged to attend the AMA -MSS meeting, and at least 31 one delegate and alternate delegate from every medical school is expected to be at the 32 assembly, and the HOD assembly is attended by student representatives from each region 33 based on total region membership, in addition to student councilors, a section delegate and 34 alternate delegate (MSS Internal Operating Procedures 10.4 through 10.4.6; AMA Bylaws 2.3 35 through 2.3.6, 7.3.3 through 7.3.4.3), MSS registrants at the A -19 MSS Meeti ng was 620 36 members and at the I -19 MSS Meeting was 711 members (data provided by staff); and 37 Resolution: 617 (A-22) Page 2 of 8 Whereas, In addition to the AMA -MSS Annual and Interim meetings, medical student members 1 may also participate in additional advocacy or region- specific conferences that require travel, 2 such as the AMA Medical Student Advocacy Conference (in Washington, DC) and Region- 3 specific Physicians of the Future Summits (held in various locations within each geographic 4 region); and 5 6 Whereas, Some MSS Regional Delegates and Alternate Regional Delegates to the HOD 7 receive financial support from their state delegations, but a 2022 survey of the MSS Caucus 8 showed that 51% of these delegates are receiving funding for travel and hotel, 12% for hotel 9 only, and 37% receive no state funding; and 10 11 Whereas, Many organizations provide funding for students to participate in their meetings, for 12 example: 13 the American College of Radiology (ACR) offers up to 15 stipends of $150 to qualified 14 medical students attending the ACR annual meeting when v irtual7 15 the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) provides 250 scholarships of $600 16 to attend their national conference8,9 17 the American Medical Women's Association (AMWA) gives scholarships to students and 18 has special consideration to students with leadership positions, presenting posters, 19 ambassadors, or who are traveling from far -away locations10 20 the American Psychiatric Association (APA) provides up to 30 medical students variable 21 funding to attend both the Annual Meeting and the Mental Health Ser vices Conference11 22 and specifically seeks to support underrepresented minority and racial/ethnic students 23 the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and American Academy of Neurology (AAN) also 24 offer travel awards specifically focused on diverse student popula tions in addition to a 25 general award12,13; and 26 27 Whereas, A study of the AAFP's funding mechanism and conference attendance demonstrated 28 that systematic programs to fund student participation in conferences increased attendance and 29 likelihood of future conf erence attendance9; and 30 31 Whereas, For general AMA -MSS members, until spring 2021 the sole AMA funding source for 32 travel was the Medical Student Outreach Program (MSOP) Recruitment Commission; MSOP is 33 a peer -to-peer mentorship initiative designed to promote first year medical student recruitment 34 and engagement and based on recruitment numbers from early April 2021, the average 35 Recruitment Commission per school would be around $550; median around $25014,15; and 36 37 Whereas, In March 2021, the AMA announced a new travel scholarship, for up to $1,000, for 38 one student from each MSS Region (seven students total), to be awarded for the first time for 39 the Annual 2022 Meeting, and as a part of the AMA Section Involvement Grant, MSOP 40 instituted an AMA Annual Meeti ng Travel Grant for students to attend the MSS June 2022 41 Meeting16,17; and 42 43 Whereas, The AMA Ambassador Program provides leadership and networking opportunities for 44 MSS members, including scholarships to attend and be trained at AMA advocacy 45 conferences18; and 46 47 Whereas, Besides the data from the informal poll above, data on student funding for meetings 48 are not available, and likewise neither are data on financial or other barriers to student 49 participation in AMA meetings; and 50 Resolution: 617 (A- 22) Page 3 of 8 Whereas, Our AMA is dedicated to the professional development of student, resident and 1 fellow, and young physician section representatives (G -600.030); therefore be it 2 3 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association explore mechanisms to mitigate costs 4 associated with medical student participation at national, in- person AMA conferences.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Diversity of AMA Delegations G -600.030 Our AMA encourages: (1) state medical societies to collaborate more closely with state chapters of medical specialty societies, and to include representatives of these organizations in their AMA delegations whenever feasible; (2) state medical associations and national medical specialty societies to review the composition of their AMA delegations with regard to enhancing diversity; (3) specialty and state societies to develop training and/or mentorship programs for their student, resident and fellow and young physician section representatives, and current HOD delegates for their future activities and representation of the delegation; (4) specialty and state societies to include in their delegations physicians who meet the criteria for membership in the Young Physicians Section; and (5) delegates and alternates who may be entitled to a dues exemption, because of age and retirement status, to demonstrate their full commitment to our AMA through payment of dues. CCB/CLRPD Rep. 3, A -12 Resolution: 617 (A- 22) Page 4 of 8 Diversity in the Physician Workforce and Access to Care D -200.982 Our AMA will: (1) continue to advocate for programs that promote diversity in the US medical workforce, such as pipeline programs to medical schools; (2) continue to advocate for adequate funding for federal and state programs that promote interest in practice in underserved areas, such as those under Title VII of the Public Health Service Act, scholarship and loan repayment programs under the National Health Services Corps and state programs, state Area Health Education Centers, and Conrad 30, and also encourage the development of a centralized database of scholarship and loan repayment programs; and (3) continue to study the factors that support and those that act against the choice to practice in an underserved area, and report the findings and solutions at the 2008 Interim Meeting. CME Rep. 7, A -08; Reaffirmation A -13; Reaffirmation: A -16; Reaffirmed: CME Rep. 5, A -21 Principles of and Actions to Address Medical Education Costs and Student Debt H -305.925 The costs of medical education should never be a barrier to the pursuit of a career in medicine nor to the decision to practice in a given specialty. To help address this issue, our American Medical Association (AMA) will: 1. Collaborate with members of the Federation and the medical education community, and with other interested organizations, to address the cost of medical education and medical student debt through public - and private- sector advocacy. 2. Vigorously advocate for and support expansion of and adequate funding for federal scholarship and loan repayment programs --such as those from the National Health Service Corps, Indian Health Service, Ar med Forces, and Department of Veterans Affairs, and for comparable programs from states and the private sector -- to promote practice in underserved areas, the military, and academic medicine or clinical research. 3. Encourage the expansion of National Institutes of Health programs that provide loan repayment in exchange for a commitment to conduct targeted research. 4. Advocate for increased funding for the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program to assure adequate funding of primary care within the National Health Service Corps, as well as to permit: (a) inclusion of all medical specialties in need, and (b) service in clinical settings that care for the underserved but are not necessarily located in health professions shortage areas. 5. Encourage the National Health Service Corps to have repayment policies that are consistent with other federal loan forgiveness programs, thereby decreasing the amount of loans in default and increasing the number of physicians practicing in underserved areas. 6. Work to reinstate the economic hardship deferment qualification criterion known as the \"20/220 pathway,\" and support alternate mechanisms that better address the financial needs of trainees with educational debt. 7. Advocate for federal legislation to support the creation of student loan savings accounts that allow for pre- tax dollars to be used to pay for student loans. 8. Work with other concerned organizations to advocate for legislation and regulation that would result in favorable terms and conditions for borrowing and for loan repayment, and would permit 100% tax deductibility of interest on student loans and elimination of taxes on aid from service- based programs. 9. Encourage the creation of private- sector financial aid programs with favorable interest rates or service obligations (such as community - or institution- based loan repayment programs or state medical society loan programs). 10. Support stable funding for medical education programs to limit excessive tuition increases, and collect and disseminate information on medical school programs that cap medical education debt, including the types of debt management education that are provided. 11. Work with state medical societies to advocate for the creation of either tuition caps or, if caps are not feasible, pre- defined tuition increases, so that medical students will be aware of their tuition and fee costs for the total period of their enrollment. 12. Encourage medical schools to (a) Study the costs and benefits associated with non- traditional instructional formats (such as online and distance learning, and combined baccalaureate/MD or DO programs) to determine if cost savings to medical schools and to medical students could be realized without jeopardizing the quality of medical education; (b) Engage in fundraising activities to increase the availability of scholarship support, with the support of the Federation, medical schools, and state and specialty medical societies, and develop or enhance financial aid opportunities for medical students, such as self-managed, low -interest loan programs; (c) Cooperate with postsecondary institutions to establish collaborative debt counseling for entering first -year medical students; (d) Allow for flexible scheduling for medical students who encounter financial difficulties that can be remedied only by employment, and consider creating opportunities for paid employment for medical students; (e) Counsel individual medical student borrowers on the status of their indebtedness and payment schedules prior to their graduation; (f) Inform students of all government loan opportunities and disclose the reasons that preferred lenders were chosen; (g) Ensure that all medical student fees are earmarked for specific and well -defined purposes, and avoid charging any overly broad and ill -defined fees, such as but not limited to professional fees; (h) Use their collective purchasing power to obtain discounts for their students on necessary Resolution: 617 (A- 22) Page 5 of 8 medical equipment, textbooks, and other educational supplies; (i) Work to ensure stable funding, to eliminate the need for increases in tuition and fees to compensate for unanticipated decreases in other sources of revenue; mid- year and retroactive tuition increases should be opposed. 13. Support and encourage state medical societies to support further expansion of state loan repayment programs, particularly those that encompass physicians in non- primary care specialties. 14. Take an active advocacy role during reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and similar legislation, to achieve the following goals: (a) Eliminating the single holder rule; (b) Making the availability of loan deferment more flexible, including broadening the definition of economic hardship and expanding the period for loan deferment to include the entire length of residency and fellowship training; (c) Retaining the option of loan forbearance for residents ineligible for loan deferment; (d) Including, explicitly, dependent care expenses in the definition of the \"cost of attendance\"; (e) Including room and board expenses in the definition of tax -exempt scholarship income; (f) Continuing the federal Direct Loan Consolidation program, including the ability to \"lock in\" a fixed interest rate, and giving consideration to grace periods in renewals of federal loan programs; (g) Adding the ability to refinance Federal Consolidation Loans; (h) Eliminating the cap on the student loan interest deduction; (i) Increasing the income limits for taking the interest deduction; (j) Making permanent the education tax incentives that our AMA successfully lobbied for as part of Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001; (k) Ensuring that loan repayment programs do not place greater burdens upon married couples than for similarly situated couples who are cohabitating; (l) Increasing efforts to collect overdue debts from the present medical student loan programs in a manner that would not interfere with the provision of future loan funds to medical students. 15. Continue to work with state and county medical societies to advocate for adequate levels of medical school funding and to oppose legislative or regulatory provisions that would result in significant or unplanned tuition increases. 16. Continue to study medical education financing, so as to identify long- term strategies to mitigate the debt burden of medical students, and monitor the short -and long- term impact of the economic environment on the availability of institutional and external sources of financial aid for medical students, as well as on choice of specialty and practice location. 17. Collect and disseminate information on successful strategies used by medical schools to cap or reduce tuition. 18. Continue to monitor the availability of and encourage medical schools and residency/fellowship programs to (a) provide financial aid opportunities and financial planning/debt management counseling to medical students and resident/fellow physicians; (b) work with key stakeholders to develop and disseminate standardized information on these topics for use by medical students, resident/fellow physicians, and young physicians; and (c) share innovative approaches with the medical education community. 19. Seek federal legislation or rule changes that would stop Medicare and Medicaid decertification of physicians due to unpaid student loan debt. The AMA believes that it is improper for physicians not to repay their educational loans, but assistance should be available to those physicians who are experiencing hardship in meeting their obligations. 20. Related to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, our AMA supports increased medical student and physician participation in the program, and will: (a) Advocate that all resident/fellow physicians have access to PSLF during their training years; (b) Advocate against a monetary cap on PSLF and other federal loan forgiveness programs; (c) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that any cap on loan forgiveness under PSLF be at least equal to the principal amount borrowed; (d) Ask the United States Department of Education to include all terms of PSLF in the contractual obligations of the Master Promissory Note; (e) Encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to require residency/fellowship programs to include within the terms, conditions, and benefits of program appointment information on the employer's PSLF program qualifying status; (f) Advocate that the profit status of a physician's training institution not be a factor for PSLF eligibility; (g) Encourage medical school financial advis ors to counsel wise borrowing by medical students, in the event that the PSLF program is eliminated or severely curtailed; (h) Encourage medical school financial advisors to increase medical student engagement in service -based loan repayment options, and other federal and military programs, as an attractive alternative to the PSLF in terms of financial prospects as well as providing the opportunity to provide care in medically underserved areas; (i) Strongly advocate that the terms of the PSLF that existed at the time of the agreement remain unchanged for any program participant in the event of any future restrictive changes; (j) Monitor the denial rates for physician applicants to the PSLF; (k) Undertake expanded federal advocacy, in the event denial rates for physician applicants are unexpectedly high, to encourage release of information on the basis for the high denial rates, increased transparency and streamlining of program requirements, consistent and accurate communication between loan servicers and borrowers, and clear expectations regarding oversight and accountability of the loan servicers responsible for the program; (l) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that applicants to the PSLF and its supplemental extensions, such as Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF), are provided with the necessary information to Resolution: 617 (A- 22) Page 6 of 8 successfully complete the program(s) in a timely manner; and (m) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that individuals who would otherwise qualify for PSLF and its supplemental extensions, such as TEPSLF, are not disqualified from the program(s). 21. Advocate for continued funding of programs including Income- Driven Repayment plans for the benefit of reducing medical student load burden. 22. Strongly advocate for the passage of legislation to allow medical students, residents and fellows who have education loans to qualify for interest -free deferment on their student loans while serving in a medical internship, residency, or fellowship program, as well as permitting the conversion of currently unsubsidized Stafford and Graduate Plus loans to interest free status for the duration of undergraduate and graduate medical education.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 618 (A-22) Introduced by: Oklahoma Subject: Extending the Delegate Apportionment Freeze During COVID -19 Pandemic Referred to: Reference Committee F Whereas, The COVID -19 pandemic has been difficult for physicians and the practice of 1 medicine; many physicians have elected not to renew their m emberships in organized medicine 2 due to numerous reasons; and 3 4 Whereas, 40% of the Oklahoma State Medical Association active dues paying members in 2021 5 and 36% in 2022 took a self -determined 50% dues reduction for the COVID -19 hardship; and 6 7 Whereas, Because of the COVID -19 pandemic, many state and specialty associations have not 8 been able to meet in person to utilize their usual platforms to promote the importance of 9 organized medicine; and 10 11 Whereas, At the November 2020 Special Meeting, the House of Delegates asked that our AMA 12 extend the current grace period from one year to two years for losing a delegate from a state 13 medical or national medical specialty society until the end of 2022; and 14 15 Whereas, The \"freeze\" adopted at November 2020 meeting pr oved to benefit 22 states, 16 Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, 17 Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 18 Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dak ota, Virginia, and Washington(1); and 19 20 Whereas, The current freeze has left the overall size of the House of Delegates unchanged and 21 will seat 693 delegates during 2022(2); and 22 23 Whereas, Many states and specialty societies have continued to have decreased AMA 24 membership; therefore be it 25 26 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association extend the current delegate apportionment 27 freeze for losing a delegate from a state medical or specialty society until the end of 2023. 28 (Directive to Take Action) 29 Fiscal Note: Minimal - less than OF DELEGATES Resolution: 619 (A-22) Introduced by: Texas, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania Subject: Focus and Priority for the AMA House of Delegates Referred to: Reference Committee F Whereas, The speakers of the American Medical Association House of Delegates established a 1 Resolutions Committee for the 2021 S pecial Meeting; and 2 3 Whereas, The Resolutions Committee will streamline and increase the efficiency of the 4 business of the house ; and 5 6 Whereas, Resolution 605, Nov. 21, was referred to the Board of Trustees for study with a verbal 7 request for a report back at the 2022 Annual Meeting, and no report has been issued; and 8 9 Whereas, The number of resolutions submitted to our AMA continues to remain very high; and 10 11 Whereas, Our AMA needs to prioritize and focus to develop policy and act on the issues that 12 are pertinent and important to practicing physicians;

Such legislation is recommended to include the 30 following: Compensation shall be paid in full by payers to physicians without deductible, 31 coinsurance, or copayment billable to patients; thus, patients will not bear the burden for such 32 processes imposed by payers. Physicians shall bill payers for time spent by physicians and their 33 staff in performing such tasks at a rate commensurate with that of the most highly trained 34 professionals. Payers shall pay physicians promptly upon receiving such a bill with significant 35 interest penalties assessed for delay in payment. Billable services for authorization and 36 preauthorization include, but are not limited to, time spent filling out forms, making telephone 37 calls (including time spent negotiating phone trees and hold time), documenting in the patient's 38 medical record, communicating with the patient, altering treatment plans (such as changing 39 medications to comply with formularies), printing, copying, and faxing.

Citation: Res. 206, I -20 Managed Care H -285.998 (1) Introduction The needs of patients are best served by free market competition and free choice by physicians and patients between alternative delivery and financing systems, with the growth of each system determined not by preferential regulation and subsidy, but by the number of persons who prefer that mode of delivery or financing. (2) Definition \"Managed care\" is defined as those processes or techniques used by any entity that delivers, administers, and/or assumes risk for health care services in order to control or influence the quality, accessibility, utilization, or costs and prices or outcomes of such services provided to a defined enrollee population. (3) Techniques Managed care techniques currently employed include any or all of the following: (a) prior, concurrent, or retrospective review of the quality, medical necessity, and/or appropriateness of services or the site of services; (b) controlled access to and/or coordination of services by a case manager; (c) efforts to identify treatment alternatives and to modify benefits for patients with high cost conditions; (d) provision of services through a network of contracting providers, selected and deselected on the basis of standards related to cost -effectiveness, quality, geographic location, specialty, and/or other criteria; (e) enrollee financial incentives and disincentives to use such providers, or specific service sites; and (f) acceptance by participating providers of financial risk for s ome or all of the contractually obligated services, or of discounted fees. (4) Case Management Health plans using the preferred provider concept should not use coverage arrangements which impair the continuity of a patient's care across different treatment settings. With the increased specialization of modern health care, it is advantageous to have one individual with overall responsibility for coordinating the medical care of the patient. The physician is best suited by professional preparation to assume t his leadership role. Resolution: 725 (A-22) Page 3 of 6 The primary goal of high- cost case management or benefits management programs should be to help to arrange for the services most appropriate to the patient's needs; cost containment is a legitimate but secondary objective. In developing an alternative treatment plan, the benefits manager should work closely with the patient, attending physician, and other relevant health professionals involved in the patient's care. Any health plan which makes available a benefits management program for individual patients should not make payment for services contingent upon a patient's participation in the program or upon adherence to treatment recommendations. (5) Utilization Review The medical protocols and review criteria used in any utilization revi ew or utilization management program must be developed by physicians. Public and private payers should be required to disclose to physicians on request the screening and review criteria, weighting elements, and computer algorithms utilized in the review pr ocess, and how they were developed. A physician of the same specialty must be involved in any decision by a utilization management program to deny or reduce coverage for services based on questions of medical necessity. All health plans conducting utilizat ion management or utilization review should establish an appeals process whereby physicians, other health care providers, and patients may challenge policies restricting access to specific services and decisions to deny coverage for services, and have the right to review of any coverage denial based on medical necessity by a physician independent of the health plan who is of the same specialty and has appropriate expertise and experience in the field. A physician whose services are being reviewed for medical necessity should be provided the identity of the reviewing physician on request. Any physician who makes judgments or recommendations regarding the necessity or appropriateness of services or site of services should be licensed to practice medicine and actively practicing in the same jurisdiction as the practitioner who is proposing or providing the reviewed service and should be professionally and individually accountable for his or her decisions. All health benefit plans should be required to clearly and understandably communicate to enrollees and prospective enrollees in a standard disclosure format those services which they will and will not cover and the extent of coverage for the former. The information disclosed should include the proportion of plan income devoted to utilization management, marketing, and other administrative costs, and the existence of any review requirements, financial arrangements or other restrictions that may limit services, referral or treatment options, or negatively affect the physician's fiduciary responsibility to his or her patients. It is the responsibility of the patient and his or her health benefits plan to inform the treating physician of any coverage restrictions imposed by the plan. All health plans utilizing managed care techniques should be subject to legal action for any harm incurred by the patient resulting from application of such techniques. Such plans should also be subject to legal action for any harm to enrollees resulting from failure to disclose prior to enrollment any coverage provisions; review requirements; financial arrangements; or other restrictions that may limit services, referral, or treatment options, or negatively affect the physician's fiduciary responsibility to his or her patient. When inordinate amounts of time or effort are involved in providing case management services required by a third party payer which entail coordinating access to other health care services needed by the patient, or in complying with utilization review requirements, the physician may charge the payer or the patient for the reasonable cost incurred. \"Inordinate\" efforts are defined as those \"more costly, complex and time- consuming than the completion of standard health insurance claim forms, such as obtaining preadmission certification, second opinions on elective surgery, certification for extended length of stay, and other authorizations as a condition of payer coverage.\" Any health plan or utilization management firm conducting a prior authorization program should act w ithin two business days on any patient or physician request for prior authorization and respond within one business day to other questions regarding medical necessity of services. Any health plan requiring prior authorization for covered services should pr ovide enrollees subject to such requirements with consent forms for release of medical information for utilization review purposes, to be executed by the enrollee at the time services requiring prior authorization are recommended by the physicians. In the absence of consistent and scientifically established evidence that preadmission review is cost -saving or beneficial to patients, the AMA strongly opposes the use of this process.

List services and prescription medications that require a PA on a website and ensure that patient informational materials inc lude full disclosure of any PA requirements. b. Notify providers of any changes to PA requirements at least 45 days prior to change. c. Improve transparency by requiring plans to report on the scope of PA practices, including the list of services and presc ription medications subject to PA and corresponding denial, delay, and approval rates. d. Standardize a PA request form. e. Minimize PA requirements as much as possible within each plan and eliminate the application of PA to services and prescription medic ations that are routinely approved. f. Pay for services and prescription medications for which PA has been approved unless fraudulently obtained. g. Allow continuation of medications already being administered or prescribed when a patient changes health plans, and only change such medications with the approval of the ordering physician. h. Make an easily accessible and responsive direct communication tool available to resolve disagreements between health plan and ordering provider. i.

Our AMA will oppose health plan determinations on physician appeals based solely on medical coding and advocate for such decisions to be based on the direct review of a physician of the same medical specialty/subspecialty as the prescribing/ordering physician. 3. Our AMA supports efforts to track and quantify the impact of health plans' prior authorization and utilization management processes on patient access to necessary care and patient clinical outcomes, including the extent to which these processes contribute to patient harm. 4.

(2) Third p arties should be required to make preauthorization statistics available, including the percentages of approval or denial. These statistics should be provided by various categories, e.g., specialty, medication or diagnostic test/procedure, indication offered, and reason for denial. Citation: Sub.

Such initiatives should provide for disclosure requirements, the conduct of review, and payer accountability. (1) Disclosure Requirements. Our AMA supports the development of model draft state and federal legislation to require disclosure in a clear and concise standard format by health benefit plans to prospective enrollees of information on (a) coverage provisions, benefits, and exclusions; (b) prior authorization or other review requirements, including claims review, which may affect the provision or coverage of services; (c) plan financial arrangements or contractual provisions that would limit the services offered, restrict referral or treatment options, or negatively affect the physician's fiduciary responsibility to his or her patient; (d) medical expense ratios; and (e) cost of health insurance policy premiums. (Ref. Cmt. G, Rec. 2, A -96; Reaffirmation A -97) Resolution: 725 (A-22) Page 5 of 6 (2) Conduct of Review. Our AMA supports the development of additional draft state and federal legislation to: (a) require private review entities and payers to disclose to physicians on request the screening criteria, weighting elements and computer algorithms utilized in the review process, and how they were developed; (b) require that any physician who recommends a denial as to the medical necessity of services on behalf of a review entity be of the same specialty as the practitioner who provided the services under review; (c) Require every or ganization that reviews or contracts for review of the medical necessity of services to establish a procedure whereby a physician claimant has an opportunity to appeal a claim denied for lack of medical necessity to a medical consultant or peer review group which is independent of the organization conducting or contracting for the initial review; (d) require that any physician who makes judgments or recommendations regarding the necessity or appropriateness of services or site of service be licensed to prac tice medicine in the same jurisdiction as the practitioner who is proposing the service or whose services are being reviewed; (e) require that review entities respond within 48 hours to patient or physician requests for prior authorization, and that they have personnel available by telephone the same business day who are qualified to respond to other concerns or questions regarding medical necessity of services, including determinations about the certification of continued length of stay; (f) require that any payer instituting prior authorization requirements as a condition for plan coverage provide enrollees subject to such requirements with consent forms for release of medical information for utilization review purposes, to be executed by the enrollee at t he time services requiring such prior authorization are recommended or proposed by the physician; and (g) require that payers compensate physicians for those efforts involved in complying with utilization review requirements that are more costly, complex and time consuming than the completion of standard health insurance claim forms. Compensation should be provided in situations such as obtaining preadmission certification, second opinions on elective surgery, and certification for extended length of stay. (3) Accountability. Our AMA believes that draft federal and state legislation should also be developed to impose similar liability on health benefit plans for any harm to enrollees resulting from failure to disclose prior to enrollment the information on plan provisions and operation specified under Section 1 (a) -(d) above.

(2) Reaffirms the following principles for evaluation of preadmission review programs, as adopted by the House of Delegates at the 1986 Annual Meeting: (a) Blanket preadmission review of all or the majority of hospital admissions does not improve the quality of care and should not be mandated by government, other payers, or hospitals. (b) Policies for review should be established by state or local physician review committees, and the actual review should be performed by physicians or under the close supervision of physicians. (c) Adverse decisions concerning hospital admissions should be finalized only by physician reviewers and only after the reviewing physician has discussed the case with the attending physician. (d) Al l preadmission review programs should provide for immediate hospitalization, without prior authorization, of any patient whose treating physician determines the admission to be of an emergency nature. (e) No preadmission review program should make a payment denial based solely on the failure to obtain preadmission review or solely on the fact that hospitalization occurred in the face of a denial for such admission.

It is the policy of the AMA to urge its constituent medical associations to (a) seek the enactment of legislation requiring that utilization review for insurers shall be conducted by physicians licensed by the state in which they are doing the review; and (b) seek enactment of legislation that would require all agencies or groups doing utilization review to be registered with the appropriate health regulatory agency of the state in which they are doing review and to have an appropriately staffed office located in the state in which they are doing the review. 2. Our AMA will continue to work with state medical associations to monitor utilization management policy Resolution: 727 (A-22) Page 2 of 2 to ensure that hospital admissions are reviewed by appropriately qualified physicians and promote related AMA model legislation. Citation: Sub. Res. 175, A -90; Reaffirmation A -97; Reaffirmation A -06; Appended: CMS Rep. 1, I -14; Reaffirmation: A -18 Principles of Drug Utilization Review H -120.978 Our AMA adopts the following Principles of Drug Utilization Review. Principle 1: The primary emphasis of a DUR program must be to enhance quality of care for patients by assuring appropriate drug therapy. Characteristics: (a) While a desired therapeutic outcome should be cost-effective, the cost of drug therapy should be considered only after clinical and patient considerations are addressed; (b) Sufficient professional prerogatives should exist for individualized patient drug therapy. Principle 2: Criteria and standards for DUR must be clinically relevant. Characteristics: (a) The criteria and standards should be derived through an evaluation of (i) the peer -reviewed clinical and scienti fic literature and compendia; (ii) relevant guidelines obtained from professional groups through consensus -derived processes; (iii) the experience of practitioners with expertise in drug therapy; (iv) drug therapy information supplied by pharmaceutical man ufacturers; and (v) data and experience obtained from DUR program operations. (b) Criteria and standards should identify underutilization as well as overutilization and inappropriate utilization. (c) Criteria and standards should be validated prior to use. Principle 3: Criteria and standards for DUR must be nonproprietary and must be developed and revised through an open professional consensus process. Characteristics: (a) The criteria and standards development and revision process should allow for and cons ider public comment in a timely manner before the criteria and standards are adopted. (b) The criteria and standards development and revision process should include broad- based involvement of physicians and pharmacists from a variety of practice settings. (c) The criteria and standards should be reviewed and revised in a timely manner. (d) If a nationally developed set of criteria and standards are to be used, there should be a provision at the state level for appropriate modification. Principle 4: Interventions must focus on improving therapeutic outcomes. Characteristics: (a) Focused education to change professional or patient behavior should be the primary intervention strategy used to enhance drug therapy. (b) The degree of intervention should match the severity of the problem. (c) All retrospective DUR profiles/reports that are generated via computer screening should be subjected to subsequent review by a committee of peers prior to an intervention. (d) If potential fraud is detected by the DUR system, t he primary intervention should be a referral to appropriate bodies (e.g., Surveillance Utilization Review Systems). (e) Online prospective DUR programs should deny services only in cases of patient ineligibility, coverage limitations, or obvious fraud. In other instances, decisions regarding appropriate drug therapy should remain the prerogative of practitioners. Principle 5: Confidentiality of the relationship between patients and practitioners must be protected. Characteristic: The DUR program must assure the security of its database. Principle 6: Principles of DUR must apply to the full range of DUR activities, including prospective, concurrent and retrospective drug use evaluation. Principle 7: The DUR program operations must be structured to achieve the principles of DUR. Characteristics: (a) DUR programs should maximize physician and pharmacist involvement in their development, operation and evaluation. (b) DUR programs should have an explicit process for system evaluation (e.g., total program costs, validation). (c) DUR programs should have a positive impact on improving therapeutic outcomes and controlling overall health care costs. (d) DUR programs should minimize administrative burdens to patients and practitioners. Citation: (BOT Rep.
