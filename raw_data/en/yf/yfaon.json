Is this true? Any precautions to keep in mind when doing a detox during summers? 8 Answers [Dr. Nadene Neale](/Expert/1492335-Nadene-Neale)Naturopathic Physician Vancouver, WA No type of diet, any time of year, detoxifying or not, should leave you dehydrated and weak. A naturopathic diet can also be called a functional diet, meaning it helps you avoid harm and feeds the function of your tissue. So when done correctly it improves hydration of your tissue and provides tissue with strengthening nutrients. Ideally a naturopathic diet would be your everyday diet that you only sometimes veer from. [Sarah Sue Myers](/Expert/2827741-Sarah-Sue-Myers)Naturopathic Physician Bellingham, WA I am not sure there is such thing as a \"naturopathic diet\"... Are you thinking about an intensive detox diet? Safe things to detox in the summer - sugar, animal products, alcohol, processed and refined foods. Anything beyond that, I would recommend working with a specialist / health professional - naturopathic doctor, nutritionist, functional medicine practitioner, Ayurvedic practitioner. [Krisel Nagallo](/Expert/81949689-Krisel-D-Nagallo)Naturopathic Physician Phoenix, AZ It is important that the nutritional plan is individualized for you to reduce these symptoms. Lack of proper hydration should be carefully monitored. AZ Hello! I'm not sure what you mean by a \"naturopathy diet\" as there isn't really *one* that would be called that. Most naturopathic doctors recommend various forms of a healthy, clean diet that is tailored to the individuals needs, or gives general guidelines, like eating mostly veggie and fruit with moderate amount of complex carbs and certain amount of complete proteins and healthy fats. Drinking plenty of water is always involved as is cutting out processed, high preservative foods and sugar filled foods! When a person eats healthy and eats the right amount for their activity level or detox program, it won't leave them dehydrated or weak as you asked. Regarding your other question on precautions for detoxing in the summer - yes, there are and the full list of precautions can vary by the type of detox program and the region you live in (ex: desert heat vs. upper northwest summers are not at all the same! And a basic, gentle detox program vs. hard core chelation detox are really not the same!!) I highly recommend talking to a health care professional experienced in detox programs to guide your summer detox to maximize success. In the meantime, make sure you stay well hydrated, get plenty of clean electrolytes, get plenty of gentle to moderate movement to pump your lymphatic system, and so things like dry skin brushing or other gentle toxin moving/eliminating steps.

[Dr. Dana Krete](/Expert/301546-Dana-Krete)Naturopathic Physician Middletown, CT There is really no such thing as a general \"naturopathic diet\". Generally naturopathic physicians recommend a diet based on whole, unprocessed foods, that is high in vegetables, fruits, fiber, and healthy fats, and contains adequate proteins. We generally recommend to avoid processed foods made out of processed sugar, flour, hydrogenated fats, preservatives and chemical additives. There are many ways to detox during summer, or any season, that would not leave a person dehydrated and weak. Naturopathic physicians tend to recommend diets, or detox programs that include plenty of hydration and nutrients, and will help a person to feel better, not worse. If you have tried a special diet or detox program that left you feeling not well, it may not have been a sound program, or it just wasn't the right one for you. I would recommend seeing a licensed naturopathic physician to get an individualized program that will benefit your health and leave you feeling vibrant and full of energy. [Carolyn Ledowsky](/Expert/8134431-Carolyn-Ledowsky)Naturopathic Physician Neutral Bay, New South Wales Hello, thanks for your question. If you are talking about a detox diet, that is very different from a naturopathic diet. The most important thing to remember when detoxing is that you don't do it longer than 48 hours without practitioner supervision. Don't detox if you are really unwell.

White](/Expert/81226047-Chrisenia-M-White)Acupuncturist Fairfax, VA It wil depend on the diet you are on. There is no one specific naturopathic diet. A diet recommended by a naturopathic physician is created based on the individual (paleo, gluten free, blood type, elimination and many others). You may be referring to a diet that focuses on detoxing, if so this type of diet can cause cause an electrolyte imbalance at any time, but more so in the summer, due to increased temperatures and increased sweating. If you have not consulted with a naturopathic physician yet, I recommend doing so to make sure your body can handle a detox during the summer as this is not for everyone. Overall, remaining hydrated, not exerting yourself and knowing your limits is key because an electrolyte imbalance is dangerous. "}
