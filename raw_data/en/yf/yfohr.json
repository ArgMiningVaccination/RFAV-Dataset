MD (Ay) Pizichil is the Malayalam Dhara Ayurvedic treatment. It is a specialty treatment from the closet of Ayurvedic time tested experience which is known for its exemplary benefits in psycho-somatic healing. Pizhichil is a treatment procedure in which the herbal oils and or ghee are poured over the body of the patient in monitored streams for a fixed duration of time. It is a type of Parisheka Sweda (steaming or sweat inducing treatment in which hot or warm liquids are poured or sprinkled or showered over the body in streams). Thus, Kaya Seka or Pizhichil is a type of Sarvanga dhara (hot fomentation given by pouring hot or warm medicated liquids over the body in the form of shower or stream) in which herbal oils or ghee or a combination of both is used for stream pouring. In Pizhichil, along with pouring of the stream of oil, simultaneous massage is done to enhance benefits of the treatment. Category of Pizhichil / Kaya-Seka: Kayaseka or Pizichil falls into the category of Swedana (fomentation, sweat inducing, sudation) type of treatment. To be precise, it falls into the Parisheka Sweda (stream pouring of medicated liquids like oil, ghee, milk, kashayam, buttermilk etc) sub-category of Swedana Chikitsa. Before knowing what Pizhichil or Kaya Seka is, I will try to give you all a brief introduction of Swedana and Parisheka Sweda for a better understanding. Table of Contents Swedana introduction Swedana - Introduction to sweating therapy: Swedana or fomentation (sudation, sweat inducing treatments, steaming treatment) is a specialized treatment of Ayurveda which helps in providing unparalleled relief in pain, swelling and stiffness associated with many systemic diseases, especially in rheumatological conditions like Amavata vis-\u00e0-vis Rheumatoid arthritis, Fibromyalgia and many types of a treatment procedure in which sweat is induced by application of heat and warmth in the form of steam or by bringing the body / body parts in contact with heated medicaments (powders, leaves, processed rice, sand etc) tied in boluses. Swedana provides relief from Stambha (stiffness and catches), Gaurava (heaviness) and Sheeta (coldness) in the body or body parts. Swedana is said to be the best form of treatment in expelling morbid Vata and Kapha and also destroying the diseases manifested due to morbid Vata and Kapha. Swedana is usually done after Abhyanga and or Snehana (administration of medicated oils and ghee for oral consumption in metered doses, as a pre-treatment procedure for cleansing treatments like Vamana - Therapeutic vomiting and Virechana - Therapeutic purgation). After Swedana, the body starts sweating, we feel lighter and energetic, and the cells get activated and flush the toxins away. The cellular metabolism improves and we feel light and at ease. There are many types of Swedana as explained in Ayurvedic texts. There are about 13 types of Sagni Sweda's (sweat inducing treatments administered by procedures involving utilisation of fire or heated materials) and 10 types of Niragni Sweda (sweat inducing treatments where in the fire or heated materials are not utilised ex. sleeping covering thick blankets until we sweat etc). Again, Swedana can be done in 2 ways - Ruksha Sweda (dry fomentation) and Snigdha Sweda (wet fomentation or sweat inducing treatment done after giving oil massage or by using the medicinal drugs which are processed or fried in herbal oils). In some pathological conditions both forms can be skilfully combined as and when required. In conditions where pain and associated symptoms are due to ama (metabolic toxins having a sticky nature, tending to block the transport systems of the body and cause painful conditions), meda (contaminated or accumulated fat) and or kapha (morbid kapha) we generally prefer doing Ruksha Sweda or dry fomentation. In conditions where the pain and related symptoms are due to vitiation of only morbid Vayu, we generally prefer Snigdha Sweda (wet or unctuous fomentation) Every form of Sweda can provide relief from pain, stiffness and swelling. But their area of utilisation and the diseases and pathological conditions in which they are administered or preferred will differ. In this context I would limit my discussion to Parisheka Sweda (warm medicated liquids stream pouring type of fomentation) with special reference to Sarvanga Sagni Sweda and drava sweda (sweating or steaming treatments wherein hot or warm medicated liquids are used) Note - Ama means metabolic wastes created by low metabolism and indigestion which have a sticky nature and has a tendency to produce pain and stiffness. Meda or sprinkling or showering of warm kwatha (decoction or herbal extract) prepared with herbs which destroy or pacify Vata or Vata-Kapha morbidity over the body is called Parisheka. Since it is a type of Swedana or sweat inducing treatment the word Sweda has been added as a suffix to Parisheka. Thus Parisheka Sweda means stream pouring of hot medicinal liquids over the body so as to produce sweating. Other names for Parisheka - Dhara, Seka, Kayaseka, Pizhichil pouring medicated oil) Parisheka, like any other form of Sweda is done to a person who has undergone Abhyanga (herbal oil massage). Thus Abhyanga forms an essential Purva-karma (pre-treatment procedure) for Parisheka. Parisheka is done in 3 different ways (depending on the equipment used for conducting Parisheka): Kumbha Parisheka - In this the medicaments (Kwatha) is filled in a small earthen pot or metal pot with a small tube fitted to it with its one end opening into the space of the pot and the other end at the rear end of the tube. The tube has a u bend at the centre so that the liquid does not rush out of the pot once for all. The vessel is filled with liquid. The masseur tilts the pot to an adjusted angle such that the liquid falls on the body of the person subjected with Abhyanga through the tube is a small stream. The liquid is poured all over the body. Alternatively, the pot itself has an orifice at the end into which cotton wick or wick of a sterile cloth is fit. In this set up the pot doesn't consist of the lateral tube. The medicine dribbles through the wick and falls in stream over the body of the patient. Another variant is a small vessel or pot with a tapering orifice. The liquid is poured in streams through this narrow tapering passage. Varshulika Parisheka - Varshulika is a pot which is also called sahsradhara which means 1000 orifices. As the name indicates, the bottom of the pot has many small holes. When the vessel is filled with the liquid, it falls as a stream of shower over the body of the patient who has been given a massage. Pranadika Parisheka - Pranadika means a tube. It is a modification of Varshulika. Just as in Kumbha Parisheka, the pot or vessel will have a bent tube fit to one of its lateral walls. At the end of the tube a cap with many holes is fit. Just as in Varshulika, the liquid falls as a stream of shower over the body of the person after he has taken a massage. The medicated liquid filled in the vessel or pot may be Kashaya (decoction), Ksheera (milk), Dhanyamla (fermented liquid), Ghrita (ghee), etc. all these are called Dhara or Parisheka. The names will follow the material or liquid used. Ex. When milk is used, the treatment will be called as Ksheera Dhara, when oil is used it will be called Taila Dhara etc. Sarvang Taila Dhara wherein the medicated oils or ghee or both are poured in streams over the body of the patient for an allotted period of time is called Pizichil or Kaya Seka. Synonyms Pizichil full body, Seka means steaming through stream pouring (showering or sprinkling) of hot or warm medicated (herbal) oils. Thus Kaya Seka means stream pouring or showering of warm medicated / herbal oils / ghee or oil and ghee mixed together over the entire body. Kerala people call it as Pizhichil. As discussed already it is a type of Parisheka Sweda. It is also a sub-type of Sarvanga dhara (Sarvanga=full body, dhara=pouring of medicaments or medicated liquids like milk, oil, buttermilk etc in stream or shower method). It is highly beneficial in tackling Vata disorders like neuromuscular and musculoskeletal disorders, diseases like osteoarthritis, myalgia, fibromyalgia, paralysis, GB Syndrome etc. Sneha-dhara is best in dealing degenerative conditions. It can also be used in high pitta conditions wherein inflammation and inflammatory changes are predominant. The choice of medicines should be skilfully done after a thorough diagnosis in either case. Its sub-types are as below mentioned: Taila dhara - medicated oils are used Ghrita dhara - medicated ghee is used Yamaka dhara - medicated oils and ghee are used together as a combination or the medicine itself is prepared having both ghee and oil as base substances Indications Sarvanga Sneha dhara is highly beneficial in the below said conditions - Paralysis - It is the loss of muscle function in part of your body (one or more muscles). It can be accompanied by a loss of feeling (sensory loss) in the affected area if there is sensory damage as well as motor. It happens when something wrong happens with the way messages pass between your brain and muscles. It can be complete or partial; can occur on one or both sides of your body. (Hemiplegia - paralysis of one side, Diplegia - Paralysis affecting symmetrical parts of the body, Facial paralysis etc) Hemiparesis - It is the weakness of the entire left or right side of the body. Poliomyelitis - It is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system. Children younger than 5 years are the victims. (The disease has been largely eradicated) Paraplegia - It describes complete or incomplete paralysis affecting the legs and possible also the trunk, but not the arms. It is usually caused by spinal cord injury or a congenital condition such as spina-bifida that affects the neural elements of the spinal canal. Osteoarthritis (Sandhigata Vata) - Osteoarthritis is the common form of arthritis. It results from the breakdown or damage of protective joint cartilage on the ends of the bones and underlying bone. OA can affect and damage any joint in the body. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Joint swelling and decreased range of movements are also present in many cases. This treatment helps in preventing the degeneration process from progressing and strengthens the joints and muscles. Rheumatoid Arthritis (Amavata) - It is a chronic progressive disease causing inflammation in the joints and resulting in painful deformity and immobility, especially in the fingers, wrists, feet and ankles. It has an autoimmune component also. Pizichil will be useful in the chronic stages of RA (Jeerna or pravruddha Amavata) wherein the inflammation and the stage of ama have subsided but pain has been left over. This will serve the purpose of rejuvenating and strengthening the joints, muscles and soft tissues. It can also be applied when RA has developed complications in the later stages. It will help in improvising the movements. Musculo-skeletal pains as in myalgia and or fibromyalgia (Mamsagata Vata) after getting rid of ama by suitable medications. Neuromuscular diseases and various musculoskeletal disorders Emaciation / Wasting diseases (Karshya, Shosha) Vertebral or spine pain including Ankylosing Spondylitis - It is a form of arthritis which primarily affects the spine. It causes severe inflammation of the vertebrae that might eventually lead to chronic pain and disability. The disease will cause pain and stiffness in other parts of your body. Other large joints such as the shoulders, hips and knees can be involved as well. Polymyalgia Rheumatica - It is an inflammatory disorder that causes pain and stiffness in various parts of the body. It commonly affects neck, shoulders, arms, thighs and hips. Fibromyalgia - It is a rheumatic condition characterized by muscular or musculoskeletal pain with stiffness and localized tenderness at specific points on the body Guillain Barre Syndrome - It is a rare condition in which your immune system attacks your nerves leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis. There is a rapid onset of muscle weakness as a result of damage of the peripheral nervous system Spinal stenosis - It is a condition in which the spinal column (backbone or spine) narrows and starts compressing the spinal cord. It is a gradual process. The symptoms include leg or arm weakness, lower back pain while standing or walking, numbness in legs or buttocks and balance problems. Spina bifida (occulta) - It is a birth defect where there is an incomplete closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. It presents with leg weakness and paralysis, club foot, hip dislocation, bladder and bowel control problems etc Pains and catches in the joints and spine (especially neck and low back) due to bad postures Pain due to repeated trauma of bones, joints, muscles, soft tissues Sthanika sneha dhara - Localized streaming of oil / liquids is effective in - Coccydynia - Tail bone pain Frozen Shoulder - Chronic pain and stiffness of the shoulder joint with limitation of range of movements, also known as adhesive capsulitis Patello-femoral pain syndrome (Chondromalacia patellae) - This often results from issues associated with muscle imbalance, tightness and alignment of the legs, rather than an injury. Pain is present between the patella and the underlying thighbone (femur). Old (chronic) joint injuries which was not properly treated, sprained ligaments, cartilage tears, sports injuries, sprains and strains Elbow pain due to various conditions like Tendinitis, Olecranon bursitis, elbow sprain, cellulitis, arthritis, or Lumbago (Lumbar spondylosis) Sacroiliac Joint Syndrome displacement of a vertebra, especially a 5th lumbar vertebra) Benefits Other Vrishataa - acts as an aphrodisiac Deha sthairyam - makes the body strong Agni sthairyam - establishes the normalcy of digestive fire and corrects metabolism Varna sthairyam - provides and establishes proper colour Ojo sthairyam - stabilises and fortifies ojus in the body (ojus is the essence of all the tissues formed as an end product of tissue formation, its normalcy in terms of quality and quantity points towards an established immunity.

Sarvangadhara said method - Purvakarma Purvakarma (Pre-treatment procedures): This includes - Preparation of the patient: The patient is thoroughly examined. The Prakriti (basic constitution) and Vikriti (details of morbidity) are documented in detail. The disease is also examined. After careful assessment, it is decided if Kaya Seka is suitable to the disease and diseased or not. The treatment line-up, materials and medicines which need to be used are enlisted. Preparation for the treatment: Materials needed for the treatment are collected beforehand. They are: For Sneha dhara (Kaya seka, Pizichil) - medicated oils and ghee are collected. Sneha dhara can be done just by using gingely oil / sesame oil or ghee of cow. The below mentioned taila's / ghrita's are used in Sneha dhara or Tailam is used in Vata morbidity etc. Doctors can do the permutations and combinations of choice of medicine and their subtypes based on their wisdom and experience. Sarvanga Tailadhara can also be done in healthy individuals. For them oil and ghee should be mixed in equal proportions for conducting dhara. In predominance of Vata, Kapha or Vata-Kapha morbidity or diseases caused due to them, warm or hot oil should be used. In case of Pitta predominance or Pitta disorders, cold oils should be used. In Pitta disorders, warm oil or ghee can be used for dhara or parisheka. Oil, ghee and or muscle fat (vasa) shall be used in predominance of Vata, In morbidity wherein vitiated pitta and rakta (blood) are associated ghee shall be used for stream pouring, Tila taila (sesame oil) should be used in Kapha disorders, In disorders caused by vitiated Vata, Pitta and Rakta - oil and ghee should be mixed in equal proportions to conduct dhara and in Kapha association oil and ghee should be taken in 1:1/2 proportions. For Tala-dharana: Since Tala-dharana should be done during Pizhichil or Sneha-dhara (Sarvanga dhara) - the materials required for it also should be kept ready - Amalaki churna (fine powder of Indian gooseberry), Bandage dhara (stream pouring of medicated oils over the head) also can be carried out simultaneously as per the preference of the doctor. The oils which will be mentioned below for usage in Abhyanga (massage) can be used for massage. The other materials needed for Kaya seka / Pizhichil - For Abhyanga (massage) - Taila (medicated oil), Ghee (medicated ghee) or both suitable to the disease and diseased are collected and stored beforehand. Some effective oils used for Abhyanga are the body constitution, morbid doshas and nature of morbidity involved Small vessels for heating oil Spoons Stove for heating Sterile clothes, sponges, napkins or tissue papers for wiping etc Deepana-Pachana - Kaya Seka or Pizhichil should be done only after having got rid of ama (cellular toxins formed due to sluggish metabolism and having capacity to clog the cells and channels of the body) by skilful and timely administration of Deepana (medicines and treatments which kindle the digestive fire and correct the metabolism) and Pachana (medicines and treatments which destroy and expel ama). They should essentially be administered for 1-2 weeks before Kaya seka. If the treatment is done without administration of Deepana-Pachana, the morbidity, disease and symptoms may aggravate instead of getting pacified. These medicines can also be administered parallel with treatment. The best herbs used for Deepana are - Pippali - Piper longum Pippalimula Trachyspermum ammi etc The best medicines which can get rid of ama are - Dhanyaka - Coriander Musta - Cyperus rotundus Syzygium aramaticum etc In this the heated oils or ghee or ghee mixed oils need to be continuously poured over the body for a fixed duration of time until sweating occurs and the patient starts feeling light and good. Massage is also given to the patient to induce sweating and to give relaxation. The patient fit for and chosen for Kaya Seka or Parisheka sweda is made to sit in the Droni, a special type of table made in the shape of a boat, with elevated edges all around. Dhara Droni or Dhara Table - The table is made up of woods of medicinal plants like Plaksha (Ficus dimensions are that which can accommodate the body of an average individual. The foot end of the table consists of an orifice or a tapered opening through which the liquid poured over the patient's body flows down into a collection vessel. This collected liquid can be reheated and reused for the Dhara until the completion of treatment duration. Similarly at the head end, there is an elevation for headrest which forms a bridge between an elongated portions of the table meant to accommodate the rest of the body from a small chamber (portion of table) which is extended behind the head end. The oils poured on the head as a part of Sneha Shirodhara collects in this chamber and flows back into an orifice or tapered opening at its centre a few inches away from the crown of the head and gets collected in another collection pot. This too can be recycled and reused just like the oil of Pizhichil is done. Dhara droni is generally mounted on a frame consisting of 4 limbs of convenient height so that the masseurs can easily carry out the treatment procedure on the patient sleeping on it. Alternatively, the Droni can be kept on the floor on a small raised platform so that the vessels can be kept below the openings at the foot and head ends of the table. The masseurs in this case can sit around the table (instead of standing) and conduct the treatment. Dhara patra (Dhara pot or vessel) - The dhara pot too is made up of the similar material as is the table. It is also made up of metals like silver, brass or earthen pot. A small hole which entertains the finger of the patient into it is made at the bottom. It is fit with a sterile cotton or cloth wick in case of Shiro-dhara pot. The Shirodhara pot is fit to an adjustable stand such that it is hung a few inches above the centre of the forehead. Swasthi Vachana (welfare prayers) - The patient should be brought on to the table after having performed the prayers, worship and recited holy hymns as a ritualistic practise. This is done for the welfare of the patient and for the success of the treatment. The patient should have undressed to their convenience for better results. Alternatively they may be allowed to wear a thin dress (after having conducted massage) Abhyangam (herbal oil massage) - Head and body massage is given with one among the above said oils for 15-20 minutes. Any other suitable oil can be used as per the choice of the physician. Abhyanga can be considered as Purvakarma (pre-treatment procedure) for Pizhichil but I have included it in the discussion of the treatment proper because it is done in continuation with dhara (immediately before dhara). For massage - oils prepared with herbs having hot potency should be used for the body and oils prepared with herbs having cold potency are used for head. Oils can also be used as per the disease and morbidity of doshas. Ex. Sahacharadi in Vata morbidity etc. Tala-dharana (application and tying of coolant medicines over the head) - A small pre-treatment procedure called Amalaki Tala-dharana is done mandatorily after massage. On the previous Parisheka Sweda officinalis) 10 tola (120 grams) in quantity is boiled and processed in 20 tola (240 grams) of buttermilk. When being processed it gains semisolid consistency, the contents are grinded and made into a soft mass. It is kept in a cool place for cooling. This paste is used for Tala Dharana. Tala Dharana means applying the paste on the crown of the head and tie a bandage cloth around it to keep it in position such that the knot occupies the place near the ear. To do this, a small compartment / cabin with elevated walls is constructed with the paste of Amalaki so as to cover a small area on the crown of the scalp. The space within the wall of the cabin is filled with coolant oils like Chandanabala Lakshadi Tailam etc. Over this, leaf of a plant having a capacity of alleviating Vata like leaf of Nirgundi (Vitex negundo), Eranda Patra (castor leaf) etc is placed. A bandage cloth is wrapped around the construction and the knot is tied near the ear. Sarvanga taila dhara /Pizhichil (Kaya seka, Parisheka) is a procedure which includes pouring of hot medicinal liquids over the body of the patient for more than 1 hour. The head might affect the brain and sense organs in due process. To protect these organs, Amalaki Tala Dharana is done. This provides a coolant effect on the body and mind of the patient. If Tala-dharana is not done, pitta gets aggravated due to heat and the aggravated Pitta causes symptoms like giddiness, burning sensation, feeling of darkness in front of the eyes, fainting etc. When doing Dhara for a part of the body like low back or lower limb or upper limb or shoulder, we need not tie the Tala-dharana since the heat will be provided for a portion of the body and for a short time. Alternately a sterile cloth (thin) is tied over the head while doing Shiro-dhara to avoid spilling of the liquid contents into the eyes. As a precaution during Kaya seka or Shiro dhara, sterile cotton pads are kept over the closed eyes of the patient to avoid sprinkling of medicaments into the eye. Pradhana Karma The oil is poured over the body and massage at the same time. We need at least 4 attendants or masseurs to carry on the treatment in a synchronized and uninterrupted way on either side of the patient. The stream pouring of liquid medicines over the body of the patient on both sides of the body (left and right) should be done in a rhythmic way by all the 4 masseurs. They should be trained in such a way that they should be able to efficiently carry out the treatment procedure. 2 masseurs should stand on one side of the patient and the other 2 on other side. We need a 5th person as helper (can have 2 helpers too). He should be standing near the stove, on which the vessel consisting of liquid medicines is being heated on mild flame. He will be constantly supplying heated liquid medicines to the masseurs. As and when the liquid collected in the vessels at the foot and head end of the table lose temperature, the masseurs return it to the helpers and in turn receive the heated liquid medicine from him. This method is conducted for the prescribed duration without interruption. Care should be taken that neither the bolus nor the body of the patient gets cold at any point of the treatment (The only exception being Sarvanga dhara done with cold liquids in case of Pitta and Rakta morbidity). This is possible only with a cyclic synchronizing between the main masseurs and the helpers in terms of how they keep changing and exchanging the liquid so as to maintain the heat throughout the treatment procedure. The masseurs should not only be skilled but also should be compassionate towards the patient. Two masseurs should take in charge of stream pouring the herbal liquids over the body of the patient in a gentle way and cover the lower portion of the body i.e. one masseur should attend the hip, buttock, anterior and posterior portions of thigh, leg, knee, ankle and lumbo-sacral area on the right side and the other masseur on the left side. The other 2 masseurs should carry on the procedure simultaneously on the upper portion of the body. One among them should cover the abdomen, chest, sides of the chest, flanks, upper back, neck (nape), shoulder, elbow, wrist and small joints of the hands, arm and forearm of the right side and the other masseur should cover the left side of the body. The treatment should be carried out in a skillful and synchronized way on both left and right sides of upper and lower portions of the body by all the 4 masseurs in an uninterrupted way. The masseurs should have small Dhara pots in their hands (1 pot in each masseur's hands). The liquids filled in it should be allowed gently and in a synchronized way on the patient's body in the form of stream. The stream should neither be too thick nor too thin, not falling in a rush or too slowly, neither too hot not too cold. It should neither fall from a lot of height from the patient's body nor from too proximal distance. The procedure should be done so gently that it should not create a fear in the mind of the patient. Alternately, Kaya Seka / Pizhichil should be done with the help of sterile cloths of 18\u00d718 inches dimension dipped in the dhara liquids. The masseur should take the cloth in his hand and squeeze in such a way the liquid should fall on the body of the patient in a stream flowing through his thumb which is pointing towards the body of the patient. While the masseur uses his right hand to squeeze the cloth and allow the stream to fall on the body of the patient, he should simultaneously stroke the body part on which the liquid is falling and give a light massage through his left hand. In Kaya Seka the medicine should fall on the body of the patient from a height of 12 angula's (i.e. approximately 9 inches). The temperature of the liquid medicine should be only so much that it is tolerable to the patient. The masseur's should therefore check the temperature of the liquid every time before pouring it on the patient's body. If the drava (dhara liquid) is too hot, it may cause burns and if it is not hot, the objective of Swedana is not achieved and there is no relief from the disease. Experienced masseurs will be able to do it to the perfection. Before doing the Dhara, the masseurs should allow the stream of liquid to fall on their left hand and test the temperature and conduct the Dhara after confirming that the patient can tolerate that temperature. The patient also should be asked if he or she can tolerate that particular temperature. Their consent forms a yardstick so as to what temperature they can tolerate. This comes only by experience. The oil poured in stream over the body of the patient (or on head as in Shirodhara) flows through the tapered opening at the foot end of the table and gets collected in a vessel kept beneath it after flowing through a pipe connected to the opening. In some tables, the tapered end bends towards and extends downwards, opening into the collecting vessel. Recycling of oil - The helper (5th person) collects the oil in the vessel, heats it and gives it back to the masseurs for conducting Pizichil. This procedure is done until the duration meant to conduct Kaya Seka gets completed. Care should be taken to see that the oil used in dhara should not get cooled throughout the length of the treatment. Maintenance of uniform temperature of the oil is important in Sarvangadhara. The helpers should be sharp and quick enough to heat the oil and give it back to the masseurs conducting Kaya Seka. Change of oil in Kaya Seka: The oil or ghee or ghee mixed oil shall also be changed once in 3 days. Generally the oil used on first day is used for 3 days. This oil is stored in a bottle or vessel. On 4th day fresh oil is taken. This oil is used for Parisheka unto 6th day. On 7th day, both this oil is mixed with the oil used for first 3 days and Pizhichil is carried out. Again on the 8th day fresh oil is taken for the treatment. For best results of the treatment, the oil should be changed on daily basis. Since the medicinal oils will be very costly and will add on to the cost of the treatment, everyone cannot afford to get it changed every day. When the same oil is used on 2nd day or 3rd day, the sweat and dirt of the body too gets mixed in the oil which may lessen its efficacy. For those who cannot afford the cost of the treatment, the same oil can be continued for 7 days. Duration of treatment: As a general rule, Kaya seka should be done until the proper signs of Swedana (sweating treatment) have occurred or until the patient sweats When the body is too dry and the morbidity is caused by pitta associated with Vata - Parisheka sweda can be done for 72 minutes In the patient afflicted by morbidity and unctuousness of Kapha - Kaya Seka or Pizhichil shall be done for 36 minutes Duration for Sneha Sarvangadhara or Pizichil: Again as a rule sweating is an indication for stoppage of treatment, i.e. Sarvanga Sneha dhara shall be done until sweating occurs. For this to happen 1 \u00bd hours (3 \u00bd nadika kala) will disorders, Sarvanga sneha dhara can be done up to 2 hours time duration (5 nadika kala) In Vata-Kapha disorders - up to 1 and a half hours (3 \u00bd nadika kala) Parisheka sweda method should reach all parts of the body. To achieve this, the procedure should be carried out in all the 7 postures in which Abhyanga (herbal oil massage) is done. Cost of Pizhichil: Varies from 1,000 Indian Rupees to 4,000 rupees. The 7 postures of doing Kaya Seka are, keeping patient in - Sitting posture Sleeping by facing the roof (supine position) Sleeping in left lateral position (towards left) Sleeping on tummy (prone position or face downwards) Sleeping in right lateral position (towards right) Sleeping back by facing the roof Sitting posture The treatment procedure is carried out for 10-15 minutes in each posture. Thus the time duration of the treatment ranges from 70-105 minutes. By the time we finish off this procedure, the patient would be sweating, which gives a sign to stop the treatment. According to dhara kalpa book - the oil will enter the orifices of skin within 300 matra kala (1/2 minute approximately) of stream pouring. The oil is said to reach the roots of other tissues within 300-500 matra kala. Signs of proper fomentation Properly done sweating therapy brings about the below said signs - Sheetoparama - The feeling of coldness pacifies Shuloparama - Pacification of pain Stambha nigraha - reduction of stiffness Gaurava nigraha - reduction of the feeling of heaviness Maardava - smoothness of the body or body parts Sweda praadurbhaava - sweating of body or body parts subjected to fomentation Roga lakshana prashamanam - Pacification or reduction of the symptoms of the disease Sheetaartitvam - Liking towards taking cold foods and comforts Care should also be taken so as to see that the patient is not subjected to excessive or deficit sweating Parameters for improper / less sweating (Asamyak / Heena Swinna / Aswinna Lakshana) - In this the symptoms opposite to those explained in the Ati Swinna Lakshana are manifested i.e. Sheeto anuparama - no relief from the feeling of cold Shula anuparamam - non-pacification of pain Stambha anigraha - no relief from stiffness Gaurava anigraha - no relief from heaviness Amaardavam - lack of smoothness of the part Aswedam - absence of manifestation of sweat Alaghutvam - no feeling of lightness Vyadhi anupashama - no relief from disease Parameters of excessive / over sweating (Ati Swinna Lakshana) - Pitta prakopa - aggravation of rakta Trushna - thirst Murcha - loss of consciousness Svara sadana - weakness of voice Anga sadana - weakness of the body Bhrama - giddiness peeda - Seka, the person should be allowed to relax for a while. The body should not be immediately exposed to cold or cold measures. Doing so might induce some symptoms like cold, muscle cramps etc. The Tala-dharana is slowly removed; the construction of Amalaki and the containing oil are also removed. The head should be wiped off with a sterile cloth. Abhyanga - After a while, the patient is once again given a soothing massage. The whole body and the head should be given massage with herbal oil. Snana - Following the massage a hot water bath should be given. Alternatively water boiled with Nirgundi (Vitex negundo), Nimba (neem) or Dashamula (10 roots) shall be used for bathing purpose. Patient is advised to take a refreshing hot water bath after going home or after a few hours if the patient is being handled as in-patient.
