In seven chapters exploring healing, aesthetics and virtue, meals and rituals, the balance of life, the sacred cosmos, meditation, and practical tips, Caduto explores practically every pistil, stem, blossom and more of the herbal world. Arcane facts about Egyptian embalming rest comfortably alongside advice on growing and harvesting herbs. Herbal experts will treasure the extensive spiritual application contexts, and beginners will find comfort in the cultivation basics. Especially soothing and bonding are the Islamic connections summoning the exquisite, sumptuous gardens of the Middle East. Each chapter has more than a handful of activities, ceremonies and projects. Some, such as \"Bathing Balms\" and \"Valentine's Day Cards,\" seem overly simplistic, but all recall the sweet elemental connection among aspects of the living world.
