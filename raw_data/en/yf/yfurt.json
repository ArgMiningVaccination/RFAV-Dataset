However, we did move some language from 05.02.04 to 05.02.03. We explained the repeal in the rulemaking notice. Department of Correction 6 2 2Rules Governing Establishment and Operation of a Limited Supervision Unit by the Department of Correction, Division of IDAPA 060202 was combined with 060201 Rules Governing the Supervision of Offenders on Probation or Parole by the Department of Correction, Division of Probation and Parole, with simplifications in the process.

Since that time the state requirements for both of these areas have been updated making these sections in rule obsolete and in the case of public information requests the references to other sections of code contained in the rule are incorrect. The State Board of Education follows the provisions established in Chapter 52, Title 67, Idaho Code for contested cases and Chapter 1, Title 74 regarding public records. Board of Education 8 1 4ResidencySection 33-3717B, Idaho Code establishes requirements for individuals to establish residency for eligibility for in-state tuition at our public four-year postsecondary institutions. The provisions in 08.02.04 provide clarification to the public institutions on how they are to evaluate these provisions. The State Board of Education as the Board of Regents and the Board of Trustees of these institutions is already authorized to create policy for the governance of the postsecondary institutions making this rule unnecessary. The provisions that are currently established in this rule will be moved to State Board of Education Policy. Board of Education 8 1 7State Professional Studies ProgramThis loan repayment program has not been funding in over a decade making this section of rule obsolete. We will be proposing a legislative idea to repeal Section 33-3604, Idaho Code, removing the enabling statute for this rule. The enabling statute does not currently require the rule stay in place.Board of Education 8 1 8Miscellaneous Rules of the State Board of EducationThere is a provision prohibiting alcohol in state owned buildings, in the past this included the facilities of our public postsecondary institutions. The Department of Administration has since amended their rule pertaining to the restriction of alcohol in state facilities in such a way that it no longer includes the postsecondary institutions facilities. This allows us to remove the language in this rule authorizing the State Board of Education to allow alcohol on the campus pursuant to Board policy. The Board currently has a policy regarding the presence of alcohol on campuses and this Board policy will stay in place for the foreseeable future, however, the rule itself is now unnecessary. Labor 9 1 4Unemployment Insurance Benefit Fraud and Overpayment RulesDeleting seven duplicate rules already included in Unemployment Insurance Benefits Administration Rules (IDAPA 09.01.30); and moving the remaining six rules from Unemployment Insurance Benefit Fraud and Overpayment (IDAPA 09.01.04) to Unemployment Insurance Benefits Administration Rules (IDAPA 09.01.30). Labor 9 1 6Rules of the Appeals BureauDelete this chapter by moving all rules from the Rules of the Appeals Bureau (09.01.06) to the Rules of the Administrative Procedures of the Idaho Department of Labor (IDAPA 09.01.01). Labor 9 1 50Rules of the Wage and Hour SectionMove any rules in this section that relate to an administrative appeal process to Rules of the Administrative Procedures of the Idaho Department of Labor (IDAPA 09.01.01). ISP - POST 11 11 2Rules of the Idaho Peace Officer Standards and Training Council for Juvenile Detention Officers Content streamlined and consolidated into a new chapter 11.11.01 ISP - POST 11 11 3Rules of the Idaho Peace Officer Standards and Training Council for Juvenile Probation Officers Content streamlined and consolidated into a new chapter 11.11.01 ISP - POST 11 11 4Rules of the Idaho Peace Officer Standards and Training Council for Correction Officers and Adult Probation and Parole Officers Content streamlined and consolidated into a new chapter 11.11.01 ISP - POST 11 11 5Rules of the Idaho Peace Officer Standards and Training Council for Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections Direct Care Staff Content streamlined and consolidated into a new chapter 11.11.01 ISP - POST 11 11 6Rules of the Idaho Peace Officer Standards and Training Council for Misdemeanor Probation Officers Content streamlined and consolidated into a new chapter 11.11.01 Fish & Game 13 1 5Rules Governing Fishing Contests Substantive requirements will be incorporated into 13.01.11, Rules Governing Taking of Fish Fish & Game 13 1 13Rules Governing the Taking of American Crow in the State of Idaho Substantive requirements will be incorporated into 13.01.09, Rules Governing Taking of Game Birds Fish & Game 13 1 20Rules Governing Selection of Fish and Game License Vendors Substantive requirements are integrated into 13.01.19 because of overlap of requirements Commission on Aging 15 1 21Rules Governing Older Americans Act (OAA) ServicesThe content of 15.01.21 has been incorporated into the ICOA rewrite of 15.01.01. The content of 15.01.21 was related to the Federal Older American's Act but also included items found within the Idaho Senior Services Act. Combining the information into one rule adds clarity and minimizes duplication. The ICOA manages and administers the Older Americans Act and Idaho Senior Services Act together. Commission on Aging 15 1 31Rules Governing the Five Percent Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Older Worker ProgramThis Federal program no longer exists. ICOA no longer administers or manages the program. The JTPA program was repealed and replaced by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA). WIA was then subsequently superseded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) in 2014. WIOA is currently managed under the supervision of the Idaho Department of Labor. Office of Information Technology Services 15 7 1Rules Governing Billing Procedures of the Office of Information Technology ServicesIDAPA Chapter 15.07.01 is proposed to be removed as it is now obsolete given the new billing methodo logy was approved during the 2019 Idaho Legislative Session. Removing these obsolete rules will allow t he Office of Information Technology Services to bill agencies consistent with JFAC's approved budgets a nd in a manner similar to other agencies that use inter -agency billing and are part of the SWCAP. Furthe rmore, removing these rules will allow ITS to be more nimble with future updates in billing methodolog y given the rapidly changing technology environment. Any future billing changes would remain subject t o the appropriation process, and therefore the Legislative Branch will retain oversight of changes. Health & Welfare 16 2 5Rules Governing Human Immunodeficiency (HIV) Related ServicesRules are not necessary to administer these HIV-related services. The Department follows federal guidelines for the Ryan White Part B and AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) programs. Health & Welfare 16 2 7Control of Anatomical Parts Intended for Transplanting or TransfusionIn 2014, the US Department of Health and Human Services enacted a final rule related to organ procurement and transplantation. This rule is found at 42 CFR.121, so this chapter is no longer needed. Health & Welfare 16 2 28Registration of Free Medical Clinics The registration process outlined in this chapter is obsolete, and the rules are no longer needed. Health & Welfare 16 3 12Rules Governing Long-term Care Remedies in IdahoThe remedies outlined in this chapter are actually enforcement actions for a facility's failure to meet federal certification requirements. The same remedies are outlined in 42 CFR Part 488 and in Chapter 7 of the CMS State Operations Manual. Health & Welfare 16 3 15Secure Treatment Facility for People with Intellectual DisabilitiesThese rules are temporary only, and the Department will not seek to make them permanent/final. Health & Welfare 16 4 2Idaho Telecommunication Service Assistance Program Requirements in this chapter are already in statute at Title 56, Chapter 9, Idaho Code. Health & Welfare 16 4 4Early Intervention Services for Infants and ToddlersDuring a significant economic downturn in 2010 this set of rules was created in order to provide funding for Early Intervention Services in the Infant and Toddler Program. The alternative funding mechanism was not needed, so these rules were never implemented. Health & Welfare 16 4 6Rules Governing Fees for Adult/Child Development Center ServicesServices that were delivered in Adult/Child development centers were privatized in 2010. Direct client services are no longer provided in the Department's Adult/Child Development Centers, so the fee structure outlined in these rules is no longer necessary. Health & Welfare 16 4 12Rules Governing the Individual and Family Grant Program The requirements for this program already exist in 44 CFR \u00a7206.131 Health & Welfare 16 6 6Developmental Disabilities Family Support and In-Home AssistanceThis program is no longer provided by the DD Program and the supports provided are now available under Medicaid services for families of children who have Developmental Disabilities and services for adults who have Developmental Disabilities. As these supports became Medicaid fundable this general fund program was no longer needed nor the most efficient way to fund these supports. Health & Welfare 16 7 30Behavioral Health Community Crisis CentersRequirements in this chapter are already in statute at Title 39, Chapter 91, Idaho Code as well as in the contracts the division has with individual crisis centers.Health & Welfare 16 7 50Minimum Standards for Nonhospital, Medically Monitored Detoxification/Mental Health Diversion UnitsThese rules were developed to oversee one detoxification unit in Boise. Since then, the requirements and oversight are handled through contract.

Insurance 18 1 7Maternity Benefits Under Hospital, Surgical, and Medical Contracts in IdahoWe found the rule was not needed because Idaho Code \u00a7 41-2214 - Group and Blanket Disability Insurance, covers this requirement. Insurance 18 1 14Proxies, Consents, and Authorizations of Domestic Stock InsurersThe requirements are adequately covered under Idaho Code \u00a7 41-2868 - Organization and Corporate Procedures of Stock and Mutual Insurers therefore this rule is not needed. Insurance 18 1 15Fingerprinting of Producer License ApplicantsWe found the rule was not necessary as Title 41 Chapter 10 Producer Licensing governs an applicant's submission of fingerprints; IDAPA 18.01.44 governs the associated fees. Insurance 18 1 17Surplus Lines - Delegation of ResponsibilityThe DOI and Director already have the authority to delegate or enter into contract under Title 41 Chapter 12. Some sections of this rule will be combined into IDAPA 18.01.65. Insurance 18 1 18Open Lines for Export - Surplus LinesUpon examination of process, we felt the system could be updated. Such updates will be done through the negotiated rulemaking process and placement in IDAPA 18.01.65. Insurance 18 1 33Domestic Insurer Purchasing and Selling of Exchange-Traded Call and Put OptionsThis rule is adequately covered under Title 41 Chapter 10, Idaho Code, and these provisions predate the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual which is now adopted by bulletin annually via I.C. 41- 335(1). Insurance 18 1 39Rebates and Illegal Inducements in the Title Insurance Business Consolidating with IDAPA 18.01.56 and 18.01.25. Insurance 18 1 43Certification of Fire Code OfficialsTitle 41 Section 254 outlines powers and duties of the State Fire Marshal (SFM). The SFM is only required to provide training not certification. Recertification rule creates an unnecessary regulatory burden. Insurance 18 1 45Domestic Insurers Regarding Financial Futures ContractsThese provisions predate the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual which is now adopted by bulletin annually via I.C. 41-335(1). Insurance 18 1 51Unfair Discrimination on the Basis of Blindness or Partial BlindnessWe found the rule was not necessary because it is adequately covered under \u00a7 41-1313, Idaho Code. Insurance 18 1 57Permitting Smoker/Nonsmoker Mortality Tables for Use in Determining Minimum Reserve Liabilities and Nonforfeiture BenefitsWe found the rule was no longer needed; mortality tables are out of date; I.C. 41-335(1) and 41- 612(14)(c)(ii) authorize the Director to adopt updates regarding reserves via bulletin; and I.C. 41-1927 governs nonforfeiture laws.

The program will continue in its current form subject to its legislative appropriation. Parks and Recreation 26 1 1Rules of Administrative Procedure of the Idaho Park and Recreation Board.We can rely on the Attorney General rules on administrative procedures rather than have IDPR specific administrative procedures. Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5206 directs the Attorney General to promulgate rules implementing the APA, and authorizes agencies to \"promulgate its own procedures\" if it includes a finding stating \"the reasons why the relevant portion of the attorney general's rules were inapplicable to the agency under the circumstances.\" If IDPR eliminates its procedural rules, it could rely on the Attorney General rules. Moreover, the Rules simply misstate meeting and public record requirements found in the Idaho Code, and are unnecessary. The one exception is Rule 300.02., establishing copying fees for certain public record request responses, and providing exemptions from such fees. IDPR answers information requests electronically and does not charge a copying fee. Therefore, the rule is unnecessary. Parks and Recreation 26 1 2Rules Governing Reporting and Remittance of Surplus County Vessel Account Moneys.Idaho Code \u00a7 67-7013 provides sufficient detail on remittance of State Vessel Account money for IDPR to conduct this activity without further clarification in rule. The policy that IDPR would propose would be to document the appropriate level and frequency of quasi-auditing done by IDPR in administering the Boating program. Parks and Recreation 26 1 6Rules Governing Cooperator Recognition and Sale of Advertising.In addition to the existing rule, IDPR currently has a policy on sponsorship approvals and a handbook on sponsorships and donations. IDPR proposes to move all the appropriate guidance and standards into a single, easily accessible policy. At a minimum, the policy will include the current standards in rule regarding naming rights and prohibited arrangements. We will develop an additional policy to address the current provisions in rule regarding the sales of advertising. Parks and Recreation 26 1 23Rules Governing Filming Within Idaho State Parks.IDPR amended this rule during the 2019 Legislative Session. The general nature of those amendments was to provide staff more flexibility in administering the rule based on vast technological improvements in personal-use photography and videography. All of the comments we received were that the amended rule was better, but that it was perhaps still too rigid. In developing the policy we would look to strike an improved balance between park and visitor needs and expectations.

House Bill 182 passed both chambers unanimously (66-0; 33-0) and was signed into law on March 21st. The two necessary rules were merged into IDAPA 27.01.01 as discussed during the legislative review.

A few specific rules will be moved into the remaining chapter. Public Utilities Commission 31 51 2Automatic Dialing and Announcement Devices (ADADS) RulesThe ADAD Rules are antiquated and are no longer relevant. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has rules contained within CFR 64.1200 Subpart L- Restrictions on Telemarketing Solicitation, and Facsimile Advertising Rules - which supersede this rule set and accomplish the same end goal. The FCC is also better positioned technically and financially to address complaints in this area. Real Estate Commission 33 1 2Rules of Practice & Procedure of the Idaho Real Estate Commission Governing Contested CasesThe Attorney Generals APA Rules are applicable to the Real Estate Commission's current procedures. The Commission specific Rules on contested cases are in fact a very close version to these Attorney General's Rules. Therefore, the Real Estate Commission is proposing the 33.01.02 be allowed to expire. Real Estate will promulgate a new Rule adopting the Attorney General's Rules on Contested Cases. Real Estate Commission 33 1 3Rules of the Idaho Real Estate Commission Governing Registration of Subdivided Lands Rule is not needed as content is fully covered by 55-1809, Idaho Code. Tax Commission 35 1 4Idaho Estate and Transfer Tax Administrative RulesIdaho stopped estate taxes in 2005. It has been sufficient time that this chapter is no longer needed in current rule. It is archived and available online if a taxpayer needs it. Tax Commission 35 1 13Idaho Illegal Drug Tax Administrative RulesSection 63-4208, Idaho Code, the Illegal Drug Tax Act, provides sufficient enforcement provisions. No rules are necessary. The Commission has determined that illegal drug users don't pay the tax, only stamp collectors. Current forms and procedures are all that's needed to sell stamps to collectors.Water Resources 37 2 2Funding Program RulesThese rules are proposed for elimination for the following reasons: (1) they are largely a re-statement of Idaho Code (\u00a7\u00a7 42-1750 - 1758, 1760, and 2760) and have been superseded by statute in many cases; (2) they require a Letter of Intent process within the loan application process that is ineffective and outdated; and (3) they are out of date because they were promulgated before the creation of the Board's Aquifer Planning and Management Fund, Secondary Aquifer Planning Management & Implementation Fund, and the Flood Management Grant Program. Administration 38 3 1Rules Governing Group InsuranceAll the Administrative Rule categories will be addressed in the Provider's Health Benefit contract for the State if Idaho. Administration 38 4 5Rules Governing the Management of State- Owned DwellingsThe Administrative Rule categories are no longer necessary. The IRS tax code provides instruction to determining the Fair Market Value and reporting income as part of the employee's benefit. Agencies who do provide state-owned dwellings for employee, have established policies to address Agency and Employee responsibilities. Transportation 39 1 2Rules Governing Petition for Adoption, Amendment, or Repeal of Administrative RulesThis rule is unused and unnecessary. ITD has many avenues in which rulemaking can be initiated. Further, these provisions are covered in the state's Administrative Procedures Act Transportation 39 2 6Vehicle Dealership's Trade NamesThis rule is covered in Idaho Code \u00a749-1602(4), and is also a business area that the Secretary of State's Office has authority over.

Soil and Water Conservation 60 5 2The Antidegradation Plan for Agriculture for the Idaho Soil Conservation Commission and Soil Conservation DistrictsReinstatement of this rule is not critical since it can be referenced in IDAPA 60.05.04 - Rules for Allocation of Funds to Conservation Districts, and in our District Reference Manual policy document. Soil and Water Conservation 60 5 3Rules for Administration of Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share Program for IdahoReinstatement of this rule is not critical since the Water Quality Program for Agriculture has not received Legislative appropriations for close to ten years.

State Bd. of Land Comm'rs, 153 Idaho 190, 280 P.3d 693 (2012), the Idaho Supreme Court held that leases of state endowment trust lands require a conflict auction/application process. Rule 090 allows a preferential right for a new minerals or oil and gas lease to an existing geothermal lessee upon discovery of unleased minerals, oil, or gas without a conflict auction/application process, which is contrary to the Idaho Supreme Court's decision and the Idaho Constitution. Idaho Code \u00a7 47-801 still allows a lease to be extended due to production or good faith drilling operations. Lands 20 3 15Rules Governing Geothermal Leasing on Idaho State Lands 95.01.dRule 095.01.d includes requirements of the record title holder that are no longer needed.

Reliance on this 30-day default process, which is outlined in Department Policy #9 and in the lease template language for all lease types, is consistent with Idaho Code \u00a7 47-809, which allows 90-day periods to cure for non-financial defaults of oil and gas leases. Lands 20 3 16Rules Governing Oil and Gas Leasing on Idaho State Lands 104Rule 104 allows grandfather rights for oil and gas leasing following passage of Idaho Code \u00a7 47- 701, which reserves from sale mineral deposits in lands belonging to the state.

IBOL - Barbers & Cosmetology 24 28 1Rules of the Barber and Cosmetology Services Licensing Board 10.02The term is already defined in Section 54-5802(8), Idaho Code. Outfitters and Guide 25 1 1Rules of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board 2.05This definition is unnecessary because the Idaho Open Meetings Act defines a Board meeting and the definition does not add anything substantive to the information contained in Rule 071 or the direction in Idaho Code \u00a7 36-2106, which requires the Board to meet at least four times per year. Outfitters and Guide 25 1 1Rules of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board 2.08This definition is unnecessary and addressed in other ways, such as Rule 013 that instructs that \"[e]very section of the application must be completed in detail unless it does not apply to the type of license requested.\"Outfitters and Guide 25 1 1Rules of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board 2.21This definition is unnecessary because it is addressed in the rules of the administrative rules coordinator in IDAPA 44.01.01.005, which states \"[f]or all administrative rules in Idaho, the terms and references used in the masculine include the feminine and vice versa, as appropriate.\" Outfitters and Guide 25 1 1Rules of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board 2.4This definition is unnecessary because the use of the word \"rules\" in the rest of the chapter is not ambiguous and/or specifically refers to \"these rules\" or the \"rules of the Board.\" Also, any other reference to \"rules\" that are not the rules of the Board, such as the IDFG rules, specify that they refer to the IDFG rule and/or include the IDAPA citation. Outfitters and Guide 25 1 1Rules of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board 2.46This definition relates to a process that was eliminated in 2009; therefore, that term is no longer used in the rules. In 2009, the Board eliminated the requirement that it validate all training forms documenting guide training. Instead, the Board has the outfitter retain training logs/forms and make those available for inspection (Section 034.03). Outfitters and Guide 25 1 1Rules of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board 33 This rule is redundant to Idaho Code \u00a7 36-2108 and Sections 034-042 Pharmacy 27 1 2Rules Governing Licensure and Registration 40.03 Provision is unenforceable and overly broad; as such it is removed.

Tax Commission 35 1 2Idaho Sales and Use Tax Administrative Rules 121The information in this sales tax rule is also in the agency's Administration and Enforcement Rules and those are pointed to in another sales tax rule already. Tax Commission 35 1 3Property Tax Administrative Rules 945 The necessary information is in the statute. Tax Commission 35 1 3Property Tax Administrative Rules 968 The information is in other rules and only referenced in this rule. Tax Commission 35 1 3Property Tax Administrative Rules 990The rule provides no currently usable guidance. In 2006 the money, referred to in the rule, was locked in. Tax Commission 35 1 5Idaho Motor Fuels Tax Administrative Rules 120 This rule is redundant. Gross gallon reporting is required in Rules 130 and 137.

Tax Commission 35 2 1Tax Commission Administration and Enforcement Rules 5 Updating regional offices Tax Commission 35 2 1Tax Commission Administration and Enforcement Rules 10.05 This information is redundant. Water Resources 37 3 per rule subpart 025.08, they \"are solely for the purpose of illustration and do not have the effect of rules as stated.\" Eliminated rules will be incorporated into existing IDWR Water Right Adjudication policy.Water Resources have unnecessary words and phrases that add complexity to the rules without affecting the meaning of the rules. Water Resources 37 3 2Beneficial Use Examination Rules 10.12 This rule defines a word that is not used elsewhere in the rules. Water Resources 37 3 2Beneficial Use Examination Rules 55.01This rule is no longer applicable because there are no more permits with proof submitted before the effective date of the rule and no examination fee has been paid. Water Resources 37 3 2Beneficial Use Examination Rules 45.01 This rule contains an outdated directive about page margins that is no longer needed or enforced. Water Resources 37 3 2Beneficial Use Examination Rules 25.01This rule is outdated and mandates submittal of information in the form of an affidavit when other forms are acceptable to IDWR. Water Resources 37 3 2Beneficial Use Examination Rules 30.03This rule is outdated and states denied applications will be returned to the applicant, when in fact IDWR should retain the application as evidence for the record in case of an appeal of IDWR's action. Water Resources 37 3 3Rules and Minimum Standards for the Construction & Use sub-rules govern Class 2 injection wells. Class 2 wells are the class of wells used to inject: process water from oil and gas pumping; fluids used for enhancing the recovery of oil or natural gas; and liquid hydrocarbons (at standard temperatures and pressures) for underground storage. In 2018, Idaho voluntarily transferred primacy over Class 2 injection wells to the EPA. Class 2 wells are currently administered by the EPA (see 40 CFR Part 147). Now that the EPA administers Class 2 injection wells in Idaho, these sub-rules are contrary to federal rule.Water Resources 37 3 4Drilling for Geothermal Resources Ru 25.03Rule subparts 025.03.a, 025.03.b, and 025.03.c restate fees that are statutorily defined in Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 42-4003 and 4011. Furthermore, the fee identified in the rules for production wells, exploratory wells, and injections wells are outdated and no longer consistent with the statutorily defined fees. Rule subparts 025.03.d and 025.03.e will be removed from the rules and added to existing IDWR policy governing well drilling permit processes. Water Resources 37 3 7Stream Channel Alteration Rules055.03, 055.05, 055.06, 058, 060, 061, E, Appendix F, Appendix G, M, and part of Appendix K.These sub-rules cover minimum standard rules for the use of gabions, dikes and levees, and jetties in stream channel alteration activities. These minimum standards are outdated and rarely used in stream channel alteration work. The current Stream Channel Coordinator has rarely permitted alteration activities that include these minimum standards. If gabions, dikes, levees, or jetties are proposed in the future, they can still be permitted as non-minimum standard stream channel alterations. Water Resources 37 3 8Water 045.02.b.iii. These rules have unnecessary words and phrases that add complexity to the rules without affecting the meaning of the rules. Water Resources 37 3 8Water Appropriation Rules 035.03.a This rule repeats a directive in rule subpart 035.01.d and is unnecessary. Water Resources 37 3 8Water Appropriation Rules 035.03.b.xv This rule is outdated and addresses circumstances which do not occur. Water Resources 37 3 8Water Appropriation Rules 040.01.e This rule is outdated, IDWR does not require a surety bond from water right applicants. Water Resources 37 3 8Water Appropriation Rules 040.02.dThis rule is no longer consistent with Idaho Statute. The opportunity to receive notification by mail was replaced in Idaho Code \u00a7 42-203A(3) with a requirement for notice on IDWR's internet homepage. Water Resources 37 3 8Water Appropriation Rules 50.07 This rule restates unambiguous requirement from Idaho Code \u00a7 42-204 and is unnecessary. Water Resources 37 3 8Water Appropriation RulesPart of rule 035.01.aThis rule is inconsistent with Idaho statute and incorrectly states that certain changes to existing water rights require the filing of an application for permit. The requirement is not consistent with the requirement of Idaho Code \u00a7 42-222 requiring the filing of an application for transfer to change an existing right.Water Resources 37 3 8Water Appropriation RulesPart of rule 035.01.b This rule is inconsistent with Idaho Code \u00a7 42-111(3). Water Resources 37 3 8Water Appropriation RulesPart of rule 035.03.b.iiThis rule is out of date and requires IDWR to use local common names for water sources, but in many instances IDWR does not know the local common name or in other instances multiple names are used locally. Water Resources 37 3 8Water Appropriation RulesPart of rule 050.02This rule is out of date and refers to \"Policy 32 I\" in the State Water Plan and the current state water plan does not contain a \"Policy 32 I.\" Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 10.05This rule is unnecessary and redundant as IDWR has statewide rules for conjunctive administration. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 10.14 This rule is unnecessary as all references to the SRBA are being deleted from these rules. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 20This rule is unnecessary as we now have general provisions that govern conjunctive administration and separate streams in Basin 34. Parts of this rule are inconsistent with SRBA Basin 34 general provisions. Furthermore, parts of this rule are restatements of law and are not necessary for administration. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34Parts of rules 025.01 Because section 020 is being deleted, the reference to section 020 is being deleted here. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34035.02, 035.03, 035.06, and 035.07These rules are unnecessary as IDWR already has a separate measurement order in place. These rules are not necessary because they are either duplicative of Idaho Code or they are outdated with current IDWR water measurement standards. Rules 35.02 and 35.03 are not consistent with current IDWR measurement standards. Rule 35.06 is not necessary since the Director already has inherent authority to allow a measuring device exemption. Rule 35.07 is confusing and redundant with both Rule 35.01 and Idaho Code \u00a7 42-701. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34Parts of rule 040.01 and 040.01.a,Sections of these rules are outdated, restatements of law and inconsistent with current, more accurate administrative practices. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34Parts of rules 040.03.a The Hydromet station mentioned in this rule is no longer used. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34Parts of rules 040.03.b Section of this rule is inconsistent with current and more accurate administrative practices. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 40.07This rule is not consistent with SRBA General Provision 2; the rule is actually more restrictive than the General Provision. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 45This rule is outdated as the SRBA Court has decreed all rights in Basin 34 and we are no longer operating on list of water rights approved for interim administration. This rule also contains elements that are restatements of law and already addressed by the state wide rules for conjunctive administration. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 50This rule contains elements that are addressed by general provisions issued by the SRBA Court, are restatements of law, and are already addressed by the state wide rules for conjunctive administration. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 55.01 This rule is a restatement of law. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 55.02This is unnecessary. This rule states that the maximum annual field head gate volume is 3.5 AFA. But the rule goes on to state that the volume limit does not apply to water rights for which the limit is not stated on the water right. If the limit is stated on the water right, it is unnecessary to have it mentioned in the rules. Water use is regulated by the total volume and rate of diversion listed on the water right decree or license. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 55.03This rule is unnecessary since water use under combined rights is regulated by the total volume and rate of diversion listed on the water right decree or license, along with combined use limit conditions placed on water rights. Water Resources 37 3 12IDWR Water Distribution Rules - Water District 34 55.04This rule is unnecessary since water use, including the use of water for conveyance loss, is regulated by the rate of diversion listed on the water right decree or license along with any related water right conditions. Most of the language in this rule amounts to statements of fact or a reiteration of information already included in the water rights. The rule is not necessary for water right administration.
