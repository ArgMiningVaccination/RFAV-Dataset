{"title": "Use of Osteopathic Manipulation for Treatment of Chronic Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration", "author": "Simrat Veera; Justin Chin; Lina Kleyn; Salvatore Spinelli; Leonid Tafler", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) is an increasingly reported phenomenon that causes inflammation of surrounding structures, along with pain and decreased range of motion of the affected shoulder. Current literature emphasizes proper injection techniques and locations to decrease incidence; however, there is limited information available on successful treatments. The aim of this report is to describe a case of SIRVA and review treatment options, specifically the role of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) in the resolution of symptoms refractory to standard care. Here we present a case of chronic SIRVA in a 58-year-old female due to a poorly administered influenza vaccination with emphasis on a stepwise osteopathic therapy approach as a lasting treatment to decrease the effects of the inflammatory process and improve daily function of the shoulder. OMM, with the option of anesthesia, can be performed in outpatient family medicine practices as a noninvasive and safe adjunct treatment. Specifically, the Spencer technique has been shown to improve shoulder-related pathologies that include adhesions, capsulitis, and inflammation and was used in this case under anesthesia. The patient reported good improvement in her symptoms and increased range of motion. SIRVA is an underdiagnosed phenomenon that involves inflammation of surrounding structures after a vaccine administration. In chronic cases, such as in this patient, OMM may be enhanced with the use of anesthesia to optimize the treatment's effect on scar tissue and fibrosis.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2020-07-12", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
