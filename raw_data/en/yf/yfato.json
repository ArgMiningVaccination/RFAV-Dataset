In recentdecades, technology, pharmaceuticals, andknow-how have substantially improved howcare is delivered and the prospects forrecovery. American markets for innovationin pharmaceuticals and medical devices aresecond to none. The miracles of modernmedicine have become almostcommonplace. At its best, American healthcare is the best in the world. Notwithstanding these extraordinary achievements, the cost, quality, andaccessibility of American health care havebecome major legislative and policy issues. Substantial increases in the cost of healthcare have placed considerable stress onfederal, state, and household budgets, aswell as the employment-based healthinsurance system. Health care quality varieswidely, even after controlling for cost,source of payment, and patient preferences. Many Americans lack health insurancecoverage at some point during any givenyear. The costs of providing uncompensatedcare are a substantial burden for many healthcare providers, other consumers, and taxpayers. This Report examines the role of competition in addressing these challenges. The proper role of competition in health caremarkets has long been debated. For much ofour history, federal and state regulators,judges, and academic commentators sawhealth care as a \"special\" good to whichnormal economic forces did not apply. Skepticism about the role of competition inhealth care continues. This Report by the Federal Trade Commission (Commission) and the AntitrustDivision of the Department of Justice(Division) (together, the Agencies)represents our response to such skepticism. In the past few decades, competition hasprofoundly altered the institutional andstructural arrangements through whichhealth care is financed and delivered. Competition law and policy have played animportant and beneficial role in thistransformation. Imperfections in the healthcare system have impeded competition fromreaching its full potential. Theseimperfections are discussed in this Report. The Agencies based this Report on 27 days of Joint Hearings from Februarythrough October, 2003; a Commission-sponsored workshop in September, 2002;and independent research. The Hearingsbroadly examined the state of the health caremarketplace and the role of competition,antitrust, and consumer protection insatisfying the preferences of Americans forhigh-quality, cost-effective health care. TheHearings gathered testimony fromapproximately 250 panelists, includingrepresentatives of various provider groups,insurers, employers, lawyers, patientadvocates, and leading scholars on subjectsranging from antitrust and economics tohealth care quality and informed consent. The Hearings and Workshop elicited 62written submissions from interested parties. Almost 6,000 pages of transcripts of theHearings and Workshop and all writtensubmissions are available on theCommission website. The Report addresses two basic questions. First, what is the current role ofcompetition in health care, and how can it be2enhanced to increase consumer welfare? Second, how has, and how should , antitrus t enforcement work to protect existing and potential competition in health care? This Executive Summary outlines the Agencies' researc h, finding s, conclu sions, recommendations, and observations. Subsequent chapter s provide in-depth discussion and analyses. Chapter 1 provides an overview and introduction. Chapter 2 focuses on physicia ns. Chapters 3 and 4 address hospitals. Chapters 5 and 6 consider insurance. Chapter 7 focuses on pharmac euticals . Chapter 8 addres ses a range of issues, including cer tificate of need, state action, long-term care, interna tional perspec tives, an d remedi es. We beg in with a revie w of why health c are issu es are s o important . I. CURRENT HEALTH CARE CHALLENG ES A. Health Care Expenditure s Are Once Again Rising Dramatic ally Health care spending in the United States far exceeds that of other countries. Approximat ely 14% of g ross dome stic product, or $1.6 trillion in 2002, is spent on health care services in the United States. Federal, state, and local gove rnments pay for approxima tely 45 perce nt of total U.S. expenditur es on hea lth care ; private insurance and other private spending account for 40 percent; and consumer out-ofpocket spending accounts for the rema ining 15 perce nt. As Figure 1 reflects, in 2002, 31 percent of the $1.6 trillion spent by Americans on health care went to inpatient hospital care; that percentage ha s declined substantially over the past twenty years, a s hospitalization rates and lengths of stay have declined. Physician and c linical services accoun t for 22 pe rcent, b ut phy sicians' decisions and recommendations affect a fa r larger percentag e of total expenditures on health care. Prescription drugs ac count for about 11 percent; that percentage has increased substantially over the past decade. The remaining 36 percent is split among long-term care, administrative, and other expenditures. The per centag e of gr oss domest ic product s pent on he alth car e rose substantia lly during th e 1970s a nd 1980s,3but stabilized during most of the 1990s at around 1 3.5 perc ent. I n the last f ew y ears, however, dramatic cost increases ha ve returne d, attribu table to b oth incre ased use of and increased prices for hea lth care services. Inpatient hospital car e and pharmaceuticals are the key drivers of recent increases in expenditures. These trends are likely to continue - and eve n accelerate - as new technologies are develope d and the percen tage of the popula tion that is elderly increases. B. Health Care Quality V aries Quality has multiple attributes. Many health ser vices researchers and provider s focus on whether the car e that is provided is based on empirical evidence of efficacy . The Institute of Medicine define s quality as \"the d egree to which h ealth services for individuals and populations increa se the like lihood of d esired h ealth outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.\" The Ag ency for Healthcare Research and Q uality defines quality health car e as \"doing the right thing at the right time in the right way for the right person and having the best results possible.\" Some consumers may foc us on how long they must wait for an a ppointment, and how they are treated at the provider's office. Many health c are pro viders a nd health services researchers tre at the cost of care (and the resources of consumers) a s immaterial; for them, you either provide high quality ca re to a particular patient or disease set, or y ou do not. From a c onsumer p erspec tive, hea seve ral distin ct factor s, and the deliver y system must perfor m well on each if it is to provi de high quality care . These factors include whether the diag nosis is co rrect, whether the \"rig is selec ted (with the \"rig ht\" treatment vary ing, depending on the underlying diagnosis and patient prefer ences) , whethe r the tre atment is performed in a technically competent manner, whether service quality is adequate, and whether consumers can acc ess the care they desire. I nformation is necessary for consumer s to make d ecisions regar ding the ir care, and determine how well the hea lth care system is meeting their ne eds. If we focus strictly on technical measure s, what is k nown abou t the qual ity of health care in the United States? Commentators and panelists agree that the vast majority of patients rec eive the care they need, but ther e is still significant room for improvement. Commentators and panelists note that treatment patterns vary significantly; proc edures of known value are omitted, and treatments that are unnecessary and inefficacious are perfor med and tens of billions of dollars are spent annually on services whose value is questionable or non-existent. As one commentator stated, \"quality problems . . . abound in Amer ican medicine . The majo rity of these problems are not r are, unp redicta ble, or in evitable conc omita nts of the d elive ry of co mplex, modern health care. Rather, they are frighteningly common, often predictable, and frequently preventable.\"1 1 Mark R . Cha ssin, Is Heal th Care Ready for Six Sigma Quality? , 76 M ILBANK Q. 565, 566 (1998). 4C. The U.S. Economy Typically Relies on Market Competition In the overwhelming majority of markets, the government does not decide the prices and quality a t which sellers offer goods a nd servic es. Rathe r, rivals compete to satisfy consumer dema nd, and consumers make dec isions abo ut the pric e and qua lity of goods or services they will purchase. A well-functioning market maximizes consumer welfare when consumers make their own consumption decisions based on good information, clear prefer ences, and appropriate incentives. Vigorous competition, both price and non-pric e, can h ave impor tant bene fits in health care as well. Price competition gener ally results in lower pr ices and , thus, broader access to health care products and services. Non-price competition can promo te high er qual ity and en courage innovation. More concretely , competition can res ult in new a nd improve d drugs , cheaper generic alternatives to branded drugs, treatments with less pain and fewer side effects, and treatments offere d in a manner and location consumers desire. Vigoro us compet ition can be quite unpleasant for competitors, however. Indeed, competition can be r uthless - a circumstance that can create c ognitive dissonance for providers who prefer to foc us on the necessity for trust and the importance of compassion in the delivery of health care services. Yet, the fact that competition create s winners and loser s can insp ire hea lth care providers to do a better job for consumers. Vigorous competition promotes the delivery of high quality, cost-e ffective health c are, an d vigoro us antitru st enforcement helps protect competition. At the same time, competition is not a panac ea for a ll of the pr oblems wit h American health care. Competition cannot provide its full benefits to consumers without g ood infor mation an d proper ly aligned incentives. Moreover, competition cannot e liminate th e inhere nt uncer tainties i n health care, or the informational asymmetries among c onsumers , provide rs, and payors. Competition also will not shift resources to those who do not have them. The next section identifies some of the featur es of hea lth care markets t hat can l imit the effectiveness of competition. II. FEATURES OF HEALTH CARE MARKETS T HAT CAN LIM IT COMPETI TION A. The Health C are Marke tplace is Extensively Regulated An extensive regulatory framework, developed over decades, at both the fede ral and state levels of government affe cts where and how c ompetition takes pla ce in hea lth care markets. Much of the reg ulatory framew ork aros e hapha zardly , with little consideration of how the pieces fit together, or how the pieces c ould exace rbate anticomp etitive te ndencie s of the ov erall structure. Proposals for new regulatory interventions have often focused solely on their claimed benefits, instead of considering their like ly costs, whe re propo sals fit in to the larger regula tory frame work, and whether proposals frustrate competition unnecessarily . Failure to consider such matters can reinforce existing reg ulatory imperfections and reward incumbent interest s. In deed, in h ealth ca re, some commentators see competition as a problem to be tamed with top-down prescriptive5regula tions, inste ad of an o y to improve quality, effic iency, and e nhance consumer welfare. As a sig nifican t purcha ser in most health care gover nment uses regula tions to inf luence t he price and quali ty of the services for which it pay s. The government's actions as both purchaser a nd regula tor have profound effec ts on the r est of the health care financing a nd delivery markets a s well. Pri ce reg ulation, e ven if indirec t, can dis tort prov ider re sponses to consumer demand and restrict consumer access to health care service s. Regulatory rules also can reduce the rewa rds from innovatio n and some times cre ate per verse incentives, rewarding inefficient c onduct and poor results. Restrictions on entry a nd extensive regulation of other aspects of provider behavior and organizational form can bar new entrants and hinder the development of new forms of competition. The scope and depth of regulation is also not universal; providers offering competing service s are ro utinely subject to widely varying regulatory regimes and pay ment schedule s. B. Third-Par ty Payment Ca n Distort Incentives Health insurance shifts and pools the risks asso ciated with ill healt h. By providing great er pred ictability , health insurance protects the ill and their from fina ncial ca tastroph e. Nonet heless, third-party pay ment of health-related expenses can distort incentives and have unintende d conseq uences.Consumer Incentives . Insured consumers are insulated from most of the costs of their decisions on health care treatments. The result is that insured consumers have limited incentive to balance costs and benefit s and sea rch for lower co st health care with the level of quality that they prefer . A lack o f good in formatio n also hampers consumers' ability to evaluate the quality of the health ca re they r eceive. Provider Incentives . Panelists and commentators agreed that providers ha ve a stron g ethic al obl igation to deliv er high quality care . The health care financing system, howe ver, g eneral ly does not dir ectly reward or punish health care provider s based on their p erforma nce. When this fact is coupled with the consumer incentives outlined above, the result is that providers who deliv er high er quali ty care ar e gene rally not directly rew arded for their superior performance; providers who deliver lower quality care a re gen erally not direc tly punished for their poorer performance and, worse sti ll, may even be reward ed with higher pay ments than providers who deliver higher quality care. Payor Incentives . Insurers g eneral ly offer c overag e terms ti ed to prof essional ly dictated standards of care, restricting the range of choices and tra de-offs that consumer s may desire. Insu rers ag gregate consumer preferences, but there can be incentive mismatches because insurers generally bear the costs but do not capture the full benefits of coverage de cisions and because insurance contracts have a defined term (usu ally annually ) that is g eneral ly shorter than the period of interest to the consumer.6C. Information Pr oblems Can Limit the Effectiveness of Competition The Lack o f Reliable and Accu rate Informati on about Pr ice and Q uality . The public has access to better information about the pric e and qua lity of automo biles than it does abo ut most hea lth care service s. It i s difficult to get good information about the price and quality of health care goods and services, although numerous states and private entities are experimenting with a range of \"report ca rds\" and other strategies for disseminating information to consumers. Without good information, consumers have more difficulty identify ing and obtaining the goods and services they desire. The Asymmetry of Information between Provider s and Consum ers. Most consumers have limited information about their illness and their treatment options. Consumers with chronic illnesses have more opportunity and incentive to g ather such information, but there is still a fundamental informational asymmetry between providers and patie nts. Ther e is also c onsidera ble uncertainty a bout the optimal course of treatme nt for man y illnesses, g iven dive rse patient p references a nd the sta te of scie ntific knowledge. Consumer Uncertainty about Reliability of Health Care . Uncerta inty increa ses tran de cepti on dra matically. Al though the Internet can prov ide acc ess to informat ion about h ealth ca re, it als o enhances the risks of fraud and dece ption regarding \"snake oil\" and miracle cures. Information Technology . Health care does n ot emp loy infor mation tec hnologyextensively or effe ctively. Prescriptions and physician order s are frequently hand-written. Records are often maintained in hard copy and scattered among multiple locations. Few pro viders us e e-mail to communic ate with consumers. Public and private entities have worked to develop and introduce electronic medical records and computer ized physician order entry, but commentators a nd panelists agreed that much remains to be done. D. Cost, Quality , and Acce ss: The Iron Triangle of Trade-offs Health po licy analy sts commonl y refer to an \"iron triangle\" of health care.2 The three vertices of the triang le are the cost, quality, and acc essibility of care. The \"iron tri angle\" means tha t, in equili brium, increasing the performance of the health care system along a ny one of these dimensions can compromise one or both of the other dimension s, rega rdless of the amoun t that is spent on health care. Such tradeoffs are not always required, of course. For example, ty ing payments to health ca re providers to the quality of service s provided could improve providers' incentives to contain costs and improve q uality . Better quality also coul d be achieved at less cost by reducing unnecessary services and managing consumers with chronic conditions more cost-effectively . Competition has an important role to play in acc omplishing these objectives. 2 W ILLIAM L. KISSICK, MEDICINE'S DILEMMAS : INFINITE NEEDS VERSUS FINITE RESOURCES (1994). 7Nonethe less, tra de-off s among c ost, quality , and ac cess ca n be nec essary . Those trade- offs must b e made a t multiple le vels by multiple parties. Some consumers may prefer a \"nothing but the best\" pac kage of medical care, but others are willing to trade - off certain attributes of quality for lower cost, or trade-off one attribute of quality for another . For exa mple, some consumer s will be more w illing tha n others t o travel in exchange for lower prices, while other s may be more willing to travel in exchange for higher quality care. Good information about the costs and cons equenc es of ea ch of the se choices is important for competition to be effective. E. Societal At titudes Reg arding Medical Ca re For most p roducts, consumer s' resources constrain their demand. Consumers and the general public do not generally expect vendors to provide services to those who cannot pay f or them. Few would require grocery stores to provide free food to the hungry or landlords to provide free sh elter to t he homele ss. By contras t, many members of the public and many health c are pro viders vi ew heal th care as a \"special\" good, not subject to normal market forces , with sig nifican t obliga tional nor ms to provide n ecessa ry care w ithout reg ard to ability to pay . Similarly, many perceive risk-ba sed prem iums for he alth insur ance to be inconsistent with obligational norms and fundamental fairness, because those with the highest anticipated medical bills will pay the highest premiums. A range of re gulatory interventions reflect these norms. F. Agency Relationships A large majority of consumers purchas e health care th rough mu ltiple ag ents - their employers, the pla ns or insurers chosen by their e mployers, and provider s who guid e patien t choice through refer rals and sele ction of tr eatments . This multiplicity of agents is a major sour ce of problems in the market for health care service s. Agen ts often d o not have adequa te informat ion about t he pref erence s of those they repr esent or sufficient incentive to serve those inte rests. III. HOW THE HEALTH CARE MARKETP LACE CURR ENTLY OPERATES Competitive pressur es for c ost containment have spurred the development of new forms of health care financ ing and delivery. Gove rnment payors ha ve adopted new forms of pay ments for health care providers to slow health care inflation. Private payors ha ve adopted systems, such as managed care a nd preferred provider organizations, to encourage or re quire consumer s to choose relative ly lower-co st health care. Phy sicians have tried new ty pes of joint ventures and consolidation, and hospitals have consolidated through merger and the creation of multi-hospital networks. These new organizational forms offer the potential for reducing costs and increa sing provider bargaining power. Mo re recently, strateg ies for im proving the quali ty of health care have gained a ttention. Health care markets remain in flux. 8A. How Consumers Pa y for Hea lth Care Most Americans pay for health care through health insurance. Most Americans under the age of 65 obtain health insuranc e through their employ er or the employ er of a family member. Some Amer icans under the age of 65 obtain coverag e through a government program or purc hase an individual insurance policy. Ame ricans aged 65 and over are a lmost always covere d by Medicar e. In 2002, the Census Bure au estimated that approximately 85 perce nt of the total U .S. popula tion had he alth insurance coverage. 1. Publi cly Fun ded Pro grams Medicar e. Medicare provides coverage for appr oximately 40 million elderly and disa bled Americans. Medicare Part A covers most Americans over 65, and provides hospital insurance coverage . Althoug h Medica re Part B is optiona l, almost all eligible parties enroll, given substantial federal subsidies to the program. Medicare Part B provides supplementary medical c overag e for, a mong othe r things , doctors' visits and diagnostic tests. Many Medicar e benef iciarie s also pur chase Medicare Supplemental Insura nce (Medig ap) polic ies or ha ve cove rage f rom a former employe r. Medigap policies are federally regulated and must include specified core benefits. In 1997, Congress ena cted Medicare + Choice (M+C). M+C encourage d Medicar e benef iciarie s to join pri vately operated managed car e plans, which often offer g reater benefit s (e.g., prescription drug covera ge) in e xchange for acc epting l imitson choice of provid ers. I n 2003, Con gress renamed M+C Medicare Advantag e, and enacted prescription drug bene fits for Medicare beneficiaries. Medicai d. Medicaid provides coverage for appr oximately 50 million Americans. Although the federal government sets eligibility and service parameters for the Medicaid prog ram, the states specify the services they will offer and the eligibility require ments for enrollees. Medicaid programs gene rally cover young childre n and pre gnant w omen whos e family income is at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, as well as many low- income adults. Most states have most of their Medicaid population in some form of manage d care. Medicai d pay s for a ma jority of long term care in the United States. Payments to Health Care Providers: Past and Present . Prior to 1983, Medicare, as well as most other insurers, reimbursed provider s under a \"fee- for-se rvice\" (FFS) system based on the costs of the number and type of ser vices pe rformed . Despite some restrai nts on how m uch a pro vider co uld claim as its costs, the result was to reward volume and discourage efficienc y. Commentators argued that the combination of FFS pay ment, health insurance, and consumers' imperfect information about health care created ince ntives for providers to provide, and consumers to consume, greater health care resources than would be the case in competitive markets. I n addition, FFS pay ment dampened the potential for effective pric e competiti on, because FFS guaranteed reimbursement for claimed charges. Thus, providers lacked inc entives to lower prices. 9Hospitals and Ancillary Services . In response to increasing health car e expenditures, Congress directed the Center for Medi care a nd Medica id Servic es (CMS) to adopt the inpatient prospective pay ment system (I PPS) as a means to create a more competitive, market-like environment for hospital reimbursement by Medica re. The IPPS too k effec t in 1983. T he diag nosis- related group (DRG) for the diag nosis at discharge determines the amount that the hospital is paid. Each DRG has a pay ment weight assigned to it, which reflects the average cost of trea ting patients in that DRG. Hospitals receive this predetermined amount regardless of the actual cost of c are, although adjustments are made for extraordinarily high- cost cases (\"outlier payments\"), teachin g hospita ls, and hos pitals that serve a disproportionate number of low- income patients. Similarly , Congre ss direc ted CMS to chang e its pay ment sy stem for h ospital- based outpatient care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. On August 1, 2000, the payment sy stem changed from a cost-based system to the outpatient prospective payment sy stem (OPPS) , under w hich CMS reimburses hospitals based on one of about 750 ambulatory pay ment classifications (APCs) in which an episode of care falls. Each APC has a general weig ht based on the median cost of providing the service. Congress also directed CMS to adopt prospective pay ment systems for skilled nursing facilities and home health care service s, and thos e systems are curren tly in effec t. As of 20 07, Medic are is sc heduled t o begin a competiti ve bidding system to determin e which p rovider s will offe r durabl e medical equipment to Medicarebenefic iaries. the stems they replac ed. With the intr oduction o f IPPS, ease in ho spital ex pendi tures slowe d, and average length of hospital stay de clined. The adoption o f prospe ctive pa yment for hom e health c are ser vices al so had an immediate impact on the number of beneficiaries that received services and the ave rage number of visits. Any administered pric ing system inevitably has difficulty in replicating the price that would prevail in a competitive market. Not surprisingly , one unintended consequence of the CMS administered pricing systems has b een to ma ke some hospital services extraordinarily luc rative and other s unprofi table. As a result, some service s are mor e availa ble (and others le ss available) than they would be in a competitive market. Physicians . Medicare pay s for physician service s using the resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS), a sy stem for calcula ting a ph ysician fe e schedu le. CMS calculates the fee schedule on the basis of the cost of physician labor , practice overhea ds and mat erials, a nd liabilit y insurance, as adjusted for geog raphic and yearly differences. 2. Employment-Based Insurance Employ ers off er insur ance to t heir employees and r etirees through various sources, including commercial insurance companies, employer s' self-funded plans, or various combinations of the two. Employer s10that o ffer he alth i nsura nce th rough commercial insurers usually negotiate on behalf of their employ ees for a package of benefits at a specified monthly premium per person or per family . Some employers choose to self-fund (self-insure) by assuming 100 percent of the risk of expenses from their employee s' health care coverag e. Some emplo yers crea te self- insured p lans, but contract with commercial insurance companie s to act a s a third- party administrator for claims processing, for access to a provi der netw ork, or to obtain stop-loss coverage. The applicability of federa l and state laws and regula tions var ies, depending on the source of health ca re covera ge an e mploy er make s availa ble to employees and r etirees. Not all em ployers off er heal th coverage, and some employ ers offer coverage only to f ull-time em ployees. In some sec tors of the economy , employ ment- based health insurance is less common. The large r the emp loyer, the m ore like ly it is to offer health insurance. Premiums and coverage vary widely. The number of people with employment-base d insurance fluctuated throughout the 1990s but has currently stabilized at appr oximately 61 percent of the U.S. population. The federal government subsidizes emplo yment-ba sed he alth i nsura nce th rough the tax code. Employer contributions for health in surance covera ge are deductib le to employ ers, but a re not co nsidere d taxable income to employees a nd retirees. The result is t hat emplo yees can ob tain hea lth care c overag e throug h their e mploy er with pre-tax dollars. Although it is common parlance to speak of \"employ er contributions\" to the cost of health carecovera ge, emp loyees and r etirees ultimately bear these costs in the form of lower salaries and bene fits. Payment s to Provid ers. In so me instances, private pay ors have copied the payment strateg ies of the Medicare progra m or have u sed Medic are pay ments as a reference pr ice for negotia tion with providers. For example, some pay ors negotiate either a specified discount or a specified premium relative to the pay ment the Medicare program would make for a specific episode of hospitalization or service . To be sur e, many payors do not r ely on these strategies, and instead structure their own payment arr angeme nts with providers, including discounted per diem payments to hospitals and neg otiated discounts off charges for other pr oviders. 3. Individual Insurance In 1999, approximately 16 million working -age a dults and c hildren - almost 7 percent of the population under 65 - obtai ned he alth i nsura nce cov erage individually issued, non-group policie s. Commentat ors sugg est that th is small market share is due, in part, to the tax subsidies provided for employment-ba sed coverage. I ndividual insurance policies are gener ally more expe nsive and less comprehensive than group policies. 4. The Uninsured Approximately 15 percent of the populatio n, or 44 mil lions Amer icans, lacked health insurance at some point during 2002. A study by the Congressional Budget Office found that 45 percent of the uninsured were without coverage for four11months or less, and that only 16 perce nt of the uninsured (or approximately 6.9 million Americans) remained so for more than two years. The uninsured are more likely to be younge r and less likely to have a regular source of care, less likely to use preventive services, and more likely to delay seeking treatment. Studies indicate a variety of adverse health consequences ar e associated with being uninsured. Medical treatment for the uninsured is often more expensive than care of the insured, because the uninsured are more likely to delay treatme nt and re ceive c are in an emer gency room. Hos pitals ty pically bill the uninsured full price for the services they received, instead of the discounted prices that hospitals offer insured patients pursuant to negotiated contracts with their insurers. The uninsured bear some of the costs of treatme nts themse lves and o ften ca nnot fully pay for the care they receive. The burden of providing this uncompensated care varies significantly a mong providers and regions. For example, the burden of uncompensated care is greater in the South and West, where a highe r perce ntage o f the popu lation is uninsured, than in the rest of the United States. The costs of uncompensated treatme nts for the uninsure d are ei ther pai d by taxpay ers, absorbed by providers, or passed on to the insured. B. How Consumers Re ceive H ealth Care: The Rise and Decline of Managed Car e Burgeoning health ca re expenditures in the 1960s and 1970s led to numerous proposal s to provid e better incentiv es to contain costs. Some commentators argued that organizations that agreed to meet thehealth care needs of a consumer a t a set price for a set period of time offere d a solution to t his proble m. Such pre paid group practices existed in some parts of the United States beginning in the early part of the 20th century, but Cong ress took a signi ficant step i n this dire ction with passa ge of the Health Maintenance Orga nizations Act of 1973 (HMO Act). The HMO Act provided start-up funds to encourage the developm ent of HMO s, overr ode State anti- HMO laws, and required large f irms to offer an HMO ch oice to th eir emplo yees. Thes e forces set the stage for the de velopment of managed care org anizations (MCOs). Manag ed care means dif ferent things to different people, and it has meant different things at different times. There is gene ral agree ment, how ever, th at MCOs inte grate the financing and delivery of health care services, albeit to vary ing degrees. I n global terms, managed care off ers a more restricted choice of (and access to) provider s and treatme nts in excha nge fo r lower p remiums, deductibles, and co-pay ments than traditional indemnity insurance. MCOs historically relied on three strategies to control costs and enhance quality of car e. One is selective contracting with provi ders tha t must meet certain criteri a to be included in the MCO's provider network. Selective contracting can intensify price c ompetition and allow MCOs to negotia te volume discounts and choo se providers based on a range of discounts. When MCOs and other insurers have a credible threat to exclude providers from their networks and send patients elsewhere, provider s have a p owerfu l incentiv e to bid aggressively to be included in the network. Without such credible threats, providers have less incentive to bid aggressively , and12even MCOs with large market shares may have les s ability to obtain lo wer pric es. Another strategy is to use incentives that shift some of th e financ ial risk to providers. Capitation, for example, pays providers a fixed amount for each of the patients for whom they a gree to provide care, r egard less of wh ether th ose patie nts seek care or the costs of their car e exceeds the fixed amount. Some physician groups particip ating in capitati on arra ngemen ts underestimated these risks and went bankrup t, and pro viders ha ve beco me increasingly reluctant to accept the risks of capitation in recent y ears. Direct financial incentives for providers in the form of bonuses (or withholding a percentag e of payment) base d on meeting clinical or financi al targ ets rema in fairly prevale nt, with considerable variation in their details. A third strategy is utilization review of proposed treatments and hospitalizations. This strategy involves an appraisal of the appropriateness and medical necessity of the proposed treatment. Many MCOs and other insurers use utilization review in a variety of forms. In recent y ears, many MCOs have adopted a fourth str ategy : increa sed cost- sharing. Cost sharing creates dire ct financial incentives for consumers - through vary ing co-payme nts and deductibles - to receive care f rom parti cular pr oviders o r in particu lar loca tions. By the late 1990s, managed care had grown so unpopular that commentators began to refer to a \"mana ged care backlash.\" Providers complained that their clinical judgments were second-gue ssed; consumerscomplained that managed care w as restric ting cho ices, limi ting ac cess to necessary medical care, and lowering quality. These conc erns resulted in a number of federal and state leg islative and regula tory initiative s, as well as priva te litigati on aga inst MCOs. Commentators report a substantial gap between consumer and provide r perceptions, on the one hand, and manage d care's actual impact, on the other. They point to surveys and studies showing tha t consumer s are g eneral ly satisfied with their own MCOs, that MCOs do not provide poorer quality c are than FFS medicine, and that \"managed care hor ror stories\" are often exaggerated or hig hly unrepre sentative. In recent y ears, more restrictive forms of managed care ha ve been eclipsed by offer ings with more choice and flexibility. These offering s include point-of- service (POS) pla ns, which allow pat ients to select a primary care g atekee per, y et use out - of-plan physicians f or some services. Preferred provider orga nizations (PPOs) are similar to POS programs, but generally do not require a coordinating primary care physician. I nstead, PPOs have a panel of \"preferred providers\" who a gree to accept discounte d fees. So me phy sicians w ho wish to avoid managed care entire ly have beg un \"concierge prac tices,\" where they provide persona lized car e, includ ing hous e calls, to patients willing and able to pay out of pocket for hea lth care costs. Public and private payors are also experimenting with payment f or performance (P4P) initiatives. Commentat ors and pa nelists g eneral ly agree d that P4P sho uld be mor e widely13employed in health ca re. Many pa yors have yet to adopt P4 P progr ams, and s ome providers have resisted such progra ms. The development of P4P programs will require better measurement of, and information about, health care quality. IV. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: NEW DELIVER Y SYSTEMS, NEW FORM S OF ORGANIZATION, AND COMPETI TIVE PRESS URES A. Physicians Spending on physician se rvices accounts for approximately 22 percent of the $1.6 trillion spent annually on health car e services. Total spending on phy sician service s increa sed at an averag e annua l rate of 12 percent from 1970-1993, and at 4 to 7 percen t a year sinc e then. I n respons e to increased competitive pressures from MCOs and other payors to lowe r their pr ices, som e physicians have a ttempted to respond procompetitively, while others ha ve engaged in anticompetitive conduct. Multiprovider Network Joint Ventures . Historically, phy sicians were predominantly solo practitioners, but many physicians implemented network joint ventures in response to managed car e. The 1980s saw the emergence of two ty pes of joint ventures with physician members (Independe nt Practic e Associa tions (I PAs) and Physician Hospital Org anizations (PHOs)). In ge neral, IPAs are ne tworks of independent physicians tha t, among other things, may contr act with MCOs and employers. PHOs ar e joint ventures between a hospital (or more than one hospital) and physicians who g enerally ha veadmitting privileges there; hospital and physician members sometimes contr act jointly through the PHO wi th MCOs to provide care to a population of patients. IPAs and PHOs are often integ rated to varying degrees financially (sharing financial risk) or clinically (using various strategies to improve the quality of care they provide) or both. Such joint ventures may provide various cost savings, such as reduced contracting costs, and c linical efficiencies, such as better monitoring and manage ment of pa tients with chronic illnesses. IPAs and PHOs can also repre sent attempts b y providers t o increa se their barga ining le verag e with insu rers. Som e contend that the primary advantage for physicians and hospitals in forming a PHO is that the member hospital(s) and physicians prese nt a united front for bargaining with pay ors. In recent y ears, the use of IPAs and PHOs has decr eased, as MCOs and providers have abandoned capitation arrangements. One antitrust issue that physician joint ventu res conf ront with r espect t o their contrac ting pra ctices is how to avo id summary condemna tion under the antitr ust laws. The Health Car e Stateme nts outline the key factor s the Ag encies w ill conside r in determin ing whe ther to a pply the per s e rule or more e laborat e rule of reason a nalysis to particu lar cond uct.3 These factors include the degree of integr ation that the venture achieves to obtain efficiencies and the extent to which jo int pricin g is rea sonably 3 DEP'T OF JUSTICE & FEDERA L TRADE COMM 'N, STATEM ENTS O F ANTITRUST ENFOR CEMEN T POLICY I N HEAL TH CARE (1996), available a t http:// www.ftc .gov/re ports/hlth3s.p df. 14necessary to achieve those efficiencies. The \"Messenger Model .\" Arrangements to allow networks of provider s to contr act with p ayors, while avoiding any agreement on price among the provider s, sometime s use a \"m esseng er\" to facilita te contr acting . The pay or usuall y submits a proposed fee schedule to an age nt or third party, who tra nsmits this offer to the network physicians. Ea ch physician dec ides unilaterally whethe r to accept the fee schedule , and the a gent tr ansmits tho se decision s to the pa yor. Provider s may also individually give the messe nger information about the prices or other contract terms that the provider will accept, and the messenge r aggregate s this infor mation an d market s it to payors. Health Care Statement 9 describes how to avoid antitrust problems when using a messenger model, and provider networ ks have used the model successfully . Nonetheless, physician ne tworks using so- called \"messengers\" to orche strate or participate in price-fixing ement tivity in rece nt years. Physician Collective Bargaining . Some physicians have lobbied he avily for an antitrust exemption to allow independent physicians to barg ain collectively. The y argue that pay ors have market power, and that colle ctive ba rgaini ng will e nable physicians to exercise counte rvailing market power. T he Age ncies ha ve consis tently opposed these exemptions, because they are likely to harm c onsumers by increas ing cost s without improving quality of ca re. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that proposed federal legislation to exempt physicians f rom antitr ust scruti ny w ould increa se expendi tures on p rivate h ealthinsurance by 2.6 percent and increase direc t federa l spending on health care pr ograms such as Medicaid by $11.3 billion. Licensing Regulation and Market Entry . State licensing boards composed primarily of physicians determine, apply, and enforce the requirements for phy sicians to practice within a particular state. Various state lic ensing b oards ha ve taken steps to restrict allied health professionals and telemedicine. Some states have limited or no reciprocity for licensing phy sicians and allied health professionals already licensed by another state . The Report discusses the anticompetitive potential of such restric tions, as w ell as the ir ration ales. B. Hospitals As with phy sicians, some hospi tals have responded to competitive pressures by finding way s to lower costs, improve quality , and comp ete more efficie ntly. Some commenta tors cont end, howe ver, tha t a number of hospital networks are exercising market power to demand price increa ses from payors, a nd seeking to forestall entry new compe titors, suc h as sing le-spec ialty hospitals. Hospital Networks . Over the past 20 years, ma ny hospitals have merg ed or consolidated into multi-hospital networks or systems. Although the Ag encies had considerable early success in challenging certain hospital mergers, the Ag encies and state enforcers have lost all seven hospital merger cases they have litigated since 1994. Courts in these cases typica lly disagre ed with the Agencies on how to measure relevant antitrust markets, how to assess the prospects for entry to remedy any15anticompetitive effects, how to determine the magnitude of any likely efficie ncies, and the rele vance o f the hosp ital's non profit status. The Commission has undertaken a retrospective study to evaluate the market results in several consummated mergers, and one case is curre ntly pending in administrative litigation. Initially , national systems acquire d hospitals throughout the United States, but recent acquisitions have been more localized. Some believe that hospital consolidation generally has promoted the development of efficiencies and instilled life back into failing hospitals. They point to the savings from consolidated operations that hospital networks may make possible. Others believe that a primary result of consolidation has been to create hospital market p ower, th us allowin g hospita ls to increase their prices. Hospitals claim that rising prices result not from market power, but from a multitude of pressures they confront, such as shortages of nurses a nd other pe rsonnel, rising li ability premiums, the costs of improved technology , and the obligations of indigent care. Most studie s of the r elationsh ip between competition and hospital prices have found that high hospital concentration is associa ted with in crease d prices , regardless of whether the hospitals ar e for- profit or nonprofit. Some studies have found that merged hospitals experienced smaller p rice an d cost inc reases than those that have not merg ed, excep t in highl y concentrated markets, where the pa ttern was revers ed. Anoth er study found tha t some systems' acquisition of hospitals did not produce efficie ncies, be cause of a failur e to combine operations. Some have pointed outthat studie s typically do not diff erentia te among transactions that occur within local markets a nd those th at occur across m arkets, such as na tional sy stem acq uisitions; different type s of consolidations might reflect very different hospital strategies and could hav e diffe rent ef ficienc y effects. Entry: Sp ecialty H ospitals . Specialty hospitals provide car e for a specific specialty (e.g., cardiac) or ty pe of patient ( e.g., children). Newer single- specialty hospi tals ( to spe cialize orthopedic surger y, and participating phy sicians often have an ownership interest in the facility , for reasons described infra . Some contend that SSHs have ac hieve d bett er out comes throu gh increa sed volume , better disease management, and better clinical standar ds. Others disagree, sugg esting that physician-investors send he althier, lower risk patie nts to their SSH and sic ker pati ents to a gen eral hos pital to en able the SSH to produce service less expensively yet still be reimbursed at the same rates as the ge neral hospital. These commentators fear that SSHs will siph on off the most profi table procedures and patients, leaving g eneral hospi tals w ith le ss mon ey to cr oss su bsidi ze socially valuable, but less prof itable care. Some general hospitals facing competition from SSHs have removed the admitting privileges of phy sicians involved with the SSH or other wise act ed to limit physician a ccess to the gen eral hos pital; other g eneral hospitals h ave esta blished th eir own single-specialty wing to prevent physicians from shifting their patients to a new entrant. Some commentators state that general hospitals have used certific ate of16need (CON) laws to restrict entry by SSHs. There a re rela tively few SSHs, and the va st majority are in states w ithout CON programs. Debate about SSHs continues. A recently imposed Cong ressional moratorium on physician ref errals to SSHs in which they have an ownership interest and two Congressionally ma ndated studies on SSHs and general hospitals will likely affect the future o f SSHs. Entry: Am (ASCs) perform surgical procedures on patients who do not require an overnight stay in the hospital. Technological advances in surg ery and anesthetic agents have made it possible for ASCs to perform a wide range of surg ical procedures. Medicare reimburse ment has had a profound effect on the number of ASCs and the amount and types of surg ery performed in them. Commentators express divergent views on ASCs, with some focusing on likely benefits to consumers including greater convenience , and others expressing concer ns about A SCs similar t o those regarding SSHs. Hospital reactions to deter ASC entry and restric t competition have been simil ar to thos e for SSHs . Government Purchasing of Hospital Services . Government-administered pricing by CMS inadvertently can distort market competition. For example, CMS never decided as a matter of policy to provide greater profits for car diac surgery than many other ty pes of se rvice, b ut the I PPS tends to do so. This pricing distortion create s a direct economic incentive for specialized cardiac hospitals to enter the market; such entry re flects areas that government pric ingmakes most profitable, which may or may not reflect consumers' needs and preferences. When the gove rnment is the sole or primary pa yor for a service, such as kidney dialy sis or vaccines, pay ing too much wastes r esource s, while pa ying too littl e reduces output and capacity, lowers quality, and diminishes incentives for innovation. Althoug h CMS can se t prices, its ability directly to encourage price and non- price competition is limited. With few exception s, CMS cann ot force provider s to compete for CMS's business or reward suppliers that reduce costs or enhance quality with substa ntially increa sed volume or highe r pay ments. CMS ha s limited a bility to contra ct selec tively with provi ders or u se competitive bidding. Even straightforward purchasing initiatives, such as competitive bidding for durable medical equipment (DME), h ave ge nerate d conside rable resistance, despite the success of a pilot project for DME competitive bidding that resulted in saving s of 17 to 22 percen t with no significant adverse effec ts on beneficiaries. Worse still, CMS's payment systems do not reward pr oviders who deliver higher quality care or punish providers who deliver lower quality care. As the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reported, the Medic are pay ment sy stem is \"la rgely neutral or negative towards quality . . . . At times providers are paid even more when quality is worse, such as whe n complications occur as the result of error.\"4 ATION AND INNOVAT ION I N MEDICARE 108 (2003), enh ance qu ality through public reporting initiatives. For example, since CMS began public reporting of quality informat ion on dial ysis care i n 1996, the number of patients receiving inadequa te dialy sis or expe riencin g anemi a has declined substantially. Since 2002, CMS publicly reports on the quality of care provided in nursing homes and by h ome health a gencie s. Recen tly, CMS joined w ith hospitals and the Quality I mprovement Organizations in Mary land, New York, and Arizona to design p ilot tests f or public ly reporting hospital performance mea sures. The Me dicare Presc ription Dru g, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 creates modest financial incentives for hospitals to report such information. Examples of other government initiatives include New York State, which began to publicize provider -specif ic outcomes fo r cardiac surgery in 1989. By 1992, one study found risk-adjusted mortality had dropped 41 pe rcent statewide, giving New York the lowest risk-adjusted mortality rate for cardiac surgery in the nation. Studies show the mortality rate has continue d to fall. P ennsy lvania r eported ly experien ced simila r improve ments whe n it began collecting and publishing r isk- adjusted report cards. Some have cr iticized these findi ngs on methodological and policy grounds. For example, critics suggest that some of the improvement in mortality rates in New York resulted from the m igratio n of high -risk patients to other states for surgery , and that data collection and risk adjustment methods were flawed. A gene ral criticism of such \"repor t cards \" is th at the y discour age providers from treating higher r isk patients. More research is required to deter mine the best methods for measuring and reporting on hospital quality. Private Purchasing of Hospital Services . In recent y ears, contracting between hospitals and private pay ors has sometimes been controversial and contentious. Some contend that many hospital sy stems incl ude at le ast one \" must- have\" h ospital in e ach of th e geog raphic markets i n which th ey compete . A \"must- have\" hospital is one that health care plans believe they must offe r to their beneficiaries to attract employer s to the plan. Payors complain that hospital systems insist on including all or none of the hospitals in a system in the pay or's coverage plan. Consumer pressure for open networks has made it more difficult for pay ors to exclude an entire hospital system, and the presence of a \"must-have\" hospital in the network also increases a hospital's bargaining power. Although some commentators believe that particu lar hospi tals and h ospital sy stems have the upper ha nd in barg aining i n some markets, bargaining advanta ge varies substantially within and among diff erent markets. In a few marke ts, certain pay ors have experimented with \"tiering\" hospitals, which results in differe nt consume r co-pa yments depending on the hospital. Hospital tiers may be established ba sed on a variety of criteri a. Tieri ng usua lly does not ap ply to emergency care and may depend on where routine and specialty services are offered. Tiering allows a pay or to maintain a broad network and inclu de a \"mus t-have\" hospital, yet still cre ate ince ntives fo r consume rs to use lowe r cost hos pitals. Ho spitals usu ally resist tiering, in some cases negotiating18contrac ts that pro hibit tier ing. Hos pitals express c oncern t hat low-c ost facil ities will be mislabe led as low quality and hig h-cost facilities as inefficient, and that tiering might force p oorer c onsumers to use only low-cost hospitals. Private-sector efforts are under way to provide more information about quality. A number of private initiatives seek to make quality -relate d informa tion avai lable to employers, hea lth plans, and consumers. The Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDI S), developed by the National Committee for Quality Assura nce to assess health plans, uses more than 50 measures of provider and plan performa nce in areas such as patient satisfaction, childhood immunization, and mammography screening rates. Hospital Purchasing . Some hospitals have joined group purchasing organ izations (G POs) to co nsolidate their purchases and achieve volume and other discounts . GPOs hav e the pote ntial to as sist hospitals in lowering costs. There have been complaints about certain GPO practices. The Agencies investigate GPO pr actices that appear to merit antitrust scrutiny . The market- share sa fety zones cont ained in Health Car e Statemen t 7 do not co nstrain Agency enforcement in cases involving anticomp etitive c ontract ing pra ctices. Consumer P rice and Q uality Sensitivity: The Need for Better Information . Tiering represents an attempt to force consumers to bear some of the increased price associated with rec eiving care at a more expensive hospital. Medical savings accounts, which combine a high- deductible insurance policy with a taxadvantaged fund for pay ing a portion of uncover ed costs, are inte nded to ac complish the same goal for most health care purchas ing dec isions. Fo r such str ategie s to work, how ever, c onsumers will need reliable and understandable information about the prices and quality of the services among which they must choose. At present, most insured consumers are \"rationally ignorant\" of the price of medical s ervice s they receiv e, beca use insurance largely insulates them from the financial implications of their treatment. Even if consumers were interested in the price of their care, they would find it very difficult to obtain the information. The pricing of health care servic es is complicated and fre quently obscure . Thus, pr oposals to increa se consum er pric e sensitiv ity m ust develop strategies to increase the trans parenc y of prici ng. An analogous finding emerg es for quality measures. Althoug h consumers typically express in terest in report c ards, they often do n ot use suc h informa tion to select health plans and providers. I f the information is usable, consumers will select treatments that accord with their prefere nces. Publicly availab le repor t cards c an motiva te provider s to addre ss quality deficie ncies, even when it does not appear that many consumer s rely on that inf ormation. Not all consumers must be well-informed for the market to deliver an efficient level of quality. Pricing: Bulk Purchasing, Price Discrimin ation, Cost- Shifting, a nd Cross- Subsidies . Understanding health care pricing requires an understanding of four terms: bulk purchasing, price19discrimin ation, co st shifting , and cro ss subsidies. The terms have distinct meanings, although there is some overlap between cost shifting and cross subsidies. Bulk p urchas ing occ urs wh en large organ izations re ceive pu rchasin g discou nts because of the volume of their purchases. Price discrimination involves charging different consumers different price s for the same services, based on differential dema nd. Cost shifting refers to raising the price charg ed to one g roup of c onsumers as a result of lowering the price to other consumers. Cross subsidizing is the practice of charging profit maximizing prices above margin al costs to some pay ors or fo r some services and u sing the su rplus es to s ubsid ize other payor s or other clinical services. Some pane lists state d that cos t- shifting is common in the medical marketplace, but most commentators and panelists disagr eed, an d stated th at bulk purchasing discounts and price discrimination explain observable pricing patterns. Panelists and commentators agreed, however, that ther e are a range of subsidies and cross-subsidies in the medical marketp lace. F or example , provide rs lose money by treating the uninsured, but make money by treating the well insured. Any administe red pric ing sy stem has d ifficult y replicating competitive prices. Thus, not surprisingly, unde r Medicare's administered pricing sy stem, some services are much more profitable than others. Congress has also created direc t subsidies for certain hospitals. CMS pays more to te aching hospitals ( approxima tely $5.9 billion in 1999) and to hospitals that provide a dispropor tionate sh are of c are to the poor (approximately $5 billion per y ear). The existe nce of su bsidies a nd cross- subsidies complicates any plan to g ive consumers better price information and increa se their p rice se nsitivity . Cross- subsidies can distort relative prices and makes access to care conting ent on matters such as the number of uninsured that seek care, the wealth of the community , and the degree of competitiveness of the mar ket for medical s ervice s. C. Pharmaceutic als Competition between Brand-Name and Gene ric Drug M anufactur ers. The availability of patent prote ction creates innovatio n incenti ves for b rand-na me pharmaceutical companies by excluding other s from makin g, usi ng, or s elling a claimed invention for a specified period of time. This protection helps ensure revenues to pharmaceutical firms that they can use for more research. Patent law also require s the disclosure of information about the patented invention that otherwise would remain a trade secret and thus encourag es competition to design around brand-name patents. In 1984, Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman Act, which has encouraged competiti on from lo wer-pr iced ge neric drugs. Hatch-Waxman has shaped substantially the lega l environment governing Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drug products, and established a framework to balance incentives for continued innovation by brand-name firms with entry by ge neric drug firms. The Commission has pursued several enforcement actions to remedy actions by particular firms to game certain Ha tch-20Waxman provisions and deny consumers the benefits of generic competition that Congre ss intende d. The Comm ission also issued a study in July , 2002 that addresses strategies among drug companies to affect the timing of gen eric dr ug entr y prior to patent expiration. Congress has adopted the two major recomme ndations p roposed i n this study to preclude cer tain abuses of Hatch-Waxman. Current Policy Debates . Concern about pharmaceutical prices in the United States has received much attention, and discussio n continue s about how best to address this issue. Certain policy c hoices curren tly under deb ate mig ht lead to problems similar to those that this Report identifies in other health care sectors. For example, price regulation to lower prescr iption dru g price s could le ad to problems with administered pricing similar to those described above. Government purchasing that reflects monopsony power would likely reduce output and innovation. PBMs . The use o f pharma cy benefit managers (PBMs) as intermediar ies between pharmaceutical manager s and payors ha s raised questions whether PBMs increase the costs of p harmac y benefits. Pu rsuant to Congre ssional dir he Commissio aspe ct of the se conce rns: whether costs ar e highe r if a pa yor uses a mail-order p harmacy integrated with a PBM rather than retail pharmacies or non- integr ated mail -order pharmac ies. This study is due in June, 2005. To date, empirical evidence sugge sts that PBMs have saved co sts for pa yors. Direct-to-Consumer Advertising . Some suggest that direct-to-consumeradvertising has increased price s for consumer s or caus ed them to consume inappropriate prescription drugs. The availab le evide nce doe s not suppor t these allega tions. I ndeed, c ompetition can help address these information problems by giving market p articipa nts an inc entive to deliver truthful a nd accu rate inf ormation t o consumers. Nobel Laure ate George Stigler once observed that advertising is \"an immensely powerful instrument for the elimination of ignorance.\"5 Studies by the FTC's Bureau of Economics have c onfirmed that adve rtising p rovides a powerf ul tool to communicate information about health and wellness to consumers - and the information can change people's be havior. Thus, good information is a necessary building block both for consumer empowerment and enhanced health. V. RECOMMEN DATIONS TO IMPROV E COMPETI TION IN HEALTH CARE MARKETS Competition has affected health care markets substantially over the pa st three decades. New forms of org anization have developed in response to pressures for lower costs, an d new stra tegies for lowe ring co sts and enhancing quality have emerged. Nonethe less, com petition r emains le ss effective than possible in most health care markets, because the prer equisites for fully competitive markets are not fully satisfied. This list of recommendations focuses on how to encourage the development of prerequisites to competition such as good information about price and quality . The Agencies recog nize that the work remaining 5 Geo rge J. S tigler, The Economics of Infor mation , 69 J. POL. ECON. 213, 220 (19 61).21to be done is complex a nd diffic ult and wil l take time. A renewed focus on the prerequisites for effective competition, however , may assist poli cymakers in identifying a nd prioritizing tasks for the near future. Recommendation 1: Privat e payors, governm ents, and provider s should cont inue experiments to improve incentive s for provide rs to lower costs and enhance quality and for consumers to seek lower prices and better quality . a) Privat e payors, governments , and providers should improve measures of price and quality. As noted above, health care pricing can be obscure and complex. I ncreased transpa rency in pricing is neede d to implement strat egies t hat en courage provider s to lower costs and consumer s to evaluate prices. Achievement of this goa l will likely require addr essing the issue of cross-subsidization, which encourages providers to use pricing that does not reveal the degree to which the well-insured ma y be subsidizing the indig ent, and m ore prof itable service s may be subsidi zing less well- compensated care. A great deal of work alre ady has been don e on meas uring qu ality. Quality measures exist for a considerable number of conditions and treatments. The Agencies encourage further w ork in this area. The Agencies sugge st that particular attention be paid to the criticism that report cards and other perfor mance m easure s discourageprovider s from tre ating si cker pa tients. I f it is not addr essed, th is critic ism could undermine the perceived validity and reliability of information about quality. b) Privat e payors, governments , and providers should furnish more information on p rices and q uality to consumers in way s that they f ind useful and re levant, and continue to experiment w ith financing structures that will give consumers greater incentives to use such information. Information must be reliable and understa ndable if consumer s are to u se it in selecting health plans and providers. Research to date indicates that many consumers have not used the price and quality informat ion they have re ceived t o make decisions about health plans and providers. Additional research into the ty pes of price and quality information that consumers would use for those decisions appears to be necessary . Further experiments with varying c o-payments and deductibles based on price- and quality- related factors such as the \"tier\" of service that consumers choose can help give consumer s grea ter resp onsibility for their choices . Such re sponsibilit y will also like ly increa se consum er ince ntives to u se available information on price and quality. c) Priva te payors , government s, and providers should experiment further with payment metho ds for alig ning provider s' incentiv es with consumers' interests in lower prices, q uality improv ements, and innovation.22Payment methods that give incentiv es for pr oviders t o lower c osts, improve quality, and innovate c ould be powerful forces for improving compe tition in health care markets. Although pay ors have experimented with some pay ment methods that provide incentives to lower costs, no payment method has y et emerged that more fully alig ns providers' incentives with the interests of consumers in lower prices, quality improvements, a nd innovatio n. At pre sent, for example, mo st payments to providers ha ve no connection with the quality of car e provided. A focus on the degree to which provider s' incen tives are compatib le with consumers' interests is important. Compatible incentives and interests are more likely to yield bette r results ; incompa tible incentiv es and int erests a re more likely to have unintended consequences that can lea d to worse results. Initiatives that address the use of pa yment methods to align provider s' incentives with consumers' interests are necessary . These experiments should be caref ully analy zed to eva luate the ir consequences, both intended and unintended. Recommendation 2: States should decrease barriers to entry int o provider marke ts. a) States with Certificate of Need programs should reconsider whether these programs best serve their citiz ens' healt h care nee ds. The Agencies believe that, on balance, CON programs are not successful in containing health care costs, and that theypose serious anticompetitive risks that usually outweig h their pu rported economic benefit s. Marke t incumbe nts can to o easily use CON procedures to forestall competitors from entering an incumbent's market. As noted earlier, the vast majority of single- specialty hospitals - a new f orm of competiti on that ma y benefit co nsumers - have opened in states that do not have CON progra ms. In deed, the re is con siderab le evidenc e that CON progra ms can ac tually increase prices by fostering anticompetitive barrie rs to entr y. O ther mea ns of cost control a ppear to be more e ffectiv e and pos e less sig nifican t competit ive conc erns. er the recommenda tion of the I nstitute of Medic ine to broad en the membership of s tate lice nsure boards. State licensing boards are disproportionately composed of lice nsed providers, although some states require broader representation. Many state licensing boards have taken steps, such as restricting allied health professionals (AHPs) from independ ent prac tice and direct a ccess to consumer s, that sig nifican tly reduce c ertain forms of competition. State licensure boards with broader membership, including representatives of the gener al public, and individua ls with expe ffairs, education, and health services resear ch, could be less likely to limit competition by AHPs and new business forms for the deliver y of health c are, an d are le ss likely to engag e in condu ct that un reasona bly increa ses pric es or lowe rs acce ss to heal th care. 23c) States should consider implementing unifo rm licensing standards or reciproc ity compact s to reduce b arriers to t elemedici ne and competition f rom out-of-s tate providers who wish to move in-state. When used properly, tele medicine has consi derable promise a s a mecha nism to broaden access, lower costs, and improve health care quality. W hen used improperly, telemedicine has the potential to lower health care quality and to increase the incidence of consumer fraud. To foster telemedicine's likely pr o-competitive benefits and to deter its potential to harm consumers, states should consider implementing uniform licensure standards or reciprocity compacts. Uniform licensure standar ds and re ciproci ty compacts c ould operate both to pro tect con sumers a nd to reduce barrie rs to State regula tors and l egisla tors shoul d explicitly consider the pro-competitive benefits of telemedicine before restricting it. Similar considerations apply to the potential f or licensure to restrict competition from out-of- state providers who wish to move in-state. Recommendation 3: Govern ments s hould reex amine the role of subsidies in health care marke ts in light of t heir inefficiencies and potential to distort c ompeti tion. Health care markets have numerous cross-subsidies and indirect subsidies. Competitive markets compete away the higher prices a nd supra- competiti ve profi ts necessary to sustain such subsidies. Such competition holds both the promise of consumer benefits and the threat ofundermining an implicit policy of subsidizing certain consumers and ty pes of care. Competition cannot provide resources to those who lack them; it does not work well when certain facilities are expected to use hig her prof its in cer tain areas to cross-subsidize uncompensated care. I n gene ral, it is mo re eff icient to provide subsidies directly to those who should receive them, rather than to obscure cross sub sidies an d indirec t subsidies in transactions that are not transparent. Governments should consider whether curren t subsidies best ser ve their citizens' health care needs. Recommendation 4: Governments should not enact legislati on to perm it independe nt physicians Phys ining wil l harm con sumers fi nancial ly and is unlike ly to result in quality improvements. There a re numerous ways in which inde pendent physicians can w ork together to improve quality without violating the antitrust laws. Recommendation 5: States sho uld consider the potential costs and benefits of regulati ng pharma cy benefit manager transparency . In us compet ition in the mark etplace for PBMs is more lik ely to arrive at an optimal level of transparency than regulation of those terms. Just as competitive forces encourage PBMs to offer24their be st price a nd servic e combina tion to health pl an sponso rs to ga in acce ss to subscrib ers, com petition sh ould also encourage disclosure of the infor mation health pl an sponso rs requi re to dec ide with which PBM to contract. To the extent the Commission's Congressionally mandated study of PBMs provides re levant informati on to the i ssue of PBM transparency , it will be discussed in the Commission's study report. Recommendation 6: Governments should reconsider whether c urrent m andates be st serve their citizens' health care needs. When deciding whether to mandate particula r benefits , governments should consider that such mandates are likely to reduce competition, restrict consum er choice, raise the cost of health insurance , and incre ase the number of uninsured Americans. State and federa l gover nments mandate numerous health insurance benefits. Proponents argue that mandates can cor rect insurance market failures, and that the require d inclusio n of some b enefits i n all health insurance plans can be welfar e enhanc ing. Opp onents ar gue tha t the cas e for many manda tes is anecdotal, and that mandates raise premium costs, leading employ ers to opt out of pro viding he alth insurance and insured individuals to drop their coverage. Opponents also note that providers of the mandated benefit are usually the most vigorous propone nts of such legislation, making it more likely that the manda ted bene fits may constitute \"provider protection\" and not \"consumer protection.\" The Commission has submitted numerous competition advocacy letters on this issue in the last fifteen yea rs, focusing on any willing provide r and freedom of choice provisions. For mandates to improve the efficie ncy of the he alth insur ance ma rket, state an d feder al legi slators mu st be able to identify service s the insurance market is not currently c overing for which consumers are willing t o pay the marg inal costs . This task is challenging under the best of circumstances - and benefits are not mandated under the best of circumstances. In pr actice , mandate s are like ly to limit consumer choice, eliminate product diversity, raise the c ost of health insurance, and increase the number of uninsured Americans. State and federal policy makers should con sider wa ys of evalua ting the se risks in their decision making processes and reconsi der whe ther cur rent man dates be st serve their citizens' health care needs. VI. AGENCY PERSP ECTIVES ON ISSUES IN ANT ITRUST ENFORC EMENT IN HEA LTH CARE The Agencies have bee n active for nearly 30 y ears in h ealth ca re mark ets, challenging anticompetitive conduct and providing guidance to consumers and industry participants. This section outlines the Agencies' perspective on se veral issues in antitrust enforcement in health care markets.25A. Perspective on Physician-Related Issues Physicia n Joint Ve ntures and Multi- provider Networks . Health Car e Statement 8 provides that \"physician ne twork joint venture s . . . will no t be viewe d as per s e illegal, if the ph ysicians ' inte gratio n thro ugh the network is likely to produce significant efficiencies that benefit consumers, and any price agreements (or other agreements that would otherwise be per se illegal) by the network physicians a re reasonably necessary to achieve those efficiencies.\" Health Car e Statemen t 8 further notes that financial risk- sharing and clinical integration may involve sufficient integration to demonstrate that the venture is likely to produce significant efficie ncies. 1st Observat ion: Payment for performance arrangements among a group of physicians may constitute a form of financial risk-sharing. In determining whe ther a physicia n network joint ventu re is suff iciently financially integ rated to avoid per se condemnation, the Agencies will consider the extent to which a particular pay ment for performance (P4P) arrang ement constitutes the shar ing of su bstantial financi al risk among a group of phy sicians, and the relationship between the phy sicians' pricing agreement and the P4P progra m. 2nd Observat ion: The Agenc ies do not sug gest particular structures with which toachieve clinical integration that justifies a rule of reason analysis of joint pricing, but the analysis of whether a phy sician net work joint venture is clinically integrated may be aided in so me cir cumsta nces by asking quest ions like tho se outlined in Chapter 2. Attempts to achieve clinical integration were discussed at leng th at the Hearing s. Panelis ts descr ibed a wid e varie ty of factors as possibly r elevant to evaluating clinical integration. Panelists and commentators asked the Agencies to define the criteria that the Agencies will consider sufficient to demonstrate that a particular venture is clinically integ rated. The Agencies do not sugge st particular structures with which to achieve clinical integration that justifies a rule of reason analy sis of joint pricing , becau se of the risk that i t would channel market behavior, instead of encouraging marke t participants to develop structur es respo nsive to th eir par ticular g oals and the market conditions they face. As an aid to analysis, Chapter 2 of the Report includes a broad outline of some of the kinds of questi ons that th e Agen cies ar e likely to ask when analy zing whether a phy sician network joint venture is clinically integ rated. B. Perspective on Hospital-Related Issues Hospital M ergers . The Agencies will continue carefully to evaluate proposed hospital me rgers and to cha llenge those with likely anticompetitive effe cts. Certain issues addressed in hospital merger cases a re discussed below.263rd Observation: Research on hospital product markets is encouraged. In most cases, the Ag encies have analyzed hospital product marke ts as a broad group of acute, inpatient medical conditions where th e patien t must rema in in a hea lth care facility for at least 24 hours for treatment, recovery or observation. The Agencies continue to examine whether smaller markets exist within the traditional cluster product market definition or other product market adjustments might be warran ted, and e ncourag e resea rch on the se matters. For example: The percentage of total hea lth care spending devoted to outpatient care is grow ing. Th e Agenci es enco urage research on whether service s provided in outpatient settings may constitute additional relevant product markets, and if so, whether those services might be adversely affected by a hospital merg er. In recent y ears, si ngle-s pecialty hospitals have emerged in numerous locat ions. The A gencies encou rage further research into the competitive significance of SSHs, including whether pay ors can discipline general acute car e hospitals by shifting a larger perc entage of patients t o SSHs. The Agencies encourag e additional research to validate or refute the analytical tec hniques for defining product markets suggested by various c ommentato rs and pa nelists.4th Observation: Hospital geographic markets should be defined properly. The def inition of h ospital g eogra phic markets has proven controversial. In connection with this Report, the Agencies undertoo k a substa ntial ana lysis of how b est to determine the contours of the relevant geog raphic m arket in which hos pitals operate , consiste nt with the process described in the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines (Merger Guidelines ). The Agenc ies' con monopol ist\" test of the Merger G uideline s should be used to de fine ge ograp hic mark ets in hospital merger cases. To date, the Agencies' experience and r esearch indicate that the E lzinga- Hogar ty test is not valid or reliable in defining geographic marke ts in hospital merger cases. The limitations and difficulties of conducting a proper critica l loss ana lysis should be fully consider ed if this m ethod is us ed to define a hospital geographic market. b)The types of e vidence used in all merge r cases - such as s trateg ic planning documents of the merging parties and customer testimony a nd documents - should be used by Courts to help delineate relevant geographic marke ts in hospital merger cases. Evidence regarding the willing ness of c onsumers to travel and physic ians to steer consumers to less expensive alternatives should also be considered by Courts. 27c)The Agencies encourag e additional research to validate or refute the analytical tec hniques for defining geographic marke ts suggested by 5th Observation: Hospital m erger a nalysis should not be affected by institutional status. The best available evidence shows that the pricing behavior of nonprofits when they achie ve market power does not systematically differ from that of for-profits. The nonprofit status of a hospital should not be considered in determining whether a proposed hospital merger violates the antitrust laws. 6th Observation: The resolution of hospital merger challenges through community comm itment s should be ge nerally disfavored. The Agencies do not accept community commitmen ts as a re solution to likely anticompetitive effe cts from a hospital (or any othe r) merger. The Ag encies believe community commitments are an ineff ective, short-te rm reg ulatory approac h to ultimately a problem of tition. Neverth eless, th e Agen cies re alize that in some circumstances, State Attorneys Genera l may agree to communit y commitments in light of the resource and other constraints they f ace.C.General Issues 7th Observation: The safety zone provision of Health Care Statement 7 does not protect anticompetitive contrac ting pract ices of gr oup purchasing organizations. Health Car e Stateme nt 7 and its safety zone aim to addre ss monopsony and oligopoly conc erns with the formation of a GPO. This s tatement does not a ddress a ll potential issues that GPOs may raise. The Agenc ies belie ve amend ing the s tatement to address some, but n ot all pote ntial issue s, is likely to be counterpr oductive. Health Car e Statemen t 7 does not preclude Agency action challenging anticompetitive contracting practic es that ma y occur in co nnection with GPOs. The Agencies will examine, on a case-by -case basis, the facts of any alleged anticomp etitive c ontract ing pra ctice to determin e whethe r it violat es the an titrust laws. 8th Observation: Countervailing power should not be conside red an effec tive re sponse to disparities in bargaining power between payors and providers. Although there appear to be disparities in bargaining power betwe en some payors and some providers, the available evidence does not indicate that there is a monopsony power pr oblem in most health care markets. Even if it were assumed that providers confront monopsony health plans, the Agencies do not believe that allow ing prov iders to e xercise28countervailing power is likely to serve consumers' interests. 9th Observation: Private parties should not engage in anticom petitive conduct in responding to marketplace developments. The permissibility of unilateral and collecti ve is raised in several differe nt setting s in the Rep ort. Gen erally speaking, antitrust law permits unilateral response s to compe tition. I f there is specif ic evidence of anticompetitive conduct by individua l provide rs or pro vider co llusion in response to marketplace developments, the Agenc ies will ag gressi vely pursue th ose activities. 10th Observation: The state action and Noerr- Penningt on doctrin es should be interpre ted in light of the principles that just ified those doctrines in the first place. The state action and Noerr Pennington doctrines curb competition law to promote important values such as federalism and the right to petition the gover nment for redres s. In appropr iately broad interpretations of these doctrines can chill or limit competition in health care markets. It is im portant to recog nize both the genuine interests these doctrines serve as well as the anticompetitive consequences that result from an overly expansive interpretation of their scope. 11th Observation: Reme dies must resolve the anticompetitive harm, rest ore competition, and prevent future anticompetitive conduct. Remedies are a c ritical is sue in implementing an effective competition policy. Optimal enforc ement must steer O ver-de terren ce may occur if conduct that is not, in fact, anticompetitive is challenged, or if excessive sanctions are imposed on anticompetitive conduct. Under- deterr ence ma y occur if anticompetitive conduct is not identified and addressed, or if inadequate remedies a re imposed in response to such conduct. The Agencies must avoid both of these extremes to effe ct reate a \"compliance norm.\" Ag encies v iew all anticomp etitive c onduct as serious, and will seek appropriate sanctions. I n general, much more stringent measures are nec essary against those who violate the antitrust laws repeatedly or flagrantly and those who facilitate anticompetitive conduct by multiple pa rties. Th e Division will also pursue c riminal sa nctions in lution will be sought in appropriate cases. VIII. CONCLUSION The fundamental premise of the American free-market sy stem is that consumer welfare is maximized by open competition and consumer sovereignty - even when complex products and services29such as health care are involved. The Agenc ies play an importa nt role in safeguarding the fr ee-market sy stem from anticompetitive conduct, by bring ing enforcement actions against parties w ho violate the antitrust and consumer protection laws. To be sure, in some instances compellin g state interest s may trump or li mit free-market competition. The Age ncies play an important role here as well, by making policy makers a ware of the costs of impediments to competition, and by advocating for competitive market solutions. The Agencies do not have a pre-existing preference for any particula r model for the financing and delivery of health care. Such matters are best left to the impersonal workings of the marketplace. What the Agencies do have is a commitment to vigorous competition on both price and non-pric e param eters, in health c are and in the rest o f the ec onomy . Much re mains to be accomplished to ensure that the market for health care goods and ser vices operates to serve the inter ests of c onsumers . This Report identifies concrete steps to improve competition in the health care marketplace, and improve the application of competition law to health care.

DEVELOPM ENTS IN HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND DELIVERY Health care financing a nd delivery arrang ements ha ve under gone dr amatic chang es in the p ast seve ral dec ades. Th is section provides a brief overview of some of these de velopmen ts, includ ing cha nges in provider pay ment, the rise of managed care , and the in tegra tion (and then par tial dis- integration) of health care delivery.1 A. Fee For Ser vice Rei mbursement and the Rise of Manage d Care For most of the twentieth century, most consumers relied on independent physicians to provide ca re. Pricing was fee- for-service (FFS).2 FFS pay ment was based on the number and type of services performed. Insure rs imposed few constraints on consumer choice of providers and limited oversight of the ty pe and extent of care provided.3 FFS pay ment provided little incentive for physicians a nd other health care providers to coordinate and integrate the car e they rendered. FFS arrang ements c onforme d with publi c sentiment that more care was better car e, and1 There are numerous books on the i ssues covered in this sectio n.

Managed care existed for most of the 20th century , but it did n ot sprea d widely until the 19 80s and e arly 1990s.9 In 1980, the overwhelming majority of the population was enrolled in an indemnity insura nce plan and mana ged ca re org anizations (MCOs) accounted for a small percentag e of the market. Fifteen y ears later, these patterns had reversed, and various manag ed care offerings accounted for a n overwhelming majority of the insured population.10 To be sure, ma naged care at 22, 2 4. 5 Tufts M anag ed C are In stitute, A Brief History of Managed Ca re 2 (1998), at http:/ /www.tmci.org/ downloads/BriefHist.pdf (\"In t he late 1960 s and early 19 70s, po liticians and interest groups of al l stripes pr omoted v arious pr oposal s for stration a new nation al health strategy: the deve lopm ent of . . . .

The \"tools\" of managed car e include the creation of networks of preferr ed providers or the hiring of a staff of employ ed physicians to provide ca re, selective contracting based on price, re quired pre-au thorizatio n, restr p anels of provider s, higher copay ments (and sometimes denial of coverage) for out-of -network care, capitati on, bonuse s, pract ice gui delines, retrospective denials of coverag e, \"real-time\" utilization review, restricted covera ge of p rescrip tion drug s, diseas e manage ment for c hronic ill nesses, limitations on benefits, and an emphasis on prevention. In global terms, manag ed care offers a more restricted choice of (and a ccess to) providers and treatments in exchange for lower premiums, deductibles, and co-pay ments than tradition al indemn ity insurance. Stated differently , managed care inverts, to varying degrees, the incentives of a piece -work ba sed fee -for-se rvice sy stem, and employs a var iety of supply - and demand-side strategies to do so. MCOs typically use three strategies to contro l costs an d enhanc e quality of care : (i) selective contracting; (ii) direct f inancial11 Cara S.

Pay ment is typically based on a set number of dollars \"per member-per month.\" In the mid-1990s, many commentators believed that capitation would become the basis for compensating most providers. Capitatio n lost some o f its allur e when so me physician g roups that had received capitation payments under estimated the associa ted costs , and wer e force d to file bankruptcy.20 Pay ors also g rew less interested in capitation in the late-1990s, as provider s became increa singly relucta nt to accept the associated risks.

Some physicians w ho seek to avoid managed care entire ly have beg un concierge practice s, where they provide persona lized car e, includ ing hous e calls to patients willing and able to pay out of pocket for hea lth care costs.34 The pric e of thes e options vary, with consumers fa cing greater out-of- pocket c osts if the y select less restrictive options. Health care financing ha s also moved toward a tiered sy stem of payment. As the prior paragraph states, and Chapter 5 outlines in great er deta il, consum ers pay less if they selec t a restricted managed car e plan, or use an in-network provider than if they opt for a less rest rictive p lan or use an out- of-network provider. As Chapters 3 and 6 explain, tiering is also being used for hospitals and pharmaceuticals. Such strategies expose consumers to an increased share of the econ omic costs of their decision s.35 2.

Competition has an imp ortant ro le to play in en surin g that c onsum ers rec eive h igh quality care , and informing consumers of the costs and benefits of selecting a particular provider or treatment. Competition law promotes quality by encouraging consumer empowerment through information disclosure, and preventing marketparticip ants fro m engag ing in anticompetitive conduct.

In recent decades, technology, pharmaceuticals, and know-how have substantially improved how car e is delivered and the prospects for recovery . American markets f or innova tion in pha rmaceu ticals and medical devices are second to none. The miracle of modern medicine has become almost commonplace. Americans reap the benefits of new and improved drugs, cheape r gene ric drug s, treatm ents with less pain and fewer side effects, and treatments offered in a manner and loca tion consumers desire. At its best, American health c are is the best in the world. Commentators and panelists agree that providers are committed to delivering high quality ca re, that the vast majority of consumers are getting the c are they need, and that there have been rece nt improvements in quality of car e.58 There is , the title of the session is consu mer in form ation, b ut I think ther e's a real di fference bet ween what consumers may want and what payers may want.\"); Delbanc o 5/29 at 269-270 ( noting importa nce \"who the in health care); at of inf and to some degre e a lack of agreemen t on what constitut es high-quali ty surgi cal care from both the clinical and patient perspectives creates confusi on.\"). 57 See Clancy 5/ . 58 AH RQ, supra note 4 9, at 2.

Through their professional societies and other groups, health care prof essionals can jointly provide i nformati on and expr ess opinions to health plans and the general public.133 Physicians, for example, may collectively explain to a health plan a nd the general public why they think a particular policy or prac tice is medically unsound and may present medical o r scienti fic data to support th eir view s.134 Finally, the Ag encies have never brought a case based solely on provider s' collec tive advo cacy with a hea lth plan on an issue involving patient care.135 Competition law also enhances quality in way s that are not widelyapprec iated. Whe n provide rs enga ge in anticompetitive conduct they c an undermine the quality of car e actually r eceived by the population as a whole. Lower pr ices can actually contribute to hig her quality; as severa l commenta tors note d, \"when costs are high, people who cannot aff ord something find substitutes or do without.

The highe r the cost of ph armace uticals, t he more p eople skip doses or do not f ill their prescriptions.\"136 Stated differently, w hen anticomp etitive c onduct inc reases prices, it makes it more difficult for many Americans to obtain needed care.

Competi tion law e xists to promote and enhance consumer choice a long all of these dimensions. Provider complaints about the antitrust laws miss the point of those laws. As one co mmentator noted: [T]he antitrust laws are concerned with maximizing the long-term welfare of consumers, but this is not inconsistent with the interests of efficient providers. The providers who are most efficient and offer the best-qua lity service at reas onable prices will attract patients in a competitive environment protected by the antitrust laws. The provide rs whose methods fall behind the times and who rely on the protection of concer ted actio n to mainta in their position ma y lose grou nd. But th at is precise ly what one sh ould expec t in our fre e enter prise sy stem.141 In an efficient mar ket, consumer preferences specify the targets at which provi ders ai m. Wh en pro vider s engage in antico mpetitive conduct, they frustra te this process. By e nsuring a competitive marketplace and transparency of information, competition law and policy allows such demands to be satisfied, and prevents self-interested provider gr oups from preempting \"the working of the market by dec iding for itself that customers do not need that which they demand.\"142 the pro portion of firm s offering health ins uranc e to employees would decline by almost 2 percentage poin ts.).

INTRODUC TION TO COMPETITION LAW AND HEALTH LAW As background to the succeeding chapters, this chapter summarizes the basics of competiti on law an d offer s a brief history of the a pplication of competition law to health care markets. This chapter also provides an abbrevi ated ove rview of severa l specifi c forms of regulation that affect the structur e and pe rforman ce of the health care marketplace. A. Basics of Competition Law Feder al compe tition law s tems from a se ries of f ederal statutes, principa lly the Sherma n Act,143 the Clayton Act,144 and the Federal TradeCommission A ct.145 The Sher man Act pr ohibits unilateral and collective conduct that poses una ccepta ble dang ers to competition. Section 1 of the Sherman Act dec lares un lawful \" every contrac t, combinat ion . . . or c onspirac y, in restraint of trade,\"146 while Section 2 of the Sherm an Act pr ohibits \"monopolization\" and \"attempted monopolization.\"147 Courts reviewing Section 1 cases generally focus on whether the allegedly conspiring parties reach agreeme nt, and whether that agreement was unreasona bly restrictive. By contr ast, courts reviewing Section 2 cases generally examine whether the defendant created or maintained a monopoly through wr ongful or exclusionary means. The Clay ton Act pr ohibits the claim tha t mar kets coul d not a dequat ely provi de for public healt h and safety as \"nothing les s than a front al ass ault on the bas ic poli cy of t he Sherman Act\" ). See al so Blum stein 2/27 at 28 (\"[A]ntitrust law is the engine of the ma rket paradigm.\"); Frank H. Easterbro ok, Cyber spac e Ver sus Prope rty Law? , 4 TEX. REV. L. & POL. 103, 111 (1999). (\"It is ironic that just as a global network and automation are reducing the costs of contracting, and moving us closer to the world i n which the Coase Theorem prevails, people promote more and mo re contract-defeat ing schemes. One is tempted to thi nk that they are concerned not about market failures but about market successes - about t he prospect that the sort of world people pre fer whe n they vote t heir own pocket books wi ll depart from the propose rs' idea s of what p eople oug ht to pr efer.\"). 143 15 . In add ition, state a ttorneys gene ral ma y enforc e fede ral antitrust sta tutes. See generally HERBERT HOVE NKA MP, FEDERAL ANTITRUST POLICY: THE LAW OF COMPET ITION AND ITS PRACTICE \u00a7 15.4, at 590- 91 (2d ed. 1999) (discussing role of state attorneys gen eral in antitrust enfor cement). 146 15 U .S.C. \u00a7 1 (19 94) (\"Eve ry con tract, combina tion in the form of t rust or ot herwi se, or conspiracy, in r estraint of trade or commerce amo ng the se veral States , or wi th foreign n ations , is declared to be i llegal [and i s a felony puni shabl e by f ine and/or imprisonment] . . .\"). 147 Id. \u00a7 2 (\"E very p erson who s hall monopoli ze, or attempt t o monopoli ze, or combin e or conspire w ith any oth er pe rson o r pers ons, to monopo lize any part of the tr ade or comm erce among the seve ral Stat es, or wi th foreign nat ions, shall be deemed guilty of a felo ny [and is similarly punishable] . . . .\").32mergers and acquisitions where the effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\"148 The Clayton Act thus reaches incipient threats to competition that might escape the Sherman Act's reach. Under related leg islation, parties to proposed mergers that exceed statutory thresholds are required to notify the fede ral antit rust ag encies o f their plans and afford the gov ernment a limited opportunity to investigate befor e the transaction is executed.149 Finally, Section 5 of the F ederal Trade Commission Act provides that \"unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, a nd unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or af fecting commerce are ... unlawful.\"150 The Supreme Court found this provision provides the FTC w ith the au thority to attack conduct constituting a Sherman Act violation.151 The FTC Act provides no crimina l penaltie s and is limi ted to equitable remedies. Depending upon the specifics of a case, the Commission enforces the FTC Act either administratively or throug h the courts. Advisory opinions are a vailable for parties interested in prospective guidance as to the strictures of the FTC Act.152 The Divis ion offe rs busine ssreview letters that perform much the same function for the statutes that the Departm ent of Justic e enfor ces.153 The Agencies pr imary antitrust enforc ement au thorities , although state attorney s general and private parties can also bring suit. For example, b oth the Div ision and p rivate parties m ay sue to enf orce the civil provisions of the Sherman Act, which authorize treble damages and broad equitable relief. By contrast, only the Division may enforce the criminal provisions of the Sherman Act. Moreover, the federal laws assig n each Agency responsibility to enforce va rious antitrust laws. Thus, both Agencies can pursue violations of the Clayton Act, but only the Commission may enforce the FTC Act. Becau se most of t he antitr ust challenges to health care pra ctices focus on edly anticomp etitive a greem ents, an abbreviated analy sis of the standards for assessing such claims is warranted. In reviewing such claims, \"the developm ent of hor gests a n analy framework that proceeds by several identifiable analytica l steps.\"154 Some conduct - such as na ked ag reemen ts among competitors to fix prices or allocate markets - is viewed as \"inhere ntly suspect o wing to it s likely148 Id. \u00a7 13(a). 149 Hart-Sco tt-Rodino A \u00a7 18a (1976 ). 150 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45. 151 FTC v.

For almost three decades, the Agencies have continued to enforc e the competition laws by initiating investigations, filing and litigating complain ts, filing amicus br iefs in private litigation, and writing advisory opinions and business review letters for the health care industry.165 The Agencies took an additional step in the application of competition law and policy to hea lth care by issuing the joint Department of Justice and Federal T rade Comm ission State ments of Antitrust Enforcem ent Polic y in Health Car e (Health Car e Stateme nts) in1993.166 The Agencies designed the Health Car e Stateme nts \"to advise the health care community in a time of tremendous change, and to address . . . the problem of uncertainty concerning the Agencies' enforce ment policy.\" 167 In response to comments and changes in the health care ma rketplace the Agencies expanded the Health Car e Statemen ts in 1994 and amplified them again in 1996.

Division He alth Care Related Activities During the last three y ears, the Division has pursued formal investigations across the full range of healthcare products and services. In addition to the matters on which it has taken formal enforcement or advisory action, t he Divisio n has exami ned, or is investigating, mergers a nd conduct of managed care org anizations, including the review of four major merge rs of health plans. In one of these ma tters, the Division publicly set forth the reasoning that led it to clear the formation of thenation's largest health plan.180 The Divis ion has exa mined both vertica l contra cting a rrang ements involving health plans and providers as well as allegations of horizontal agreements among plans. Additionally, the Division has or is investigating merge rs and co nduct of p rovider s (both physicians and hospitals), including allegations of horizontal agreements. These investigations, while not resulting in challenges, have included criminal inquiries into the conduct of managed care plans, hospitals, and phy sicians. The Division's civil conduct investigations have encompassed hospital conduct, blood products, and retrospective examinations of a hospital joint oper ating a greem ent and a multi- hospital joint selling venture, the latter of which implement ed mecha nisms intended to achieve clinical integration without formal merger. The Division's formal merger investigations have encompassed hospital mergers, senior assisted l iving fa cilities, and diag nostic imaging service providers. F inally, the Division has actively provided c ounsel to the Administration on health care policy matters. The Division has taken several public enfo rcemen t acti ons, i nclud ing a merger challenge involving critical carephysicians and physi cian organizations have been the subject of approximately 50 enforcement actions. \"). 178 The Commiss ion a nnounc ed on Jun e 30, 2004 that it had closed an investi gation int o the aquis ition of Provena St. Theres e Medical Cente r by Vista Health Ac quisition .

T here ar e also administrative regulations creating specific safe harbors and advisory opinions covering a number of other arrang ements.190 Those who violate the anti-kic kback sta tute are subject to criminal and civil penalties and/or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid progr ams.

The Self- Referr al Amendm ents create a strict l iability offense , with violation punishable by prog ram exclusion and substantial civil penalties.

EMTALA The Emergency Medical Treatme nt and L abor Ac t (42 U.S.C. \u00a71395dd) requires hospitals that receive Medicare funding and have a n emergency department (ED) to provide an appropriate medical screening examination to any individual who comes to the ED and requests one. Stabilizing treatment must be provided to individuals with an emergency medical condition. Violations are punishable with civil penalties, program exclusion, and private lawsuits brought against individual hospitals. Like the anti-kickback and Self-Referral Amendments, EMTALA has had an important effect on the health care marketplace.193 4. Medical Malpractice Medical malprac tice litig ation is gover ned by state tor t law. To p revail in a medical malpractice claim, the plaintiff must prove that the provider-defendant owed a duty of c are to the plaintiff, that the provi der-de fendant breach ed this duty by failing to adhere to the standard of care expected, and that this breach of duty caused a n injury (with associated damages) to the plaintiff. Malpracticelitigati on seeks t o compens ate negligently injured consumers, deter unsafe practices, and achieve corrective justice. Numerous panelists and commentators stated that the medical malpractice sy stem is in the midst of a crisis.194 The American Medical Association (AMA) has declared a malprac tice cri sis in twen ty states, claiming that important health care services are in short supply.195 Complete consideration of this issue lies beyond the scope of this Rep ort, but it significantly a ffects the health care provi sions on ph ysician-owne 2/27 at 63; Kahn 2/27 at 76 (\"One of the un intend ed co nseq uenc es of the Stark L aw is this i ssue of physici an-owned specialty hospit als.\"); Fine 9 /9/02 See Bria n Ka moie , EMTALA : Dedicat ing an Emergenc y Depart ment Near You, 37 J.

OVERVIEW As Chapter 1 details, competition has spurred significant change s in the market for physician service s in the past several decades. Chapter 2 discusses how many physicians have soug ht to use innovative joint ventu res to pr ovide con sumers wi th higher quality care a t lower pr ices, wh ile others have sought to stifle competition through conduct such as price-fixing and restrictions on allied health professionals. Reflecting consumer concerns a bout the quality, availability , and price of phy sician service s, we hig hlight th e benef its to consumers of competitive markets and vigorous antitrust enforcement. This chapter first considers two ty pes of provid er netwo rk joint ve ntures - independent practice associations (I PAs) and physician-hospital org anizations (PHOs) - that are part of the rapidly changing marketplace for phy sician services. We then discuss physician pay ment arrangements, the messenger model, and phy sician collective bargaining. Next, the chapter eva luates the competiti ve impac t of restr icting p hysicians' and allied health professionals' market entry . Finally, we e xamine the application of antitrust law to certain aspects of the marketp lace fo r phy sician se rvices, including private antitrust litigation about creden tialing, the Age ncies' a nalysis to assess the financial and clinical integration of joint ventures, and the ability of physicians to share a nd use information relating to quality improveme nts.

COMPETI TION AND TH E MARKET FOR PHYSICIAN SERVICES Provider network joint ventures have the potential to reduce costs and improve quality. Some phy sicians, however, have responded to changes in the market for physician service s by eng aging in collusive anticompetitive conduct, seeking collective bargaining rights, and manipulating licensure regulations. The following sections describe these developments and assess their implications for the cost, quality, and availability of hea lth care. Some of these se ctions co ntain re commenda tions to enhance the performance of the physician services market. A.

Many physicians responde d to managed care's g rowth by implementing network joint ventu res to fa cilitate contrac ting with manage d care p lans. This section focuses on two joint venture ty pes (IPAs and PHOs) and descr ibes their key featur po tential e fficien cies.9 These joint ventu re types are not immutab le categories; as manage d care organizations (MCOs) have reduced reliance on c apitation arrangements, some joint ventures have dissolved while others have implementedmessenger models or invested in clinical integration.10 These joi nt ventur es also compete with one a nother to recrui t physician-m embers of IPAs are of inde pendent physicians that contrac t with MCOs and employ ers.12 IPAs m ay be org anized as sole proprietorships, partnerships, or professional 9 Some of the potenti al ef ficiencies discu ssed in this Sec tion m ay not c onstitute efficiencies for the purpo ses of the Agenc ies' antitrust analysis o f physicia n netwo rk join t venture s. 10 For a discus sion o f the me ssenge r mo del, see infra note s 110- 132, an d accompan ying text.

For a di scus Physician-members generally own IPAs, although individual doctors, hospitals or physician pra ctice manage ment comp anies al so own some IPAs.14 IPAs contract with phy sicians on both an exc lusive an d nonexclus ive basis .15 IPAs have historically included primary c are physicians a nd specia lists, alth ough som e commentators have noted a trend toward the formatio n of sing le-spec ialty IPAs.16 Many IPAs a re nonpr ofit.17 IPAs can be integrated (financially, clinically, or both) to vary ing degrees or not at all. Phy sicians p articipa ting in f inancia lly integrated I PAs share financial risks. Clinically integra ted IPAs seek to improve the quality of car e their member-phy sicians provide though varied strategies. Phy sicianswho esch ew finan cially or clinic ally integrating an I PA may use a messeng er model to convey price and price-related information to the payor. Most I PAs emerg ed in the 1 980s as a reaction to managed care .18 Panelists stated that some physicians in smaller pra ctices thought t hat pay ors had th e upper h and so they formed I PAs to gain bargaining leverage.19 Physicians were a lso concerned about missing out on managed care contracts, particularly contracts that included capitati on provisi ons.20 One commentator stated that the Health Maintenance Organizations Act of 1973 spurred the growth of IPAs by recognizing them as an acceptable form of orga nized medical practic e and pro viding f unds t heir developm ent.21 As MCOs have abandoned capitation arrangements with providers, the number of IPAs has declined in re cent 13 See Bro wn, supra note 12, at 290-92. 14 See Lawre nce Cas alino, IPA Over view Diff erent is Cali 20% physi cians own approximately 50%, and no n-physici an managers own abo ut al., supra note 12, at 230 (noting that 40 p ercent of Ca lifornian IPAs use exclusive contract s for some physicians ). 16 Lawr ence Casa lino et al., Growth of alty Medical Groups , 23 H EALTH (M ar./Ap r. 200 4); K ongs tvedt e t al., supra note 12, at 35; Gin sburg 2/26 at 67. 17 Ko ngstve dt et al., supra note 12, at 35.18 Casa lino 9/ 25 at 10 (s tating that IPAs \"were really more of a defensive strategy against manage d care. \"); Asner 9/25 at 31-32. 19 Casali no 9/25 97; Holloway 9/ at 100; Asner at physi cians bargaini alone l ack data an d an unde rstand ing of the nego tiating pro cess); T 'N, HEAL TH PLANS' SELECT ION AND PAYM ENT O F HEAL TH CARE PROVI DERS , 1999, at 120 (200 0) (final report) (\"M ost of the enti ties were al so formed to improve negot iating power or leverage with heal th pl ans ( 67 percent) and to protect market share (78 percent).\"). 20 Casalino 9/25 at 15 (stati ng that \"i f you're a small practice, you might be left out of HMO contracts, bu t in a large IPA , you're n ot likely to be.\") ; Asne r 9/25 at 31 ; Ko ngstve dt et al., supra note 12, a t 35. 21 Bro wn, supra note 12, at 290.5years.22 Statistics on the number size of IPAs vary.23 A panelis t repre senting an IPA trade a ssociatio n stated th at there present ly are approximately 2,000 I PAs nationwide.24 One survey found that the number of IPAs decrea sed from 1223 in 199 6 to 771 in 2002.25 A national survey of physician organ izations fo und that th ere we re at lea st 463 IPAs that contained more than 20 physician members in 2002.26 One panelist noted that IPAs can vary in size from about a dozen to more tha n 1,000 phy sician me mbers.27 A national survey of phy sician organizations found the average number of doctor s in an IPA was 233.28 Anoth er stu dy calcul ated an average of 387 phy sicians p er IPA nationw ide, while in California the average was 418.29b. IPA Efficiencies (i) Costs and Related Efficiencies Panelists and commentators disagreed about the impact of I PAs on the cost of c are and whether IPAs c an crea te efficiencies. Panelists stated that IPAs reduce contracting costs by lowering administrative and search costs for physicians and allowing payors to contra ct efficie ntly with pre- existing n etworks.30 Additionally, they asserted that IPAs may generate efficienc ies by integr ating informat tive purc hasing p ower to receive creden tialing o f phy sician-a pplicant s.31 Others expressed concern that physicians may use IPAs to obtain increased fees fr om pay ors.32 IPAs t hat eng age in payor contr acting and are not integra ted run 22 Casalino 9/25 at 7, 12-13, 93 (explaining that \"ab sent risk c ontra cting, IP As are struggling to find a re ason to exist\" ); M eier 9 /25 a t 70.

PHOs a. Description of PHOs A PHO is a joint venture between a hospital and physicians who g enerally ha ve admitting privileg es at the hospital.53 Physician and hospital members of a PHO sometimes contract jointly with MCOs for providing care to a population of patients. PHOs ty pically vary along base.54 First, PHOs can accept hospital medical staff on an exclusive or nonexclusi ve basis. Open PHOs allow most medical staff to join and have minimum creden tialing r Closed PHOs limit physician membership by practice profiling or specialty type and ar e more likely to form exclusive relationships with phy sicians.56 PHOs that employ practice profiling seek to use objective practice data to determine which phy sicians they should invite to join the PHO.57 PHOs that recruit physicia n-members based on specialty ty pe reportedly focus on the number of patients that the physic ian- member will PHOs are integrated (whethe r financ ially, clinica lly, or both) t o varying degre es or not a t all.59 Many nal Incenti ves, I nformation Technology, and Organized Process to Imp rove Health C are Q uality fo r Pa tients with Ch ronic D isease , 289 JAM A 43 9 (2003 ). 52 Thoma s Bo denheime r et al., Prima ry Care Physi cians Should Be Coor dinat ors, Not Gatekeepers , 281 JAM A 20 45, 2 048 (1999). 53 Lawton R.

Physician-members and hospitals jointly own most PHOs, tals are sole owne rs.61 Alth ough hospitals generally provide a majority of initial capitalization, some PHOs strive for equal physician- hospital ownership.62 Physicians may own interests in a PHO individually or through a n entity such as an IPA.63 PHOs can take the form of a limited liability company , a general partnership, a nonprofi t corpor ation, or a gene ral busin ess corporation.64 Finally, PHOs can ha ve different organizational bases. PHOs can have a hospital, multiple hospitals, or a hospital system as their org anizational base.65 Commentators often describe PHOs that involve multiple hospitals or joint ventures betwee n multiple PH Os as supe r-PHOs.66 Panelists and commentators stated that PHOs emerged in the 1980s largely as \"a defensive provider reac tion to increasing managed care pene tration.\"67 PHOs subsequently beca me the most common form of vertical integration among physicians a nd hospita ls.68 Approximat ely 60 percent of PHOs are nonprofit and 40 percen t are fo r-prof it.69 In 2002, 74 percent of PHOs were open and 26 percent we re closed.70 Panelists noted that PHOs have chang ed substa ntially in rece nt years.71 Many PHOs initially engaged in full or partial risk contracting.

PHO Efficiencies (i) Costs and Related Efficiencies Panelists and commentators differ on whether PHOs can reduce costs or o therwise result in efficiencies. Some contend that PHOs can reduce the cost of neg otiating contracts between pay ors and physicians a nd hospitals by offering \"one-stop shopping.\"76 As such, PH Os may enable p ayors to contract more efficiently with physicians with whom they have no e xisting contractual arrangements.

Summary Physicians have historically been solo or small-group practitioners, competing only with other such pra ctitioner s in their particular product and geog raphic market. As the market for phy sician services has evolved, and antitrust enforcement has address ed antic ompetitive conduct, competiti on has eme rged a to contr act with payors. The f orms and modes of competition in the market for physic ian services will inevitably var y over time as conditions and preferences chang e. Competition helps del iver an o ptimum mix of physician ser vices at the lowest cost and highest quality. The Agencies are committed to vigorous price and non-price competition and not to any particular model for delivering health care. B. Physician Compensation 1. Physician Payment Arrangem ents Insurers and others ty pically pay physicians on an F FS, salaried, or capitated basis.97 In F FS pay ment an in surer di rectly pays an individual provider ba sed on the number and type of services that provider perfor ms.98 Some state that FFS improves quality by rewarding phy sicians who do more for their pa tients.99 Other commentato rs are concerned t hat FFS payment cre ates inc entives f or phy sicians to over-provide healthcare resour ces because a physician's income is direc tly related to the volume and intensity of service s rendered.100 Capitation involves a physician assuming responsibility for a certain number of patients and receiving a fixed amount for each of these patients rega rdless of whether Organiz ational Div ersification Americ an Hospit al, 19 A NN.

The resulting figure is adjusted for g eographical differences and is updated annually.108 Many private payors and MC Os base th eir payment of phy sicians on this schedule.109 2. Messenger Model a.

Some stated that the messenger model simplifies contracting and contract administration, thereby reducingphysicians' and pay ors' tra nsaction costs.122 Two panelists observed that an agent can significantly r educe phy sicians' transaction costs by educa ting them about the terms of a contrac t.123 Panelists a lso explaine d that a properly implemented me ssenger model cannot r esult in hig her pric es for pa yors, because it is incapable of creating countervailing market power for physicians.124 Finally, one pa nelist observed that networks risk incurring administration costs for limited gain if only a minority of network physicians a ccept a pay or's offer.125 In contrast, some panelists and commentators stated that the messenger model is not a viable business strategy and can increase costs for providers and Preferred Physic ians), avail able at http://www .ftc.gov/b c/ado ps/ba pp030923.h tm. 120 See, e .g., In re Physician Network Consul ting, L.L.

Some state d that mess enger arrang ements are useful in preventing violations of the antitrust laws and lower the risk of being compelled to disband a network to settle an Agency investigation.130 One panelist noted the model has been particularly useful for erstwhile financially integrated phy sician networks that need an alternative contrac ting mechani sm as risk s haring arrang ements have become less common.131 Others noted that physician ne tworks purporting to use the messenger model have been the focus of multiple Agency investig ations an d consen t settleme nts.132 3.

Several speakers opposed such exemptions.156 As one panelist stated, \"it'sclear that a blanket exemption to the antitrust laws for the purpose of allowing the creatio n of coun tervaili ng powe r is inappropriate.\"157 Another speaker similarly testified that allowing providers to acquire countervailing market power is unnecessary, impossible to impleme nt, and ba d public policy.158 The Ag encies b elieve th at antitr ust enforcement to prevent the unlawful acquisition or exercise of monopsony powe r by insurers is a better solution than allowing providers to exercise countervailing power. Joel Klein, the Assist ant Attor ney Genera l in 1999, noted that a \"better approach [than allowing counter vailing market p ower] is to empower consumers by encouraging price competition, opening the flow of accurate, meaningful information to consumers, and ensuring effec tive antit rust enf orceme nt both with regard to buy ers (health care insurance plans) a nd seller s (health care pr ofession als) of provider services.\"159 on Health Care and Comp etition Law and Policy (Sept . 16, 2002) 2 (Public Comment) ; Meghrigi an 9/24 at 85 ; Ame rican M edica l Ass'n, C omp etition in Healt h Ins uran ce: A Comprehen sive Stu dy of U.S. Markets E xecu tive 32; AL ., CHARLES RIVER ASSOCIATES , COMPET ITION I N HEAL TH INSURANCE AND PHYSI CIAN MARKETS : A REVIEW OF \"COMPET ITION I N HEAL TH INSURANCE : A COMPREH ENSIVE STUD Y O F US MARKETS \" BY THE AMERI CAN MEDICAL ASSOC IATION (2002) (Pub lic Comment) (S ubm itted Leib infra Cha pter 6 . 155 See, e .g., Fore man 5/7 a t 21-2 2. 156 See, e .g., Noether 193; American Bar Comments Regardi ng The Federal T rade Co mmission' s Wo rksho p on Health Care and Competi tion Law and Poli cy (Oct. 2002) 10-1 3 (Public C omm ent) [he reinafter ABA Statem ent on B ehalf of the A ntitrust Coalition for Con sumer Cho ice in He alth to of Congr ess (Apr. 12, 2002) (Pub lic Comm ent) (On B ehalf of The Antitrust Coalition F or C onsu mer C hoice in He alth Ca re). 159 The Quality Healt h-Care Coalit ion Act of 199 9: He aring o n H.R . 1304 Before th e Ho use Com m. on the Jud iciary , 106t h Cong. 14 Joel I.

Panelists a greed that it is pr efera ble to use ant itrust enf orceme nt to addr ess monopsony concer ns than to allow physicians to acc umulate countervailing market power. One panelist stated, for example, that the best policy response to the existence of market power on one side of the market is to remove it on a ca se-by -case basis.161 Even a panelist who spoke in favor of allowing countervailing market powe r noted that restoring competition is the ideal solution to a health insurer's acquisition of monopsony power.162 Indeed, even if w e assume physicians confront a monopsonist health plan that neither unlawfu lly acquired nor unlaw fully exercised that power, authorizing phy sicians to engage in collusive conduct will not serve the inter ests of c onsumers .163 A health insurer with monops ony power is l ikely to impose qua ntity restric tions that w ill increase prices for consumers. I f providers were to acquire countervailing ma rket power, the result is likely to be f urther quantity restrictions - increa sing the prices paid by consumers a bove those already imposed by the monops onist.164 Providers that obtain countervailing market p ower als o likely will caus e competitive harm to other market participants that do not possess monopsony power. One panelist suggested, f or example, that physicians may use their countervailing market power to disadvantage non-phy sician competitors, such as nurse midwives and nurse anesthetists, or health care insurers other than the monopsonist health care insurer.165 The Agencies believe that statutory or other legal change s allowing countervailing market power are ill-advised and unnecessary .

Physician Collective Bargaining Harms Cons umers The Ag encies h ave con sistently opposed the creation of antitrust exemptions for phys ician collective bargaining. In congressional testimony , the Agencies have identified various way s in which physician collective bargaining likely will harm consumers and other participants in the health c are sy stem.166 These harms include: (i) consumers and employers f acing higher prices f or health insurance coverage ; (ii) consumers facing higher out-of-poc ket expenses as copayments and othe r unreimbursed expenses increase; (iii) consumers receiving reduced benefits as costs increase; (iv) senior citizens participating in Medicare HMOs receiving reduced be nefits; (v) the federa l gover nment pay ing more for hea lth coverage for its employ ees; (vi) state and local g overnme nts incur ring hig her cost s to provide h ealth be nefits to t heir emp loyees; (vii) state Medicaid programs incurring higher costs to pr ovide hea lth benef its, forcing them to inc rease t axes, cut b enefits, or reduce the number of beneficia ries; and (viii) the number of uninsured increasing due to more costly hea lth insurance. The balance of this section focuses on the impact of phy sician c ollective barga ining on c ost and quality. Collectiv e barg aining i s likely to increase substantially the price of health care services, because providers collectively are likely to demand higher fees an d refuse to negotiate individually.167 The Agencies have extensive experience with the consequences of alleged phy sician collective bargaining. For example, the Commission alleged approximately 500 phy sicians and 15 hospitals that comprised the vast majority of providers covering a larg e area of southern Georg ia conspi red to fix pr ices and not to deal with payors on an i ndividual basis.168 Accord ing to the complain t, respon dents restrained competition among the providers and forc ed pay ors to pay higher prices to its providers, thereby increasing the cost of healthc are for consumer s.169 In United States v.

Through licensure requirements, states may restrict market entry by p hysicians a nd allied health professionals (AHPs), and further limit the scope of authorized practice.179 Most state licensing boards are primarily composed of licensed providers, although some states require broader represe ntation.180 The Commission recently initiated administrative litigation against a state licensing board,allegi ng that i t had take n steps unl awfully to restric t AHPs fro m obtaining direct a ccess to consumer s.181 Many states have only limited or no recipr ocity for lice nsing ou t-of-sta te physicians and AHPs see king to practice in- state.182 A number of state licensing boards have also sought to restrict the practice of telemedicine. This section considers each of these issues and recommends strategies for address ing the a nticompe titive risk s of state regulation of the nature and form of professional practice. 1. Mechanisms to Regulate Physician and AHP Market Entry The states have traditionally assumed responsibility for reg ulating physicians a nd AHPs using three certification; and (iii) registration.183 Licensure, the most restrictive method of regulation, ty pically involves a mandator y system of state-imposed standar ds that practitioners must meet to practice a given178 See Roger D.

They also recomme nd that sta tes should not restr ict a duly lic ensed physicia n from consu lting a physician in another state . When used properly, tele medicine has consi derable promise a s a mecha nism to broaden access , lower c osts, and i ncreas e healthcare quality. W hen used improperly, telemedicine has the potential to lower health care quality and increase the incidence of consumer fraud. To foster telemedicine's likely pr o-competitive benefits and to deter its potential to harm consumers, states should consider implementing uniform licensure standards orreciprocity compacts. Uniform licensure standar ds and re ty c ould operate both to pro tect con sumers a nd to reduce barrie rs to State regula tors and l egisla tors shoul d explicitly consider the pro-competitive benefits of telemedicine before restricting it.

The Agenc ies' Anti trust Ana lysis of Provid er Net work Joint Ventures Health Care Statement 8 describes how the Agencies evaluate phy sician network joint ventu res. This statemen t sets forth antitrust safety zones for exclusive and non-exclusive physician network joint ventures that, absent extraordinary circumst ances, t he Age ncies ar e unlikel y to challenge. Statement 8 then outlines the analytical fr amework for joint ventures that fall outside the antitrust safety zo nes. It states that like transactions in other sectors of the economy, \" physician network joint ventures will be analy zed under the rule of reason, and will no t be viewe d as per s e illegal, if the ph ysicians ' integr ation throu gh the network is likely to produce significant efficiencies that benefit consumers, and any price agreements (or other agreements that would otherwise be per se illegal) by the network physicians a re reasonably necessary to realize those efficiencies.\"250 This statement further notes that financial risk-sharing and clinical integ ration may involve su fficien t integr ation to demonstr ate that t he ventur e is likely to produce significant efficiencies. Finally, Statemen t 8 outlines the Agencies' rule of reason analy tical framework and applies theprinciples set forth in the statement to seven examples of physician network joint venture s.251 2. Financial Integration Statemen t 8 notes tha t financ ial risk sharing can gener ate significant efficiencies by providing physicians w ith incen tives to cooperate in controlling the cost and improving the quality of se rvices they render. It provides e xamples of arrang ements thr ough wh ich part icipants i n a physician networ k joint venture can share substantial financial risk, including capitation, global fee arrang ements, fee- withholds, bonuses o r penalt ies.252 Statemen t 8 also establishes that only those phy sician network s that sha re substa ntial fina ncial ris k can qualify f or an antitrust safety zone on the basis of their financial integration. As Chapter 1 outlines and the Health Care State ments acknowledge, financing and delivery a rrangements for health car e have ch anged substantia lly over the p ast severa l decade s.253 Some commentators and panelists state P4P arrangements may have important procompetitive benefits for consumer s.254 Chapters 1 and 3 describe gram opin ion.p df. 250 HEAL TH CARE 8(B y confront physi cian network joint ventur es that re quire rule of re ason analysis.

In determining whe ther a physicia n network joint ventu re is suff iciently financially integ rated to warrant rule of reason analy sis, the Agencies will consider the extent to which a particular P4P arrangement constitutes the sharing of substantial financial risk among the members of the joint venture, whether that sharing is likely to produc e efficiencies, and whether any price or otherwise per se illega l agreements among the membe rs are reasona bly necessa ry to achie ve those efficiencies. 3. Clinical Integration Health Car e Stateme nt 8 notes that clinical integration can be evidenced by a \"network implementing an active and ongoing program to eva luate and modify practice patterns by the network's physic ian participants and create a high de gree of interdependence and coopera tion among the physicians to control costs and ensur e quality.\"255 This statement identifies three arrangements that a clinical integ ration program might include: (i) establishing mechanisms to monitor and control utilization of health care services that are designe d to contr ol costs a nd assure quality of care; (ii) selectively choosing network physicians w ho are li kely to furthe r these efficiency objectives; and (iii) the significant investment of capital, both monetary and human, in the necessary infrastructure andcapability to rea lize the claimed efficiencies. This section discusses commentators' perspectives on clinical integration and presents a series of inquiries the Agencies are likely to pose when considering whether a phy sician network joint ventu re is suff iciently clinical ly integrated to avoid summary condemnation. Commission staff stated in an advisory opinion to a proposed initiative involving clinical integration that the venture, as designed, did not warrant summary condemna tion.256 Commission staff also closed an investigation into a physician collabora tion that created a substantial degree of market conce ntration, because the parties demonstrated the collabor ation cr eated c onsidera ble efficiencies (including improvements in the quality of car e).257 255 HEAL TH CARE STATEMENTS , supra C ommission, to John J.

A trade association representing Californian physician g roups contended that joint negotiation of contracts will ensure that sufficie nt phy sicians a cross mult iple specialties participate in the venture.273 icians pa rticipat e in I PA networ ks, this association argued, because the y can delegate \"the time and hassle of neg otiating contracts with pay ers\" to the IPA.274 Moreover, the trade association sugg ested payors' costs se, beca use a cli nically integrated I PA will deliver cost-effective and efficient care. This trade a ssociation also argued that clinically integrated I PAs \"can offer pay ers a single, comprehensive, and integ rated ne twork\" a nd should therefore \"be priced in the ag gregate, not through individua l contra cts with physicians.\"275 Commentators similarly asserted that joint pricing is necessary to ensure the active and ongoing participation of an entire group' s members .276 These commentatorsalso contend that joint negotiations are necessary to help physician members recover the substantial time and financial commitmen ts that ar e neces sary to implement a clinica l integr ation pro gram.277 Finally, they argue that joint negotiations are necessary to prevent physician me mbers from fre e-riding on the con tributions of their colleag ues.278 The extent to which joint contracting is reasonably ne cessary to achieve efficient clinical integration will vary , depending on the fac ts and cir cumstanc es.279 The Agenc ies will tive neg otiation is reasonably necessary to accomplish the goal of achieving clinical integra tion. Participants in a joint venture that ntly integr ated (wh ether ally) face signific ant antitr ust risk if they attempt to contrac t jointly. c.

The Agencies do not sugge st particular structures with which to achieve clinical integration that justif ies joint pr icing, b ecause it would risk channeling market behavior rathe r than encouraging marke t participants to develop structures responsive to their particular efficiency goals and the market conditions they favor . Nonetheless, to help further guide practitioners and counsel on the issue, below is a broad outline of some of the kinds of questions that the A gencie s are like ly to ask when analy zing the competitive implicationsof a physician ne twork joint venture that justifies joint action involving price or other competitively significa nt terms on the grounds that it is clinically integ rated. The Agencies emphasize that this list is not exhaustive, and that these questions may be more or less relevant, depending on fa ctual circumstances. Other questions, not listed here, may be important, again depending on the facts at issue. 1.What do the physicians plan to do togethe r from a c linical st andpoint? What specific activities will (and should) be undertaken? How does this differ from what each physician already does individually? What ends are these collective activities designed to achieve? 2.How do the physicians e xpect act ually to accompl ish these goals? What infrastructure and investment is needed? What specific mechanisms will be put in place to make the program work?

As Aree da and Ho venkamp note, \"the great majority of exchanges of information that do not pertain to either price or output should be regarded as harmless , at leas t when co ncerte d refusa ls to deal are not in issue.\"285 The Agencies encourage such information sharing , as long as there are adequate saf eguards to ensure information exchange is not used for anticompetitive ends. 282 HEAL TH CARE STATEMENTS , supra note 44, \u00a7 6.283 Id. \u00a7 6. 284 See Letter from C harles A.

INTRODUC TION In cities and towns throughout the United States, hospitals are a key part of the health care delivery system. Hospitals are there when Americans give birth or die , are injured, or live with a chronic illness. Hospitals respond to the health care challenges in their communities, whether the problem is SARS or syphilis, anthrax or chicken pox, obesity or influe nza. Hospi tals provide c are to th e rich a nd poor, th e well insured and the uninsured. Currently, pay ments to hospitals for inpatient care account for approximately 31 percen t of total h ealth ca re expend itures in the Unite d States.3 The percentage of total 1 For li sts of part icipan ts in thes e and other panels see infra App endix A an d in the tc.gov/ogc/h ealthcarehear ings/ completea 2 A t of par ticipants i n the Sept ember 2002 FT C Health Care Workshop is avail able at http://www. ftc.gov/ogc/ healthcare/agenda.htm. 3 Kath arine L evit et al., Health Spending Rebound Conti nues i n 2002 , 23 H EAL TH AFFAI RS 147, 155 (Jan./F eb. 2 004). 2expenditur es devote d to inpatient care has declined over the past two de cades, along w ith declin es in hospital length-of-stay and the per capita rate of hospitalization.4 During the period 1993-98, spending on hospital inpatient care increased by 3.4 percent per year.

Although CMS uses an administered pricing system for Me dicare , hospital s engage in non-price competition to attract Medicare and Medicaid beneficia ries, and engage in price a nd non-price competition for private pay ors and patients. As detailed below, competition in the market for hospital inpatient services has enhanced quality and lowere d prices. Private and public pa yors are en courag ing thes e improvements by g iving providers financial and nonf inancia l incentiv es to incr ease quality and -related informat ion to patie nts.10 III. DESCRIP TION OF HOS PITALS Hospitals fall into one of three categories: (1) publicly owned hospitals, (2) nonprofi t hospitals , and (3) for-pr ofit hospitals. Although these classifications might appear distinct and immutable, they are not. Many nonprofit hospitals own for- profit ins titutions or have for -profit subsidiaries. F or-pro fit systems m anage nonprofit and publicly owned hospitals. Hospitals also may chang e their institutional status. One study demonstrated that ove r a thirteen yea r period, approximately one percen t of hospita ls chang ed their institutional status every y ear.11 Nonprofit hospitals currently ma ke up about 6 1 perce nt of commu nity hospitals and have roughly commu nity and 13 percent of inpatient beds. The rema ining 24 p ercent of commun ity hospitals are run by f ederal, state, and local governments, and account for 16 per cent of inpatient beds. Figure 2 shows the distribution of beds among the categories of hospitals and shows that these patterns have not chang ed signi ficantly over the past thirt y years.13 Hospitals are als o freque ntly categorized as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary , dependent on the level and complexity of care provide d. For example, a primary ca re hospital offers basic services such as an emergency department and limited intensive care facilities. A secondary care hospital generally offers primary ca re, general internal medicine, a nd limited surgical and diagnostic capabilities. A tert iary care ho spital pro vides a full range of basic and sophisticated diagnostic and treatment services, including many specialized services. 10 See supra Chapte r 1. 11 Jack Needlem an et al., Hospit al Convers ion Tr ends , 16 H EAL TH AFFAI RS 187, 189- 90 (Mar./ Apr. itals; lic and nonp rofits co nverte fo r-pro and ublic hosp Id. 12 The Ameri can Hospi define s whose facili ties and servi ces are available t o the public.\" In 2002, there were approximat ely 1, 136 state and local government hospitals, 3,025 nonp rofit hospit als, and 766 for-prof it ar e clas sified as com munity ospitals.

T hese dist inctions, however, are not alway s clear in practice, as hospitals are not restricted to only offering the services associated with one categ ory. Hospitals provide either general inpatient services or specialize in a particu lar kind o f patien t (e.g., pediatric and women's hospitals) or condition ( e.g., cardiac, orthopedic, psy chiatric and rehabilitation hospitals). Regardless of how one categ orizes private hospitals, they fa ce similar market pressures and competitive constraints. Hospitals seek to provide cost-effective care and generate sufficient mar gins to continue to provide care to the commu nity. Ind eed, it is a misnome r to use th e word \" nonprofi t;\" as hos pital admin istrators are fon d of sa ying,\"no margin, no mission.\"14 IV. HOW ARE HOSPITALS PAID: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Prior to 19 83, Medic are and most other insurers paid hospitals on a cost-based reimburs ement sy stem.15 Under sy stem, hosp itals informed payor s of the cost of the care that was provided, and those amounts were then 14 LAURIE E.

Alth ough the re were some cons traints on how muc h a hospita l could cl aim as its costs, the result was to reward volume and discourage efficiency . Payors picked up the cost of each service, each or dered test, and each day in the hospital. Additionally, compreh ensive he alth insur ance (b oth private and public) imposed minimal out-of- pocket costs on patients. Thus, insured patients had little incentive to select lower cost procedures or more efficient provide rs. As a passive pay or of bills, the payor ha d no control over expenditures. This pay ment sy stem led to substantial increases in health care spending. Payors so ught t o curb these costs throu gh various methods. Medicare implemented a prospective pay ment system in 1983, and has experimented with a range of strateg ies for cre ating in centive s for hosp itals to constrain their pricing. Private pay ors have done the same, in many instances piggy- backing off strategies de veloped by CMS. Medicai d progr ams have also adop ted their own pricing strategies. The rise of managed care and other delivery -side innovations have also had a significant impact on hospi tal pr icing.16 A. Public Pay ors The most si gnific ant public payor is CMS, which administers the Medicare and Medicai d progr ams. I n 1983, Con gress directed CMS largely to abandon cost-based reimbursement for acute inpatient care delivered to Medicare beneficiar ies, and adopt the inpatient prospective pay mentsystem (I PPS).17 The I PPS was and ... curb ine fficien cies in hospital operations engendered by reimbursement of incurred cost.\"18 Under the IPPS, the amount a hospital receives for treating a patien t is based on the dia gnosis- related group (DRG) for the e pisode of hospitalization. The DRG assigned to a particular episode of hospitalization is based on the diagnosis at discharge that justified the hospit alization. Each DRG has a payment weig ht assigned to it, based on the average cost of trea ting patients in that DRG. The a verag e DRG cos t reflec ts both the very ill patients that requir e more intensive care and the \"healthy \" ill who do not cost as much to treat. Hospitals receive this predetermined amount regardless of the actual cost of care. Certain hospitals receive an adjusted payment in exce ss of the s tandard DRG amount.

Moreover, if the treatment of a particular patient is exceptionally costly , an \"outlier\" adjustment is added.20 Prior to Au gust 1, 2 000, CMS pai d hospitals for outpatient care on a cost-based system. Since that date, hospitals, pursuant to the Balanced Budge t Act of 1997, are paid for outpatient care under the outpatient prospective pay ment system (OPPS). Under OPPS, hospitals receive a predetermined amount for all outpatient services or procedures, based on which one of the approximately 750 ambulatory payment classifications (APCs) the episode of care falls into . The OPPS e ncompass es allevaluation and management service s and procedures provided by hospitals on an outpatient basis. For example, the APC for a particular outpatient surgical proce dure includes payment for all operating and recovery room services, anesthesia, and surgical supplies. Each APC is assigned a general weight base d on the median cost of providing the service.21 Effective October 1, 2000, Medicare adopted a prospective pay ment system for home hea lth care service s.22 Moreover, as of 2007, Med icare is schedule d to beg in employ ing a co mpetitive bidding s ystem to determin e which p rovider s will offe r durabl e medical equipment to Medicare benefic iaries.23 19 See Centers for M edica re & Medica id Serv ices, Acute I npati ent Pr at http://www .cms .hhs.gov/pr ovider s/hipps /ippsover.asp (last ar. 10, 20 03). T hese adjust ments wer e made because Congres s conclu ded that Medicare shoul d pay more to hos pital s that incurred greater expenses as a r esult of havi ng a residency program, or having more patients who were poor.

The legislatio n includ es pro visions to ensure quality, protect sma ll supp liers, and mand ate mu ltiple winners.7 The I PPS sy stem was d esigne d to control rising inpatient hospital costs and shift more care to the outpatient setting.

As descr ibed in g reater detail inChapter 5 , each st ate also has a Med icaid program, which pay s for care provided to the poor and disabled.25 Within broad guidelines established by Federal law, each state set s its own pa yment rate f or Medic aid services and administers its own program. Medicaid programs either pay health care provider s directl y on a fee- for-se rvice ba sis, or use prepay ment arrangements such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs).

B. Private P ayors In some instances, private pay ors copied the reimbursement strategies of the Medicare program, or used Me dicare DRGs as a reference price for negotiation.27 Thus, some payors neg otiate either a specified discount o r a spec ified pa yment relati ve to the amount CMS would pay for a spec ified treatme nt episode . More of ten, priv ate payors and ho spitals ne gotiate discounts from cha rges ( e.g., they pay 85 percent of billed ch arges ) or a pe r diem ra te. Some contracts provide for a fixed pay ment for inpatient services on a per-case basis. Outpatie nt pay ment prov isions are typically structured on a percentage -of-billed charges or fee-schedule basis. V. RISING HO SPITAL P RICES Expenditures on hospital services have grown over the past two deca des, but the rate of spending growth ha s varied. As noted previously, I PPS slowed the rate of hospital expenditure growth. The rise of managed care slowed the r ate of expenditure growth further; from 1993 through 1998,hospital expenditures increased at an averag e annua l rate of 3.7 perc ent and in some areas of the country , the per diem price of a hospital stay ac tually decre ased.28 In the past five y ears, rising hospital prices h ave driv en spend ing on ho spitals higher , ugh hosp ital utiliza tion is decli ning.29 Analysts attribute rising hospital prices to a variety of factors including \"hospita ls' incre asing a bility to price s from pri vate payers.\"30 26 CENTERS F OR MEDICARE & MEDICA ID SERVI CES, STATE MEDICAI D MANUAL , PART 2 - STATE ORGAN IZATION GENERAL & MEDICAI D SERVI CES, 2002 MEDICAI D MANAGED CARE ENROLLMENT REPORT (2002). 27 See, e.g., Shoptaw 4/ 11 at 61 (st ating that in the Little R ock mark et, \"[r]eim burse men t, . . . is largely discounted w ith fee for DRGs and per diems . . . . \").28 See sup ra Figure 3.

Mo re recently, numerous cardiac and orthopedic surg ery hospitals have opened or are under construc tion.

Ambulatory surg ery ce nters (ASCs) perform surgical procedures on patients who do not require an overnight stay in the hospital. Approximately half of the ASCs are sing le- specialty.120 Single- special ty ASCs generally specialize in either gastroenterology , orthopedics, or ophthalmology.121 Most ASCs ar e small (two to fo ur opera ting roo ms). ASCs' ownership structures vary : some are completely phy sician owned; some are owned by joint ventures be tween physicians and priva te or publ icly traded c ompanies ; some are owned by physician/hospital joint venture s; and some are own ed by hospitals and hospit al networ ks.122 Inno vations in technology have made it possible to offer a broad ra nge of service s in ASCs.123 ASCs requi re less c apital tha n SSHs, and are generally less complex to develop because they do not require the facilities needed to offer care twenty-four hours a day,seven days a week. ASCs generally do not have eme rgenc y departmen ts, and ce rtifica te of need regulations often are not a s rigorous for ASCs, if they apply at all.

The ASC payment schedule has not been ad justed for a dvanc es in t echno logy and prod uctivity over the last 16 y ears; so me procedures that were once labor -and- resourc e intensiv e are no w much les s costly for ASCs to perform. The MMA freezes Medicare pay ment rates for ASCs from 2005 through 2009 and directs the Department of Health a nd Human Se rvices to implement a new payme nt system by 2008.134 Although ASCs and hospital outpatient departments perform some of the same procedures, pay ment varies depending on where the services are provide d.

As former CMS administrator Tom Scully noted, wh en the ASC r ate is high \"a ll of a sud den y ou start se eing ASC s pop up all over the place to do colonoscopies or to do outpatient surgery .... If the hospitals get paid a little more, they're going to have more outpatient center s.\"137 Many of the c oncerns expressed by panelists about SSHs were also expressed135 Andrew 3/26 at 118. 136 MEDPAC 2003, supra note 127, \u00a7 2F, a 46.27about ASCs. Panelists a sserted that ASCs are eroding the outpatient market share of hospitals that hospitals depend upon, that ASCs do not c are for Medicai d beneficiaries, they \"skim and cherry -pick on the front end regarding [] the finances of the patient,\" and that ASCs only enter a reas where business is profitable.138 One ASC representative sugge sted that reimbursement should be modified based on the acuity of the patie nt, but den ied that A SCs refuse to care f or Medic aid patie nts.139 Market R eaction t o ASC Entry . Panelists indicated that many of the a ctions taken to curb entry of specialty hospitals are also being employ ed against ASCs. One panelist suggested that entry and competition for ASCs have been made difficult by hospitals eng aging in legislative efforts to encumber ASCs with unnecessary regula tion and ma ndatory service s.140 Another panelist d escribe d how some hospitals have negotiated discounted prices for inpatient services in exchange for exclusive contracts for outpatient surgery.141 One panelist noted that some general hospitals have revoked privileges of physician-i nvestors in ASCs, and used stat e certifi cate of need (CO N) laws to inhibit ASC entry.142 Competitiv e Evalua tion of Entr y. In general, the Agenc ies favor the elimination of anticompetitive barriers to entry , on the ground s that rob ustly competiti ve marke ts in which entry a nd exit is determined by market forces maximizes consumer welfare. Entry by SSHs and ASCs has had a number of beneficial consequences for c onsumers who receive care from these providers. It cannot be overlooked, however, that Medicare's administered pricing sy stem has substantially driven the emer gence of SSHs and ASCs. Generally speaking, antitrust law does not limit individual hospitals from unilaterally re sponding to competition either by terminating phy sician admitting privileg es or by approac hing sta te governments in connection with CON procee dings.143 If there is specific evidence of anticompetitive conduct by individual hospitals or of hospitals colluding together against efforts to open a SSH or ASC, then the Age ncies wil l agg ressive ly pursue tho se activities.

Once IPPS went into effect, leng th of stay began an immediate decline, the number of inpatient cataract surgeries dr opped precipi tously (from 63 0,000 to 21 1,000 in one yea r), and the number of hospital outpatie nt catar increa sed the adoption o f prospe ctive pa yment for hom e health care had an immediate impact on the number of beneficiaries that rece ived service s and the a verag e number of visits.146 Medicare's administered pricing system can a lso (albe it gene rally inadvertently) ma ke some services extraordinarily lucra tive, and others unprofitable. The result of the pricing distortions is that some services are more or less available than they would be based on the demand for the services - which in turn triggers ada ptive re sponses by provider s.147 One panelist noted these difficulties are compounded by the fa ct that the balance of the population relies for its health care service s on an inf rastruc ture built in response to the excesses and inadequacies of Medicar e's admin istered p ricing system.148 Consider cardiac care. Commentators and panelists suggested that CMS never made a de liberate decision to provide for greater prof its for such services relative to the amounts paid for other inpatient services but the IPPS does so.149 Genera l hospitals use these profits to subsidize the provision of less profitable (or unprofitable) services, but the pricing distortion create s a direc t economi c incentive for SSHs to enter the ma rket. In response , gene ral hospi tals compl ain to legislators and try to find ways to limit the expansion of competition. Absent the distortions created by the excess profits for cardiac services in Medicare 's administered pricing sy stem, the incentive for SSH entry would be less.

F or example , CMS has onl y limited au thority to contra ct selec tively with provider s or to use competiti ve bidding to meet its ne eds.152 With limited e xceptions, CMS cannot force providers to compete for CMS's busine ss or enc ourag e supplie rs to reduce their co sts and en hance th eir qual ity by rewardin g them w ith substan tially increased volume or substantially higherpayments if they do.153 Even straightforward purchasing initiatives, such as competitive bidding for durable medical equipment (DME), have generated considerable r esistance. A pilot proje ct res ulted in Med icare s avings between 17 and 22 percent with no significant adverse effec ts on benefic iaries.154 Opponents of competitive bidding have argued, howeve r, that the bidding process increased bureaucracy, decreased consumer choice, thre atened the existence of small manufacturers, and lowered quality.155 At least one industry representative has called for the re peal of the provisions mandating competitive bidding.156 150 Pauly 2/26 at 93-94 (noting that \" [i]f t he regulated price is too high, you' ll get excessive socia lly inefficient qu ality.

Payors se ek to balance the price of the hospit al servic es they must purc hase to offer insurance coverag e against the desirability of the re sulting network to the purchasers of their insurance products. If patients v iew seve ral hospi tals as ad equate substitutes for one another, it will be easier for the pay or to threaten credibly to exclude one or more of these hospitals.

Multi-hosp ital sy stems fre quently seek to ensure that all sy stem hospitals are included in a payor network.

Consumers who have co-pay ments that vary dependin g on whe re they receiv e care will still focu s on the am ount of the co-pay ment, and not on the total price of the services they receiv e. Even i f consume rs are in tereste d in knowing the total price of the care they receiv e, they would find it extreme ly difficult to obtain that information, and are likely to find it to be complicated and obscure.198 Proposals to increase consumerprice sensitivity must confront this reality, and develop strategies to increase the transparency of hospital pricing. To be sure, these difficulties do not apply to pay ors, who deal with multiple pr oviders i n multiple geog raphic a nd produc t markets , and use pricing information to make contracting decisions. XII. HOSPITAL PRICING: DISTINGUISHING AMONG BULK PURCHASING, PRICE DISCRIMI NATION, C OST SHIFTING , AND CRO SS SUBSIDIES Understanding hospital pricing require s an unde rstandin g of fou r terms: bulk purc hasing, price scrimina tion, cost shifting , and cro ss subsidie s. The ter ms have dist inct mean ings, al though th ere is some overlap between cost shifting and cross subsidies. Bulk purchasing usually occurs when large organ izations ( e.g., insurance companie s) rece ive purc hasing d iscounts because of the volume of their purchases. 196 Of course, consumers will also want inform ation a bout the qua lity of the serv ices they w ill receiv e at both hospit als. The avail abili ty of such information i s addressed in supra Chapte r 1. 197 Herb ert Sim on, A Behavior al Model of Rational Choice , in MODELS OF MAN (1957). 198 See Frech 3/26 at 198 (\"[A] t ypical hospi tal will have at least tens, and maybe h undre ds of payors with dif ferent prices .

T he pr ice of he alth services are jeal ously guarded proprietary inform ation.\" ). 37This type of purcha sing can help reduce the cost of he alth car e becau se the bul k purchasing capability can be used to obtain a large discount. For example, insurance companies often secure better hospital care rates for their beneficiaries than uninsure d individual may obtain.199 There is nothing unusual about this behavior and it has a long history in commer cial pra ctice, in the cour ts, and in ec onomic an alysis. The conventional definition of price discrimin ation is dif ferent ratios of price ( P) to marginal cost (MC) for the same service across different buy ers. That is P/MC for consumer \"j\" is not equal to P/MC for consumer \"k\".200 For example, senior citizens ma y pay less to watc h the same movie at the same time as other adults. Like bulk purc hasing, price di scrimina tion has a long history in commerc ial practice, in the courts, a nd in econ omic ana lysis.201 Cost shifting refers to raising the price charged to one g roup of consumers as a result of lowering the price to other consumers.

Elzinga-Ho garty Te st The Elzinga-Hogarty test was designe d to analy ze commodit y mo vements, not hospital mergers. It wa s proposed by two economists in an article critiquing the Agenc ies' ge ospital ases.31 In one case, th e gove rnment re lied on L IFO (\"little in from outside\") data to argue that an entire state was the relevant geog raphic market for beer products. In the se cond case, the government relied on L OFI (\"little out from inside\") data to argue that the rele vant geographic marke t for commercial bankingwas limited four-county area.32 Kenneth Elzinga a nd Thomas Hogar ty argued that a proper geographic market analy sis required the use of both LI FO and LOFI statistics, but observe d that the ir analy sis was not readily applicable to heterogenous goods or differe ntiated p roducts.33 Hospitals generally \"Elzinga -Hoga rty test\" has been used extensively in hospital merger cases. The movement of a patient who resides within the provisional geographic marke t to a facility outside of that area for hospital services is considered an importation of hospital services into that provisional geographic marke t, measured as LIFO. The movement of a patient who resides outside of the provi sional g eogra phic market to a facility inside the provisional geog raphic m arket f or hospita l service s is considered an exporting of hospital services outside of the provisional geographical the analysi s be dynamic.

A geog raphic m arket de finition is usually described as \"strong\" if less than 10 per cent of discharged patients from the merg ing hospitals' area come into or out of the area. If more than 10 perc ent (but less than 25 percent) of patients migrate in or out of the hospitals' core geographic area for in-patient services, the market definition is considered \"weak.\"37 Panelists identified a number of weaknesses with the use of the Elzinga- Hogarty test to define a geographic market for hospi tal servi ces.38 One panelist pointed out that the Elzinga-Hogarty test takes a leap in logic from a current level of patient migrati on to the c onclusion that patie nts would respond to a small price increase by using hospitals outside of the merging hospitals' core geographic area - a leap not justified by e ither ec onomic an alysis or pas t experience.39 Patients decide whether or not to trave l for hea lth care service s for a va riety of reasons, including perceived and a ctual variations in quality, insurance coverage, out-of-pocket cost, sophistication of service s, and fa mily connec tions.40 Although patient flow data may show that patients go to hospitals beyond the core zip code area, this does not mean that their behavior reflects price sensitivity , or that other consumers would travel if prices increased.41 Stated differently, pa tient flow data can show existing hospitalization patterns, but offer no insight into what patients will do in response to a price 35 See Gregory V istnes, Hospitals, Merg ers, and Two-Stage Competit ion, 67 689 er & Silvia, supra 18, at 192- 93. 36 See Vistne s, supra note 35, at 689; Elzin ga & The , at 72-7 6; Elz inga & Hogarty, The Problem Revisit ed, supra note 23, at 2-3. 37 See Elzing a & H ogarty, The Problem , supra note 2 3, at 73 -75; E lzinga & Hogarty, The Problem Revisit ed, supra note 2 3, at 2.

Another panelist d escribe d this phenomenon as the \"silent majority f allacy.\" The E-H [Elzinga-Hogarty ] approach draws a conclusion about the entire market f rom the be havior of those consumers who express displeasure with their local sellers by tra veling elsewhere. This is a valid logical leap when travelers and non-travele rs have similar demands and related market experiences. However, if the two groups differ on dimensions other than location, then E-H gives rise to what we call the \"silent majority fallacy .\" That is , if travelers and non-travelers display fundamentally diffe rent demand behavior, either because they differ in their taste for travel or their need for local/non-local services, then there is n o necess ary relation ship between the market experiences of these two groups post-merger. If travelers differ significantly from non-travelers, then the presence of a minority of trave lers doe s not imply that local firms lack market power vis-a-v is the majority of consumer s who are non-tra velers.42 The silen t majority fallacy is a particular problem with hospital merger analysis, beca use the goods and services are not fung ible commo dities, bu t are \"h ighly differentiated and other dimensions.\"43 Empirica l evidenc e confir ms that \"the majority of patie nts are tr uly reluctant to travel and do not view distant hospitals a s close su bstitutes f or most services, even though a sizable perce ntage of their ne ighbors may travel f or care . Those who do travel have distinct reasons for doing so and the fact that they travel would not inhibit merging local hospitals from increasing prices substantially .\"44 One pane list also no ted that in some circumst ances, t he Elzing a-Hog arty test cannot be satisfied. If the initial specification of the geogr aphic market does not meet the required threshold for L IFO and LOFI , expanding the geographic ma rket may not satisfy the require d threshold either. The result is that the geographic marke t expands without limi t.45 This probl em alone casts 42 CORY CAPPS ET AL., THE SILENT MAJORI TY FALL ACY OF THE ELZINGA -HOGARTY CRITERIA: A CRITIQUE AN D NEW APPROACH TO ANALYZI NG HOSPITAL MERGERS 1 (Nat' l Bure au earch , Workin g Paper No. w8216, 2001) [hereinaft er C APPS ET AL., SILENT MAJORI TY].

This same panelist suggested that the Elzinga- Hogar ty test systematic ally leads to expansive geog raphic m arkets w hen zip codes ar e selec ted base d on the ab solute number of patients t hat come from a zip code.46 There is tremend ous varia bility in the number of individuals that live in a particular zip code. A hospital may have a small shar e of tota l admission s from a particu lar zip cod e, even though it gets a significant number of patient admissions from that zip code - and the Elzinga- Hogar ty test, as use d in hospita l merge rs, will include such distant zip codes in the market. Accord ing to thi s panelis t, \"a zip code that has 20,000 people, that's 40 miles away , might g et includ ed if the hospital g ets 50 patien ts from the re, whe reas te n zip codes that are closer that only have a thousand p eople ea ch, migh t send 40 get excluded.\"47 He sugge sted that s uch larg e and dist ant zip codes are particularly likely to be cities that have hospitals in them, which skews the results of the anal ysis from the outset.48 2. Critica l Loss Analys is Critical loss analysis has the potentia l to provid e a usef ul way toimplement the hy pothetic al monopol ist test, but it must be applied with great care.49 Problems w ith its appl ication h ave led s ome commentators to question the value of critica l loss ana lysis as an a ntitrust to ol.50 Conventio nal criti cal loss a nalysis posits a particular price increase and a sks what proportion of the hypothe tical monopolist' s sales wo uld have t o be lost to yield a net dec rease in the hy pothetical monopolist' s profits.51 When criti cal loss analysis is used to delineate a relevant market, the first step is to calculate the percentage loss in sales that would make a given price increase unprof itable for a hypothetica l monopolist over a c andidate market. This calculation depends on the price increase posited and on the contribution margin ( i.e., price minus marginal cost, all divided by price) on the sales tha t would be lost.52 46 Frech 3/26 at 192 (\"[R]anki ng zip codes by the numb er of patients usually gives the largest market areas.\"). 47 Id. at 192 -93.

The f ormul a for the crit ical loss for an x% price increase is x/(x + m), where m is the margi n, expressed as a percentage price. For example, if the margin is 60 percent, the critical loss for a 5 perc ent price increas e is 5/(5 + 60) = .07 7, or 7 .7 pe rcent.11The second step is to estimate the likely actual lo ss in sales that would result from the hypothesized price increase, e.g., what per centag e of pati ents likel y would stop patronizing the hospitals in the candidate market in response to the price increase.53 The estimated actual loss is then compared to the calculated critical loss. If the estimated actual loss exceeds the critical loss, it is in ferred that the price in crease would be u nprofita ble and th e candid ate market is too small to be a mar ket.54 One panelist described misuses of the critical loss technique that practitioners should avoid.55 Notably, ty pical applications posit small (e.g., five percent) price increases. Yet, the Merger G uideline s' methodology for delineation of relevant markets asks whether the profit-maximizing price increase would be at least a small but signific ant amoun t (e.g., five percent). Even though a monopolist may find a f ive percent price increase unprofitable, it may find a larger price increa se profitable.56 This panelist presented an example based on the stylized facts of sever al hospital merger cases in which a f ive perc ent pric e incre ase would be unprofitable, but any price increase between 31 perce nt and 319 percent would be profitable, and the hy potheticalmonopolist would maximize its profits by increa sing pri ce 175 pe rcent.57 Thus, the candidate market was a market under the Merger G uideline s' hypothetica l monopolist test, even though a five percent pric e increase was unprofitable. This panelist discussed other problems that occ ur in some implementations of critical loss analysis. The standard formula presumes constant margin al cost a nd no avoi dable fi xed costs, but actual cost functions may dif fer significantly f rom this assumption. Also, the standard formula implicitly assumes proportionate increases in all prices, but the profit maximizing strategy for hospitals may involve highly disproportionate pr ice increa ses.58 This panelist also explained that critical loss calculations must focus on the margins for the patients that likely would be lost in the event of a price increase.59 Much of th e potenti al for a buse in critical loss analysis involves the sec ond step - est imation of the actu al loss.

For similar cr itiques, see Danger & Frec h, supra note 2 9; La ngen feld & Li, supra note 29. 12data to estimate the actual losses in sales that would result from a price increase. For example, some practitioners use patient flow data to identify zip codes that are \"contestable.\" These practitioners then argue tha t the share of patients in these zip codes that would stop patronizing certain hospitals in a candidate geogra phic market in response to a given price increase would be g reater than the critical loss, and that the geogra phic area must there fore be expanded in order to constitute a relev ant geo graph ic marke t.60 Data on e xisting tra vel patte rns for r esidents in a zip code, however, say nothing about why patients selec t specific hospitals or how a change in relative price s would affect patient migration.61 One cannot infer that just because some patients in a zip code curren tly choose mor e distant h ospitals, others a lso would c hoose suc h hospital s if the pric es of the mergin g hospita ls increased.62 Recent c ommentar y, some of it published after the Hearings, has stresse d a link between the first and second steps ofcritica l loss ana lysis.63 As a simple matter of arithmetic, the higher the contribution margin, the smaller the critical loss will be for a given price increa se. The higher the margin, the more it costs the hy pothetical monopolist to lose a sale, and so the smaller the sale s loss req uired to o ffset the profit gain fr om making the rema ining sa les at a higher price.64 Yet if fir ms are ma ximizing pro fits before the merger, hig h margins indicate that those firms face low price elasticities of demand.65 Otherwise, these firms could earn greater total profits by reducing prices and expanding sales. Moreover, a hy pothetical monopolist o ver any candida te marke t must face a lower elasticity of demand than the individua l firms in th at candi date mar ket, so high margins must imply a very low dema nd 60 Alternati vely, t hese zip 26 at 189- 61 See CAPPS ET AL., SILENT MAJORI TY, supra note 4 2; Ca pps et al., Antitr ust Poli cy, 189-90 (noting that predi cted actual loss i s an i mporta nt pa rt of how critical los s analysis is im plem ented , and a s typically imple men ted, critic al loss an alysis lead s to implausibly l arge geographic areas).63 Dan ger & Frec h, supra note 29 at 349- 51; Katz & hapiro, supra note 29, at 49-50, 52-53; Lang enfeld 307-08; rien & Wickelgr en, supra note 161-63. 64 See Katz & S hapiro, supra note 29, at 50; O'B ffman & Simo ns, supra note 2 9, at 4. 65 See Katz & S hapiro, supra note 29, at 50- 51; O 'Brie n & W ickelgr en, supra note 29, at 162; Danger & Frec h, supra note 29, at 349-51; Lang enfeld & L i, supra note 29, at 308-09, 323; Michae l Katz & C arl Sha piro, Further Thoughts on Critical Loss , 3 T HE ANTITRUST SOURCE , Wickelgr en, The State of Critical Loss Analysis: Reply t o Schef fman and Simons , 3 THE ANTITRUST note 2 9, at (disag reeing with critiqu es that atte mpt \"to infer, with great er specif icity, a v alue of AL [ actual loss] increm ental m argins a nd (to o le e conomic theory\").13elasticity for the c andidate market. Hospitals' experts commonly arg ue that merging hospitals' margins are high, which implies that the critical losses are low. They ar gue that post-merger price increases would be unp rofitable b ecause of the high per-unit foregone profits on lost sales. In essence, they argue that where the cr itical loss is low, the actual loss will exceed the critical loss. On this basis, they arg ue that relevant geogra phic markets for hospital mergers are broad.66 Yet, a s discusse d abov e, high margins also imply low dema nd elasticities. Low demand elasticities indicate that the merge d firm's a ctual loss es of sal es would be low. Because the actual losses may be less than the critical losses when margins are high, the releva nt geog raphic m arket ma y in fact be narrow.67 Other commentators also have describ ed way s in which c ritical lo ss analysis has been carried out incorrectly, both for delineation of markets and for competiti ve effe cts anal ysis.68 One arti cle cites four key problems in how courts have applied critical loss analy sis in recent hospital me rgers .69 First, courts have failed to consider whether a price increase g reater than five percen t would be profitab le.

Alternative Analytical Techniques One panelist proposed an alternative analytical fr amework built on the observation that hospitals compete in two stages .71 According to this panelist, the Agenci es typica lly focus on fir st-stage competiti on, in whic h hospital s compete to be included in the networks of health plans. At this poin t, health plans ar e the buy ers, and pric es may be constr ained if a health plan can credibly threaten to, or actually, exclude th e merg ing hosp itals fro m its provider network and diver t patients toalternative hospitals. The focus for defining the geographic marke t for this first stage of competition is on hospital locations, not patient lo cations.72 Once a hospital is in the plan's ne twork, or in some ca ses even if it is not, the hospitals then compete at the second stage - for the individual patient. This panelist suggested that defend ants t ypically focu s on s econd -stage competition for patients and argue for broader geogra phic markets based on patient flow data.73 This level of competition differs significantly from the first stage.74 A two-stage analy sis may result in differe nt geographic marke ts and different competiti ve effe cts for e ach stag e, beca use the two sta ges invo lve diffe rent cus tomers, different means of competition, and different 70 Lang enfeld & L i, supra note 29, at 332- 333.

In these circumstances, network inclusion provides no assura nce that patients w ill seek c are at a particu lar hospi tal.78 Another panelist submitted a joint statement proposing a different analy tical framew ork for a nalyzing ge ograp hic mark ets in hospitals. The statement asserts that because potential patients select manage d care or ganizat ions ( e.g., health i nsurers ) prior to knowing what their medical needs will be, th e subsequ ent ex-ante pricing makes the connection between patient flowsand pric ing powe r tenuous .79 For example, the statement suggests that \"100% of patients p lace a h igh valu e on havin g acc ess to a local hospital,\" but if they a re part of the 20 percent of the group that develop a serious me dical co ndition, th ese same patients may be willing to tra vel any distance to go to th e best hos pital for their condition.80 As an alternative, the statement proposes a formal demand analy sis model that would require data on patient and hospital characteristics in addition to the patient o rigin a nd destina tion data tradition ally used. Alth ough this model is more complex than patient flow analy sis, the statement contends it provides \"a measure of market p ower tha t, unlike p atient fl ows, is theoretically va lid for differentiated goods markets and is directly related to the prices that hospitals are able to charge.\"81 B.

The recommended sources include t ypes of evide nce ty pically assesse d in non-ho spital mer ger ca ses: strategic planning documents and testimony from the m erging parties a nd their competitors, and documents and testimony from major purchasers of services fr om the mergin g parti es - here , third-p arty payors. Panelists also suggested the use of evidence that casts direct light on the distances patients are willing to travel and the reasons they are willing to do so, and evidence that demonstrates the role, if any, physicians can pla y in defea ting a hospital's post-merger, anticompetitive price incre ases. Each of these categorie s of evidence are considered below. 1. Hospital Str ategic P lanning Documents The Agencies ty pically examine strategic planning documents from the mergin g parti es and the ir compe titors to assess relevant market and other key issues in merger analy sis. Panelists suggested using strategic planning documents fr om the hospitals to help establish the proper geog raphic m arket.82 Such documents may specify the g eographic regions in which a hospital is marketing its services and the hospitals it sees as its primary competition.83 In addition, a hospital's strategic planning documents frequently disclose the hospital manage ment's as sessment o f the exten t to which the proposed merger will increa se the hospital' s negoti ating po wer and its ability to raise prices. Hospital strategic planning documents can illuminate hospital competition for both inclusion in payor networks and for individual patients. 2. Payor T estim ony For non-hospital mergers, the Agencies regular ly obtain the views of the mergin g firms' major cu stomers to assess issues such as relevant market definition and competitive effects. These market participants typically have the most price negotiation experience with the merging firms, as well as the most to lose from price increa ses (or q uality or other degra dations) if the proposed merger were to create market power. On the other hand, major customers also have much to gain from reduced pr ices if the pro posed mer ger wo uld likely create efficie ncies tha t would be passed on to customers. Courts, however, have been skeptical about tes timony from thir d-party payors in hospital these payors routin ely negotia te with hos pitals about price and other aspects of hospital care. In Tenet, for examp le, the Ei ghth Circuit questioned the district court's relianc e on pay or testimo ny that they \"would unhesitatingly ac cept a price increase ra ther than stee r their su bscribe rs to hospi tals\" outside of the core geogr aphic area.84 83 See, e .g., Guer in-Calve rt 3/26 at 141 (stating that documents s how who the h ospita ls see as their co mpe titors and strategic p lans of h ospitals competi supra note 20, at 12.84 FTC v.

Second, panelists suggested that payor testimo ny also would b e helpfu l in determining whether pay ors can steer patients to a lower-cost hospital if pricesincrease post-merger.88 Several panelists noted tha t pay ors used t o creat e marke table plans with limited provider networks and thus could exclude a hospital if its prices were not acceptable to the plan.89 Today, many consumers de mand choice and open provider network s.90 Therefore, pay ors frequently r ely on mecha nisms other than excluding hospitals to divert marginal 85 Tene t Health C are, 186 F. 3d at 1054 & n.14 .

One panelist noted that if payors a ctually can steer patients to (or away ) from particular institution s, the dista nces tra veled to hospitals s hould hav e grow n in para llel with the rise of managed care .94 In fact, the panelist noted, the distances patients travel to hospitals have not changed very much since the mid-1980s , and ther e is little distinction between the distances traveledfor HMO v ersus non -HMO pat ients.95 Based this evid ence, th e paneli st maintaine d that cou rts should not assume that pay ors can e ffectiv ely steer pa tients in response to price increa ses.96 Another panelist suggested that patient flow data may help show whether and, if so , how pay ors can s teer pa tients.97 This panelist asserted that pay ors have had enough success in moving marg inal consumer s to lower -cost hos pitals tha t, in most cases, they ca n discipline hospital price increa ses.98 She also concluded that in many cases, even if pay ors testify acc urately that they must have the merg ing par ties in the ir network s, that is no t necess arily sufficie nt to give the hospitals unilateral power over 91 Guerin-Calvert 3/26 at 134, 141 (referring to cases where payor s were abl e to move margi nal patien payo rs cou ld use to divert p atients: dropping a hospital from the network; adding hospit als to the net work to \" dilut e\" the pat ient base; creating panel) supra note 20, at 8; Harr is 3/26 at 180 (stating p ayors u se vario us me chan isms to sh ift patient choices, including dif ferent copays and deductibles, ti ered plans, and cafeteri a plans). 92 See supr a Chapte r 3. 93 See, e 3/2 6 at 1 86-8 8. 95 Id.

A pay or must consider the cost of providing a lower c opay ment to all patients, not just the margin al patien ts the pay or is trying to stee r.101 Moreove r, other hospitals may have hig her prices than the merged hospitals, even ass uming pr ice incr eases a s a result of the merger.1023. Patien ts' Willing ness to Tr avel - How Far and Why? Several panelists suggested that courts should give more weight to empirical studies of patients' willingn ess to tra vel to receive health care. Studies indicate that most patie nts pref er to be h ospitalize d close to their ho mes.103 Some patients appear willing to travel long distances for very serious or complicated procedures, but many patients p refer to rece ive such c are in th eir local hospital, even if their local hospital has higher mortality rates and less experience with such p rocedur es.104 Some patients are willing t o recei ve care in a distan t city because they work or have family in that city, or beca use of the hospital's religious affiliation.105 Several panelists noted that such migration patterns are unlikely to be price sensitive, yet the applica tion of the Elzinga- Hogar ty test and cr itical los s analy sis would result in a large geog raphic market in such circumstances, if enough patients travele d99 See Guerin-Calvert 3/26 at 141-43 (noting that it is rare to find a co mpe lling coo rdina ted-effec ts story in hospital markets and t hat the Chattanooga case is the one exc eption wher e the cour t accepte d a coordinated effects t heory of harm, referr ing to the Seventh Circuit opini on in Hospital Corp. of America v.

Physicia ns' Willingne ss and Ability to Steer P atients t o Less Expensive Alternatives Several hearing particip ants suggested that pay ors may be a ble to provide financial incentives to phy sicians to steer patients t o less expe nsive hosp itals.107 Some of the proposals included requiring physicians to ag ree to a financial risk- sharing contrac t, threa tening p hysicians wi th exclusion from a plan's network, imposing financi al penal ties on phy sicians w ho admit patients to the higher-priced hospitals, and providing bonuses to physicians w ho admit to lower- priced h ospitals.108 Even though such incentives are theoretically possible, it does not follow that payors would find them usef ul or desirable.109 Inde ed, such incentiv es could make a plan less marketable to employ ers and consumers who value open networks and unrestricted access to health car e. Such incentiv es also c ould inter fere wi care , partic if patien ts must use a different phy sician when they a rediverte d to a diff erent ho spital.110 These incentiv es also a re unlike ly to be effe ctive if they require patients to travel long distances and physicians to trave l those same distances to provide care. C. Summary The definition of a relevant geographic marke t has proven to be one of the most daunting components of a hospital merger case. Nonethele ss, some guiding principles are clear. The hy pothetical monopolist test of the Merger Guidelines should be u sed to def ine geo graph ic marke ts in hospital merger cases. The ty pes of evidence used in all merger cases - such as strategic planning documents of the merg ing parties and customer testimony a nd document s - should a lso be use d to delinea te relev ant geo graph ic marke ts in hospital merger cases. The Ag encies believe that cour ts have g iven eight to payor testimo ny and docume nts in particular. Empirical evidence is desirable on certain issues, su ch as the extent of p atients' willingn ess to tra vel to dista nt hospita ls in response to a small, but significant and non- transitory incre ase in price. Patient willingness to travel for non-price related reasons does not pr ovide a su fficien t basis to infer patient willingness to travel to distant hospitals in response to price increases. The Agencies encourag e further106 See, e .g., CAPPS ET AL., SILENT MAJORI TY, supra note 4 2; Ca pps et Vis tnes 3/26 108 See, e .g., Vis tnes 3/26 at 153-57. 109 See, e .g., id.110 Id. at 153-54, 156-58 (suggesting look ing at wh ether the re are over lapp ing ho spitals where physicians have or could l ikely have admitt ing privileges or deter mining how far physi cians are willi ng to travel t o perform daily rounds at the hospitals i n which they have pati ents admitted).21resear ch pa tients will travel to distant ho spitals in response to price increases. Empirical evidenc e also is d esirable on the exte nt to which phy sicians c an and wi ll steer p atients to lower-cost hospitals in response to price increases. To be persuasive, direct e vidence should show that such steering by physicians is feasible, cost-effective, and likely.111 The Agencies also encourag e additional research to validate or refute the alternative analy tical techniques discussed supra. To date, and for the reasons discussed supra, the Agencies' experience and research indicate that the Elzinga- Hogar ty test is not val id or reli able in defining geogra phic markets in hospital merge r cases . In a ddition, if critica l loss analysis is used, it must be used with gre at care to avoid the problems of application discussed in this section. The use of the Elzinga-Hogarty test and the misapplication of critic al loss an alysis has led some cour ts to find hospital geographic markets that ar e improbably larg e. III. PRODUC T MARKET DEFINIT ION The Merger G uideline s provide the framework for defining the re levant product market for hospital services. The product market has typica lly been define d as a broad group of medical and surgica l diagnostic and treatment services for acute medica l condition s where the patie nt must rem ain in a health care facility for at least 24 hours forrecovery or observation.112 Over the past twenty years, ma ny hospital merger cases have conside red and rejected outpatient services as part of the relevant product market for hospitals. For example, in In re Hospital Corp. of America , 106 F.T.C. 361 (1985), the Commission noted that, although outpatient care for certain services might be a separ ate relevant market or markets, the evidence demonstr ated \"th at the co re and va st majority of an ac ute car e hospita l's busine ss is acute inpatient care\" and non-hospital nt provide rs could n ot defea t post- merger anticompetitive behavior aff ecting hospital in patients.113 The Seventh Circuit agreed, observin g that \" althoug h hospital s increasingly are providing services on an out-patient basis ... most hospital services cannot be provided by nonhospital providers; as to these, hospitals have no competition from other providers of medical services.\"114 Similarly, in American Medical 111 Som e steerin g mec hanism s cou ld implicate f ian self-refe rral laws . See supr a Chapter 1 . 112 In American Medi cal I nternational , Inc. and Hospital Corp. of America , the FTC defined the releva nt pro duct mark et as a gr oup of gen eral ac ute care h ospital service s.

In that case, the Commission noted that alt hough \"the types of surgical proc edures whi ch can be handl ed on an ou tpatien t basis b y surgice nters ar e incre asing, this suggest s only that the cl uster of in patien t ser vices offer ed by acut e care hospi tals is ch anging and does not in dicate hospit als ar e becoming head- to-hea d competit ors wit h such out patien t provi ders.\" Id. 114 Hosp. Cor p. Am. , 807 F.2d at 13 88. Similar ly, in Unite d Stat es v. Rockfor d Memorial Corp. , 898 F.2d 12 78, 1284 (7th Cir. 1990), the22International , 104 F.T.C. 1 (1984), the Commission excluded outpatient services from the p roduct ma rket.115 The Elev enth Circuit also accepted inpatient acute-care service s as the r elevant product m arket in University Health.116 Only one court ha s included outpatient providers within the product m arket f or inpatie nt servic es.117 Panelists agreed that providers of outpatie nt servic es, such a s phy sicians' offices, urgent care c enters, and ambulatory surgery centers, should generally not be included in the product market definition for hospital se rvices.118 Panelists indicated that from the p erspec tive of pa yors and pati ents, inpatient services are complementary and bundled.119 Even if hospital prices areincreased, patients and pay ors cannot separate nursing care, dia gnostic tests, and room and b oard fr om the othe r treatm ents provided as part o f a hospit al stay and out- source t hem.120 Similarly, demand-side substitution is improbable; a cancer or heart attack p atient is n ot going to substitut e obstetrical care if prices for ca ncer care or heart attacks increase. Be cause outpatient treatment is generally not a substitute for inpatient care, there was ag reement among the panelists that outpatient providers are (and were) correctly excluded from the product m arket.121 Seventh Ci rcuit again a ffirmed the product market definition a s the \"pr ovision of inpa tient services by acute-care hospital s,\" noting t hat other providers cannot co mpete for m any acute-care ho spital services.

Patient flow data can be separately analyzed for each category.126 Panelists recognized, however, that pay ors gener ally do not disa ggregate se rvices th is finely.127 Conclusion . The Agencies continue to believe that inpatient acute-care servic es constitute a relevant product market. At the same time , the per centag e of tota l healthcare sp ending devoted t o outpatie nt care is growin g, and t he perc entage devoted t o inpatient care is declining. Over time, the level of payment and ch anges i n tech nology may shift the provision of many inpatient servi ces in to the outp atien t sett ing.128 The Agencies will continue to examine whether services provided in outpatient settings may constitute additional relevant product markets, and if so, whether those services might be adversely affected by a hospital merge r. The Ag encies w ill also co ntinue to examine the competitive significance of specialty hospitals, including whe ther and under what circumstances pay ors might discipline prices for cardiac or other ser vices at gener al acut e care ho spitals by shi fting a large r perce ntage o f patien ts to spec ialty hospitals t hat provi de such se rvices. Althoug h the Ag encies c urrently doubt the advisability and prac ticability of conducting separate product marke t analyses for many discrete markets - particu larly when payor s do not define the product they are purchasing in this fashion - the Age ncies will continue to examine whether smaller product markets exist in addition to the traditional product market definition. For example, if more specialized medical procedures raise more competitive conce rns than primary c are services, there may be some circumstances in which the product market sh ould be de fined na rrowly to include only a spec ific service or limited number of service s. Similarl y, it is possible that exper tise in one or more s pecific special ities may make a ho spital a \" must have\" hospital for a pay or's network, which could justify a separ ate product market125 Sacher 3/ 26 at 80-83; Sach er & 18, at 98; at a s ystem hospit al rge d iagno sis.

ENTRY The Merger G uideline s provide that entry should be c onsidere d if it is like ly to occur within two yea rs and to be sufficient to deter or counte ract an ticompeti tive eff ects of a proposed hospital merger.130 Entry into the inpatient general acute ca re hospital services market by constructing a new hospital or adding additional beds to an existing f acility is likely to exceed this time- frame. If th e state r equires that a Cer tificate of Need (CON) be grant ed befo re bui lding a new hospital or increasing bed capa city, the approval of the CON can take any where from 18 mo nths to sev eral y ears.131 Complianc e with othe r regu lations wi ll require additional time. Thus, the likelihood of timely and sufficie nt entry into the inpatient general acute car e hospital services market is remote. V. EFFIC IENCIES The Merger G uideline s make clear that efficiencies should be evaluated befor e determin ing whe ther a pr oposed me rger i slikely to be pro- or a nti-competitive.132 Under the Merger Guidelines , the Agencies will not ch alleng e a merg er if co gnizable efficiencies are of a cha racter and magnitude such that the merger is not likely to be anticomp etitive in any releva nt marke t.133 Efficiencies are cognizable when they are (1) merger-specific, ( 2) have been verified, and (3) do not arise from anticompetitive reductions in output or service.134 Hospitals often cl aim that th eir merge r will pro duce sig nifican t effici encies, and some courts have given significa nt weight to these arguments. Claimed efficiencies have included avoidance of capital e xpenditure s, reduc tions in manage ment and o peratio nal suppor t jobs, consolidation of specific services to one location ( e.g., all car diac ca re at Hos pital A and all cancer treatments at Hospital B), a nd reducing operational costs, such as purchasing and accounting. Some hospitals claim that after the merger they will be able to provide better and more complex services to their patients. For example, in Tenet the merg ing hosp itals claimed they would re alize significant efficiencies, including: eliminating unused 129 But see United States v. Long Isl and Jewi sh Med. Ct r., 983 F.

GPO members include hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and other health care sy stems. Some Hearing participants and industry c ommentators assert th at GPOs, a cting a s their me mbers' buying c ooperatives, can be tremendous engines of efficiency , allowing medical buyers to poo l their pur chasing power to lower health care costs. Nonetheless, others assert that certain GPO contr acting practic es may raise compe titive con cerns r elate d to t ying, bundling , and exclu sive dea ling. Th e Senate Judiciary Committee, through eff orts by Chairman Mike DeWine and Ranking Member H erb Kohl of the An titrust, Competition Policy and Consum er Righ ts Subcommittee, and the U.S. General Accounting Office have e xamined this issue in depth,180 and the issue was an importanttopic in the Hearings and the Commission's Health Care Workshop.181 In the sections that follow, we explain wha t a GPO is, d escribe its role a s a purchasing intermediary , and provide an overview of the GPO industry structure. This section then discusses the various organ izational s tructure s GPOs may adopt, the potential incentives created by each, and the various contracting practices use d by either G POs or the ir supplie rs and the ir potential impact on competition. Finally, this section addre sses concerns expressed during the Hear ings and elsewhe re that Health Care Statement 7, which governs GPOs, impedes the Agencies' ability to challenge GPO practices when, and if, they are anticompetitive. For the reasons discussed below, the Agencie s believe these co ncerns a re mispla ced, an d it is not necessary to revise Health Car e Statement 7.182 This statement does not provide a safety zone for the specific ty pes of conduct that some commentators have criticized, including tying , bundling, or exclusive dealing. In such situations, the Agencies would analy ze the conduct on a case-b y-case ba sis to dete rmine whe ther it may violate th e antitru st laws.180 See, e .g., Hospital Group Purchasing: Has the M arket Becom e More O pen to Com petiti on?: Hearing Befo re the S ubcomm. o n Antitrust, Competit ion Pol icy and Consumer Ri ghts of the S.

What is a GPO? GPOs are entities t hat agg regat e health c are pro viders' purchas ing volum e and contr acting function tiate discounts with manuf acture rs, distri butors, and other vendors of medical products and service s.183 According to the Health I ndustry Group Purchasing Association (HI GPA), 96 percent of all acute care hospitals in the United States use the services of a GPO, and on average, hospitals use at least two GPOs.184 More than 70 percent of hospital purchases are made through a contractnegotiated by a GPO.185 GPOs neg otiate co ntracts w ith manufacturers of products that fall into two general categ ories - commodities and medical d evices.186 Cotton ball s, banda ges, and linens are examples of commodities for which hospital clinical staffs generally do not have strong preference s about the manufacturer. High technolog y medical devices such as pacemakers and stents ar e examples of medical devices for which hospital clinicians may have a preference as to the manufacturer.187 GPOs are not wholesalers or distributors, and they do not take possession of, or title to, the products for which they negotia te contr acts.188 Vendors of medical supplies and services generally submit bids to a GPO in response to a \"Request For183 See Health Industry Group Purchasing Ass'n (H IGPA), Group P urcha sing O rgan izations 6 (Public Comment) (submit ted by Robert Betz) [hereinaft er HIGP A (public cmt)]; HERBERT HOVE NKA MP, COMPETITI VE EFFECTS O F GROUP PURCHASI NG ORGAN IZATIONS'(GPO) PURCHA SING AND PRODUCT SELECT ION PRACTICES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUST RY 1 (2002) ( prepar ed ).

GPO Industry Overview The Hospital Bureau of New York, established in 1910, is the first known hospital GPO.194 According to HI GPA, \"[f]rom 1974 to 1999, the number of GPOs grew forty to 633 . . . [a nd] it is estimated that approximately 200 GPOs contract directly with suppliers, and that twenty-six of these operate on a national level.\"195 One commentator asserted that \"when ma rkets in th is industry are pro perly defin ed, no GPO ha s a mar ket sh are as h igh as 20%. Further, there are ma ny GPOs, and hospitals can and do join multiple GPOs or switch memberships.\"196 In contrast, the GAO's pilot study focused on seven national GPOs, ea ch with purchasing volume of more than $1 billion. The GAO stated that the seven GPOs collectively ac counted for purchases totaling approximately $43 billion, or \"more than 85% of all hospital purchases nationwide 189 GA O Senate Testimon y, Pilot Study , supra note 1 80, a t 7; B loch (s tmt), supra note 184, at 8. 190 Blo ch (stm t), supra note 184, at 7-8. 191 GA O Senate Testimon y, Pilot Study , supra note 180, at 7. 192 Blo ch (stm t), supra note 1 84, a t 8.

Similarly, the se cond largest GPO's market share g oes from 12 percent of all purchases to 25 perce nt of purchases made through a GPO.200 C. Structure and Incentives The GAO report explained that \"GPOs differ in their corporate structures and their relationships with member hospitals.\"201 Member h ospitals ow n some GPOs; in other cases, shareholders that are independent of the member hospitals ownthe GPO.202 In some instances, suppliers finance GPOs by paying administrative fees that often are calculated as a per centage of each member's purchases of ea ch supplier's products .203 These fe es are d esigne d to \"cover [a] GPO's operating expenses and serve[] as its main source of revenue.\"204 GPOs may distribute surplus f ees to the ir member h ospitals a s well.205 GPOs may be for-profit or nonprofit organizations. Becau se of the se diffe ring str uctures , some panelists and commentators question the extent t o which GP Os act as the age nts of their buyer -members, or as the agents of the sellers that pay the GPOs' administrative fees.

For e xample, one panelist stated that \"very few GPO contracts today are, in fact, exclusive,\" and unlike true exclusive dealing contracts, sole source contracts allow hospitals the freedom to buyfrom othe rs.224 Another commentator noted that GPO loyalty rebate programs allow buyers to purcha se from rivals offering lower pr ices.225 Other panelists noted that many long-te rm contra cts are qualifie d in that \"almost all GPO contracts can be terminated on 60- to 90-day s notice.\"226 Some pane lists arg ued that, even if the GPOs were doing what their critics alleged, these contracting practices can actually incre ase, not decrease, consumer welfare.227 For example, one source reported that GPOs use the challenged contracting practices \"as inc entives for 223 FTC STAFF REPORT , ENTERING THE 21ST CENTURY : COMPET ITION POLICY IN THE WORL D OF B2B ELECT RONIC MARKETPLACES \u00a7 3, at 26 (2000) (citati ons omitted) at www. ftc.gov /os/2000/10/ b2brepo rt.pdf.

F or example , GPOs ac ting on th eir members' behalf may strive to achieve efficie ncies fo r the memb ers.242 Thus, some noted that when the challenged contrac ting practices are arrang ed not by one rival manufacturer seeking to fore close others, but by \"a buy er or its agent\" - i.e., the buyers or their GPO - \"in order to get lower prices from the manufacture[r],\" the practices are likely to be pro-compe titive.243 One pane list sugg ested this circumstance distinguishes the challenge d practices from ty pical tying a nd bundling cases.244 Indeed, another pa nelist believed that a GPO's refusal to carry a given turer's product reflec ts buyers' ske pticism about the manufacturer's claims about its product, not any competitive injury.245 By contr ast, some commentators suggest that if suppliers control a GPO, theorgan ization may lack the incentiv e to promote e fficien cies for its member s. Some panelists suggested that such GPOs may have an incentive to collude with suppliers aiming to injure ri val suppli ers in a b id to acquire market power over the mar ket for providing goods and services to the buyers.246 Under this theory, the G POs agree to raise barriers against rival suppliers throu gh cont ract t erms i mpos ing tying, bundling , or exclus ive deal ing arr angeme nts on the buy ers.247 These te rms seek to \"exclude rival manufacturers from competing for hospital sales even when the rival products are better or cheape r.\"248 242 See, e .g., Clamp-Al l Corp. v.

For example, member h ospitals ma y be contrac tually bound to purchase certain supplies through a given GPO; the efficiencies that GPOs afford may outweigh their anticompetitive costs; member hospitals may enjoy \"side- payments or spec ial discounts\" that give them private incentives to stay; a race-to- the-botto m effec t may persuad e a hospit al to maintain i ts specia l GPO disco unt so that it does not suffer vis-a-v is its rivals; or agency problems that reward hospital administrators for winni ng shor t-term pr ice cuts regar dless of long- term har ms may prevent hospitals from taki ng acti on aga counter that GPOs are unlikely to collude with suppliers in this way for long, because buy ers unhappy w ith the anticompetitive results can alway s leave the GPO for other means of purchasing supplies.252 One panelist noted that GPOs must compete for hospitals' business and that hospitals \"are free to select GPOs that best represent their interests.\"253 E.

Statement 7 and its safety zone thresholds aim to address monopsony and oligopoly conc erns with the formation of a GPO.255 This statement reflects concerns that a pa rticular GPO could (1) cre ate monopsony power, i njuring competiti on in the supplier market or (2) facilitate collusion in the sale of hospita l product s or serv ices, injuring competition in the downstream market. Statement 7 does not a ddress a ll potential issues that GPOs may raise. F or example, it is silent on alleged exclusive dealing, ty ing, and bundling concerns that many pan elists discussed in the H earings. It is also silent on other potential competitive concerns, such as price-fixing, market allocati on, merg ers, etc . No state ment islikely to cover eve ry issue that could ar ise. The Agencies believe amending the statemen t to addre ss some, bu t not all potential issues, is likely to be counter producti ve. For example, s ome might argue that because c ertain issues were discussed, Statement 7 implicitly endorses as legal w hatever conduct i s not spec ifically addressed. If a supplier coordinates with the buyers, or with GPOs that have turned on their buy ers, to e xclude riv al supplie rs, Statement 7 would not protect such conduct from antitrust challenge. In sum, Statement 7 governs Agency actions e xamining mo nopsony and olig opoly issues in connection with a GPO's formation. It does not preclude Ag ency action c halleng ing anti competiti ve condu ct - such as anticompetitive contracting practice s - that hap pens to oc cur in co nnection with GPOs. The Agencies will examine, on a case-by -case basis, the facts of any alleged anticomp etitive c ontract ing pra ctices to determine whether the practice violates the antitrust laws.

As appropriate, the Agencies will bring cases a gainst providers who collusively refuse to enter into such arrangements or provide such infor mation.

INTRODUCTION In 2002, the Census Burea u estimated that approximately 85 perce nt ofthe Unite d States' populatio n had hea lth insurance coverage.2 Most Americans under the age of 65 obtain health insurance through their emp loyer or a f amily membe r's em ployer. M any obtai n cove through a gove rnment pr ogram o r purcha se an individual insurance policy . Medicare covers most Americans aged 65 and ove r. Many individuals also purchase additional insuranc e to cove r Medica re co-p ayments and those health care goods and ser vices for which Medicare does not pay. Health insurance and other third party pay ment programs pay for a substantial majority of health ca re services. As Chapter 1 notes, in 2002, nat ional hea lth expenditures were approximately $1.6 trillion. Private health insurance paid for $549.6 bill ion (35 pe rcent) , other pr ivate funds paid for $77.5 billion (five percent), and public funds paid for $713.4 billion (46 percent).3 Consumer out-of-pocket expenses accoun ted for a n addition al $212.5 billion in private expenditures (14 percent).4 1 Complete lists of participants on these and other panel s are ava ilabl e infra App endix A an d BHANDARI , U.S. CENSUS BUREAU , HEAL TH INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES : 2002, at 1 (200 3), avail able at http://www .census.gov /prod/ 2003pubs /p60-223.pdf.

Coverage f or pharmac euticals is more va riable, but still fairly common.5 Hospitalization accounted for only 6.9 perc ent of consumers' out-of- pocket health-related expenses in 2002, while prescription drugs accounted for 22.9 percen t.6 Prescri ption drug s are pr ojected t for 32.5 percen t of consu mers' ou t- of-pocket health care expenses by 2013.7 Health in surance is subjec t to extensive federal and state laws and regulations. As noted previously, Americans obtain insurance coverag e from various s ources, including employ ment- based insurance, individual insurance, and Federal and State public sources, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These source s provide health care coverag e through several types of hea lth plans, including traditional indemnity (or fee -for-se rvice ( FFS)) p lans, as well as managed care plans, which include health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider or ganizations (PPOs), and point of service plans (POSs). This chapter first summarizes the state and federal laws and reg ulations that affec t the hea lth insura nce indus try. Next, this chapter describes employ ment-based, individua lly-purchas ed, and g overnme nt- funded health care coverag e, and considers the impact of public purchasing on the overall health care sy stem. This chapter then cons iders in mo re deta il the PPO. T his chapter also discusses some issuesconcerning the approximately 15 percent of the American population that is without health insurance at some point during the year. F inally, this chapter discusses consumer-driven health care initiatives and proposal s. III. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK The reg ulatory framew ork for h ealth insurance varies, depending on whe ther coverage is individually -purchased, employ ment-ba sed, or g overnme nt- sponsored. The applicable regulatory framew ork for e mploy ment-ba sed heal th insurance also may vary depe nding on wheth er the e mplo yer purcha ses co verage from a commercial insurer, self-insures the health plan, or uses a combination of approaches. A. McCarran-Ferguson Act The McCarran-Ferg uson Act was adopted in 1945 to resolve a dispute over the authority of state a nd feder al gove rnments to regulate the business of insurance.8 The McCarran-Ferguson Ac t clarified that the states had the authority to tax, license, and regulate insurance companies r egardless of 5 Id. at 80 e x.1. 6 Id. at 87 e x.5. 7 Id. 8 McCarran- Fergu son Act , 15 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1012-10 14 (194 5). The Act was a response to the Supreme Co urt's decision in United States v. South- Eastern U nderwriters A ss'n, 32 2 U.S. 53 3 (1944), in which the Sup reme Court held that insura nce is com merc e, and when transac ted ac ross state lines, is interstate commerce and s ubject t o federal law, including t he anti trust laws. This opinion r eversed the Supreme Court 's decis ion i n Paul v. Vi rginia, 75 U.S. 168 (18 69) and similar cases, i n which the Court had held insurance was not commerce within t he meaning of the Commerce Clau se and was acco rding ly not sub ject to fe dera l regulatio n. See South-Ea stern Un derwriters , 322 U.S. at 543- 45.3the insurance company 's state of incorpor ation, as well as th e author ity to allow insu rance c ompanies to rguson Act spec ifically reserved authority for Congress to enact laws superceding state insurance la ws and regulations, as long as the feder al law specifically r elates to the business of insurance.10 The McCarran-Ferg uson Act exempts the \"business of insurance\" from the antitrust laws to the extent the states regula te such bu siness.11 Every state ha s adopted a framework for reg ulating insurance.12 Section 3(b) of the McCarran- Ferguson Act provides that \"[n]othing contained in this chapter shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boy cott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of boy cott, coercion, or intimidation.\"13 Thus, the antitrust lawsgenerally apply to insurance company mergers, monopolization, and other conduct not constituting the \"business of insurance,\" as well as to the specific forms of anticompetitive conduct listed in the McCarra n-Ferg uson Act.14 Chapter 6 discusses antitrust enforcement in this area. B.

COBRA The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) provides for cont inuation o f group health coverage that would otherwise be terminated.23 Former employ ees and t heir dependents who lose coverage ma y temporarily continue the ir health coverage at group r ates if th ey are will ing to pa y up to 102 percent of those rates, and they qualify under the terms of t he statute . COBRA generally applies to group health plans maintained by employ ers with 20 or more employ ees in the prior y ear. I t applies t o plans in th e privat e sector and those sponsore d by state an d local g overnme nts.24 F. Mandated Be nefits State and federa l laws man date numerous health insurance benefits. Mandated benefits fall into three gener al categories: (1) provider mandates , which require health insurers to cover service s provided by ce rtain providers or categories of provid ers (e.g., any -willing provider laws, freedom of choice, and laws mandating coverage of service s provided by a sele ct group o f provide rs (e.g., massag e thera pists or naturopaths)); (2) coverage mandates , which require health insurers to cover particular classes of individual patients andcondition s (e.g., mental health parity) ; and (3) benefit mandates, which re quire he alth insurers to provide a specified minimum level of benefit s (e.g., 48 hour post-partum hospitaliza tion, dire ct acce ss to specialists).25 Some state s rarely mandate benefits, while other states do so routinely.26 Feder al law ma ndates a few ben efits.27 G. Federal Tax Code The tax code subsidizes employment-based he alth insurance. Employ er contr ibutions fo r employ ees' health in surance covera ge are deductib le to employ ers, but a re not co nsidere d taxable 23 The Consolidat ed Omnibus Budget Reconci liation Act (COBRA) of 1986, Pub.

See infra Chapte r 6.6income to employ ees.28 Thus, employees obtain he alth car e cover age thr ough the ir employ er with pr e-tax dolla rs, which results in a tax subsidy for employ ment-based health insurance of more than $100 billion per yea r.29 IV. EMPLOYM ENT-BASED le with employment-based insura nce fluctuated during the 1990s, but is currently stabilized at approximately 61 perce nt of the population.30 The significance ofemployment-based he alth insurance varies by industry . In s ome sect ors of the economy (e.g., construction, service industries, and retail), employment-ba sed health insurance is less common than in other sectors of the economy (e.g., finance and manufacturing).31 Employer size matters as well; the large r the fir m, the more likely it is that emplo yees will be offere d employ ment- based health insurance.32 Not all employees take adv antage of employ ment-ba sed heal th insuranc e, and so me employ ees obta in covera ge for themselve s, but not f or their benefic iaries.33 Although it is common parlance to speak of \"employ er contributions\" to the cost of health care covera ge, emp loyees ultima tely bear the se costs, in the form of lower salaries and fringe benefit s.34 28 Dav id A.

ERI SA preemption of state law varies, depending on the contractual relationship between the self- insured plan and the commercial insurer.42 Some emplo yers self- insure th eir health plan up to a certain amount and purchas e an insur ance po licy to cover costs that exceed that pre-determined, agr eed upon amount.43 This is ofte n called \"stop-lo ss\" coverage.44 For example, an employe r may choose to self-ins ure its em ployees' aggrega te health care expenditures up to a maximum of $1 million per year, and contract with a traditional insurance company to cover any health c are cos ts in excess of that $1 mill ion. ERI SA gene rally preempts state laws that apply to self-insured plans, including plans that purchase such stop loss insurance coverage.45 In AmericanMedical Security v.

This rule has an important anti-fraud rationale, but it creates difficulties when services are more efficie ntly deliver ed withou t this requirement. For example, a consultation between a rural gene ral practitioner and an urban specialist might be beneficial to the patient, but it is less likely to occur if the urban specialist cannot bill for his services unless the patient travels to his office.124 Several speakers noted that the Medicare prescription drug bene fit will be helpful to benefic iaries, b ecause it will help in the management of chronic illness, and fills an ob vious ga p in the be nefit package.125 Some expressed concern, however , about the risks for innovatio n if the Cente rs for Me dicare & Medic aid Service (CMS) start setting pharmaceutical prices.126 One speaker sugge sted that the federal government should refor m Medicare to look more like the Federal Employ ees Health Benefits Program (F EHBP), which would empower consumers and have positive spillover effects on the broader health c are mar ket.127 He and ot hers cla im such an approach would rely on \"consumer choice i n a sensib le way , with go od, solid federa l ht\" to pro tect con sumers.128 Another speaker agre ed that there were profound differences between F EHBP and Medicare because the g overnment relied on competition in FEHBP and on administratively designe d benefits and delivery ar rangements in Medicare, with the result that FEHBP beneficiaries have ha d catast rophi c and p rescri ption drug c overage for many y ears, while Medicare beneficia ries only rece ntly got both.129 Accord ing to thi s speaker, Medicare's leg islative and regula tory require ments make it extreme ly difficul t for CMS to a dapt the p rogra m to changes in health care de livery and standar ds.130 B.

THE UNINSUR ED Approximately 15 percent of the population, or 44 million Americans, were uninsured at some point during 2002.172 This section of the report describes the demographics of the uninsured, the impact of being uninsured, and the competitive implications of these facts. There is no lega l obliga tion to purchas e health insuranc e. Some individua ls can af ford to pu rchase health insurance, but voluntarily e lect to bear the risk of not doing so.173 For many others,health insurance is prohibitively e xpensive when weighed aga inst the cost of food, shelter, and basic necessi ties.174 The un insured cut across a large swath of the United States: some are y oung and healthy, some a re not; many ar e below the pover ty line and oth ers are reasona bly wealthy . Those mo st likely to lack he alth insurance are y oung adults (18 to 24 ye ars old), people with less education, and Hispanic s.175 In 2002, 23.5 percent of the uninsured were in households with annual incomes of less than $25,000; 8.2 percent were in households with annual incomes of $75,000 or more.176 The uninsured population is large, but fluid. A substantial majority of those c urrently uninsure d will not be unin sured a y om now; a172 M ILLS & BHANDARI , supra note 2 at 1, 4.

What Is the Impac t of Not Hav ing Insurance? Being uninsured has significant health and financial consequences. Numerous studies indicate that being uninsure d reduce s consumpt ion of hea lth care se rvices a nd produc ts.179 The uninsured are less likely to have a regular source of care, less likely to have had a recent physician visit, less likely to use preventive services, and more likely to delay seeking treatme nt.180 One study indicate s that thosewho are uninsured for a full y ear receive about hal f as much care in dollar te rms ($1,253) per person as the privately insured ($2,484).181 A wide va riety of adver se health c onseque nces ar e associ ated with being uninsured.182 177 Pamel a Far t & Battery-P owered Health In sura nce?

One study found that uninsured persons experiencing severe health problems had higher out-of-pocket spending ( $4,576 versus $1,912) and higher total medical spending ($42,166 versus $2 6,957) tha n did the insured.189 In many instances, the uninsured cannot pay f or the care they receive. The burden of providing this uncompensated care varies tremendously . Only 7.9 perce nt of the population is uninsured in Minnesota, while in Texas, almost 25 percent of the population is uninsured.190 Hospitals bear the larg est burde n, beca use they must asses s and stabilize all patients with an emergency medical c ondition, r egard less of a bility to pay.191 Yet, eve n in the sa me geog raphicarea, the burden of providing uncompen sated ca re vari es signi ficantly among h ospitals.192 These costs are \"absorbed by providers as free care, pa ssed on to the insured v ia cost sh ifting a nd highe r health premi ums, or pai d by taxp ayers thro ugh higher taxes to finance public hospitals and public insurance programs.\"193 One study estimate d that the uninsure d recei ved almos t $100 billion in care in 2001.

The Impact of Competition Our health care sy stem relies on hospitals, physicians, and clinics to provide uncompensated care to the uninsured. Competition may help addr ess some problems of the uninsured, for example, by lowering the price of insurance c overage and medical care.198 Competition also may worsen the problems of the uninsured, however, by decreasing the ability of provider s to cross -subsidize some prod ucts and services. Competition will not transfer resourc es to those who do not h ave them .199 Proposals to address these matters should be carefully evaluated to ensure that theconsequences of any reform are pro- competitive. IX. CONSUMER -DRIVEN HEALTH CARE Panelists discussed the disadvantages of the current health care sy stem, and the potential benefits of a more consumer-driven health care sy stem. For example, Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingric h spoke at the Hearings and observed that \" a third party payment mode l is inhere ntly conflic t- ridden because y ou have the person receiving the goods not responsible, the person [providing the] goods confused about who they're responsible to, and the person who is pay ing the m oney irritate d with both the provider and the patient.\"200 Speaker Gingrich stated that there are fou r driver s, to tran sforming the U.S. health care sy stem: the health care sy stem must emphasize patient safety and outc ome; embrace information technology (IT), computing, and communications; focus on quality and a culture of quality; and cente r on the individual consumer.201 When consumers have information and knowledge, they will be empower ed to make real choices about their care and take responsi bility for their choices .202 Other panelists agreed that we need a more194 Had ley & H olaha n, supra note 181, at 78. 195 Id. at 69 ex.2; IO M, supra note 1 74, a t 5 tbl.ES 1. 196 Had ley & H olaha n, supra note 181, at 70-7 1. 197 IOM , supra note 174, at 55-58. 198 See W illiam M .

Speaker Gingri ch noted that consumer are sy stem,203 and that there is considerable room for improvement in health care I T and consumer information.204 Two panelists suggested that the government could play a role in creating an IT infrastructure .205 Consumer-driven health care relies on consumers to make their own decisions regarding th e care they rece ive. Tax- advanta ged sa vings ac counts (H ealth Savings Accounts, Health Reimbursement Arrangements, and Flexible Spending Accounts) can be used to pay for out-of- pocket health care expenses with pre-tax dollars.206 Commentat ors and pa nelistsstated tha t when ind ividuals a re resp onsible for paying for their health care costs up to a certain amount, th ey are like ly to become more health conscious and more value conscious about the health care products and servi ces th ey are purch asing.207 Panelists generally supported greater development of consumer-driven health care and individual health savings accounts, but agre ed that 203 See Lans ky 6/1 2 at 7 0-72 ; Dav id La nsky, A person -cen tered view of co nsumer inform ation in the h care y 6/12 at 70- 89 (repor ting on findings f rom studies and surveys conducted by the Foundation for Accountability (FACC T)); Lansky Presentatio n, 110-11; Gingrich 6/12 at 51-52 (\"Everybody ought to ha ve an e lectronic heal th record.

Potential R esponses to the Dem and for M andated Benef INTRODUC TION In the health insurance industry, health insurers are both sellers of insurance to consumers and buye rs of medical services. As a result, mergers a nd other conduct i nvolving health in surers p otentiall y can rai se issues related to both mono poly and monopsony power. Chapte r 6 discusses some of th ese issue s. II. MERGERS OF HEALTH CARE INSURERS As discussed in Chapter 4, the Agencies use the framewor k provided by the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines (Merger Guidelines )1 to evaluate whether a merge r or acquisition will likely \"crea te or enhance market power or ... facilitate its exercise.\"2 Market p ower \"is the abilit y profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time.\"3 As in Chapter 4's discu ssion of ho spital mer gers, t his Chapter uses the framework of the Merger Guidelines to discuss issues tha t arise in connection with mergers or acquisitions involving health c are insu rers. A. Product and Geographic Market Definition Merge r analy sis can be gin eith er with an assessment of direct evidence ofanticomp etitive e ffects,4 or the identification of rele vant prod uct and g eogra phic mar kets and the calculation of the shares of market particip ants and c oncentr ation ra tios.5 A releva nt marke t typically is define d as a product or group of products and a geographic are a in which the product or groups of products is produced or sold such that a hy pothetic al profit -maximizing firm, not subject to price regulation, that was the only present and f uture producer or seller of those pro ducts in th at area likely would impose at least a \"small but significant and non-transitory\" inc rease in price above the competiti ve level , assuming the terms of sale of all other products are held constant. A relevant market is a group of produc ts and a 1 U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTICE & FEDERA L TRADE COMM 'N, HORIZON TAL MERGER Id.

Product Market In he alth insur ance ma rkets, considerable attention has focused on the definitio n of the r elevant product m arket.8 One thre shold issue is whethe r health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POSs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and indemnity plans are separate product markets or a ll part of a single p roduct ma rket.9 A second issue is whether self-ins ured emp loyer plans are in the same product market as commercial insurers and health plans. 10 The first issue arises in deciding whether HMOs and P POs are s eparat e product markets, either from each other or from a ma rket con sisting o f all hea lth insurance f inanc ing.11 Until recently, a prominent and common characteristic of many HMOs was the use of a closed panel of physicians with a primar y care physician acting as a \"gateke eper,\" but several panelists noted a pronounced trend toward less restrictive forms of managed ca re.12 As a result, several panelists suggeste d that the relevant product market should be defined broadly.13 Two Seventh Circuit cases, Blue Cross & Blue Shie ld v.

The Seve nth Circui t indicate d in both cases that HMOs and PPOs are instead part of a larger hea lth insurance financing market. In Marshfiel d Clinic , Blue Cr oss & Blue Shie ld (Blue Cross) an d their subsidiar y HMO alleg ed that th e Marshf ield Clinic, a p hysician-o wned clin ic, and it s HMO had mo nopoly power in the HMO market that they ha d acquired and maintaine d throug h imprope r pract ices.16 The Seventh Circuit rejected the argument that HMOs constituted a relevant product market se parate from othe r forms of health care cove rage. Th e cou rt sta ted th at \"[a ]n HMO is basically a method of pricing medical services,\" and not a distinctive organ izational f orm or g roup of sk ills.17 The court not ed that B lue Cross' s ability to contrac t with enou gh phy sicians to form a PPO networ k in the sa me geog raphic a rea in which it alleged the Marshfield Clinic had a monopoly implies that Blue Cross also had the ability to form an HMO.18 The court concluded that \"services offere d by HMOs and by various f ee-for -servic e plans a re both provided by the same physicians, who ca n easily shift fro m one ty pe of ser vice to another if a change in rela tive prices makes one type more luc rative than others.\"19In Ball Memorial Hosp. Inc. v. Mutual Hospital Insurance , eighty acute care hospitals alleged that Blue Cross's attempt to offer a PPO plan violated the antitrust laws because Blue Cross had market p ower an d abused it.20 The hospi tals were concerned that if Blue Cross entered the PPO mar ket, it wou ld exercis e monopsony power by lowering the pric es it paid to pa rticipat ing hosp itals.21 The hospitals also were concerned that once B lue Cross lowe red the p rices it p aid for th eir service s, the hosp itals woul d be forc ed to charg e highe r price s to other PPOs, including their own, which would allow Blue Cross to raise the costs of, and take business a way from, co mpeting PPO plans.22 The Seventh Circuit held that market power was a prerequisite to any finding that Blue Cross violated the antitrust laws and upheld the district court's finding that Blue Cross did not have market power. Blue Cross's la ck of mar ket powe r was ba sed in large part on the district court's finding tha t the product was health care financing , and that the \" Blues, o ther insu self- insuring employe rs all offer methods of financing health care.\"23 15 784 F.2n d 1325 (7t h Cir . 1986) (Easterbrook, J.). 16 Marshfield Clinic , 65 F. 3d at 1407. 17 Id. at 1409. 18 Id. at 1410. 19 Id. at 1411.20 Ball Me m'l H osp.. 784 F.2d at 1330-31.

Neither employer s nor employees view[ed] HMOs and PPOs as the same product, and enrollees who le[ft] an HMO disproportionately selec t[ed] another HMO, rather than a P PO, fo r their next plan.\" T he Divisio n also con cluded th at a \"small but significant increase in the price of HMO and HMO-POS products would not cause a sufficie nt number of custom ers to shift to oth er heal th insura nce prod ucts to make suc releva nt product market w ithin whic h to asses s the likel y effects of the proposed acquisition.\"26 insur ance busi ness i s money, which suppli ed on a mome nt's noti ce, plus the abil ity to spread risk, which many fir ms possess and which has no geographic boundary. \" Id. at 1335. 24 In U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v.

And ... any analysis that takes plac e from here on out needs to factor in the changing marketplace that is emerging due to the manag ed care backlash.\"27 Another panelist stated that \"we should look at the ef fect of macroe conomic conditions on how to define product markets.

One pane list presented the results of an empirical study he conducted, in which he compared merg ers involving locally -based h ealth pla ns with those involving national HMOs. He found that these two types of HMO s are very different and that the entry of a national HMO is unlikely to impact significa ntly the profits or competitiveness of a local HMO, and vice-v ersa.40 Thus, ac cording to this panelist, in a market with three local HMOs and two national HMOs, the merger of the two national HMOs might result in signific ant mark et power because its effe cts would be similar to a two to one merger.41 Many hear ing participants testified that hea lth insura nce mar kets in most geographic are as enjoy robust competition, with \"multiple health insurer competitors and several product options, including HMO, PPO, POS, and consumer directed health plans.\"42 One panelist explained that \"competitors within specific markets vary, including regional and local plans serving specific needs an d geog raphies .

Such programs often cost more and require larger patient populations than such programs did in the past.63 Moreove r, some pu rchase rs want to deal with firms that are already in the particular geogra phic market even if a firm with a national reputation is seeking to enter that mark et.

For example, one panelist discussed how HMOs might achieve economies of scale.73 She noted that HMOs might lower supply -side costs by neg otiating better with localphysician s.74 Moreove r, econo mies of sc ale may create lower co sts for co mply ing with s tate regulations, administering the HMO, or implementing disease and utilization management, she noted.75 She maintained that these real cost savings are akin to a technological innovation that lowers input costs.76 Another panelist suggested that because the lower input pric e refle cts genuine cost savings in the supply chain, overall welfar e incre ases.77 The firs t panelist discussed demand-side efficiencies (including broader provider networks, more financially stable a nd better managed organizations, and a larger pa tient population to provide a critical mass for population health and disease management programs) that may improve or increase the value of the HMO to the customer.78 Several panelists discussed the number of enrolle es an HMO needs to achieve economie s of scal e.

E. Conclusion The Agencies will continue to follow the Merger G uideline s in health insurance mergers and conduct a fa ctually intensive, case-specific assessment of whether a particu lar tran saction u nder re view will allow health plans to exercise market power with reg ard to the ir custome rs.83 III. MONOPSO NY POWER Conceptu ally, monopson y power is the mirror image of monopoly power. A buyer has monopsony power when it can profitably reduc e prices in a market below competitive levels by cur tailing purchases of the rele vant prod uct or se rvices.84 The exercise of monopsony powe r causes competiti ve harm b ecause the monops onist will reduce purchases of the input, shift some purchases to a less efficient source, supply too little output in the downstream market, or do all three.

Monopsony concer ns can ar ise in health in surer me rgers ,90 as well as in other contexts, including market allocation agree ments amon g compe ting pur chaser s, most favored nation (MFN) clauses, and exclusive or quasi-exclusive dealing contrac ts.91 Some of the Agencies' MFN cases can be seen as monopsony -related matters, as they de alt with the power of purchas ers of se rvices ( such as de ntal, vision, or hospital c are ser vices) to impose contract terms on sellers of those services (such as dentists, optometrists, or hospitals).92 A.

Defining a buy er-side market involves reversing the standard seller-side formula t o ask abo ut the exten t to which a t- risk suppliers will substitute other outlets for their products or services in response to a small but significant and non-transitory decrease in price. The crucial consideration in defining monopsony produc t and geographic marke ts, therefore, is whether the buyers of the input in the putative market successfully would be able to lower the price they pay for the input or whether, instead, the selle rs have s ufficie nt realis tic alternatives to allow them to circumvent the price decrease. Several additional monopsony market d efinition -relate d points ar e worth noting. First, purchasers of the input need not compete in the output market to beincluded in the relevant market for the purchas e of the i nput.94 Thus, it is p ossible that public payors (e.g., Medicare and Medicai d) and pr ivate pa yors (e.g., health care insurers) do not compete in output markets, but do compete in the market for the purchase of services from hea lth care providers. Thus, purchasers of services might be differentiated in their competitive effectiveness just as sellers are diffe rentiated in some dow nstream m arkets.95 Second, t he same a nalytical tool s used i n defi ning markets to assess seller power can be applied when assessing buyer power .96 Third, a firm need not have seller- side market power in order to have buy er- side monopsony power.97 Fourth, while the Division previously treated the product market in Aetna as phy sicians' service s, rather than defining separate product markets by phy sician specialty, monopsony antitrust markets m ight be a ppropria tely defined in other circumstances for phy sician specialties, hospitals, or other provider 93 See Miles 4/24 at 13 0-31.

Seller Switc hing Costs Seller switching costs are an important part of monopsony ana lysis. Seller switching costs are the costs faced by supplier s (e.g., health c are pro viders) in switching to differ ent outle ts (e.g., health care insurers) for their service s. High seller switching costs make it more difficult for a provider, when faced with lower reimburs ement fr om a monops onist hea lth care insurer, to switch business to another healt h care i nsure r. Con seque ntly, hi gh seller sw itching costs mak e it more l ikely that monop sonist hea lth care insurer s could exercise market power against hea lth careprovider s.

First, some have noted that such switching costs may be greater when a seller has invested in specialized assets and have suggested that the training under gone by physicians ma y be such an in vestment.103 Second, some have noted that seller switching costs can be higher if the se llers are not mobile and have sugge sted that health care providers may not be geographically mobile.104 Other panelists disagreed with the notion that the seller switching costs faced by providers ar e substantial, and argued that some phy sicians a re both g eogra phically mobile an d are ab le to serv e other h ealth98 Aetna Complaint , supra , supra note the cont ext of monopso ny, should be \"basical ly special ty-specific\"). 99 See, e .g., United States v.

C. Competitive Effects 1. Insurer M arket Shar e and the Cost of Provider Withdrawal Two recognized analy ses of market share in the context of health care insurer monopsony are: (1) the health care insurer's locality-wide shar e, which is the health care insurer's market share of patients or patient dollars in a local ma rket and (2) the h ealth care insurer's share of ea ch physician's business.107 The locality-wide share indicate s the size of the pool of patients available to the provider, if that provider were no longer to treat t he monopso nist health c are insu rer's p atients.108 The share of each provider's business, which matters only bec ause there are switching costs, shows the number ofpatients a provider would hav e to repl ace, if the provider were no longer to trea t the health c are insu rer's p atients.109 If either type of marke t share is high, a provider faces high per-patient replacement costs if the provider no longer treats the health ca re insurer 's patien ts.110 If both market shares are high (and other fac tors are present) then a health care insurer merg er or health care insurer monopsony conduc t could allow the insurer to impose significant price reductions on a nontrivial number of provider s.111 It is d ifficult , in the ab stract, t o state market share thresholds for such monopsony concer ns. I n part, th is is beca use determining the existence of monopsony power r equires the Age ncies an d courts t o look at oth er fac tors in ad dition to the health care in surer' s market s hare. T he class ic elements of monopsony power have been described as: (1) a large market share on the part of the purchaser; (2) an upwar d sloping or somewhat inelastic supply c urve in the input market; and (3) an inability or unwillingness for new purchasers to enter the market or current purchasers to e xpand the amount of their purchases in the market.112 105 See McCarthy 4/24 at 163-64, 189. 106 See i d. at 213-214; McCarthy 4/25 at 135; Mil es 4/ 24 at 213. 107 See Schwar tz 4/ 25 at 17- 19. 108 See id. at 18.109 See id. at 19. 110 See id. at 18- 20. 111 See id. at 21- 22. 112 See Miles 4/25 at 35-36.

[t here are] some intermediate t erm concerns about supply.\").182. Distinguishing Lawfu l From Unlawful Behavior Of course, even if a health car e insurer has monopsony powe r, the issue for antitrust purposes is whether the health care insurer has obtained or maintained that power th rough im proper m eans.113 If reimburs ement lev els are low due to lawfully obtained and e xercised health care insurer market power, then there is no antitrust violation. One area of health care insurer activity that may sometimes be confused with unlawful monopsony behavior is lawf ul managed care contra cting. Managed car e plans and other health care insurers ca n legitimately lowe r health care provider prices by incr easing competition among health care providers or eng aging in other activities that lower the costs of provider services. Indee d, because one of the purposes of managed care is to lower prices closer to a competitive level, it can be difficult to determine when a managed c are purchaser is exercising monopsony power.114 The First Circuit dealt with this issue in Kartell v. Blue Shie ld of Massa chusetts .115 In Kartell , physicians sued B lue Shield, alleging that its prohibition on \"balance billing\" was an unreasonable restra int of trade or an act of monopolization or attempted monopolization.116 The Fir st Circuit, in rejecting this antitrust challenge, assumed for purposes of its analy sis that Blue Shie ld had mar ket powe r and tha t it used the market \"power to obtain 'lower than competitive' prices.\"117 The cour t said that as long as the prices were not predatory, or below anyone 's incremental cost, \"a legitimate buye r is entitled to use its market power to keep prices down.\"118 One way to distinguish monopsony conduct f rom other market si tuations is to look for i ndicia of such con duct.119 One 113 See Miles 4/25 at 43-44. 114 See Frec h 4/2 5 at 2 4-25 .

Lowering P rices Be low the Competitive Level Some have said that the Agencies should be concerned whenever a tr ansaction or prac tice lea ds to a lowe ring of prices.121 A more ap propria te way of frami ng thisissue is that the Agencies should be concerned only if the transaction or practice leads to prices below competitive levels. Of course, this requires a determination of the \"compet itive pric ing leve l,\" which is a daunting task.122 Health care prices can be defined in a number of different way s, and even with an agreed-upon be nchmark for competitive reimbursement, it can be difficul t to know wh ether th e price paid to health care providers has chang ed.123 4. Monopsony P ower Absen t Downstream Market Power Finally, it should be noted that payors need not have m onopoly power in downstream markets to have monopsony power in upstrea m markets .124 Thus, in cases su ch as Cargill , a monopsony may affec t supplier s but not co nsumers.125 In Cargill , the Division challenged a merge r that would have created a monopsony purchas er of g rain in so me local m arkets.126 The merg ing comp anies, ho wever, sold grain in world markets, in which they faced competiti on from ma ny other gr ain selle rs.127 Thus, even if the merged firms imposed a loss on fa rmers by cutting back the quantity Everything Old is New Again: Health Care and Comp etition in the 21st Century, Speech B efore the 7th An nual Competi tion in Healt h Care F orum 16- 18 (Nov. 7, 20 02), avail /www.ft c.gov/ speech es/muri s/mu rishealthcarespe ech0211. pdf physicians who ent ered into consent agree ments to settle FTC al legations of anticompetit ive conduct were not located i n areas with high payor concentration - indicati ng that t he driving force behi nd suc h conduc t was not a n attempt to offset m onopsony po wer). 120 See McCarthy 4/2 5 at 6 5-69 .

D. Conclusion The Hearings confirmed two important , interre lated poi nts with re spect to monopsony power in the hea lth insurance sector. First, un der the r ight cir cumstanc es, monopsony power ca n be created or exercised in this industry. The Ag encies consequ ently need to r emain vig ilant in monitoring the market for such situations. Second, properly ascertaining whether monopsony power has in fa ct been created or exerc ised in this industry typically will involve a case-s pecific , factua lly-intense assessment. As panelists pointed out, \"'low prices' by the mselves are not an indication or certainly not proof of monopsony power,\"129 and correctly determining the presence of monopsony power is \"tricky .\"130 IV. CURRENT C ONTROVERSI ES A. Most Favored Nation Clauses An MFN clause is a contractual agreement between a supplier and a customer that req uires the supplier to sell to the customer on pricing terms at least as favorable as the pricing terms on which tha t supplier sells to any o ther customer. In health care markets, large insurance plansimpose the se contr actual a greem ents in contracts with hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers. MFNs ar e sometimes also referred to as \"most favored customer clauses,\" \"prudent buy er clauses,\" or \"nondiscrimination clauses.\" According to panelists at the Hearings, MFNs may be anticompetitive or procompetitive, depending on the circumst ances.131 Proponents of MFNs argue that they allow an insurer to be confide nt that the reimburs ement it pa ys a provider is no greater than the ra tes paid by the insur er's co mpetitors . In c ertain situations, however, an MFN clause may harm com petition e ither by substantia lly raising the costs of the insurer's rivals, or reducing provider discounting in the particu lar mark et.132 Under e ither the ory, any savings in provider cos ts to the fi rm imposi ng the MFN must be weighed against any higher provider costs inc urred by that firm 's rivals .133 The 128 See i d. at 12. 129 Miles 4/25 at 35. 130 Frech 4/24 at 31-32.131 Overstr eet 5/7 at 146 (notin \"[t]here's a fai r consens us among economis ts that have l ooked at these things that they can be pr o- competitive or anticompetit ive depending on the factual circumst ances \"); Kopit 5/ 7 at 126, 132-35; /7 at 13 9-43 ; Sno w 5/7 at 15 4-55 . 132 As di scus sed infra notes 148-?, and acco mpa nying tex t, MF Ns a re typica lly used to elimina te pro vider disco unting if the in surer is controlled by pro vider s. 133 See Kopit 5/7 at 135-38 (sugges ting that MFNs imposed b y insurers with market power are likely antico mpe titive unless th ey can be sho wn to redu ce co st, similar to th e the R obin son-P atma n Ac t's requ ireme d iscou ). Overstreet at impo rtance of de termin ing actu al act of M FN in weighing theoret ical clai ms that lower costs to the firm imp osing th e MFN are o ffset by high er co sts to21Agencies consider economic justifications for MFNs when weighing the ir potential competitive effects. Accord ing to som e paneli sts, justifications for MFN clauses in other industrie s are not applica ble when applied t o the health care industry.134 For example, MFNs ca n facilit ate long -term co ntracts i n industrie s such as n atural g as, wher e it is difficult to predict future price chang es and industry conditions. They also can be used as a subst itute \"low -cost se ller\" sig nal in industrie s in which i t is diffic ult and co stly for consumers to search for price information.135 These jus tificatio ns for MF Ns likely are not a pplicabl e to the us e of MFN s in health care markets. The \"equitable\" argume nt in favo r of MFN s that the l arges t buyer in the market is entitled t o a quanti ty discount and to the best price is not supporte d by antitrust economic s, but it is likely to b e advanced by la rge buye rs. In any ca se, there is no need for a counterintuitive blanket rule against MFNs. There may be situations, however, where an MFN has an anticompetitive effect and as noted above, in any investigation, the agencies would weigh the c ost savings to the largest buy er against higher costs that may be incur red by that firm 's rivals .1361. Prior Cases The Agencies have broug ht several cases in volving M FNs.137 Only a few of those cases have resulted in judicial opinions, and they provide little guida nce other tha n that MFN s are not per se lawful.138 Delta Dental Of Arizona and RxCare involved provider-controlled insurer s that impos ed an MF N in orde r to eliminate provider discounting. Vision Service Plan and Medical Mutual Of O hio involved insurers that were not provider- controlled and used their monopsony power to raise their rivals' costs. In Delta Dental of Rhode Island the federal district court issued an opinion that held that MFNs are not per se lawful.139 Private litigation has had mixed results. In both Ocean State and Kitsap v. Wash ington De ntal, courts found that the MFN clauses at issue did not violate the com peting firms). 134 Baker 5/ 7 at 141- 43. 135 See i d. at 142- 43. 136 See gen erally Snow 5/ 7 at 156- 57 (argu ing \"that in m ost cas es, the larg est buye r is entitled to a qua ntity disco unt and to the b est pric e\").

In United Sta tes v. Eli Lilly , the court found that the MFN clause explained the existence of prices higher than the competitive price,although there was no evidence of conspiracy.144 In Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shie ld, the court fo und that t he MFN provided evidence of Blue Cross's market power, a nd the Te nth Circui t explicitly stated that the Ocean State decision did not alter its conclusion with respect to Blue Cross's possession of monopoly power.145 Several other cases also have discussed the anticomp etitive po tential Conc erns MFNs, as used in health care markets, may re sult in competitive harm based up on two diff erent th eories.147 First, MFNs can facilitate coordination among health care providers in certain instance s where th e insure r imposing the MFN i s provider-controlled.148 Under th ese circumstances, the MFN can make c heating on a cartel price more transpare nt and provide an enforcement mechanism that can140 Ocean State Physic ians Heal th Plan, Inc. v.

One of RxCare's stated goals w as to \"de fine and promote appropriate compensation to pharmacists for patient care.\"150 The Commission's complaint alleged that RxCare and the associa tion used t he MFN c to r \"rivalr y in the provi sion of pha rmacy benefit prescription services among Tennessee pharmacies ... [and harm] consumers by limiting p rice co mpetition a nd entry into pharmacy network services.\"151 Second, insurers that are not controlled by provider s may impose MFNs to deter hospitals or other providers from granti ng disco unts to com peting h ealth insurers. Under this theory , the MFN may create a barrier to entry or expansion by the insurer 's rivals or may raise its rivals' c osts, thereby making them less effective competito rs.152 Some panelists noted that providers have less incentive than they otherwise would to accept lower prices from another health pl an beca use they will have togive the lower price to the dominant plan with which they have the MFN agreement. Absent the MFN, pan elists note d, some health insurers may offer new or different products, such as more restricted provider panels or tiered c o-pay ments. The se alternative insurers may have a greater ability to barga in for lower prices because, unlike many plans, they may have more flexibility in excluding providers or crea ting incentiv es for pa tients to c hoose low cost providers, panelists explained. Providers may favor the creation of these plans because, panelists observed, they may expand the size of the insured population by making i nsuranc e options a vailable to people who otherwise could not afford them.153 Under this theory, the ina bility of the incumben t health p lan's riv als to obta in discounts may result in the outright exclusion of rival health plans or new entrants into the market and allow the incumbent health plan to maintain or achieve prices above the competitive 149 See Unit ed Sta tes v.

The disparity in hospital rates among competing plans may a ffect that co mpe tition to a sig nificant 7 at 156- 57.24level.154 In Reazin v. Blue Cross & B lue Shield , for instance, the court noted there was testimony that alternative de livery systems, such as HMOs, \"we re the first real challenge to our traditional sy stem of delivering financing of ca re ... [and] that Blue Cro ss's most f avored n ations cla use hindered the development of alternative deliver y systems, the reby interfe ring wit h the introduction of competition.\"155 The Tenth Circuit observed that, at least in the Kansas market, there were sig nificant barriers to entry and Blue Cross's actions were de signed t o maintain those bar riers.156Under e ither of t hese the ories, market power is an important part of the analysis. Panelists noted that there is no absolute market share threshold above which a firm may be able to em ploy an MFN anticompetitively.157 Indeed, the rele vant source of market power (and thus the relevant market share inquiry ) depends on whether the theory of harm focuses on seller-side or buy er-side imposition of the MFN. For example, where the theory of harm focuses on the first theory (facilitation of provider coordination), the collective market power of the participating provider s is an important consideration. Conversely, wher e the theory of harm focuses on the second theory (raising rivals' costs or abuse of health insurer monopsony power), the insure r's market power upstream is a relevant inquiry.158 Indeed, most of t he cases findi ng MFN clauses anticomp etitive in volved pla ns with a dominant market share requiring provider s to agree to an MFN clause or a dominant provider network requirin g provid ers it contracts with to agree to the MFN c lause.159 154 Baker 5/7 at 140; B aker Presentation, supra note 1 43, a t 6. 155 899 F.2d 951, 970 (10th Cir. 1990).

As Commissio n staff e xplained in its most recent advocacy letter on this issue, Empirical evaluations of any willing provider and \"freedom of choice\" provisions indicate that these policies result in higher health care expenditures. One study found that states with highly re strictive any willing provider/freedom of choice laws spent approximately 2% more on healthcare than did states without such polic ies. This f inding li kely reflects the fact that these laws reduce the ability of insurers to offer less expensive plans with limited provider panels. This interpretation is supported by another study that found that metropolitan areas with a high intensity of any willing provider/freedom of choice regulation had HMO market shares approximately 7% lower than compara ble are as without these provisions. \"Freedom of choice\" provisions reduced HMO market share more than any willing provider laws.198 194 See, e .g., id.

Potent ial Respons es to the Demand for Mandated Benefits As the numb er of ma ndated be nefits has rise n, sensitiv ity to their c ost ramifications has increased. The Unfunded Mandate s Reform A ct discou rages Congre ss from imposing unfunded mandates on othergover nmental e ntities.201 The states have devel oped a variet y of strat egies t o weigh the costs of mandated benefits, with vary ing degre es of suc cess.202 There are four basic models for mandatory re view processes: (1) use of an independent standing health care commission or legislative advisory commission/interim committee; (2) use of an administrative agency ; (3) use of legislative research or fisca l staff; and (4) use of proponent prepared and submitted assessments to the legislative committee.203 Each model has procedural variations in the review process including how the bills are referred for evaluat ion and the specific require ments of th e impact a nalysis. Some of the models may be more credible and provide more objective information than others. Conclusion . For man dates to improve th e effic iency of the he alth insurance market, state and federa l legislators must be able to identify services the insur ance ma rket is no t curre ntly coverin g for w hich cons umers ar e willing to pay marg inal cost.

Representatives from the pharmac eutical i ndustry and leg al, economic, and academic experts spoke at the Hearing s on pharm aceutic al topic p anels, including: Generics and Pharmaceuticals (September 10, 2002); Advertising and Pharmaceuticals: DTC Advertising and Promotion (September 10, 2002); and Issues (June 26).1 This chap ter prov ides a brief overview of the drivers of competition for pharmaceutical products, discusses Commission initiatives in the pharmaceutical industry and highlights the contenti ous public issues sur rounding PBMs and DT C adve rtising.To date, most empirical evidence suggests that PBMs have lowered c osts for health pl an sponso rs. None theless, the use of PBMs as intermediaries between pharmac eutical m anufac turers a nd health plan sponsors has raised public concern about whether PBMs increase pharmac y benefit costs for health plan sponsors and their enrollees. Pursuant to a legislative directive, the Commission is examining one particu lar aspe ct of the se alleg ations - whether it costs more for a health plan sponsor to use mail order pharmacy services integrated with a PBM than to use non- integrated mail order or retail phar macies. Similarly, the effec ts of DTC advertising have been subject to debate. Currently available empirical evidence does not support the allegations that DTC adverti sing inc reases inapprop riate prescription of, or prices for, pharmace utical products. Indeed, re search shows that truthful and non-misleading advertising generally benefits consumers by providing them with u seful inf ormation a bout their health c are nt options.2 Neverth eless, de finitive c the lopment of better e mpirical 1 A com plete list of participants on these and other pan els is avai lable infra App endix A an http:/ /www.ft c.gov/ogc/healthcare consi dered at a work shop he ld by the Commiss ion on Septemb er 10 , 200 2.

II. BACKG ROUND ON INNOVATIO N IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY The role of prescription pharmaceutical drugs has cha nged significantly ove r the last 25 yea rs. Medicines now exist to treat conditions that previously had no treatment or required lengthy hospital stays and/or surgery, allowing health c are pro viders to employ less inva sive trea tments.3 Advances in science and technology have given researchers more sophisticated knowledg e of the root causes of diseases. Scientists can more effectively design medicines to attack specific diseases, resulting in the invention of new me dicines.4 U.S. spending on pharmaceutical products mirrors t his chang ing role . U.S. spending on pharma ceutica ls increa sed to $140.6 billion in 2001, more than triple the amount in 1990.5 Total U.S. spending for drug products accounts for approximately 11percen t of pe rsona l heal th care spend ing.6 Figur e 1 shows t he annua l rate of increa se in spending on presc ription ph armace uticals during the last decade.7 One report estimates that approximately half of the increase in spending is due to increased utilization, and that the remainder of the increa se is split e venly betwee n increa ses in retail prices and increases in the use of more expensive drugs.8 This increase in spending for pharmaceutical products has been coupled with an increase in research and development (R&D) spending to develop and bring to market new pharmace utical 3 PHARMACEUTICAL RESE ARCH & cations/publi Fam ily Foun d., Presc ription Drug .org/rxdrugs Medica id ce and ied 24, 20 04). 8 Kaise r Fam ily Foun d, sup ra no te 5, at 2 .

Fr om 1990 to 2001, annua l R&D spending in the pharmaceutical industry increased from $8 billion to $30 billion.9 The Commission examined extensively the drivers behind this increa sed R&D spending and pharmaceutica l innovation in its October 2003 Report, To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy (FTC Pate nt Report) .10 The FTC Patent Report found both patents and competition play an esse ntial role in spurring innovation in the pharmaceutical industry . Patents spur innovatio n in sever al diffe rent way s. First, patents c reate in centive s for bra nd-name companies to innovate by e xcluding others from making, using, or selling a claimed invention for a specific period of time. Second, p atents dis close to th e public information that might otherwise remain a trade secret. Such disclosure encourag es innovation by giving generic companies an opportuni ty to design a round bra nd-name patents.11 Panelists at the Health CareHearings supported the FTC Patent Report's conclusion that patent protection is essential to innovation in the pharmaceutical industry.12 Inno vation in th is industry is costly and unpredic table as it requires significant amounts of pioneering resea rch to discover and test new drug products. Patent protection allows pharmaceutical firms to recoup the substantial capital investments made to discover, test, and obtain regulatory approval of these new drug products. Box 7-1 references some of the empirica l studies of the role of paten ts in spurring innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. A. Types of Innovation in t he Pharmaceutical Industry The FTC Patent R eport describes two main ty pes of inn ovation: ( i) discre te innovation; and (ii) incremental innovation.13 Innovation can occur at many points alo ng the c ontinuum, f rom discr ete to increme ntal, but th ese cat egorie s help classify innovation in the pharma ceutical industry. 1.

Another study by Richard C. Lev in, Alvin K Klevo rick, Richard R. Nelson and Sidney G. Winter analyzed surv ey responses from 650 R&D m anagers representing 130 lines of business. This study found patents were espe cially important in the pharmaceutica l drug industry to prevent duplicatio n. See Richard C.

For example, \"[t]he discovery of a che mical molecule that is both efficacious and safe for human usage can result in a totally new drug product.\"15 The benefits of discrete innovation, however, do not come without high fixe d costs an d risks tha t the eff ort will not produce a marketable product.

Incremental Innovation Incremental innovation \"c onsists of enhancing known chemical entities by formulating new dosage forms or a dditional methods of use for existing chemical entities.\"18 The term \"incre mental\" general ly refers t o adva nces i n tech nology that are built on the features or elements of existing technology.19 Drugs f ormed this way are re ferred to as inc rementa lly modified drugs (IMDs) .20 The FTC Patent R eport describes three wa ys increme ntal innov ation is achieve d. One is th rough n ew formu lations, which inc lude such things a s chang es in dosage forms or new way s of administering approve d drugs . The sec ond method is combining two previously a pproved active ingredients to form a new product. The third is the use of deriv atives of previous ly approve d drugs to form a n ew produ ct.21 There are a variety of views about the benefits of these modified drugs, rang ing from the view that IMDs bring significant health enhancements to consumers to the view that IMDs only serve to extend abrand-name company 's \"patent monopolies beyond the pate nt expiry of the new chemical entity ... by a matter of y ears, not days or we eks or months.\"22 B. The Role of Competition in Spurring Pharmaceutical Innovation Several panelists at the health care hearings highlighted the importance of competition to spur innovation. For example, some panelists suggested that the incentives to innovate provided by patent rights should be balanced against the competiti on provide d by gener ic drug s.23 The FTC Patent R eport has articulated how competition spurs pharmaceutical innovation. First, brand-name companies with pate nted drug s are inc reasing ly competin g with on e anothe r, partic ularly within the same therapeutic class. Second, provisions in the Hatch-Waxman Amendments have fostered competition from ge nerics b y streamlini ng the g eneric drug a pproval p rocess.24 Competition Among Brand-Name Companies . The FTC Patent R eport indicated that brand-name pharmaceutica l companies believe that competition among brand-n ame comp anies co ntinues to increa on of a breakt hroughpreclinical testing, and only 1 drug in 5 that enters human clinical t rials i s approved by the FD A as being both safe and effect ive.\" ). 18 FTC PATENT REPORT , supra note 10, at 8. 19 Id. at 8; see al so THE NAT'L INSTIT UTE FOR HEAL TH CARE MGMT ., C HANGI NG PATTERNS (2002) [herei nafter NIHCM, INNOVAT supra note 19, at 5. 21 Id. at 5, 8.22 FTC PATENT REPORT , supra note 10, at 9. 23 Lock 9/10/02 at 220-21; McCluskey 9/10/ 02 at 221. 24 FTC PATENT REPORT , supra note 10, at 10-12. Another form of c ompetit ion th at may af fect innovati on is the competi tion among g eneri c firms f or the sam e bra nd-na me p roduct.6medicine and the introduction of a competing therapeutic age nt has been consi stent ly shrin king.25 Although brand-to- brand co mpetition m ay have inc reased in those therapeutic areas in which demand for the drugs is likely to incr ease, one commentator has suggested that price competiti on among severa l drug pr oducts in a therapeutic class can be limited.26 Competition From Generic Drug Products . The Hatch-Waxman Amendments govern the gener ic drug approval process and have play ed a major role in spurring additional competition in the pharmac eutical i ndustry . The Ame ndments \"established a regulatory framework that sought to balance incentives for continued innovation by resea rch-based pharmaceutical companies and opportunities for market entry by generic drug manufa cturers.\"27 The Amendments also streamlined procedures for allowing generic dr ug applicants an opportuni ty to gain F DA appro val prior to patent expiration.28 Since enactment ofHatch-Wa xman in 1984, barrie rs to competition have been lowered, and price competiti on in those markets w ith gene ric entry has increased significantly.29 Competition from generic drugs can deliver large price sa vings to c onsumers , because gener ic drug s are ty pically far less expensive than their corresponding brand- name versions. A Congressional Budge t Office (CBO) study attempted to quantify the magnitude of this effect by analyzing retail pharmacy data from 1993 and 1994. The study found that the ave rage price of a gener ic presc ription wa s approxima tely half of the av erage price of a brand- name prescription.30 The CBO estimated that the availability of g eneric drugs saved purchasers between $8 billion and $10 billion in 1994 alone.31 Other empirical economics literature also finds procompetitive effects associated 25 Id. at 10 -11.

See 9/10/02 at 197-98 (d iscussing how s enior s efit from g eneric drug usage).7with the in troductio n of ge neric dr ugs.32 This literature points to significant short-run competitive impacts of generic entry that can lead to substantial benefits for consumers of prescr iption dru gs.33 The FTC Patent R eport highlig hts two provisions of Hatch-Waxman that have played a sig nificant role in spurring increases in generic compe tition: the 180- day exclusivity provision and the 30 -month stay provision. Under the 180- day provision, the first generic firm to file an application for a new drug is gr anted 180 days of mark eting e xclusivity if the g eneric firm certifies that its product does not infringe any of the brand-name company 's patents o n the drug product o r if the g eneric firm challenges the validity of the brand- name company 's patent. During this 180- day exclusivity period the FDA may not approve subsequent generic a pplications for the sa me dru g.34 The 180- day exclusivity provision has provided increased incentives for a generic firm to be the f irst to file an application to market its product. As the first to f ile, a g eneric has the po tential to\"reap t he rewa rd\" of be ing the o nly gener ic product in the market for a set period of time.35 The provision also provides more incen tives for com panie s to ch allen ge patents and develop alternatives to patented drugs.36 A brand-name company may rec eive a 30-month stay of F DA approval of a gener ic applic ant if the brand-n ame company has r eceived notice of the filing of such a generic application and files suit for patent infringement within 45 day s of that notice. 37 According to the legislative history, the stay allows for the commenc ement of a lawsuit and take s into accoun t the pate nt owner 's righ ts while sti ll encouraging generic entry.38 C. Policy Cho ices That C ould Undermine Inno vation and Competition in the Pharm aceutical Industry Both patent protection and competition have led to substantial investment and innovation in the pharmaceutical industry .

One policy choic e involves price regulation or price controls to lower prescription drug prices. L evels of prescr iption dru g spend ing hav e incre ased in recent y ears due to increases in both the number of prescriptions and prices. Many consumer s face h ardships in keepin g up with these es calating prices.39 Thus, the impetus to conside r price regula tion or pr ice cont rols is understandable. Before any move in this direction, however, it is important to review the history of attemp ts to solve p ublic pro blems through price controls. Price controls have typically led to significant market place distortion s that har med consu mers.40 Price controls are also difficult to administer.41 Price controls that reduce prices too low reduce output and capaci ty, lower the quality of the services that are provided, and diminish the incentives for innovation,including ongoing R&D.42 Thus, price controls on pharmaceuticals have a signific ant poten tial to har m consume rs.43 Another policy choic e surrounds whether gover nment shou ld use its purchasing power to purchase dr ugs on behalf of consumers and thereby lower prices. One risk of this approach is the potential for the government to become a \"monopson ist.\" As Ch apter 6 r eflects power exercised by buyers ra ther than sellers\" that lets the buy er \"reduce the purchase price by scaling back its purchases.\"44 The 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines (Merger Guidelines ) provide that market power encompasses the ability of a single buyer \"to de press the price paid for a product to a level that is below the competiti ve price and ther eby depress output.

COMMISSION INITIATIVE S TO ENSURE CONSUMERS RECEIVE THE BE NEFITS OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPETI TION The Commission has pursued numerous antitrust enforcement actions affecting both brand-name a nd generic drug manufacturers to ensure that consumers receive the benefits of ge neric drug competition. One type of c onduct involves allege dly anticomp etitive a companie s.46 In a rece nt opinion, the Commission ruled that Schering-Plough Corporation (Schering), Upsher-Smith L aboratories, Inc. (Upsher in to illega l agre ements in 1997 and 1998 to delay the e ntry of lower- cost generic competition for Schering 's prescription drug K-Dur 20.47 Schering and its potential generic competitors, Upsher and AHP, settled patent litigation on terms that included substantial payments by Schering to those potential rivals in return for agreement to defer introduction of the generic products. The Commission held that these provisions were unfair methods of competiti on and en tered a n order t hat would bar similar conduct in the future.48 The Commission also has taken antitrust enforcement action against other types of improper c onduct. These actions charged abuse of FD A regulations governing paten t listings49 and rs.50 For example, the Commission alleged a decade-long patter n of anticompetitive acts by B ristol-Myers 45 U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTICE & FEDERA L TRADE COMM 'N, HORIZON TAL MERGER GUIDEL INES 0.1 (1992), available a t http://www .ftc.gov/b c/do cs/ho riz mer. htm. 46 See, e .g., In re Bristo l-Mye rs Sq uibb Co., No. C-407 6 (Apr. 14, 2003 ) (decision and order), avail able at http://www .ftc.gov/ os/2003/ 04/bri stol Abbott Laborat ories, No. C-3945 (M ay 22, 2000) (decision and avail able at http://www .ftc.gov/ os/2000/ 05/ c3945.d o.htm ; rmac euticals, In c., No. C-394 6 (Ma y 22, 2000) (decision and order), avail able at http://www .ftc.gov/ os/2000/ 05/ c3946.d o.htm ; In re Hoechst M arion Roussel, Inc ., No. 929 3 (Ma y 8, 2001) (decision and order), avail able at http://www .ftc.gov/ os/2001/ 05/ Inc. , 62 F.

B MS allegedly abused FDA regulations to block generic entry , misled the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to obtain unwarra nted patent protection, and filed baseless patent infringement lawsuits to deter entry by generics. Accord ing to the FTC's co mplaint, BMS' illegal conduct protected near ly $2 billion in a nnual sal es at a hi gh cost t o cancer patients and other consumers, who - being d enied ac cess to lo wer-co st alternatives - were forced to over pay by hundreds of millions of dollars for important and ofte n life-sa ving med ications.51 In addition, the Commission issued its comprehensive study of this industry, Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration , in 2002.52 That study examined whether the conduct that the FTC had challenged represented isolate d instances orwas more typica l of pharmaceutical industry business p ractice s and whe ther ce rtain provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which gover n gene ric drug entry , were s usceptib le to strategies to delay or deter consumer access to gene ric alte rnative s to brand -name drug pr oducts.53 This study found that if left unchecked, certain provisions of the Hatch- Waxman Act had the potential to be abused, thereby pr eventing generic drug s from becoming timely a vailable.54 To comba t this poten tial for a buse and resultant delay s in generic drug competition, the Commission recommended two major changes to the Hatch-Waxman Act. The se reco mmendatio ns were to provide only one 30-month stay per brand- name drug product and to require notifica tion to the C ommission of certain types of pharma ceutical company agree ments.55 The recently enacted Medicar e Prescr iption Dru g, Improveme nt, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) includes these two significant recomme ndations.56 The Commiss ion will continue to protect consumers from anticompetitive practices that inflate drug prices.

This section describes PBMs' role in administering pharmacy benefit service s on beha lf of thei r clients (i.e., heal th plan spo nsors such a s large employers or he alth insurance carriers), provides overview information about the industry , and hig hlights th e importa nt public policy issues tha t panelist s discusse d. Public scrutiny has incr eased r ecently over PBM s' role in a dminister ing pha rmacy benefit services. To date, the empirical evidence suggests that consumers with prescription drug insurance administered by a PBM save substantially on their drug costs as compared to cash- paying cust omers.57 At the behest of Congress, the Commission is examining one aspect of the PBM industry - whether PBMs' mail order pharmacies save money for health plan sponsors and consumers as compare d to reta il pharma cies and mail order pharmacies not owned by PBMs. Congre ss has re quired th e Commission to complete this study by June 2005. A. What is a PBM? PBMs mana ge the p harmac y benefit of grou p health p lan sponso rs, such a s HMO plans, se lf-insur ed employ ers, inde mnity plans, labor union plans, and plans covering public em ployees.58 When an en rollee inone of the se plans p urchase s a drug at a retail ph armacy , he or she present s a healt h plan card identify ing the source of insurance coverage. The pharma cy will transmit the insuranc e cover age inf ormation t o the PBM, which ve rifies c overag e and de termines if the plan covers the prescribed drug , what the plan owes as direct pay ment to the pharmacy , and what the enrollee's co- payment will be (if any). The PBM transmits this information back to the pharmacy , logs the pay ment information on its system, and transmits the billing informat ion to hea lth insure rs. These insurer s then re mit pay ment to the PBM, which fo rwards p ayment to the retaile r. This process , known as claims ad judicatio n, is handled electronically . Ninety-five pe rcent of patients with prescription drug insurance coverage rece ive their benefits through a PBM.59 In the words of one pane list, PBMs are the \"middlemen\" between pharmac eutical m ers.60 PBMs cont ract wit h pharmaceutical manufacturers on be half of the plan sponsors to obtain brand-name and gener ic drug s. One pa nelist note d that a large customer base ena bles the la rgest PBMs with the most covered lives to drive the market share of any one pharmaceutical drug product and, therefore, obta in the lowest prices from pharmaceutical manufac turers.61 PBMs use mail order pharmac ies or co ntract w ith retai l pharmacies to establish networks of nearby pharmacies through which enrollees c an57 See, e .g., GENERA L ACCOUNTI NG OFFICE (GAO ), EFFECTS O F USING PHARMAC Y BENEFIT MANAG ERS ON HEAL TH PLANS, ENROLLEES , AND PHARMAC IES (2003), ava ilable a t http://www .gao. gov/ cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-03-196.

In these contracts, the parties agree to the dis pensing fees th at the PBM will pay the retail phar macy. B. The PBM Formular y The main t ool that PB Ms use to manage pharmacy benefits is the formulary, which is a list of PBM-approved drugs for treating various d iseases and cond itions.63 Through a formulary , the PBM controls the price that health plans and enrollees pay and may influence the use of various drugs and the mix of drugs dispensed.64 Panelists report ed tha t although P BMs des ign formularies, plan sponsors often demand a customized formulary that addre sses various needs of their en rollees ( e.g., cost containm ent, acc ess to ce rtain med icines, high generic substitution, etc.).65 One panelist described genera lly how a formula ry decision is made in a single therapy c lass for its preferred nationalformulary.66 The panelist stated that an independent pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) c ommittee f irst eval uates the drugs in the part icular c lass for c linical e ffectiv eness and safety . Each drug is then classified for formulary pur poses as \"include on the formulary,\" \"exclude from the formulary ,\" or \"op tional.\" T he nex t step for dru gs classified as \"option al\" is that the P&T committee ranks them on clinical effectiveness, and then aga in by cost. The \"optiona l\" drug s also ar e examine d for the ir market sh are and likely customer reactio n if the PBM were to prefer cer tain drugs over others. After the rankings are c omplete, the PBM deci des whic h drugs to include on its national formulary. A s noted above, group health plans may neg otiate certain aspects of a PBM's preferred national formulary. In de ciding w hich drug s to includ e in the formu lary (and the ir place ment within various tiers on the formulary ), two practices come into and (ii) ther apeutic interch ange. Generic substitution is the dispensing of a bio- equivalent generic drug product that contains the same active ingredient(s) a s the brand-n ame drug and is, am ong othe r things , chemically identica l in strength, concentration, dosage form, and route of administr ation as th e substitut ed brand -name product. Generic substitutio n gene rally occurs w hen a co nsumer pr esents a prescription for a brand-name drug and the pharmacist fills the prescription with a generic version of the drug product without the need for prior phy sician authorization. Becau se gen eric dr ugs are substantia lly less expensive than thei r brand- name62 Richa rdso n 6/2 6 at 9 .

See also Barreuta 6/ 26 at 92.13counterparts, generic substitu ting a th erapeu tically equivalent, but distinct, drug product for the drug product referre d to on the consumer's prescription ( e.g., two brand-name drug products that treat the same ailment). Prior physician authorization is required be fore a pharmacist is allowed to interchange one brand-name drug for another . The co-pay s that enrollees must pay are det ermined with all of these va riables i n mind. Co-pays significa ntly influence drug utilization. Most group health plan sponsors negotiate a three-tiered c o-pay ar rangement with the PBM, with the lowest co-pay for generic drugs, the middle tier for brand- name drugs with no generic e quivalent, and the hi ghest c o-pay for b rand-n ame dru gs with a g eneric equivale nt.68 Some plan sponsors negotiate a fourth tier for drug s not included on the PBM formulary , and so- called lifestyle dr ugs, e.g., drugs to combat hair loss.69 The ascending rates of the co- pays are designed to create an incentive f or the enrollee to prefer the lowest cost, y et clinically eff ective, alternative. Greater formulary compliance allows the PBMs to negotiate with the pharmaceutical manufacturer f or better prices, because formulary compliance is an indication of the ability of the PBM to steer enrollees to various drugs. Thus, formulary complian ce allow s the PBM to negotia tewhat it ca n deliver for the ma nufactu rers in terms of growth of their market share or avoidance of the manufacturer losing market share.70 Plan sponso rs may negotia te with PBMs to ovide enr ollees inc entives to use the PBM network pharmacies so that the PBM has greater control of re imbursement and adhe rence t o formula ry drugs. Those incentiv es rang e from dif ferent ial co-p ays to denial of coverage for out-of-network purchas es. Plan sp onsors an d PBMs als o negotia te over i ncentive s for enr ollees to u se mail order distribution for maintenance medicati ons.71 Mail order distribution typically is handled through the PBMs' own internal ma il ord er phar macie s or th rough mail orde r pharma cies unde r contra ct with another PBM. C. Flow of Pay ments for Drug Benefits and PBM Services To perform it s services, a P BM enters c ontract s with hea lthcare plans, re tail pharmacies, and drug manufac turers. When a PBM est ablishes retail ne tworks, it contracts with retail pharmacies on reimbursement amounts for drugs dispensed by the pharmac y. For a given drug, the price that the PB M will reim burse a r etail pharmac y is stated a s a discou nt from a measure of whole sale pric e plus a dispensing fee for the pharmacy . For brand- name drugs, the \"averag e wholesale price\" (AWP) as stated by the manufa cturer is used as a basis for the discount, so the price 67 See Dicken 6/26 at 32. 68 Richa rdso n 6/2 6 at 1 9. 69 Id. at 19.70 Barreu ta 6/ 26 at 91. 71 Maint enanc e drug s are those us ed for treatm ent of ch ronic or example , \"AWP - 10% + $2.00.\" For generic drugs, the average price used is the \" maximum allowable cost\" (MAC) as specified by the PBM, so the formula might be \"MAC - 10% + $2.00.\" Retail pha rmacies are will ing to offer discounts from the referenc e price (AWP or MAC) depending on the ty pe of plan sponsors covered by the PBM and the exclusivity of the retail pharmac y network. The more exclusive the network, the larger the discount retail pharmacies will offer, believin g that g reater exclusivity is likely to bring th em more c ustomers. The PBM's contract with a plan sponsor covers the amount that the plan sponsor will pay the reta il pharmacy pe r prescr iption of e ach drug , as well a s separa te charges for the variety of PBM services that the plan sponsor may utilize. The PBM's charg e to the pl an sponso r per sc ript is similar in form to the retail pharmacy contrac t. For br and-nam e drug s, it is a discount off AWP plus an administration charge per script, e.g., \"AWP - 5% + $0.10.\" For ge neric dr ugs, the charg e has the same form except the discount will be from the MAC as spe cified b y the PBM. Finally , the cont ract ne gotiate d with the pharmaceutical manufacturer may provide a rebate off the fees ow ed by the PBM based on (a) a percentag e of AWP or some other wholesale benchmark, (b) achieving certain specified sa les or market share targets, (c) pre ferred placement of certain drug pr oducts on t he PBMs' formulary, or (d) a combination of items (a) - (c). In addition, the manufacturer may pay the PBM an administration fee and a fee for the PBM pr oviding p romotiona l service s.PBMs also may be pa id for providing service s such as d rug util ization re views, which analyze phy sician prescribing patterns to identify physicians who pr escri be high cost drugs when lower cost alternatives ar e availab le; disea se manag ement se rvices, which offer treatment information to, and monitoring of, patie nts with ce ws to determine what other drugs patients may be taking so that the pharmacist can ensure agains t advers e reac tions.72 In addition, PBMs r pha rmacy service s, includi ng the p rovision o f certa in high co st, low utili zation dru gs that r etail pharmacies normally do not carry and that may require special means of distribution (e.g., refrigeration) or profe ssional administration. D. Industry Overview It is estimated that there are 60 PBMs operating in the United States today . There are three independe nt, full-service PBMs with n ational sc ope: Medc o Health Solutions, Inc. (Medco) (former ly Merck- Medco), Express Scripts, Inc., and Caremark, Inc..73 Some PBMs are owned by Walg Many large insurers such as 72 Richa rdso n 6/2 6 at 2 1-22 . 73 The Commission ann ounced that it had closed its ant itrust investi gation int o Caremark R x, Inc.'s proposed acqui sition of Advance PCS on February 1 1, 20 04 w ithout tak ing any fur ther ac tion. See Statement, Federal Trade Comm 'n, Caremark Rx, Inc./A dvance P CS (Feb in-hou se PBM functions. In addition, there are many smaller, privately- held PBMs. The relative size and ranking of these companies varies according to the measure used, such a s annual pr escripti on expendit ures, prescr iptions pe r year, or covere d lives.74 Each measure has its own shortcomings. Overall, however, the market share f igures present an industry in whic h three national PBMs are major play ers; a large share, anywher e from one-third to one-half, includes health plans and retail pharmacy chains offering PBM services; and loc al and regional PBMs have a significa nt presence.75 E. Competition Be tween PBMs: The Bidding Proc ess Group he alth plan sponsors g eneral ly procure PBM services through a bidding process. They typically issue requests for proposal s to sever al PBMs a nd then ev aluate the pr oposa ls bas ed on c osts and th e packa ge of services offered by each bidder. Plan sponsors, or their c onsultant s, conduc t these bid proce sses. Smal ler emplo yers hea lth plans with limited g eogra phic scop e likely will have many choices among PB Ms, because smaller a nd more r egiona lly oriented PBMs can meet their needs. L arger employers or he alth plans often turn to the large st PBMs be cause of their expe rience in serving large clients and their na tionwide network of pharmacies, although sever al health plans and retail pharmacy chains offerin g PBM se rvices a lso could m eet their needs.PBMs appear to compete on price and non-price dimensions. One survey of plan sponsors using PBM services showed the financial terms of the bid (such as the reimburs ement ra te and dis pensing fee pai d to pharmacies, the rebates paid to plan sponsors based on formulary drugs utilized, mail orde r pricing , and admi nistrativ e fees) often were the key determinants in the selection of the winning bid.76 This study also found that plan sponsors were concerned about non-price dimensions of service, such as plan design, the extent of the retail network, and mail order componen ts. Each t erm or fe ature is balanced against each other and is driven by the needs of the plan sponsor. For example, some want to maximize generic substitution, whereas others want to maximize rebates from manu factur ers.77 F. Benefits o f PBMs: The Evidence to Date The General Accounting Off ice released a study in January 2003 that examined the effects of PBMs on the Feder al Employ ees Hea lth Bene fits Progra m, enrolle es, and p harmac ies.78 The report c onsidere d the pre scription benefit s programs offered within three he alth plans available to federal governme nt employees. These three plans covered about 4.5 million 74 Rich ardson 6/26 at 11. 75 Id. at 13 . 76 See PRICEWATERHOUSE COOPERS LLP, HEAL TH CARE FINANCING ADMI NISTR ATION, STUDY OF PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFI T at http://www.cms.gov/resea rchers/repo rts/ 2001/cm s.pdf. 77 Boudre 6 5; see also Barrueta 6/26 at 105. 78 See GAO, supra note 57.16lives. The large st of these plans, B CBS, held cont racts wi th two PBMs : Advance PCS, which h andled th eir reta il network ; and Medc o, which s upplied th eir mail order pharmacy benefits. Another plan, GEHA, contracted solely with Medco. The third plan, PacifiCare, used a PBM called Prescription Solutions, which is a subsidiary of PacifiCare, which also sells independent PBM serv ices. Table 1: Di scounts Re lative Generic DrugsBran d-Name Pharmacy47% 18% PBM's Ma il Order Pharmacy53% 27% The study compare d prices that three types of cus tomers pa id for 14 b rand nam e drugs and four gener ic drugs: (1) cash- paying cust omers, wh o buy at retai l pharmacies; (2) health plan sponsors and their en rollees, who buy at retai l pharma cies; and (3) health plan sponsors and their enrollees, who buy from a PBM's mail order facility. Table 1 shows the results of the study . The stud y found that t he lowes t average prices for 30-day supplies wer e obtained when the drug was purchase d through the PBM's mail order pharmacy.79 For ge neric dr ugs pur chased t hrough a retail pharmacy , enrollees in health plans paid an average 47 perce nt less than cash customers. G. Issues Fac ing the PBM Ind ustry 1. Transparency Panelists discussed the significance of reba te transp arency in the PBM market, including whether a PBM should be required to disclose to plan sponsors the rebates that pharmaceutical manufacturers pa y PBMs for meeting certain market share ta rgets. One panelist stated that armed with information about rebate s, plan spo nsors can enc ourage PBMs to compete more aggre ssively so that the plan s ponsor ob tains lowe r price s.80 By contrast, other panelists suggested that rebate trans parenc y can be han dled t hrough private contracts, because there is no ba rrier to a plan sponsor negotiating an arra ngement providing it with ac cess to th e PBMs' r ebate information.81 Another panelist suggested that many plan sponsors have placed a greater emphasis on pay ing lower administrative fees as a trade-off for allowing PBMs to keep pharmaceutical 79 Similar relative cost saving for PBM clients ha ve also been doc ume nted. See Cindy Parks Thoma s et al., Impact of Healt h Plan Desi gn And Management On Retirees' Pre scription D rug U se And Spending 2001 , 2002 HEAL TH AFFAI RS (Web Exclusive) addi tion t o price, plan sponsors may be concerned about other PBM services such as ne twor k avai lability or acc ess to a wide variety o f drug p roducts. As S ection D, supra reflects , the current structur e of the PBM industry does no t suggest the potential for a PB M to exercise monopsony power over phar maceuti cal man ufacture rs. 81 6/26 at 99 ; Balto 6/26 at 99 . also Hewitt Asso ciation s, LLC , Hew itt's 2004 F uture 22, 200 4).17manufac turer re bates.82 Vigorous competition in the marketp lace fo r PBMs is mo re likely to arrive at an optimal level of transparency than regulation of those terms. Vigorous competiti on is also mo re likely to help ensure that gains from cost savings ar e passed on to consumers of health care service s, either as lower premiums f or healt h insurance, lower out-of-pocket costs (for that portion of health care expenditures borne direct ly by consume rs thr ough deductibles and co-pay ments), or improved services. Negotiated limitations on transparency are unlikely to be so se vere that health plan sponsors cannot assess the price and quality of the ser vices they ar e receiving. Just as competitive forces encourage PBMs to offer the ir best price and service combination to health plan sponsors to gain access to subscribers, competition also encourages disclosure of the informat ion healt h plan spon sors req uire to decide on the PBM with which to contract. 2. Regulatio n and Litigat ion The Amer ican Fe deratio n of State County & Municipal Employ ees filed a lawsuit in 2003 alle ging th at the lar gest PBMs have engaged in unf air and deceptive practices under California state law.83 The complain t alleg es that PB Ms enga ge in various f orms of c onduct de signed t oincrease their profits, instead of benefitting employ ers and c onsumers . The ca se is curren tly pendi ng. In April 2004, the United States along with 20 states announced a settlement of claims for injun ctive re lief and state unfair trade practices ag ainst Medco.84 The United States and the states alleged that Medco encouraged phy sicians to switch patients to different prescription drugs that earned Medco higher re bates from pharmaceutical manufacturers, but that Medco fa iled to pa ss on these savings to patients o r their he alth plan sponsors. Both the United States and the states alleged that the drug switches resulted in incre ased cos ts to health plans and patients, primaril y in follow-up doctor visits and tests. Medco claims, however, that its plans and services saved money f or patients and health plans. The consent order requires Medco to pay $29 million to states for damages, fees, and restitutio n. Other federa l alleg ations, however , were n ot settled , and that case wil l continue. Two states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation regulating PBM practice s, and other states are considering such leg islation.85 Maine's 82 Barrue ta 6/ 26 at 105. 83 CME v.

Integrated Mail Order Pharmac ies As noted above, mail order has grown in importance and, for maintenanc e medications, can be an efficient and low- cost distribution channel. A recent study funded by the r etail pharmacy industry identifie s possible actions th at PBMs c ould employ to inflate their re venues.87 The two main actions alleged include: steering enrollees to higher priced products on which the PBM earns larger re bates, regardless of the over all cost of the drug to the hea lth plan; and artificially infla ting AWP on prescr iptions fil led by a PBM-ow ned mail order pharmacy through the use of re-labeled drugs. The auth ors ref er to both of these practices collectively as PBM self-dealing. Though n o direct evidenc e of self -dealin g is given, the paper assumes that self-dea ling could result in higher profits for PBMs and higher costs for plan sponsors. Congress has required the Commission to study t hese allegations. In particular, Section 110 of the MMA requiresthe Commission to conduct a \"Conflict of Interest Stud y\" that in clude s the f ollowing: 1. An assessment of the differences in costs incurred by suc h enrollees and pl ans fo r presc ription dru gs dispensed by mail-orde r pharmacies owned by PBMs comp ared to m ail- order pharmacies not owned by PBMs and c ommunity pharmac ies. 2. Whether such group health plans are acting in a manner that maximizes co mpetition a nd result s in lower prescription drug prices for enrolle es. The statute requires the Commission to make any ne cessary recommendations concer ning the se alleg ations an d to repor t its findings in a study by June 2005. The Commission e xpects tha t the resu lts of this study will infor m the deba te about t he role of PBMs in the industry. V. DIRECT TO CO NSUMER ADVERTISING The impact of direct to consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drug s on demand for, and the prices of, prescr iption drug pr ices has gener ated con siderab le debate.

A. The Effe cts of DT C Advertisi ng Panel ists at the healt h care h earings agreed that advertising incr eases consumerand physician aw areness of the potential benefit s of phar maceutic als and he lps close the information gaps among pharmac eutical manufac turers, doctors, and cons umers.91 Panelists also presented evidence that shows some patients have been prompted by DTC adverti sing to ta lk to a doc tor about a condition that they had not discussed previously.92 One panelist stated that DTC adverti sing ca n increa se complia nce with pharmac eutical u sage r egimes and can assist in educa ting pat ients and health professionals about the risks, diagnosis, and treatment of a particular medical condition.93 The DTC Commen ts noted tha t a number of major survey s have been conducted to assess the effect of DTC adverti sing on c onsumer a ttitudes, experiences, and behavior. The ge neral consensu s from the se and oth er surve ys is that DTC advertising provides consumers with useful information, stimulates productive discussions between doctors and patients, and encourages consumers to lea rn more about previously undiag nosed condition s.94 Physician attitudes toward DTC89 See, e.g., E.

An FDA survey reported that 40 percent of the phy sicians surveyed f elt that DTC advertising had a positive e ffect o n their pa tients and their practices, 30 percent felt it had a neg ative effec t, and 30 p ercent felt it ha d no effe ct.95 Another recent survey found tha t the most frequent complaints voiced by physicians were that DTC advertising did not provide informat ion in a ba lanced m anner, a nd that it encouraged patients to seek trea tments they did not need (approximately 80 perc ent). On the other hand, the same survey found that more than 70 percent of phy sicians felt that DTC adve rtising h elped ed ucate pa tients about available treatments and 67 percent felt that it helped them have better discussio ns with the ir patien ts.96 The panelists turers a dvertise brand-n ame drug s to incre ase sale s, to complement physician deta iling and promotion, and to extend the blockbuster nature of the drug advertised.97 They notedthat there were no DTC advertisements for presc ription dr ug prod ucts, bec ause these products rapidly gain market share by virtue of their lower prices and state laws requirin g phar macists to employ gener ic substitution.98 There remains debate reg arding the impact of DTC advertising on the price and quantity sold of prescription drug s, in part due to the difficulties inherent in estimating the empirical effects. Some panelists, for example, suggested it was difficult to draw conclusions about DTC on drug utilization alone because of other force s such as increased insurance covera ge of drugs, an increase in FDA approval of drug s, an increa se in the d iagnosi s of many chronic conditions, and an increase in phy sician detailing and the f ree sam ples prov ided to physicians.99 In their survey of the research literature, Commission staff noted that empirical evidence on the effects of D TC adverti sing on sa les is mixed, with some studies sh owing a positive e ffect, while others do not.

O ther mea ns of cost control a ppear to be more e ffectiv e and pos e less significant competitive concerns. The Report analyzes ea ch of these points in turn below. A. Rationale Behind CON Programs CON programs had the major goal of controlling costs by r estricting provider capital e xpenditure s.9 The forces of competition ordinarily limit excess supply, but, according to a panelist representing the American Health Planning Association, \"[c]ompetition in health care is ... very differe nt\" than i n other ma rkets.10 Congre ss appears to have shared this view in 1974; the passage of the Health Planning Ac t reflected a congressional belief that market fa ilure plague d the hea lth care market, resulting in\"excess supply and nee dless duplication of some services.\"11 The system of cost-ba sed reimbursement may ha ve driven the problem that Congress sought to solve.12 When many CON programs were established, gover nment or p rivate in surance paid hea lth care e xpenses \"o n a retr ospectiv e cost reimbursement basis.\"13 This, cou pled with the general concern tha t patients would not be suffi ciently price se nsitive an d would demand th e perce ived hig hest qual ity services, led to the fear that health car e provider s would expa nd their s ervice s - sometimes to the point of offering unnece ssarily duplicat ive serv ices - be cause they la rgely on only non-price ground s.14 Although cost-based reimbursement is much less common today, some contend that CON programs still have a role to play in the health care marketplace. I ndeed, one panelist a rgued that in he alth car e marke ts, \"providers control the supply of services. Medical practitioners direct the flow of patients and therefore the demand for9 See Piper 6/ 10 at 53; Morris ey 6/ 10 at 146 (noting that CON programs \"were established in the '70s to help c ontro l health ca re co sts\").

The Com mission has als o noted the4regime s preven t new hea lth care entrant s from competing without a state-issued certifi cate of need, wh ich is ofte n difficu lt to obtain. This process has the effect of shielding incumbent health care providers from new entrants. As a result, CON programs may actually incre ase health care costs, as supply is depressed be low competiti ve level s.23 Moreover, CON programs can r etard entry of fir ms that could provide higher quality service s than the incumben ts.24 By protect ing incu mbents, CO N progr ams likewise can \"delay [] the introduction and accept ance of innovativ e altern atives to costly CON programs' \"[c]urtailing [of] services or facilitie s may force s ome consu mers to resort to more expe nsive or l ess-des irable substitute s, thus inc reasing costs for patients or third- party payers. Fo r example, if nursing home beds are not available, the discharge of patients from more expensive hospital b eds may be delay ed or pat ients may be for ced to use nursing homes far fromhome.\"26 Empirical studies indicate that CON programs genera lly fail to control costs and can act ually lead to in crease d prices .27 Supporting this conc lusion, som e paneli sts offered examples of the anticompetitive effects of CON programs. One panelist, for example, n oted that CON prog rams \"artificially limit[]\" access to canc er treatment, technolo gies out [consum ers'] re ach\" in favor of \"old technologies.\"28 He stated that his practice's application to a state for a certificate of need to introduce improved cancer radiation technology faced opposition in June 2002 from all of the state's operators of existing radiation therapy equipment. One yea r later, at the time of his testimony in the Hea rings, h e noted th at the sta te still had not approved the CON application.29 By contrast, in a bordering state without a CON program, his practice was able to introduc e new cancer-fighting technologies rapidly.30 Another panelist s tated tha t incumbe nt home health service providers in her state have, f or 23 years, suc cessfully opposed the CON application of her nursing service, there by barring its entry and \"keep[ing] the oligopoly in place .\"31 The incumbents, she impa ct of C ON program s on en try and firm beha vior.

CON and Cost Control Several panelists and commentators stated tha t CON prog rams ge nerally fail to control c osts.37 Inde ed, one p anelistsurveyed the empirical literature on the economic effects of CON progr ams and conclude d that the \"litera ture ten ds to conclude ... that CON has been ineffective in controlling hospital costs,\" and that, to the contrary , \"[i]t may have raised costs and restricted entry .\"38 Commentators stated that the rea son that CO N has bee n ineffe ctive in controlling costs is that the programs do not put a stop to \"supposedly unnece ssary expenditures\" but \"merely redirect[] any such expenditures into other areas.\"39 Thus, a CON rule that restricts capital investment in new beds does nothing to prevent 32 Id. at 105. 33 Id. at 106 . 34 Id. at 102, 104 (reporti ng that she has spoken to \"young peo ple wh o hav e bee n lying in their own waste for three days wi th no one to come take care o f them\" ). 35 Rex- 93-94 (st ating that \"CON is a fai lure a s a cost contai nment t ool\" and th at the pre mium s in Ka nsas an d Missouri a re gen erally the same, in spite of the fact that one state has a CON program and th e othe r does no t); And erson , supra note 2, at 2-6 (summarizing empiri cal evidence and finding th at CO N fails to regula te costs) ; Kind t, supra note 6, at 3-5 (summarizing empiri cal studies on the economic effects of CON pro grams and concluding that \"[t ]here is near uni versal agreement among the authors [of studies on the economic effects of CON programs] an d other hea lth economist s that CON has been unsuccessful i n containing healt h care costs\"); DANIEL SHERMAN , FEDERA L TRADE COMM 'N, THE EFFECT OF STATE CERTI FICATE -OF-NEED LAWS ON HOSPITAL COSTS : AN ECONOMIC POLICY ANALYSIS(1988) (concluding, after emp irical study of CON progra ms' effects on hos pital costs using 1983- 84 data, t hat st rong CON programs do not lead t o lower costs b ut may a ctually incr ease TRADE COMM 82 (1987) ical study ng that CON and s); K FEDERA L TRADE COMM 'N, CERT IFICAT E OF NEED REGULATION OF ENTRY I NTO HOME HEALTH CARE: A MULTI -PRODUCT COST FUNCTI ON ANALYSIS (1986) ( economi c study f inding that CON regula tion led to higher c osts, and that CO N re gulation did little to further economies of scale); cf.

The Agencies believe that CON programs are ge nerally not success ful in con taining health c are cos ts and that they ca n pose anticompetitive risks. As noted a bove, CON progra ms risk entrenching oligopolists and eroding consumer welfare. The aim of controlling costs is laudable, but there appear to be other, more effective means of ac hieving this goal that do not pose anticompetitive risks. A si milar ana lysis applies to the use of CON programs to enhance hea lth carequality and acc ess. For these reasons, the Agenc ies urg e states w ith CON pro grams t o reconsider whether they are best serving their citizens' health care needs by allowing these programs to continue. II. STATE ACTION AND NOERR DOCTRINES The state action and Noerr- Pennington doctrines curb competition law in order to promote important values, such as federalism and the right to petition the gover nment for redres s of gri evance s.43 Inappropriately broad interpretations of these doc trines, h owever , can ch ill or limit competiti on in heal th care markets.44 Industry repres entative s, as well as lega l, economic, and academic experts on the healt h care i ndust ry, spoke at the Hearin gs on a panel discussing Competition Law and Noerr Pennington/State Action issues on June 11.45 A. State Actio n Doctrine The state action doctrine precludes federal antitrust scrutiny of certain state (and state authorized) conduct.

When providers substantially control a reg ulatory commission or licensing board, there are good re asons to r equire s atisfac tion of bot h the clear articulation and active supervision requirements of the state action doctrine.51 The Agencies have long opposed improper extensions of the state action doctrine. Unfortunately , some courts have broadly interpre ted \"ac tive supe rvision\" require ments in Parker v. Brow n, 317 U. S. 341, 350-51 (1943). 47 See, e .g., Town of Hallie v.

One panelist explici tly supported the FTC's co mpe tition ad vocacy on this issue. 9Likewise, the Commission r ecently issued a report on competition in the market for onlin e contac t lens sale s.59 The report recommends that states considering regulating the sellers of re placement lenses assess th e compet itive eff ects of th eir actions. Specifically, it ca utions that \"requir ing a pr ofession al licens e to sell replacement contact lenses over the I nternet is likely to raise prices a nd/or reduce convenience to consumers without substantia lly increas ing hea lth protections.\"60 The report noted that \"consumers can often achieve significant saving s by purchasing replacement lenses f rom sellers other than their ey e care providers,\" including from onlin e vendor s.61 The report recognized, however, that patients could hurt their eyes by getting and wearing replac ement co ntact len ses withou t a valid prescr iption, an d that re quiring patients t o have va lid presc riptions f or their replacement lenses induces them to get regula r eye exams.62 Imposi ng a prescription requirement for contact lens sellers, the report noted, thus may makesense.63 The crit ical polic y question is whether additional state regulation - particularly r egulation requiring contact lens sellers to have a state professional license, such as a n opticia n's licen se - is like ly to hurt, or hel p, con sumer welfar e. Alt hough such a licensing requirement may afford some consumer benefits, those benefits may be available through other, less restrictive means, and the extra regulation may \"induce Internet sellers to char ge higher prices or exit the market entirely, harming consumers.\"64 Inde ed, the r esulting increa se in price or curtailed convenience in orde ring replac ement len ses migh t lead some to \"over-wear their lenses or for go replacement lenses altogether.\"65 For these reasons, the report u rged st ate dec ision-mak ers to caref ully tailor the ir reg ulatory efforts in this area to promoting consumer welfar e, without enacting unnecessary licensing require ments that could dri ve low-c ost Internet sell ers fro m the mark et.66 The Agencies have extensive experien ce with th e state a ction doc trine in health care cases.

Noerr-P ennington Doc trine The First Amendment protects the right to petition th e gove rnment fo r redre ss of grievances. I nformed by that Amendment, the Noerr doctrine immunizes petitioning from scrutiny unde r the Sherman Act, eve n when suc h petitioni ng is don e \"to restrain competition or gain advantag e over competitors.\"70 By shielding individua ls' rights to petition th e gove rnment fo r redre ss of grievances, Noerr acts as an \"important limitation on the antitrust laws.\"71Some courts have read this doctrine too broadly. One important limitation on the Noerr doctrine relates to the definition of \"petitioning the government.\" The Noerr doctrine does not cover every communication to the government. Rather, Noerr properly shields conduc t directed toward obtaining discretionary governmental action. The Commission has urged this point in a case involving health c are. As amicus curiae in In re Buspirone , the Commission successfully pe rsuaded the court that a drug manufacturer's listing of a patent in the Food an d Drug A dmin istration 's \"Ora nge Book\" involves no discretionary government decision or action for which a drug manufacturer \"petitions,\" and thus does not enjoy Noerr protection.72 In that case, Bristol- Myers Squibb ( BMS) had allege dly forecl osed c ompet ition on on e of it s drugs by improperly submitting patents for listing in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Orange B ook.

The FDA, in turn, lists the provided data in the Orange Book in a manner that is purely ministerial. The court thus found that Orange Book listings are a s ministerial as tariff filings, which have routinely been he ld to fall outside the scope of Noerr immunity.76 Likewise, in the Commission's independent action against BMS, the Commission alleged inter alia that BMS \"abus[ed ] FDA reg ulations to block g eneric entry ; ma[de] fa lse state ments to the FDA in conne ction with listing pat ents i n the O range Book; engag[ed] in inequitable conduct before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Off ice to obtain patents; and fil[ed] baseless patent infringement suits.\"77 The Commission stated that BMS's conduct fell outside thescope of Noerr . Among other reasons for this conclusion, the Commission noted that \"just as th e repea ted filing of lawsui ts brought without regard to the merits, and for the purpose of using the judicial process (as opposed to the outcome of the process), warrants rejection of Noerr immunity, so too do the alleged repeated filing of patents on the Oran ge Boo k without r egard to their validity, enforceability, or listability; repeat ed filing of reck lessly rnment a gencie s; and filing of lawsuits brought with or without regard to the merits, also cause the actions challenged here to fall outside the scope of Noerr 's protection.\"78 Conclusion . The state action and Noerr doctrine s play important roles in promoting such values as federalism and the right to petition th e gove rnment fo r redre ss of grievances. Taken too fa r, these doctrines can impede efforts to maintain vigorous competition in the health care field. The Agenc ies will co ntinue to a dvocate in all appropriate venues for interpretations of these doctrines that are consistent with the principles that justify the doctrines in the first place. III.

A. Consumer Information Long-term ca re facilities make varying deg rees of informat ion avail able to consumer s. Marke ting mate rials, co ntracts, websites and publications, tours of care facilitie s, and co mmunicati ons with residents and families are the principalmeans for disclosure of information.83 Information r egard ing nurs ing home s is also available from public sources, including state an d feder al age ncies.84 Althoug h these sources provide a considerable volume of informat ion to cons umers of nursing home care, panelists stated that much work remains to develop \"way s to collect and present accurate, meaning ful information that consumers can use.\"85 One pane list observe d that less informat ion is ava ilable regarding assisted living fa cilities, and expressed concern about the reliability of the information that is disclosed.86 Panelists n oted that it is diffic ult to provide consumer information regarding quality of long- term care because of difficulties defining and measuring \"quality.\"87 One panelist noted that 79 Com plete lists of participants on these and other pan els ar e avail able infra Append ix A and in the A gend SERVI CES, HIGH SERVI CE OR HIGH PRIVACY ASSISTE D LIVING FACIL ITIES, THEIR RESIDENT S AND STAFF : RESULTS FROM A NATIO NAL SURVE Y 1 (2000) [herei nafter HHS, ASSISTE D LIVING http://asp e.hhs.go v/daltc p/rep orts/hsh pes.h tm. 81 Thayer 6 /11 at 14 1.

Competition in the Market for Long-Ter m Care There a re a numb er of impe diments to competition in the market for long-term care.100 Many consumers a re too sick, lack the time, o r have in sufficie nt informa tion to shop around for nursing home care.101 Consumers interested in assisted living facilitie s are le ss subjec t to these impedimen ts, but less informat ion is available for them to use. Medicare and Medicaid are dominant purchasers in the nursing home market; Medicaid covers more than two-thirds of residents and Medicare covers a n addition al 10 per cent.102 Medicai d plays a very sm all role and Medicare plays no role in the market for assisted living facilitie s.103 One panelist complained thatMedicare and Medicaid pay ment levels are so low that nursing homes disc riminate against program benef iciaries when deciding who to adm it.104 Panelists and commentators have complained that CON restricts entry a nd protects incumbent providers. 105 The Agencies applaud the disclosure of information to consumers in the market for long-term care. The A gencies urge states with CON programs involving long-term care facilities to reconsider whether they are best serving their citizens' health care nee ds by allowing the se programs to continue.106 IV.

A. International Perspectives on Competition and Health Care In countries throughout the w orld, people regard health ca re as \"special.\"111 This perception has led many to argue that health care should not be subject to standard antitrust principles, or that specialexemptions should be created.112 One panelist o bserved that many in the hea lth care field are more conc erned with why competition laws are applied to health care, and not with how such laws should be applied.113 More ge nerally , competi tion is often viewed as irrelevant or even destructive to health care quality.114 Efforts by antitrust ag encies to bridge this gap have focused on education and outreach, but such efforts have pro ven diff icult.115 Antitrust agencies need to eng age in ongoing competiti on advoc acy to meet thi s challenge.116 B. Concentrat ion of Heal th Care Markets Health care markets worldwide are becoming increasingly concentrated.117 Concentration can result in cost efficiencies and economies of scale, but more concen trated ma rkets pos e grea ter risks to PERFORMI NG HEAL TH SYSTEMS (2004). 108 Com plete lists of participants on these and other pan els ar e avail able infra Append ix A and in the A 9/ 30 at 87.

An effective remedy must resolve the anticompetitive harm, restore competition, and prevent future anticompetitive conduct.124 Optimal enforcement must steer ence. O ver-de terren ce may occur if conduct that is not, in fact, anticompetitive is challenged, or if excessive sanctions are imposed on anticomp etitive c onduct.125 118 M. Jaco bs 9/3 0 at 8 2.

Industry representatives, as well as legal, economic, and acade mic experts on the health care industry , spoke at the Hearings on a panel discussing Competition Law and Remedies: Civil/Criminal on October 1.128 Panelists disagreed on whether the Agencies are over- deterring or under- deterring anticompetitive conduct in the health care marketplace.129A. Civil Antitrust Remedies Civil reme dies come in two basi c types (structura l and conduct) and are applied to two types of ca ses (merger and non-mer ger). Enforce ment offi cials must asses s whet her th e remed y should change the structure of the industry , regulate the conduct of the affected firms, or do both.130 Structural remedies, which require the divestiture of some assets to preserve competition, are more common in merger cases.131 There is typica lly little need for post-divestiture oversight because the divestitur e gene rally restore s competit ion to the pre- merge r level.132 Because conduct remedies can be difficult to formulate, require ongoing oversig ht, and may be difficult to modify in response to cha nged circumst ances, t hey are use d less fre quently in merg er case s.133 The Agencies rarely seek dissolution. Use of Di sgorgement (Public Comme nt) (noti ng concern w ith dup licative liab ilities and re coveries). 126 See, e .g., Pfizer, Inc. v. Gover nment of India, 434 U.

One panelist stated that disgorgement will be difficul t to obtain b ecause financi al harm to consumers often cannot be quantified.145 Another panelist believed disgorgeme nt should be employed more f requently to deter anticomp etitive c onduct.146 One panelist and commentators stated that the frequency of alleged phy sician price fixing cases indicates that physicians are insufficiently deter red by existing r emedies .147 Another panelist observe d, howeve r, that the Commission is unlikely to seek disgor gement unless therewas a clear violation of the law that was \"on all fours with existing precedent.\"148 The Agencies will carefully consider whether disgorgement is appropriate in all future cases. Remedies may also have significant consequences in other markets. Commentators have found that the announcement of a Commission enforcement action against an a dvertiser has a significant impact on the advertiser's share price.149 Being the target of a n enforcement action is unlikely to enhance a provider's reputation.150 B. Criminal Antitru st Remedies Some antitrust violations can give rise to criminal sanctions. As noted previously, the Division has exclusive jurisdiction over enforcement of federa l criminal antitrust statutes. There have been only a few c riminal he alth car e antitru st cases.151 One that enforc ement is in appropr iate because phy sicians do not understand the antitrust laws, an d do not inte nd to viola te143 FTC, Monetary Equitable Remedies , supra note 142. The three factors are that: (1) the under lying viol ation must be cl ear; (2) t here must be a reas onable basi s for cal culating the amoun t of remedial payment; and (3) the value of seeking disgorge ment wi ll be c onsidered i n light of other reme dies av ailable in the ma tter, includ ing priv ate action s and crimina l proc eedings.

Conclusion . Remedies are a critical issue in implementing an effective competition policy. I f remedies are inadequa te, they will not ha ve a cre dible deterrent effect. I f remedies are excessive, they will over-de ter, and discourage conduct that is ac tually permissib le. Bala ncing th ese considerations is a difficult task. The Ag encies v iew all anticomp etitive c onduct as serious, and will seek appropriate sanctions in light of the considerations outlined previously. In general, much more stringe nt measures are necessary against those who violate the antitrust laws repeatedly or flagrantly and those who facilitate anticompetitive conduct by m ultiple pa rties. Th e Division will also pursue c riminal sa nctions in d/or lution be sought in appropriate cases. 152 Bieri g 10/1 a t 68. 153 Grady 10/ 1 at 54- APPENDIX HEARINGS PARTICIPANTS PARTICIPANTS 9-10, 2002 Primary Source: http://www. ftc.gov/ogc/ healthcare/agenda.htm.
