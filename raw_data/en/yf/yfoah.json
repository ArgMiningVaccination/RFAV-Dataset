Our mission is to connect them back to you. We mean to heal with natural therapies, and empower everyone to take control of their own well-being with our healing arts centers, skincare and body products, remedies, and rituals. We take a holistic approach to beauty, and connect it to our health, our community, and the earth. our story At Naturopathica, our roots are as authentic as our ingredients. We were founded in 1995 by Barbara Close, a trained esthetician, massage therapist, aromatherapist and herbalist with a master's degree in plant medicine. Barbara had long known the healing power of nature, and after searching for \"clean\" skincare products before they even existed, she resolved to create them herself in a modern herbal apothecary. As Naturopathica went from a small healing arts studio to a leader in botanical healing, it pioneered \"clean beauty\" practices that were common sense to Barbara: a holistic approach to skin health, where skin is a reflection of all that happens inside the body. Using her expertise as an herbalist and esthetician, Barbara crafted high-performance products made with a hybrid of natural ingredients and clean cosmeceuticals. Instead of fighting against nature, Barbara designed products to work with the skin to deliver visible, lasting results. NATUROPATHICA represents a place, a practice, and a way of being that's available to all. The name is derived from naturopathic medicine, a healing tradition that connects the body's internal activity with outer forces like nature, diet, and movement. Its principles are as follows: OUR PROMISE TO THE PLANET Our products use safe and sustainable formulas that support skin's natural function.
