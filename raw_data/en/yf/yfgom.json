We tend to take medications that have proven to be very effective when it comes to alleviating the symptoms swiftly, i.e., allopathic treatment, but hardly ever consider what elements they are made of and if they are good for our health in the long run. While it is true that allopathic medicines provide immediate relief, they also produce harmful side effects in our body. Therefore, Ayurvedic Doctors in Pune have been suggesting a shift from allopathic medicines to [ayurvedic treatment](http://www.keralaayurvedpune.com/) as they are made of organic elements and tend to have minimal side effects on our body. Ayurveda is a holistic science which provides not only preventive but also curative treatment to all diseases where the objective is to discover the origin of the illness and eliminate it completely as compared to allopathy, where the medications give a patient prompt respite by abolishing the organisms that caused the disease but it is not certain if the disease is completely cured. It has been observed that common painkillers can cause severe ulceration in the stomach, produce excess acids and lead to a severe form of gastritis. The most prevalent allopathic medication, paracetamol is said to have serious side effects on the liver and is recommended not to be used when you are suffering from fever. Asthamatic medications also cause throat irritations, upper respiratory tract infections, and headaches. Since the Allopathic medications are synthetically prepared. They might pacify one disease but tend to increase the occurrence of other diseases. Ayurvedic Hospital in Pune like [Kerala Ayurveda](http://www.keralaayurvedpune.com/) recommends the usage of ayurvedic medicines as they not just focus on effectively treating the disease but also permanently healing the person. The focus in Ayurveda Treatment is on the originating cause to cure the affected area and related systems of the body. Ayurveda is connected with cures which are accessible from the nature making it one of the most eco-accommodating approach to get improve the overall health of a person. Ayurveda believes that when there is balance in the three elemental energies, Vayu (air+space=\"wind\"), pitta (fire+water-\"bile\") and Kapha (water+Earth=\"phlegm\"), or when they exist in equal proportions, the body will remain healthy and if the balance is upset, the body will become unhealthy. One of the most common myths that people have about Ayurveda is that it takes longer than the allopathic medication to relieve pain or cure a disease, making the latter as the ideal choice for healing. But the truth is that time taken to cure a disease in Ayurveda depends on how much imbalance the patient is carrying and from how long. Considering the fact that until a body has the disease-causing factors, diseases will keep hitting, again and again, Ayurveda works on the principle of detoxification of the body as a primary part of the treatment.
