The study is being conducted by the U.S. Military HIV Research Program (MHRP) through its clinical research network in the US, East Africa and Thailand. This clinical trial was designed to test a unique prime-boost preventive HIV vaccination strategy aimed at global coverage. The prime is a plasmid DNA vaccine, PENNVAX-G, and the boost is a virus vector vaccine, Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Chiang Mai Double Recombinant (MVA-CMDR). Together, the vaccines are designed to deliver a diverse mixture of antigens for HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D and E. Colonel Nelson Michael, Director of MHRP and the Division of Retrovirology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, said: \"We are very excited about the launch of this important clinical trial exploring the role of newer prime-boost HIV vaccine approaches building on the success of the RV 144 Thai prime-boost trial. The role of electroporation as a method of delivery of the priming DNA vaccine will be an especially critical factor to assess in this initial phase I safety and immunogenicity trial.\" Dr. J. Joseph Kim, President and CEO of Inovio, said: \"We are pleased that our PENNVAXTM-G DNA vaccine candidate was selected as an integral component of this novel approach to HIV prevention. Given the recently announced exceptional immune responses generated by another Inovio DNA vaccine candidate delivered using our proprietary electroporation technology, we are optimistic that we can achieve new advancements against HIV as well.\" Dr. Mary Marovich, Chief of the Department of Vaccine Research and Development at MHRP and the Protocol Chair for the study, said: \"We hypothesize that this vaccine regimen, which has subtype-mismatched inserts, will facilitate the emergence of subdominant epitopes and increase the overall breadth of the immune response.\" Taken separately, DNA based and MVA based strategies have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in pre-clinical and clinical trials. Researchers hope they can enhance immune responses by using this prime-boost strategy. Another distinguishing feature of this study is the use of different HIV antigens during the priming (A,B,C,D) and boosting (A/E), which is being studied as a means to increase the breadth of the immune response. The DNA vaccine was designed in Prof. David B. Weiner's laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania and licensed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals for further clinical product development. The boost vaccine component, based on Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), is a modified version of the smallpox vaccine that has been used safely and effectively to eradicate that disease worldwide. Researchers at MHRP and NIAID developed the boost. Historically, DNA vaccine potency has been constrained by the inability to deliver enough DNA into cells, which express the antigens coded by the DNA. To address this, researchers will also test two intramuscular delivery methods for the DNA prime (PENNVAXTM-G) to compare their effects on immune response. The two products that will be tested in this study are the Biojector\u00ae 2000 and the CELLECTRA\u00ae EP (electroporation) device. The Biojector\u00ae is a needle-free injection system that has FDA clearance for delivering vaccines and other injected medications. The CELLECTRA\u00ae EP system is an intramuscular electroporation device currently being evaluated in clinical trials as an alternative vaccine delivery system to increase immune responses above those elicited by standard needle and syringe injections. Electroporation involves the application of controlled, millisecond electrical pulses to cells to enhance their uptake of the vaccine. Once the vaccine combination has been assessed as safe and acceptable in twelve HIV-uninfected participants in the U.S., the study will begin at four MHRP sites: Kericho, Kenya; Kampala, Uganda; Mbeya, Tanzania; and Bangkok, Thailand. Twenty healthy, HIV-uninfected participants will be enrolled at each of these sites for a total of 80 international participants. This clinical trial is a collaboration that includes Bioject Medical Technologies Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, NIAID and the U.S. Army/MHRP. About Inovio's optimized DNA vaccine. Using a synthetically derived consensus of env and gag antigens of HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, this novel vaccine aims to provide broader protection against the constantly emerging new strains of this challenging disease. Inovio's electroporation systems have been shown to increase cellular uptake of a vaccine by a 1000 times or more and have been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in multiple human studies. An Inovio SynConDNA vaccine (against cervical cancer), delivered using the CELLECTRA\u00ae EP device, recently achieved significant antibody and T-cell immune responses, which are both thought to be important in controlling HIV infection and transmission. About MHRP The U.S Military HIV Research Program (MHRP)\u2014centered at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and part of the US Medical Research and Materiel Command\u2014conducts research to develop an effective HIV vaccine and integrates prevention, treatment, diagnosis and monitoring as part of an international effort to protect troops and reduce the risk of HIV infection worldwide. MHRP has developed five state-of-the-art international research sites in the U.S., Africa and Asia. The program collaborates on HIV prevention care and treatment services, funded by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), with African militaries and in the communities where it conducts research. In 2009, MHRP announced results of an Army-sponsored clinical trial in Thailand that demonstrated for the first time a modest ability to protect against HIV infection, reducing the number of infections by 31.2 percent. MHRP researchers are now working with scientists around the world, with the support of NIAID, to dissect the trial results to inform basic research and design future clinical trials to translate this scientific milestone into a deployable vaccine.

Inovio is developing a new generation of vaccines, called DNA vaccines, to treat and prevent cancers and infectious diseases. These SynCon vaccines are designed to provide broad cross-strain protection against known as well as newly emergent strains of pathogens such as influenza. These vaccines, in combination with Inovio's proprietary electroporation delivery devices, have been shown to be safe and generate significant immune responses. Inovio's clinical programs include HPV/cervical dysplasia and cancer (therapeutic), avian flu (preventive), and HIV vaccines (both preventive and therapeutic). Inovio is developing universal influenza and other vaccines in collaboration with scientists from the University of Pennsylvania. Other partners and collaborators include Merck, National Cancer Institute, HIV Vaccines Trial Network, National Microbiology Laboratory of the Public Health Agency of Canada, and PATH "}
