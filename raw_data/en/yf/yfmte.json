Without adequate and appropriate rehydration therapy, severe cholera killsabout half of affected individuals. Cholera toxin, a potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase, causes the intestine tosecrete watery fluid rich in sodium, bicarbonate, and potassium, in volumes far exceeding the intestinal absorptivecapacity. Cholera has spread from the Indian subcontinent where it is endemic to involve nearly the whole world seventimes during the past 185 years. V cholerae serogroup O1, biotype El Tor, has moved from Asia to cause pandemic disease in Africa and South America during the past 35 years. A new serogroup, O139, appeared in south Asia in1992, has become endemic there, and threatens to start the next pandemic. Research on case management ofcholera led to the development of rehydration therapy for dehydrating diarrhoea in general, including the proper use ofintravenous and oral rehydration solutions. Appropriate case management has reduced deaths from diarrhoeal diseaseby an estimated 3 million per year compared with 20 years ago. Vaccination was thought to have no role for cholera, but new oral vaccines are showing great promise. Detailed accounts of the history of cholera are available soonly a brief summary is provided here. 1,2\"Asiatic cholera\", as it was sometimes called, has been endemic in southAsia, especially the Ganges delta region, from the time ofrecorded history. It was always much feared because itregularly occurred in epidemics with high mortality rates.In Kolkata, a cholera temple, Ola Beebe (\"our lady of theflux\"), was built for protection against the disease. In1817, the first cholera pandemic began with spread of thedisease outside the Indian subcontinent along trade routesto the west as far as southern Russia. A second pandemicstarted in 1826 and reached the major European cities bythe early 1830s. In 1831, the pandemic reached the UKand the response was important in that it led to theestablishment of local Boards of Health and a \"CholeraGazette\", which served as a clearing house for tracking theepidemic. 3 At that time cholera was thought to be spread by the \"miasma\" (like a fog) coming from the river, but theclassic epidemiological study of John Snow in 1854 inLondon showed the association of the disease withcontaminated drinking water even before any bacteriawere known to exist. 4Three more pandemics, continuing up to 1925, involved Africa, Australia, Europe, and all theAmericas. The causative agent, Vibrio cholerae, was during the fifthpandemic. 5Why the earlier pandemics began and how they ended is not known. However, cholera did not persistin any of the new geographical areas that it had invadedbut continued as an endemic disease in the Ganges delta.Because of the large numbers of cases and deaths during these pandemics, the disease was viewed as amajor public-health disaster requiring governmentalintervention. The New York cholera epidemic led to thefirst Board of Health in the USA in 1866, 6and cholera became the first reportable disease. The current (seventh) pandemic now has involved almost the whole world. This pandemic began inIndonesia, 7rather than the Ganges delta, and the a biotype of V cholerae serogroup O1 called El Tor. It was first isolated in 1905 fromIndonesian pilgrims travelling to Mecca at a quarantinestation in the village of El Tor, Egypt. 2It was found again in 1937 in Sulawesi, Indonesia.8Then in 1960, for unknown reasons, this strain began to spread around theworld. It invaded India in 1964, Africa in 1970, 9-11 southern Europe in 1970,12,13and South America in 1991.14,15The disease has now become endemic in many of these places, particularly south Asia and Africa. Since1973, a focus of El Tor V cholerae similar but not identical to the pandemic strain has persisted in the Gulf of Mexicoof the USA causing sporadic cases of summertime,seafood-associated cholera. 16 In 1992, a newly described, non-O1 serogroup of V cholerae, designated O139 Bengal, caused unusual cholera outbreaks in India and Bangladesh.17,18Before the discovery of V cholerae O139 (the 139th serotype in the typing scheme for V cholerae) , only serogroup O1 was known to cause epidemic cholera, so the serotypewas essentially a \"new\" cause of cholera. 19Serogroups O139 Bengal and O1 now coexist and continue to causelarge outbreaks of cholera in India and Bangladesh. TheO139 serogroup is likely to be the cause of the nextCholera David A Sack, R Bradley Sack, G Balakrish Nair, A K SiddiqueSeminar THE LANCET Vol 363 January 17, 2004 www.thelancet.com 223Lancet 2004; 363: 223-33 International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, Centre for Health and Population Research, Dhaka, Bangladesh (Prof D A Sack MD, G B Nair PhD, A K Siddique MPH); and Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Schoolof Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA (D A Sack, Prof R B Sack MD) Correspondence to: Dr David A Sack, ICDDR,B, GPO Box 128, Dhaka, Bangladesh(e-mail: dsack@icddrb.org)Search strategy We carried out a PubMed search with the terms \"cholera\" and \"Vibrio cholerae\" from 1966 onwards and selectedreferences that were pertinent to this review.

In spring 2002, serotype O139 caused an estimated 30 000 cases in Dhaka,Bangladesh, exceeding the number of cases associatedwith El Tor during a short period. 20 Epidemiology Cholera is often described as the classic water-bornedisease because it is commonly associated with water.This description oversimplifies the transmission ofV cholerae, because the bacterium can be transmitted by contaminated food also; contaminated water is frequentlymixed with food, allowing either to act as a vehicle. Formore developed countries, contaminated food (especiallyundercooked seafood) is the usual vehicle fortransmission, and contaminated water is more common inless developed countries. 21-23 Cholera has pronounced seasonality. In Bangladesh, where the disease is endemic, two peaks occur each yearcorresponding to the warm seasons before and after themonsoon rains. 24-26In Peru, epidemics are strictly confined to the warm season.27The seasonality seems to be related to the ability of vibrios to grow rapidly in warmenvironmental temperatures. Other than shellfish andplankton, there are no animal reservoirs. In endemicareas, annual rates of disease vary widely, probably as aresult of environmental and climate changes. Betterunderstanding of the relation to climate would allowbetter planning for epidemics by public-health officials. 28 Although the typical clinical picture is severe diarrhoea, in fact, most individuals infected with V cholerae have no symptoms or only mild diarrhoea, indistinguishable fromother mild diarrhoeal diseases. The ratio of cases toinfections ranges from one in three to one in 100. 25,29The severity of the infection depends on many factors,especially including local intestinal immunity (fromprevious natural exposure or vaccination), the size of theinoculum ingested, the adequacy of the gastric-acidbarrier, and the patient's blood group. For unknownreasons, people of blood group O are at much higher riskof severe cholera from El Tor vibrios than are those ofother blood groups. 30-32This susceptibility to cholera may be the reason for the lower than normal proportion ofpeople with this blood group in the Ganges delta area. 31 A high infectious dose (108bacteria) is needed to cause severe cholera in healthy volunteers, but a much lowerdose (10 5) is sufficient if given with antacids to neutralise stomach acid.33,34Under natural field circumstances, the inoculum size to cause cholera may be even lower,because attack rates are lower than in volunteer studies,and many of the patients do have low gastric-acidproduction. 35 In cholera-endemic areas, the highest attack rates are in children aged 2-4 years;25in newly invaded areas, by contrast, the attack rates are similar for all ages. However,the illness is generally first seen in adult men on accountof exposure to contaminated food and water. 17Water-use patterns in different areas affect spread of the disease. Insome cities in Peru, cholera vibrios were spread throughthe municipal water system, 36which resulted in very high rates of infection in the urban population. In rural areas,where rivers or open wells are used for drinking water,cases tend to cluster among people living close to anddrinking from contaminated water. Secondary casessometimes occur during funeral feasts as a result oftraditional but unhygienic funeral practices in some partsof the world. 37 In contrast to Salmonella typhi , long-term carriers of V cholerae are extremely rare and are not important in the transmission of disease.38 Since cholera outbreaks can become massive epidemics, they must be reported to national health authorities. Ifpossible, cases of suspected cholera should be confirmedby bacteriology. Even without laboratory confirmation,cases should be reported if they meet the WHO definition:a cholera outbreak should be suspected if a patient olderthan 5 years develops severe dehydration or dies fromacute watery diarrhoea, or if there is a sudden increase inthe daily number of patients with acute watery diarrhoea,especially patients who pass \"rice water\" stools typical ofcholera. 39 Clinical features After an incubation period of between about 18 h and5 days, symptoms are generally abrupt and include waterydiarrhoea and vomiting. The most distinctive feature ofcholera is the painless purging of voluminous stoolsresembling rice-water (figure 1). The stools are sometimesdescribed as having a fishy odour. The vomitus isgenerally a clear, watery, alkaline fluid. In adults withsevere cholera, the rate of diarrhoea may quickly reach500-1000 mL/h, leading to severe dehydration. Signs ofsevere dehydration include absent or low-volumeperipheral pulse, undetectable blood pressure, poor skinturgor, sunken eyes, and wrinkled hands and feet (as afterlong immersion in water). At first, patients are restless andextremely thirsty, but as shock progresses, they becomeapathetic and may lose consciousness. Many patients alsoshow respiratory signs of metabolic acidosis withKussmaul, gasping breathing. Most patients have no urineoutput until the dehydration is corrected. The fluid lossmay be so rapid that the patient is at risk of death within afew hours of onset, and most deaths occur during the firstday. However, if rehydration fluids are provided ininsufficient quantities, the patient may survivetemporarily, only to die a few days later.SEMINAR 224 THE LANCET Vol 363 January 17, 2004 www.thelancet.com Figure 1: Bucket with typical rice-water stool from a patient with choleraFor personal use.

They includeacute renal failure from protracted hypotension ifinsufficient fluids are given. Most cholera patients havelow blood glucose concentrations, and a few have severehypoglycaemia. 40Electrolyte imbalance, especially hypokalaemia, can occur if the intravenous fluids are notappropriate. 41Miscarriage or premature delivery can occur in pregnant women as a complication of shock and poorperfusion of the placenta. 42With good hydration, these obstetric emergencies are becoming less frequent, butcholera treatment centres must be prepared for them.Severe muscle cramps of arms and legs are common.They are probably due to the electrolyte imbalance,although the exact explanation is not known. Theysubside within a few hours of treatment. Treatment Without treatment the case-fatality rate for severe cholerais about 50%. However, treatment is very effective andsimple and is based on the concept of replacing fluids asfast as they are being lost (panel). Replacement fluidsshould have a similar electrolyte composition to the fluidsbeing lost. Initially, the fluids must be given sufficientlyrapidly to make up for the volume that has already beenlost to restore circulating blood volume. Additionalmaintenance fluids must then be given to continue toreplace continuing losses as they occur. If fluids are givenpromptly, nearly all deaths are avoided. However,effective treatment is not always available in remote areaswhere cholera occurs, and thus, cholera deaths are stillcommon. To facilitate clinical assessment and management of patients, dehydration is classified into three categories onthe basis of clinical signs and symptoms: none, some(moderate), and severe (table 1). Signs of dehydration arenot clinically apparent until the patient has already lostabout 5% of his or her bodyweight. The degree ofdehydration guides the therapy of the patient. A patientwith severe dehydration requires emergency intravenouspolyelectrolyte solution for rehydration followed by oralrehydration solution (ORS) for maintenance hydration.For milder cases, ORS is used for both rehydration andfor maintenance. The principles of rehydration therapyare: rapid replacement of fluid deficits; correction of themetabolic acidosis; correction of potassium deficiency;and replacement of continuing fluid losses. These aimsare all accomplished with appropriate rehydration fluids.Because of the acidosis, the serum potassiumconcentration may be normal or even high, so thepotassium deficiency may not be apparent. As the acidosisis corrected, the serum potassium concentration will fallto dangerously low values unless additional potassium isprovided. Patients who are severely dehydrated are assumed to have lost 10% of their bodyweight, and this is the volumethat needs to be replaced. For example, a 50 kg patientwith severe dehydration will need immediate replacementof 5 L of intravenous fluids. Patients who have no pulse orblood pressure should receive the fluid as rapidly aspossible and more than one intravenous line may beneeded to infuse the fluid rapidly enough to restore thepulse. The entire amount should be given in 2-4 h. Themost common error in the treatment of cholera is to givethe intravenous fluid too slowly, allowing patients toremain in shock for a long period. If peripheral veinscannot be found, infusion via the femoral vein may benecessary. For patients with lesser degrees of dehydration (the majority), ORS provides effective rehydration. Thevolume should also be calculated to replace the fluiddeficit to ensure that sufficient volumes are given. Forindividuals with some dehydration, at least 5\u00b70-7\u00b75% ofthe bodyweight in ORS should be given, just to make upthe deficit, and additional ORS should be given tocompensate for the continuing losses.SEMINAR THE LANCET Vol 363 January 17, 2004 www.thelancet.com 225Feature No dehydration Some dehydration Severe dehydration (two or more of (two or more of these these signs signs including one including one indicated by *) indicated by *) General Well, alert Restless, Lethargic or appearance irritable unconscious; floppyEyes Normal Sunken* Very sunken and dry*Tears Present Absent* Absent*Mouth and Moist Dry* Very dry*tongueThirst Drinks normally, Thirsty, drinks Drinks poorly or not not thirsty eagerly able to drink Skin pinch Goes back Goes back Goes back quickly slowly very slowly In adults and children older than 5 years, other signs of severe dehydration are absent radial pulse and low blood pressure.

Rapidly rehydrate the patient with intravenous Ringer's solution for severely dehydrated patients or ORS for thosewith less severe dehydration; use rice-based ORS if possible. Severely dehydrated patients require replacement of 10% of their bodyweight within 2-4 h. Use cholera cot (if possible) to monitor stool output; monitor status of hydration and monitor severity of purging frequently. Maintain hydration by replacing continuing fluid losses until diarrhoea stops. Give an oral antibiotic (eg, doxycycline) to dehydrated patients as soon as vomiting stops. Provide food as soon as patient is able to eat (within a few hours).

Only reproduce with permission from The Lancet.The use of a \"cholera cot\" is invaluable in managing severely purging patients. This is a simple camp cot witha hole in the middle and a plastic sheet that has a sleevedraining into a plastic bucket (figure 2). The cholera cotallows the patient to remain horizontal in bed whilepurging, and also allows for easy assessment of stoolvolumes so the carer can easily estimate the fluidrequirements. Where cholera cots are not available, theycan be constructed out of simple materials. The intravenous fluid should be isotonic with respect to salts; it should also include a base and potassium(table 2). Ringer's lactate is the best commerciallyavailable intravenous fluid, though other polyelectrolytesolutions with additional potassium provide even betterbalance with the composition of the stool losses. 43Since Ringer's lactate contains only 4 mmol/L potassium, ORS,which contains 20 mmol/L potassium, should be given assoon as the patient can drink. If no polyelectrolytesolution is available, normal saline can be used inemergency situations, but ORS should be provided assoon as possible to compensate for the acidosis andpotassium deficiency. Dextrose and water does notprovide the needed salts and is not appropriate. ORS is the preferred therapy for patients who have no detectable dehydration or some dehydration. It is alsoused to maintain hydration to make up for continuinglosses after correction of severe dehydration withintravenous fluids. Packets of of oral rehydration solutes,containing carbohydrate and the correct salts are nowwidely available throughout the world. For cholera, ORSthat uses rice rather than glucose is even better because itreduces the purging rate; 44,45this form is also available in packets to be mixed with water. The preferredformulation of ORS has changed lately; the sodiumconcentration has been lowered to 75 mmol/L. Thishypo-osmolar solution is acceptable for cholera, althoughORS solutions with sodium concentrations lower thanthis do not contain sufficient sodium and could result insevere hyponatraemia. If no ORS packets are available,ORS can be prepared by adding the following simpleingredients to 1 L water: 2\u00b76 and 13\u00b75 (or 50 g boiled and cooled rice powder). Thepurest water that is available should be used whenmaking ORS, and leftover solution should be discardedafter 24 h. Especially during the first 24 h, patients must be observed closely because the purging might continue at ahigh rate and some patients have difficulty drinkingsufficient quantities of ORS, or vomiting can preventsufficient oral intake. Such patients will becomedehydrated and require intravenous infusion again. Patients can be fed as soon as they are able to take food. There is no need to restrict food or fluids, andbabies can continue to breastfeed. There is no basis for\"resting the gut\" in any acute diarrhoeal disease. Patients with clinically significant cholera should receive a 1-3-day course of antibiotic to shorten the illnessand lessen the diarrhoeal purging. 46,47Antibiotics not only treat the illness; they also decrease the need forrehydration fluids and shorten the hospital stay. Theseeffects are especially important because cholera outbreaksgenerally occur in areas where intravenous fluid and othersupplies are lacking. In most cases, doxycycline is theantibiotic of choice (300 mg given as a single dose toadults). During an outbreak, samples from representative patients should be tested for antibiotic sensitivity to selectthe most appropriate antibiotic, on the basis of currentsensitivity patterns. For outbreaks due to tetracycline-resistant strains, other clinically effective antibioticsinclude erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, 48ciprofloxacin,49 and azithromycin.50Patients with mild diarrhoea need not receive antibiotics even during cholera outbreaks. Withoutantibiotic treatment (as long as rehydration is given),patients will recover in about 4-5 days. The recovery timeis shortened to about 2-3 days with antibiotics. Antibiotics should not be given to asymptomatic contacts. Prophylactic use of antibiotics greatly increasesthe risk of the development of resistance and is not cost-effective. 51 Antimicrobial resistance Widespread antibiotic resistance in V cholerae was unheard of before 1977, but conjugative-plasmid-mediated multiply antibiotic-resistant (including totetracycline) V cholerae O1 (MARV) emerged as a major problem first in Tanzania 52then in Bangladesh.53During the past two decades, reports from several cholera-endemic countries of strains resistant to antibioticsincluding and O139 do not tend to accrue resistance toantibiotics but show spatial and temporal fluctuations,with periods of resistance fluctuating with periods ofsensitivity, usually reflective of the antibiotics that areabused in any given region. 54 The molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of MARV are becoming better known. Conjugativeplasmids, conjugative transposons, and integrons are allvehicles of acquisition of genes that facilitatethe intracellular movement of genetic determinants ofresistance to antimicrobial agents. Apart from the novelO antigen, V cholerae O139 strains that emerged in late 1992 carried a novel conjugative, self-transmissible,chromosomally integrating SXT element (a constin),which conferred resistance to sulphamethoxazole,SEMINAR 226 THE LANCET Vol 363 January 17, 2004 www.thelancet.comFluid \u00b7\u00b7Children 100 90 33 30 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 ORS Glucose (WHO) 75 65 20 10* 13\u00b75 245 Rice 75 65 20 10* 30-50 About Intravenous fluids Lactate Ringer's 130 271Dhaka solution 133 154 13 48|| 292Normal saline 154 154 0 0 308 *Trisodium citrate (10 mmol/L) is generally used rather than bicarbonate.

The organism isclassified by biochemical tests and is further subdividedinto serogroups based on the somatic O antigen. TheO antigen enormous serological serogroups. 63Only the O1 and cause epidemic pandemic disease. Strains identifiedby biochemical tests as V cholerae that do not agglutinate with O1 or O139 referred to as epidemics, canbe pathogenic, 64and are infrequently associated with small outbreaks of diarrhoeal disease.65,66They occasionally cause a variety of severe extraintestinal infections,including wound infections and acute sepsis, especially inpeople with liver disease or immunosuppression. 67 V cholerae survives well in faecal specimens if kept moist, but if there is a delay of more than a few hours, Cary-Blairtransport medium should be used for transport to thelaboratory. The faeces (either fresh or in the transportmedium) plated onto TCBS (thiosulphatecitrate bile a medium that inhibits normal faecal flora but supports the growth of thevibrios. In addition, the specimen should also beinoculated into alkaline peptone water, a high-pHenrichment broth, which vibrios. After 6-12 h of incubation, secondTCBS plate is inoculated. These plates are incubated for18-24 h, and V cholerae colonies appear as smooth yellow colonies with slightly raised centres. Presumptiveidentification of V cholerae O1 or O139 can be made on the basis of typical colonies, which are oxidase-positive andagglutinate with O1 or O139 antiserum. Agglutinationshould be carried with subcultures onto non-selectivemedium, because colonies can autoagglutinate fromTCBS medium, giving false-positive results. Positivespecimens should be reported immediately to thegovernment health department and sent to the appropriatereferral laboratory for confirmation. Rapid tests include dark-field microscopy in which a wet mount of liquid stool is examined for the appearanceof \"darting\" organisms that are halted by the addition ofO1 or O139 antiserum. 68Rapid immunoassays are also available.69,70 The rapid immunological assays can be especially useful for monitoring of epidemiological patterns in remote areaswhere cultures are not readily available, but newoutbreaks must be confirmed by cultures. Molecularmethods, including PCR and DNA probes, are alsoavailable but are not widely used and not practicable inmany areas where cholera is common. Subtypes of V cholerae The O1 serogroup is divided into two biotypes, classical and El Tor, that can be differentiated by use of assays ofhaemolysis, haemagglutination, phage, polymyxin Bsensitivity, and is to use biotype-specific genes (eg,tcpA, rtxC) to differentiate between the two biotypes. Each of the O1 biotypes can be twomajor serotypes, Inaba. Ogawa strainsproduce the A antigens and a small amount of C,whereas Inaba strains produce only the A and C antigens.A third serotype, Hikojima, produces all the threeantigens but is rare and unstable. V cholerae strains of the same biotype and serotype can be differentiated by a phage-typing scheme. There are 145phage types for O1 71and five for O139.72Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis can distinguish between classicaland El Tor strains and has grouped the toxigenic El Torbiotype strains into four major clonal groups orelectrophoretic types (ET) representing broad geograph-ical areas. 73,74These include the Australian clone (ET1), the Gulf Coast clone (ET2), the seventh pandemic clone(ET3), and the Latin American clone (ET4). 75-77In addition, a standard ribotyping scheme for V O1 and O139 can distinguish seven different ribotypes amongclassical strains, 20 ribotypes and subtypes among El Torstrains, six distinct ribotypes among O139 strains. 78,79 These ribotypes have been especially useful for molecularepidemiological studies. For example, molecular analysisof epidemic isolates of V cholerae between 1961 and 1996 in Bangladesh revealed clonal diversity among strainsisolated during different epidemics. 80,81These studies demonstrated the transient appearance and disappearanceof more than six ribotypes among classical vibrios, at leastfive ribotypes of El Tor and three cholerae O139. Different ribotypes showed different CTX genotypes resulting from differences in copynumber of the CTX element and variations in theintegration site of CTX element in the chromosome. 81 Molecular epidemiological studies have shown that manystrains are in circulation but most outbreaks are caused bya restricted number of clones. Clinical pathophysiology Ingested vibrios from contaminated water or food mustpass through the acid stomach before they are able tocolonise the upper small intestine. Colonisation is aidedby filamentous pilus (TCP) extending from cellwall, that attach receptors on the mucosa, 82and by the bacterium's motility, which helps to penetrate the mucusoverlying the mucosa. V cholerae adhering to the M cells in rabbit intestine without causing any tissue damage areshown in figure 3. Concentrations of vibrios on themucosal surface rapidly increase to 10 7or 108cells per g. With this high concentration of vibrios closely attached tothe mucosa, enterotoxin can be efficiently delivereddirectly to the mucosal cells. Formerly cholera was thought to cause sloughing of the intestinal mucosa by an inflammatory process. However,the intestinal mucosa is now known to remain intact andwithout inflammatory changes. 83The previous findings were shown to be artifacts, based on autolytic post-mortem changes. Koch first postulated in 1884 that thebacteria produce a toxin and that this stimulates themassive outpouring of fluid from the intestine.

Most of the secretions come from thesmall intestine, although the toxin also inhibits waterabsorption by the colon. 93The diarrhoeal fluid contains large amounts of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, andpotassium, but little protein or blood cells. 43The loss of electrolyte-rich isotonic fluid leads to blood volumedepletion with attendant low blood pressure and shock.Loss of bicarbonate and potassium leads to metabolicacidosis and potassium deficiency. The stools of cholerapatients contain high concentrations of cholera vibrios (upto 10 8bacteria per g), and they are highly infectious. When passed into the environment, they can contaminatewater sources and food and may seed an environmentalreservoir. Virulence factors At the molecular level, the pathogenesis of cholera is amultifactorial process and involves several genes encodingvirulence factors that aid the pathogen in its colonisation,coordinated expression of virulence factors, and toxinaction. In V cholerae , the major virulence genes required for pathogenesis are in clusters and can apparentlypropagate laterally and disperse among different strains.Genetic analyses have revealed the presence of twoimportant genetic elements that distinguish a pathogenicV cholerae from an innocuous one. These are the previously called CTX genetic element, which is thegenome of a lysogenic bacteriophage designated CTX /H9021 that carries genes encoding cholera toxin, and pathogenicity island typical CTX /H9021 genome has a modular structure composed of two functionally distinct domains, the coreand RS2 regions. 94CTX /H9021was originally perceived to be a transposon-like genetic element. The core region encodescholera toxin, which does not contribute to virionformation, and the other genes encode proteins (Psh,Cep, OrfU, and Ace) that are involved in phage packingand and one (Zot) products of also show enterotoxic activity and increase short-circuit currentacross intestinal tissue in Ussing chambers. 95,96The RS2 genes required cholerae cells, the CTX /H9021genome can exist either as a replicating plasmid or as a prophage integratedinto the chromosome. 94Under appropriate conditions, toxigenic V cholerae strains can be induced to produce extracellular CTX /H9021particles.94,98Cultures of V cholerae harbouring the high titres of the phage in their supernatants. can be converted by phagetransduction with CTX /H9021, 98and this event could conceivably take place in the gastrointestinalenvironment, yielding new toxigenic strains. 99 TCP mediates bacterial colonisation of the intestine by facilitating microcolony formation via pilus-mediatedbacterial interactions and perhaps direct attachment to theintestinal brush border. 100The genes for TCP form part of the 40 kb VPI segment that is generally absent from non-epidemic strains. 101Biogenesis of TCP requires the activities of at least 11 accessory proteins, most of whichare encoded by genes located in the TCP operon. 102The structural features of the VPI include the presence ofgroups of virulence genes, a regulator of virulence genes, atransposase gene, and specific ( att-like) attachment sites flanking each end of the island. The presence of anintegrase with homology to a phage integrase genesuggests that the VPI was also derived from 103,104As remarkable examples of evolutionary coadaptation, the CTX /H9021virion uses TCP as a receptor during infection.102Colonisation is a prerequisite to establishing a productive infection. Othercolonisation factors such as the mannose-fucose-resistantcell-associated haemagglutinin, the mannose-sensitivehaemagglutinin, and some outer-membrane proteins aresuspected from findings in animals to have roles inincreasing adhesion and colonisation . 105-107The exact roles of these factors in the virulence of V cholerae in human beings are still uncertain, but the mannose-sensitivehaemagglutinin type IV pilus has been identified as onefactor involved in the adherence to the chitin ofzooplankton. 108 The entire genome sequence of V cholerae O1 (biotype El Tor) was recently described.109The genome consists of two circular chromosomes.109,110The large chromosome contains most of the genes that are required for growthand pathogenicity, and some of the components of severalessential metabolic and regulatory pathways are on thesmall chromosome. V cholerae can activate or inactivate a set of genes including those encoding colonisation factors or toxins asan appropriate response to changing environmentalconditions. ToxR, a 32 kDa transmembrane protein,binds to a tandemly repeated 7 bp DNA sequence foundupstream of the ctxAB structural gene and increases transcription of this gene resulting in higher expression ofcholera toxin. The coordinated regulation of several genesSEMINAR 228 THE LANCET Vol 363 January 17, 2004 www.thelancet.com Figure 3: V cholerae adhering to M cells in rabbit intestine without causing any tissue damage Note the typical comma-shaped bacteria from which the organism derives its name.

ToxR regulates theexpression not only of ctxAB but also of at least 17 distinct genes that constitutethe ToxR regulon. 111-113Except for the ctxAB genes, other genes in the ToxR regulon are controlled through anotherregulatory factor called ToxT, a 32 kDaprotein. ToxR controls the transcriptionof the toxT gene, which encodes one of the AraC bacterial transcriptionactivators. The resulting increasedexpression of the ToxT protein thenleads to activation of other genes in theToxR regulon. Thus, ToxR is at the topof the regulatory cascade that controlsthe expression of several other genes,and the expression of ToxR itselfremains under the control ofenvironmental factors. 114,115 The emergence of the O139 epidemic strain of V cholerae resulted from horizontal gene transfer of afragment of DNA from anotherserogroup into a strain of the seventhpandemic V cholerae O1 El Tor strain. This transfer occurred in the region thatbrings about O-antigen biosynthe-sis. 116-118DNA hybridisation analysis of it has homology several non-O1 serogroups,but especially with serogroup 119,120 Molecular epidemiological studiessupport these findings and show thatO139 strains have genetic backbonesvery similar to those of the O1 El TorAsian seventh pandemic strains. 121-123 However, unlike V O139 traces of tetradecanoic and hexadecanoicfatty acids. 124 Ecology of V cholerae The general assumption, until quite recently, was that cholera was spread only by infected people to othersusceptible individuals via faecal contamination of waterand food and that global movement of populationsaccounted for the global movement of the disease. Recentstudies of the aquatic environment, however, have shownthat V cholerae , including strains of O1 and O139, are normal inhabitants of surface water, particularly brackishwaters, and survive and multiply in association withzooplankton and phytoplankton quite independently ofinfected human beings. 125-128Because global climate changes affect the growth of plankton, growth of the vibriosassociated with plankton could also be modified. Thecontinuing presence of cholera in the Indian subcontinentand the re-emergence of cholera in other continents may behighly dependent on environmental factors. 28,129The movement of the bacteria in association with plankton hasled to the suggestion that ship ballast may be a cause of itsglobal spread. 130The life cycle of V cholerae consists of two distinct phases (figure 4). Outside of the host and in the aquaticphase, V cholerae can be found as free swimming cells, attached to surfaces provided by plants, filamentous greenalgae, copepods, crustaceans, insects, 129,131and egg masses of chironomids.132Biofilm formation133and entry into a viable but non-culturable state in response to nutrientdeprivation 134are thought to be important in facilitating environmental persistence within natural aquatic habitatsduring periods between epidemics. 99Neither the genetic events that help the organism to lead a life in associationwith plankton nor the biofilm ecology of vibrios on abioticsurfaces are completely understood. Although V cholerae is part of the normal estuarine flora, toxigenic strains are mostly isolated from theenvironment in areas probably contaminated by infectedindividuals. Environmental isolates from areas that aredistant from regions of infection do not generally have thecholera toxin genes. 135 There are two crucial sequential steps in the evolution of a pathogenic V cholerae . First, strains have to acquire the VPI (which most environmental strains do not have);second, having acquired the CTX /H9021receptor, the TCP- positive strains are infected with and lysogenised byCTX /H9021. 94,98,136Experiments in animals have shown that theSEMINAR THE LANCET Vol 363 January 17, 2004 www.thelancet.com 229Epidemic secretorydiarrhoea Proliferation by to the gutepitheliumGastric acidbarrier Villus cells Transport of vibrios into the smallintestineAbsorptive abiotic of vibrios into the environment Free swimmingvibriosVibrios attached toaquatic life forms Figure 4: Life cycle of V cholerae involves both environmental and human segments, which sometimes intersectFor personal use. Only reproduce with permission from The Lancet.intestinal milieu is the site where strains can acquire these mobile elements efficiently.94,137Thus, V cholerae can be visualised as an autochthonous marine bacterium thatcolonises and thrives in the human gut during phases ofinfection and spends the time between epidemics in its\"original\" habitat, the estuary. Prevention of cholera and vaccines Contaminated food and water are the main vehicles oftransmission of V cholerae and much can be done to keep transmission rates to a minimum. The measures includeensuring a safe water supply, (especially for municipalwater systems), improving sanitation, making food safe forconsumption by thorough cooking of high-risk foods(especially seafood), and health education through massmedia. Some important messages for the media duringoutbreaks include the importance of purifying water andseafood, washing hands after defecation and before foodpreparation, recognition of the signs of cholera, andlocations where treatment can be obtained to avoid delaysin case of illness. The long-term prevention of cholera willrequire improved water and sanitation facilities, but theseimprovements are not happening rapidly in most regionswhere cholera is prevalent. A killed injectable vaccine was developed shortly after V cholerae was discovered in the 1880s, and it was widely used throughout the world. Vaccination was even arequirement for international travellers in the mistakenbelief that it might prevent international spread of cholera.This vaccine was probably appropriate for those whocould afford it during the early part of the 20th centurywhen treatment was ineffective and sanitation standardswere low. However, it was not cost-effective as a public-health intervention because protection was short-lived(6 months), it was associated with painful localinflammatory reactions, and it did not prevent the spreadof disease. 138Vaccination was not practicable and was too expensive for people might benefit from it. Those whocould afford it no longer needed it, and they did not likethe side-effects. Thus, the whole-cell injectable vaccine isno longer recommended for any purpose, though it is stilllicensed. New oral cholera vaccines promise substantial protection without side-effects. A killed oral vaccine(Dukoral) consists of killed V cholerae organisms along with the cholera B subunit, and the vaccine thereforestimulates both antibacterial and antitoxic immunity. Twodoses are given 1-6 weeks apart. 139The other vaccine (Orochol) is an avirulent mutant of V given as a single-dose, lyophilised oralvaccine. 140Both are licensed in several countries, but not yet in the USA. Dukoral was effective in field trials in less developed countries,141,142and it is now recommended for use in refugee settings at risk of cholera.143Its cost-effectiveness in endemic areas is still not known. Orochol is highlyprotective in volunteer studies, 140,144though its use in endemic areas is uncertain.145Other live and killed oral vaccines are also being developed that may become usefulin the future. 146-150A major problem in the development of these new oral vaccines will be to make them sufficientlyinexpensive and to develop a formulation that can bereadily distributed to huge populations at risk. Boosterdoses will probably be needed for each of the new oralvaccines, and the formulations will need to be sufficientlysimple that the vaccine might even be self-administered attimes of risk. The new oral vaccines will not prevent all cases of cholera because local intestinal immunity can beovercome with a high inoculum, but they should lower therisk by as much as 80% if used regularly. Also, a vaccineprogramme could work synergistically with sanitationprogrammes; the inoculum needed to cause disease wouldbe raised and the numbers of pathogenic organismsentering the environment would be decreased. Thusvaccines and sanitation programmes should not be viewedas alternative preventive strategies but as complementary,perhaps even synergistic, ones. Conclusion At the beginning of the 21st century, cholera remains anepidemic or endemic disease in much of the world.Research has revealed much about the pathogenesis andthe genetics of V cholerae , and has provided simple and effective methods for treatment. New epidemic strains arelikely to develop, evolve, and spread. V cholerae cannot be eradicated; it is a part of the normal flora and ecology ofthe surface water of our planet. Thus, we have to learn tocoexist with the vibrios. An understanding of the ecologyof the organism should help to limit the times that humanbeings come into contact with this super-pathogen.
