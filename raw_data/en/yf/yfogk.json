PROJECT DESCRIPTION Bioe nergy DevCo (BDC) is developing an organics processing facility referred to as the Bioenergy Innovation Center (BIC), which is located in Seaford, Delaware. The BIC (the Facility) will utilize Anaerobic Digestion (AD) technology to process organic feedstock into bene ficial end products in addition to the capture of biogas. The Facility will primarily accept organic waste in the form of poultry litter and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) liquid and solid cake; fats, oils & grease; and waste activated sludge ) as feedstoc ks. The existing composting facility will be expanded in two phases to include four anaerobic digesters (two in each phase) and total capacity of up to an additional 250,000 tons per year of recycling capability. The second phase construction starts conc urrently with the commissioning of the phase 1 digesters . The application for the Resource Recovery Facility permit is inclusive of both phases of the project. The AD process will generate a solid digestate and biogas that can be further processed to produce marketable end -products as well as liquid digestate that will require pre -treatment on -site and final treatment off -site. The solid digestate will either be transported to the adjacent compost facility or marketed as a soil amendment/conditioner. The biogas will be upgraded and conditioned to pipeline grade renewable natural gas (RNG). The RNG will be pressurized and transported as Compressed Natural Gas (C NG) by an energy services provider for injection into the natural gas pipeline grid . Wastewater generated by the AD process will be treated on -site. Initially treated waste water will be hauled to the City of Seaford for disposal. Ultimately , BDC will s eek approval from Sussex County Council to form a sewer district and construct a pumping station and force main from the site directly to Seafor d's wastewater system . BDC has a commitment from Seaford (Appendix F) to accept up to 60,000 gpd pretreated was tewater that meets Seaford's discharge standard s. The Seaford commitment is subject to an executed service agreement with BDC. 3 3.0 ENGINEERING REPORT REQUIREMENTS The following 10 report subsections follow the DRGSW Section 1301, Part 4.4.1.4 of the Administrative Code . 3.1. FACILITY LAYOUT The BIC project site was formerly owned and operated by AgriSoil, LLC (Perdue) and functioned as an organics processing and micronutrient facility. Under the previous operating permit (originally issued to Seaford AgriSoil, LLC on December 2, 2016), the facility processed poultry industry hatchery waste, and liquid and solid cake dissolved air flotation (\"DAF\") (\"source separated \") wastes. The composting permit was transferred to Bioenergy Development Group in February 2020, and BDC has been operating this facility since February 6, 2020. The BIC project site is located at 28338 Enviro Way, Seaford, DE 19973 and encompasses approximately 225 acres consisting of several parcels located west off of Seaford Rd (US -13 Alternate Ro ute), between Oneals Road (Rd 485) and approximately the intersec tion of Seaford Rd and Easter Ln. and west from Seaford Rd to near Rd 487. An aerial of the existing site obtained from Google Earth Pro is presented on the next page as Figure 1. In accordance with DRGSW , Section 1301, Part 4.4.1.4.1, the Proposed Facility Layout Drawing presenting the conceptual design of the facility is provided in Appendix A . 3.2. MASS AND ENERGY BALANCES AND PROCESS FLOW In accordance with DRGSW, Part 4.4.1.4.2., mass and energy balances are included in Appendix B as provided by the process design engineer, BTS Biogas (BTS). A Simplified Process Flow Diagram is also provided in Appendix C. 4 Figure 1 - Existing Site Aerial Photo 3.3. PROPOSED DESIGN FEATURES In accordance with DRGSW, Part 4.4.1.4.3 ., the facility's design features and processing equipment are detailed in this section. The facility includes a comprehensive AD System, which includes the following major components which are more completely described in the Section 3.3.2.1 to include design capacity, size and number of units : Feedstock Receiving Solids Feedstock Tipping Floor in an enclosed building; Solids Feedstock Receiving Feeders Biomix Feed Pump Liquids Feedstock Receiving Pad and Pump House Anaerobic Digestion System Pretank/slurry tank Digester Tanks Digestate Handling System Polyelectrolyte Preparator (polymer feed system) Centrifuge Solids Separation Screw Press(as part of Phase 2 to be insert ed upstream of centrifuge ) 5 Wastewater Pretreatment System Solids Biogas Conditioning , and Control Equipment Biogas Conditioning (H2S Scrubber and moisture removal) Compression System Flare and Thermal Oxidizer Odor Control Equipment Building Air Dilution Air Exhaust Fan System Truck Scales Inbound truck scale, 70 -ft Outbound truck scale, 70 -ft 3.3.1. Access Road and Traffi c Flow The access road to BIC will accommodate the traffic flow to the AD and organics facility and be of sufficient capacity to accommodate peak daily and hourly deliver y volumes. Though not anticipated to be used often, the access road will be equipped with a Queue Area for trucks to queue during high delivery periods. The Queue Area will be located in the main entrance road leading to the facility . One (1) 70 foot, ab ove ground inbound scale will be located after the Queue Area . All vehicle flow will proceed in a counter -clockwise direction around the facility after progressing over the inbound scale. One (1) 70 foot, above ground outbound scale will be located on th e access road in the outbound direction. These scales will provide appropriate measures to monitor and track incoming waste receipts and outbound shipments from the facility. Incoming liquid wastes received at the facility will be metered. Both scales w ill be equipped with lightning protection to improve reliability. 3.3.2. Feedstock Receiving The facility will receive poultry litter and DAF (liquid and solid cake; fats, oils & grease; and waste activated sludge ) , and the bioreactor sludge from the on-site wastewater treatment plant . The BIC facility is designed to receive and process up to 250,000 tons of organic wastes per year into marketable products or commodities that include biomethane gas (i.e., 6 biogas) , composted soil amendments, solids dig estate soil amendments and blended soil amendments. The incoming feedstock types and quantities are presented in Table 1. Table 1 - Feedstock Tonnage Assumptions for AD Process Feedstock Source and Type Short Ton (tpy) Short Ton (tpd)3 Facility 1 Cake Average 11,542.44 31.71 Facility 1 DAF Sludge Primary Average 38,176.32 104.88 Facility 2 DAF Sludge Average 22,196.72 60.98 Facility 3 DAF Cake Average 79,908.92 219.53 Facility of the feedstock being delivered to the facility 2Accounts for total amount of material processed by the AD equipment. This total is greater than the tonnage of feedstock delivered to the facility because the bioreactor sludge is recycled through the process. 3Assumes 7 days per week / 52 week s per year operation. Actual daily values will be slightly higher per feedstock receivi ng operations 3.3.2.1 Solids Receiving Area The solid DAF, chicken litter, or other similar solid organic materials will be transported to the facility in various sized transfer trailers up to a maximum of 53' in length. These trucks will enter through one of two roll up doors and tip in the Solids Receiving Area located on the south end of the building , which will accommodate a minimum of four (4) transfer trailers per hour. The trucks will tip and unload material into a receivi ng pit with a feeder . A screw auger conveyor will be located at the bottom of the feeder to transport the material to be pumped to the Pre-tanks. The screw auger will be sized to remove material quickly enough to avoid backups or overflow of the feeder . In the event some material doe s end up on the floor, a hose station will be located nearby to wash the material into the feeder . Preliminary design data for the solids receiving area is presente d in Table 2. Table 2 - Solids Receiving Design Data Equipment Quantity Size / Rating Capacity 7 3.3.2.2 Liquids Receiving Area The liquid unloading area , located at the back (west side) of the building, is designed to accommodate one truck unloading at a time. The liquid DAF and other similar liquid organic materials will be transported to the facility in large tanker trailer trucks. The driver will park the truck on a spill pad, which will co ntain any spillage that may occur during the unloading process. One truck will unload at a time. The spill pad can contain 2,304 gallons and will connect to a trench drain that will route back to a sump that will be connected to the wastewater treatment s ystem in order to handle potential maximum spill volumes. The driver will connect a vacuum line via a quick connect fitting on the tanker vessel and pump the contents to the Pre-tanks . Preliminary design data for the liquids receiving area is pre sented in Table 3. Table 3 - Liquids Receiving Design Data Area 3.3.3. Anaerobic Digestion System 3.3.3.1 Pre-tanks The project will include pre -tanks to provide mixing and stirring with mechanical agitators and provide for equalization allowing a constant flow rate and consistent quality of substrate to be fed to the digesters. The liquid DAF material will be pumped directly to the Pre-tanks. The Solid DAF and processed poultry litter will be combined with liquid substrat e that can be pumped from the p re-tanks to create a pumpable slurry with a desired percentage of solids. The slurry will then be pumped to the digesters .

The pre-tanks are designed with almost 3 days of hydraulic retention time. The reduced retention time is kept short so as not to produce biogas. Any biogas produced is collected at the top of the tank with a line that connects to the common biogas lines from the anae robic digesters and pulled to the biogas treatment system by way of a blower. The pre -tanks preheat the substrate and provide some initial breakdown of complex organic molecules into sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids to aid the AD process within the digesters. Preliminary design data for the pre -tanks is present ed in Table 4.

The digester tanks will be heated and mixed to facilitate the biological process. The digesters are expected to produce 2,304, 000 SCF of biogas per day (1600 SCFM) which is expected to equate to 1,428,480 SCF of methane produced per day based on continuous 24 -hour operation, seven days per week. Biogas will be collected from the digesters and treated at the biogas conditioning system. Digestate fr om the digesters will be pumped to a Feed Tank for solids separation . Preliminary design data for the digester tanks is presented in Table 5. 9 Table 5 - Digester Design Data Quantity (Number) Material (Type) Foundation (Type) Operating Temperature (\u00b0F and \u00b0C) Inside Diameter (FT) Height (FT) Volume Fermentation (FT3) Volume Total (FT3) 4 Pre-Cast Post- Tension Concrete Concrete Geo-Piers and Slab 108 / 42 92 39.5 244,096 265,919 The digestate is then pumped to centrifuges to provide solids separation prior to further treatment. A polyelectrolyte preparator will feed and blend p olymer with the digestate upstream of the Centrifuge s to facilitate solids separation. Solids from the centrifuges will be conveyed and discharged into a storage bunker and either marketed as a soil amendment product or transported to the adjacent compost facility for further processing . Preliminary desig n data for the solid digestate is presented in Table 6.

From there most of the liquid will be pumped to the wastewater treatment equipment and a portion of the liquid will be pumpe d back to the digest ers. Preliminary design data for the liquid digestate is presented in Table 7.

Biogas Upgrading & Conditioning System BioEnergy DevCo will be responsible for treating the biogas to generate Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and sell the RNG to an energy services provider who will pressurize and transport it as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for injection into the natural gas pipeline grid . A utility flare will be available to combust the gas in the event of equipment maintenance or excess RNG. The project basis of design and mass balance shows that the BIC will generate up to approximately 1,600 scfm of biogas with approximately 62% methane when fully built -out and at full production . The raw biogas 11 from the digesters will be boosted in pressure by a blower and pass through a biogas conditioning system. The conditioned bioga s will then be upgraded to RNG. The preliminary design data for the filtration component of the biogas conditioning system is p resented in Table 8.

WC Polishing filters 2 Global Welding Services 38.5 sq. ft. 19.4 ft. 16 - 30 in. WC The conditioning and polishing skid will include a biogas booster to increase the raw biogas pressure followed by pre -conditioner to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and moisture from the gas . A polishing step using carbon filter skids with a catalytic high capacity media remove s siloxanes and VOCs. Each system is designed with lead -lag vessels with each vessel capable of processing the full production of biogas. This allows for changeout of media while continuing to operate at full production. The media is periodically replaced and removed for landfill disposal. The design of the media vessels is such that this should only be necessary two times a year. A feed gas compressor will be used to increase the biogas temperature and pressure followed by a series of disposable particulate filters to remove moisture and bacteria from the gas prior to treatment with the membrane separation system. The membrane se paration system will be the final step of the biogas upgrade system and will separate the carbon dioxide (CO 2) and other gases from the biogas using a membrane filtration system resulting in a near pure (97 to 98.5%) methane (CH 4) stream of renewable natur al gas (RNG). The tailgas, or waste gas stream, will be routed to a thermal oxidizer. The membrane filters are disposable and will need to be changed once every 3 years. The filters will be disposed of at an appropriately permitted landfill. 12 3.3.5. Wastewater Pretreatment System The on -site wastewater treatment plant will be a Membrane Bioreactor System (MBR) that will include a Bioreactor (Anoxic and . Two treatment trains are required for the Phase 2 flows of approximately 60,000 gallons/day , initially one treatment train will be installe d with the Phase 1 AD system . A process flow diagram (PFD) for the proposed treatment process is shown on Appendix H. A mass balance for the wastewater system is shown on Appendix I. Preliminary Treatment, Filtration and Screening AD discharge is directed into an e qualization tank prior to coarse solids removal step using disc press equipment. Separated solids are sent to the compost operation. Expected wastewater influent characteristics (after disc press) are as follows: 13 Disc p ressate will be pumped sequentially through Drum Filter s and Microscreen s located near the MBR tanks . The Drum Filter s protect the Microscreen s which protect the downstream membrane systems . Both the Drum Filte rs and Microscreen s are relatively robust systems . Outages for emergency repairs to these units are expected to be minimal and not require durations that would upset the downstream biological processes . Solids captured by the Drum Filter s and Microscreen s will be collected in portable containers and will b e recycled to the AD system. Bioreactor Screened wastewater will flow by gravity to the Bioreactor Anoxic Zones. The anoxic environment functions as a zone with depleted oxygen levels to allow for denitrification of effluent recycled from the A eration Zones. The Anoxic Zone s are complete mix reactor s with no supplemental oxygen provided . Anoxic Zone effluent will flow by gravity to the Aerobic Zones where diffused air and supplemental carbon (depicted as \"nutrient\" on the PFD) will be added to provide nitrification of ammonia nitrogen first to nitrites and then to nitrates. The diffused air system will Units % <0.3 TDS 30.0 Temperature MAX \u00b0C 40.0 mg/l -- Silver mg/l -- 14 provide oxygen and mixing energy ne eded for the Aeration Zones to function as completely mixed reactors. Waste solids from the bioreactor will be routed back to the AD system. A UF Feed Tank will be provided to collect and mix effluent from both Aeration Zones prior to pumping to the UF system s. Recirculation Pumps will recycle fully nitrified wastewater from the UF Feed Tank back to the Anoxic Zone s for denitrification.. In addition, heat exchangers will be pr ovided to cool recycled wastewater during warm months to optimize the denitrification process. Membrane Treatment The UF system s provide membrane filtration of Bioreactor effluent to remove additional contaminants . UF system is a physical filtration system and will remove suspended solids. The UF membranes have a mean pore size of 30 nanometers, therefore any constituent with a size greater than 30 nm will be removed. UF effluent will be pumped to the UF Permeate tank and from there into the RO System s. The RO system is a multi - concentration, triple pass system that will remove dissolved solids including metal ions and aqueous salts. The RO system includes a 5 nanometer filter as well as semipermeable membranes. The R O system s will remove any remaining contaminants and provide effluent quality designed to meet Seaford treatment permit requirements. RO permeate will be pumped to a holding tank prior to being loaded on trucks and eventually allowed to be discharged to the new pumping station. Expected effluent quality is as follows: 15 Parameter Units Value Flow Gallons per day TS % <0.03 TSS % 0.0 pH mg/l 6.5 - 8.5 Temperature -- will be pumped back into the plant to be used as service water for clean -in-place systems of other equipment. The RO system s will also produce a concentrated effluent stream (RO concentrate) containing all the contaminants removed from UF Permeate. This waste stream is directed into the NF system which uses membranes hav ing pore sizes of 0.002 to 0.005 microns to remove smaller contaminants. NF permeate is fed to a n addition al RO super concentrat ion process . NF concentrate (approximately 3,200 gallons per day) will be sent to the composting system to be used moisture co ntrol and because it contains concentrated minerals . RO super concentrate (approximately 5,800 gallons per day) will be trucked off site to a facility that accepts industrial wastewater. Supplemental Chemical Additions An antifoaming agent will be injected into the Anoxic Zone recirculation lines to combat foaming within the Bioreactor . The UF , NF and RO system s all include a clean -in-place capabilities to allow periodic cleaning with an acid, a base, sodium hypochlorite (UF), and an antiscalant (R O). Biocide and an anticorrosive will be injected into wastewater recycled through the heat exchanger systems . Tank and Equipment Specifications 16 The preliminary design data for the wastewater treatment equipment is provided in Appendix I. 3.3.6. Odor Control Equipment All the solid feedstock will be received in an enclosed process building with an air ventilation system that will provide and maintain a negative air pressure inside the building at all times, especially in and around the Solids Receiving Area (i.e., the tipping floor for solid organic waste). The air ventilation system will prevent odors from escaping outside the process building. As the solid feedstock will be received by trucks, quick acting rollup doors will be utilized to minimize the amount of time these areas of the buil ding are open when trucks are being received, unloading, or when they are exiting the process building. The rollup doors will remain in the closed position at all other times. The air ventilation system design has accounted for the removal of odors from the building and elimination through the sufficient dilution of odors prior to being released into the surrounding environment . Design requirements for equipment include a proven history o f eliminating odors with examples of similar applications along with other attributes such as reliability, operational and maintenance requirements, critical spare parts, required space, and both CapEx and OpEx costs. F ilters and dilution exhaust fans are proven technologies that are curr ently being considered for use. The facility equipment that will have process odor contro l is mainly the feed- tank separators prior to the solid separation of digestate downstream of the digesters . This equipment will have process filters to eliminate odor s. Filters will be changed according to the maintenance requirements for correct functioning of the system . Changes will be done with the use of all required Personal Protective Equipment. Used filters will be disposed of at an appropriately permitted facility. Based on experience with other facilities, emissions from the Solids Receiving area are not expected to trigger regulatory thresholds for control equipment. If, during commissioning, it is determined that emissions require controls, BDC will seek permitting for appropriate equipment. 3.3.7. Mechanical /Electrical /Plumbing The main portion of the facility will not require heating or cooling systems. Only worker areas or areas where equipment requ ires climate control (ex. MCC) have control systems. The rest of the area will be ventilated with the air handling system described above. 17 The facility has plumbing systems for wor ker comfort and process needs. Potable water systems are protected from contamination by reduced pressure zone (RPZ) backflow preventer. The electrical system is serviced by a number of transformers on site with more than sufficient capacity for the facility. The facility will also incorporate an emergency standby generator sufficient to support critical loads during a grid outage. 3.3.8. Nuisance Du st and Vector Management The facility will implement a vector control plan to eliminate and/or minimize the potential for vectors. This approach will include a regular washing and cleaning schedule for the Solid Receiving Area tipping floor and other process equipment as necessar y. Inbound and outbound vehicles will also be required to tarp their loads while outside of the process building area (i.e. the rolldown tops being maintained in the \"down\" position) to minimize odors, which can also attract vectors. Regular cleaning and vehicle tarping will also prevent dust from accumulating. The vector control plan will also include measures for contracting with a local pest management service to perform regular inspections and baiting of the facility. Bait stations will be checked f or activity and rebaited as necessary. In addition, site landscaping will be regularly maintained to prevent overgrowth of vegetation, which could otherwise provide cover and nest sites for vectors. 3.4. PROPOSED INSTALLATION METHODS AND PROCEDURES In accordance with DRGSW, Part 4.4.1.4.4., t he BIC AD Project will be managed by Bioenergy Dev Co, and constructed by a General Contractor Construction Manager utilizing multiple specialty trade subcontractors. The existing building formerly used as a pelle tizing plant will be used as the primary process support building containing feedstock receiving, solids separation, wastewater treatment, electrical distribution, control room and other support facilities for the AD plant. The liquid waste receiving area is located just outside the Process building between the Process Building and the anaerobic digesters with drive up access for offloading tanker trucks utilizing a liquid unloading station . The anaerobic digesters and pretanks will be constructed of pre -cast, post tensioned concrete that is assembled on site, on a cast in place concrete foundation. Most of the remaining equipment will come in pre-fabricated skids installed in containers that are installed and set on new cast in place concrete foundatio ns. Equipment is interconnected both mechanically and electrically 18 utilizing above ground and below ground piping, conduits, raceways and cable trays by the specialty subcontractors. 3.5. QUALITY ASSURANCE In accordance with DRGSW, Part 4.4.1.4.5., a plan for third party quality assurance for the construction and installation of components of the facility that will be used in the processing, handling, and/or monitoring of solid waste is as follows : In addition to the Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan to be managed by the General Contractor and Subcontractors, Barton and Loguidice as the Engineer of Record, Bioenergy Dev Co and 3rd Party QA consultant per DRGSW will provide additional inspections, oversight, and testing of the installation methods and practices utilized by the General Contractor and Subcontractors for all aspects of the project inclusive of the solid waste receiving and handling area. Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) will be the project delivery method. IPD is a collaborative all iance of companies, people, systems, business structures, and practices that harnesses the talents and insights of all participants to optimize project results, increase value to the Owner, reduce waste, and maximize efficiency through all phases of design , fabrication, construction, and into operation. The key participant s will include Owner (BDC) , the Process Engineer (BTS) , the Engineer of Record (B&L) , and the General Contractor (S&T) , along with other partners, consultants, vendors, and subject matter experts that will be brought in from time -to-time during the execution of the Project. 3.6. CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE In accordance with DRGSW, Part 4.4.1.4.6., a project milestone schedule is included under Appendix C, which presents estimated timelines for permits and approvals; engineering and design; long lead procurements; construction; commissioning and startup; and commercial operation. 3.7. DESIGN CAPACITY AND LIFE EXPECTANCY In accordance with DRGSW, Part 4.4.1.4.7, a proposed design capacity per day and life expectancy of the facility shall be provided. Assuming proper maintenance , the site structures (buildings, tanks, digesters, pump houses , etc. ) and utility infrastructure have an estimated useful life of 2 0 years. Processing equipment, depending on type and use, are expected to be refurbished or replaced as required and have an estimated useful life of 5 -20 years. Rolling stock (i.e. , front end loaders) have an estimated useful life of 5 -8 years. Essential spare parts will be maintained on -site or scheduled for replacement at required intervals. For additional information, refer to the BIC Facility Plan of Operation that has been provided to DNREC under separate cover fo r the Resource Facility permit. 19 3.8. HAZARDS AND SAFETY In accordance with DRGSW, Part 4.4.1.4.8 , a comprehensive Site Safety Management Plan that complies with OSHA, Federal, State and Local codes and requirements and industry standards will provide the specific controls for each aspect of construction and installation of the AD Project. A construction activities site specif ic safety plan is provided in Appendix E . A safety manual for the operatio ns of the facility is also provided in Appendix F. The requirements and safe practices will be enforced by BDC, the General Contractor and Subcontractors at al l times . The General Contractor will have a full -time employee acting as the Site Safety Representative that is a trained professional and will monitor, train, evaluate, inspect, enforce and report on the Safety Management Plan for the site construction ac tivities. As standard practice, any employee or worker on site has \"STOP\" authority to stop the work if an unsafe practice is observed. Compliance with environmental regulations and permits for the Facility is regarded as an important requirement for all employees at all levels. Compliance requirements will be routinely discussed in employee meetings, posted in process or related areas for ease of reference and reported in Facility reports at least monthly. Compliance auditing will be conducted at least annually each year of operation and more frequently when required to correct deficiencies. 3.9. FACILITY EXPANSION In accordance with DRGSW, Part 4.4.1.4.9, an analysis of the concept for an expansion of the facility was performed. The BIC facility is being designed and permitted for its full operational capacity up to 250,000 tons per year . The BIC facility consists of approximately 225 acres with the AD and Composting facilities operations co -located on the site. Sufficient space is available to expand both operations as may be needed to sup port the needs of Bioenergy DevC o or in response to requirements deemed necessary by DNREC. 3.10. GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER DISCHARGES In accordance with DRGSW, Part 4.4.1.4 .10, a review of the BIC facility's operations was performed to identify possible groundwater and surface water discharges. This review identified the potential for discharges resulting from wastewater and stormwater generated from the facility's operations as described below: Building and equipment drains will be collected and sent to the waste water treatment facility . 20 Sanitary wastewater at the facility is currently treated and discharged to an on -site sanitary wastewater treatment system . Stormwater Surface Water Discharges - A NPDES general permit for industrial stormwater is in place for the facility and BDC has submitted a Notice of Intent to implement system enhancements. BDC has implement ed plans previously developed by Perdue, through its con sultant McCrone, and approved by DNREC to make modifications to the outlet structure of the stormwater facility that serves the composting operation. Aerators, per the approved plan, were installed in the stormwater pond to facilitate evaporation and enhan ce storage capacity with the goal of minimizing surface water discharges. The stormwater system has an outfall located on a prong of the Gum Branch tax ditch, a tributary of the Nanticoke River. The stormwater facility that serves the former pelletizing p lant will be redesigned and reconstructed to accommodate the construction of the proposed tank farm and process equipment associated with the anaerobic digester. The existing outfall from the stormwater pond will be utilized and will continue to discharge to Gum Branch tax ditch prong. The proposed stormwater management design will utilize one proposed wet extended detention pond facility and one existing wet extended detention pond facility to reduce peak runoff from the Site. A wet pond is proposed in lie u of infiltration and bioretention practices due to a high ground water table. In accordance with the requirements of the Green Technology Best Management Practices (GTBMP) Design Manual, the wet pond facility was designed to provide 48 hours extended detention for the 1 -year storm and to pass the 100 -year storm. The wet pond facilit y was designed with a permanent pool depth of 5 feet.

If you obtain treatment from a provider not listed on the panel during that time period, the employer will not be responsible for the expense incurred. The expenses will be your obligation. (Please note that this panel may change from time -to-time and it is your responsibility to make note of such changes as they are posted on the Bulletin Board.) After a ninety -day period expires, you may visit with a medical provider of your choice. However, you must notify the employer within five (5) days of the first visit that you are seeing a health care provider of your choice. If you fail to notify the employer within five days, the employer will not be responsible for the medical expenses incurred until appropriate notice is given and the service is determined to be reasonable and/or necessary. - 12 - Return to Work Policy This policy will provide a guide for establishing the availability of modified duty work in the event of an injury/illness that permits a return to work with restrictions. It is the policy of S&T to attempt to provide work for employees with restrictions due to work injuries. Decisions relating to the availability of work will be made by the managers and S&T's Health & Safety Manager, although every effort will be made to provide modified duty, we cannot guarantee work under the proposed restrictions will be available. Physical limitations will be defined by the treating health care provider and must be in writing, detailing those limitations. If needed, the Company will communicate a description of the proposed modified work activity to the health care provider in order to dete rmine whether the job(s) is within the employee's prescribed limitations. General Guidance on Modified Duty Work Employees will be assigned tasks that are within the scope of the restrictions set forth by the treating health care provider. All modified duty jobs must be monitored on a daily basis for compliance to restrictions, with documentation of any violation of those restrictions. Modified duty can be a regular 8 hour shift or a portion of that shift, which may or may not include overtime. An employee working in a modified duty capacity must follow the attendance policy and a health care provider's note is required to excuse them from work. - 13 - Back Injuries The most common cause of back injuries is sprains and strains. Improper li fting is the largest single cause of back pain and injury. Next to the common cold, back injuries are a frequent cause of lost work time. A back injury may refer to vertebrae, discs, and ligaments and muscles. Some common factors that may increase the risk of back injury include, but are not limited to, lifting heavy objects, especially from the floor or below the knees, repetitive bending and/or twisting, poor posture, and being overweight. Most back injuries occur over time due to poor lifting techni ques. Knowing and using proper lifting techniques can prevent back pain and injury. Some preventative measures to help reduce or eliminate the risk of back injury include, planning ahead, using mechanical lifting equipment when available, getting help to l ift heavy or awkward shapes, getting as close to the load as possible and lifting with your legs, lifting straight up and smoothly, avoid fast jerking motions, do not twist or turn while lifting, and when putting the load down, bend at the knees. - 14 - Blasting and Explosives Due to the complexity and dangers of handling and using explosives, you must be licensed by the state to perform or assist. Since we currently do not have any licensed blasters, all work is subcontracted. Under no circ umstance is an employee of Stewart & Tate Inc. permitted to work with blasting or explosive devices. Failure to adhere to this policy could result in termination of employment. - 15 - Mobile Telephone and PDA Usage Policy The purpose of this policy is to establish general operating rules for Company issued personal mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDA's). A \"PDA\" or personal digital assistant is an electronic device which can include some of the functionality of a computer, mobile phone, music player, and camera. Mobile phone and PDA's have become indispensable tools in our business, making it possible to instantly communicate vital Company information, giving us immediate access to Company data, other employees, and providi ng immediate access to emergency agencies. However, like any other tool, mobile phones and PDA's can pose a hazard and must be used safely. The use of personal mobile phones and PDA's at work is only authorized during designated break periods, when it does not affect the ability of the employee to do their job, and only in approved break areas. For safety reasons, we encourage you to follow these same rules when using these devices during work and personal time. General Mobile Phone and PDA Usage Rules Read the owner's manual and follow the manufacturer's safety instructions. A working knowledge of the device's capabilities will allow for safer operation. Turn off the device while refueling and while near blasting areas, chemical fields, aircraft, or any other location or environment where the use of mobile phones/PDA's could be hazardous to you or others in the area. Comply with all device warnings and restrictions. Employees are prohibited from making any modifications or repairs to any Company - issued devices without the approval of the Company. Adhere to all local, State, and Federal rules and regulations relating to the use of mobile phones and PDA's while driving. Do not use your mobile phone or PDA if it is prohibited by law, regulation, or other ordinance in a particular area. Use of Mobile Phones and PDA's in Vehicles The driver's primary responsibility is the safe operation of the vehicle. It is recommended that you pull off the road to use these devices. In order to simplify dialing mobile phones, program as many numbers into the speed dial or voice -dial feature as possible. All mobile phone conversations conducted while driving a Company vehicle should be done with a \"hands -free\" device. Many locations throughout the country prohibit using mobile phone and PDA's without a hands -free device. All mobile phone and PDA manufacturers offer a hands -free device. Even while using one of these devices - 16 - while driving, the possibility of distraction is great. Therefore, you should make each call as brief as possible. Construction Equipment Mobile Phone/PDA Rules The equipment operator's primary responsibility is the safe operation of the equipment. Do not dial or operate other functions of a mobile phone or PDA while the equipment is in operation. To safely operate these devices, the equipment operator will move their equipment to a safe, level area and secure the parking brake prior to operating the mobile phone or PDA. The onl y time you may dial a phone while operating equipment is to report an emergency that requires immediate attention, such as an accident or dangerous situation. Do this exercising extreme care and do not prolong the call. If you should receive an incoming message of any kind while operating equipment, allow the call (in the event of a phone call) to default to voice -mail. These and other PDA messages can be retrieved/viewed at a time when it is safe to do so. Use of Mobile Phones and PDA's on Job Sites Before attempting to use a mobile phone or PDA on a job site, be aware of hazards and activities taking place in the area. If necessary, move to a safe area before using the device. While on a job site, restrict the use of your mobile phone or P DA to those areas designated by the customer. Turn your device off before entering any posted or restricted environment. Adherence to this policy will ensure continued effective communications and safety for all of our employees. Any questions regarding the use of mobile phones or PDA's should be directed to the manager or S&T's Health & Safety Manager. Mobile Phones/PDAs in Relation to Other Policies The use of mobile phones or PDAs in violation of any other S&T policy, including but not limited to, the anti-discrimination and anti-harassment polices, is strictly prohibited. - 17 - Concrete Work The following safety guidelines shall be followed: 1. Since uncured concrete contains curing agents and additives that may cause skin irritation, prolonged contact should be prevented. Rubber boots must be worn while standing in uncured concrete along with the proper gloves. Eye protection is required when exposed to splashing concrete. 2. All protruding reinforcing steel, onto and into whi ch employees could fall, shall be guarded to eliminate the hazard of impalement. 3. Employers shall take measures to prevent unrolled wire mesh from recoiling. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, securing each end of the roll or turning over the roll. 4. No employee shall be permitted to apply a cement, sand, and water mixture through a pneumatic hose unless the employee is wearing protective head and face equipment. 5. Riding concrete buckets. No employee shall be permitted to ride concrete buckets 6. No employee shall be permitted to work under concrete buckets while buckets are being elevated or lowered into position. 7. Concrete buckets equipped with hydraulic or pneumatic gates shall have positive safety latches or similar safety devic es installed to prevent premature or accidental dumping. 8. Power concrete trowels: Powered and rotating type concrete troweling machines that are manually guided shall be equipped with a control switch that will automatically shut off the power whenever the hands of the operator are removed from the equipment handles 9. Concrete buggies: Concrete buggy handles shall not extend beyond the wheels on either side of the buggy 10. Bull float handles used where they might contact energized electrical conductors, shall be constructed of a nonconductive material or insulated with a nonconductive sheath. 11. Formwork shall be erected, supported, braced, and maintained so that it will be capable of supporting any loads imposed on it. All shoring, forms, and timber must be inspected prior to use. Always have preparations made in the event of kick-outs or form slippage. 12. When drilling or using a jack hammer, the proper eye and face protection such as goggles or a face shield is required. Protect surrounding areas with screens or partitions if needed 13. Masonry saw shall be guarded with a semicircular enclosure over the blade. A face shield and hearing protection should be worn while operating a masonry saw. 14. If there is a need to construct mason walls, contact the safety Manager for details. - 18 - Purpose Confined Space Entry Program The purpose of this program is to inform interested persons, including employees, that Stewart and Tate, Inc. is complying with the OSHA Confined Space Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.146. We have determined that this workplace needs written procedures for the evaluation of confined spaces, and where permit -required spaces are identified, we have developed and implemented a permit -required confined space entry program. This program applies to all work operations at Stewart and Tate, Inc. where employees must enter a permit - required confined space as part of their job duties. Under this program, w e identify permit -required spaces for Stewart and Tate, Inc. and provide training for our employees according to their responsibilities in the permit space. These employees receive instructions for safe entry into our specific type of confined spaces, incl uding testing and monitoring, appropriate personal protective equipment, rescue procedures, and attendant responsibilities. This program is designed to ensure that safe work practices are utilized during all activities regarding the permit space to prevent personal injuries and illnesses that could occur. What is a confined space? A confined space may include, but is not limited to the following; Air and gas ducts, air receivers, bin/hoppers, caissons, condensers, furnaces, machine pits, manholes, p ipes, sewers, silos, stacks, storage tanks, sumps, tunnels, turbines, vats, vaults, and all trenches more than 4 feet in depth. A confined space is: 1. Limited openings for entry and exit 2. The area is not intended for continuous work. A permit required confined space has one or more of the following characteristics; a.) Contains or has the potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere. b.) Has an internal configuration such that an entrant can become trapped or asphyxiated. c.) Contains less than 19.5% oxygen d.) The area is not protected against the entry of water, gas, sand, gravel, chemicals, or any other substance which could possibly trap, suffocate, or harm a person. Safe Permit Space Entry Procedures Only trained and qualified personnel shall analyze a confined space and determine if it is safe to enter or work within. Contact the Safety Manager for permits and related documents. Pre-Entry Evaluation To ensure the safety and health of our employees, before allowing authorized workers to enter a permit space, we evaluate conditions in that space to determine if the conditions are safe for - 19 - entry. Any employee, who enters the space, or that employee's authorized representative, has the opportunity to observe the pre -entry and any subsequent testing. The authorized entrant or that employee's representative also has the option of requesting a reevaluation of the space if they feel that the evaluation was not adequate. Our company follows t he procedures to evaluate each permit space before entry according to 1910.146(c)(5)(ii)(C). This includes testing the internal atmosphere with a calibrated direct - reading instrument for oxygen content, flammable gases and vapors, and potential toxic air contaminants. We also periodically test the atmosphere of the space to ensure that the continuous ventilation is preventing the accumulation of a hazardous atmosphere. Certification According to 1910.146(c)(5)(ii)(H), our company verifies that the space is safe for entry and that the pre -entry measures required by 1910.146(c)(5)(ii) have been taken, through a written certification that contains the date, location of the space, and signature of the person providing the certification. At our company, Safety Director, foreman, and project managers is responsible for verifying these procedures. The certification is made before entry and is available to each employee entering the space. According to 1910.146(c)(5)(iii), our company documents the basis fo r determining that all hazards in a permit space have been eliminated, through a certification that contains the date, location of the space, and signature of the person making the determination. At our company, Safety Director, foreman, and project manage rs is responsible for documenting this information. The certification is available to each employee entering the space. Equipment To ensure the safety and health of our employees, Stewart and Tate, Inc. provides appropriate equipment to all employees who work in or near our permit spaces. According to 1910.146(k)(3)(i), each authorized entrant will use a chest or full body harness, with a retrieval line attached at the center of the entrant's back near shoulder level, above the entrant's head , or at another point which Stewart and Tate, Inc. can establish presents a profile small enough for the successful removal of the entrant. Wristlets may be used instead of the chest or full body harness if Stewart and Tate, Inc. can demonstrate that the u se of a chest or full body harness is infeasible or creates a greater hazard and that the use of wristlets is the safest and most effective alternative.

It is used to ensure that the machine or equipment is stopped, isolated from all potentially hazardous energy sources and locked out before employees perform any servicing or maintenance where the unexpected energization or start -up of the machine or equipment or release of stored energy could cause injury. Authorized and Affected Employees Authorized employee : Is a person who locks out or tags out machines or equipment in order to perform servicing or maintenance on that machine or equipme nt. An affected employee becomes an authorized employee when that employee's duties include performing servicing or maintenance covered under this section. Affected Employee : An employee whose job requires him/her to operate or use a machine or equipment on which servicing or maintenance is being performed under lockout or tagout, or whose job requires him/her to work in an area in which such servicing or maintenance is being performed. Machinery and Equipment All machinery and equipment that is energized by one of the following sources falls under the Control of Hazardous Energy Standard and shall be locked or tagged out when servicing: hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, or mechanical. Lockout is the preferred method of isolating machines or equipment from energy sources. Tagout is to be performed instead of lockout only when there is no way to lockout a machine. Lockout/Tagout Procedures 1. Notify all affected employees that a lockout or tagout system is going to be utilized and the reason why. The authorized employee shall know the type and magnitude of energy that the machine or equipment utilizes and shall understand the hazards thereof. 2. If the machine or equipment is operating, shut it down by the normal stopping procedure. This i s usually done by depressing stop button, open toggle switch, etc. In addition, ensure that all stored energy is dissipated or properly restrained. 3. Operate the switch, valve, or other energy isolating device(s) so that the equipment is isolated from its energy source(s). Stored energy such as the springs, elevated machine members, rotating flywheels, hydraulic systems, and air, gas, steam, or water pressure, etc. must be dissipated or restrained. Combinations of these energy sources and any stored energy will require specific procedures. 4. Lockout, block out and/or tagout device application: a.) Locks, blocks and tags shall be affixed to each energy -isolating device only by an \"authorized\" employee. b.) Locks and tags shall be singularly identified. c.) Locks shall be affixed in a manner that will hold the energy -isolating device in a safe or off position. 63 d.) Tags, when used, shall be affixed in a manner that will clearly indicate that the operation or movement of the energy isolating device from the \"safe\" or \"off\" position is prohibited. e.) Tags that cannot be affixed directly to the energy isolating device shall be located as close as safely possible to the device, in a position that will be immediately obvious to anyone attempting to operate the device. f.) All potentially hazardous stored or residual energy shall be relieved, disconnected, restrained or otherwise rendered safe. If there is a possibility of re- accumulation of stored energy to a hazardous level, verification of isolation shall continue until the possibility of accumulation no longer exists. Stored energy may require blocks, blinds, flanges, etc. in order to appropriately control stored energy. g.) After ensuring that no personnel are expose d, as a check on having disconnected the energy sources, operate the push button or other normal operating controls to make certain the equipment will not operate h.) The equipment is now locked out or tagged out. Testing or Positioning of Machines, Equipment, or Components thereof In situations which lockout, blockout, or tagout devices must be temporarily removed from the energy isolating device and the machine or equipment energized to test or position the machine, equipment or component thereof, the following sequence of actions shall be followed: Clear the machine or equipment of tools and materials. 1. Remove employees from the machine or equipment area. 2. Remove the lockout or tagout devices. 3. Energize and proceed with testing or positioning. 4. De-energize all systems and reapply energy control measures in accordance with the requirements set forth in this instruction. Restoring Machines or Equipment to Normal Production Operations After the servicing and/or maintenance i s complete and equipment is ready for normal production operations, check the area around the machines or equipment to ensure that no one is exposed. After all tools have been removed from the machine or equipment, guards have been reinstalled and employees are in the clear, remove all lockout or tagout devices. Operate the energy isolating devices to restore energy to the machine or equipment. 64 Company Vehicles At the discretion of the President of S&T, Company -owned vehicles may be issued to selected employees for business purposes and for limited/reasonable personal use.

Work performed in Maryland is governed by the Maryland Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MOSH). Work performed on mine properties is governed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Due to frequently occurring OSHA / MOSH inspections on construction projects, several key points need to be identified to ensure proper steps are taken prior to and during an inspection. Inspections What triggers an inspection? OSHA can initiate an inspection for various reasons. Inspections are conducted according to the following priority schedule which are: 1. Imminent Danger - OSHA's highest priority a) Imminent danger is a situation that is likely to cause death or serious injury. b) If a compliance officer witnesses any situation they consider to imminent danger to workers, they have the right to initiate an inspection 2. Fatalities or Catastrophes - Second priority a.) A catastrophe is a work -related incidents resulting in the death of an employee or in-patient hospitalization of three (3) or more employees. b.) The employer must orally report such incidents in person or by phone to OSHA within 8 hours of the incident. 3. Employee complaints a.) OSHA responds to every complaint they receive. b.) Serious allegations may result in on site inspections. 4. Referrals from other agencies 5. Follow up inspections Focused Inspection Program OSHA's focused inspection program was created to focus on the major hazards in the construction industry. The program allows for limited scope inspections for employers with a strong safety and health program. The program focuses on the 4 main hazards in construction: 1. Fall Hazards 2. Caught in/between hazards 3. Struck by hazards 4. Electrical hazards A focused inspection is usually much quicker than a comprehensive inspection. To qualify for a focused inspection we as employer must do two things. First, we must have evidence of a safety and health program that complies with all of OSHA's General Safety and Healt h requirements and each project must have a competent person who conducts frequent and regular inspections of the job site. 67 Inspection Procedures Opening Conference : An inspector will show up on a job site unannounced. Before the actual inspection begins, the inspector will hold an opening conference. Call the Safety Manager as soon as the inspector is on site. The inspector should introduce him/herself and show identification. If one is not offered, ask for a business card. The inspector should state the reason for the inspection. If they do not, ask them for a reason. Also ask if the inspection will be a comprehensive or focused inspection. If it is not a focused inspection ask why it will not be. The op ening conference sets the tone for the actual inspection, so be courteous and professional. Actual inspection : A Superintendent or foreman should accompany the inspector during the walk around inspection. The inspector may do any of the following; 1. Inspect the work area and equipment for unsafe conditions mainly looking for fall hazards, electrical hazards, struck by, and caught in between hazards. 2. Ask questions of workers pertaining to safety and job knowledge. 3. Take pictures or videos. Closing conference : This will be held after the actual inspection is complete. The inspector may choose to do this separately with each contractor or as a group. The inspector will notify you of your rights and responsibilities after an OSHA inspection and any citations they will propose. Citations will be sent in the mail in the days or weeks following the inspection. At that point the safety department can appeal the citation to have them reduced or withdrawn. Employee Behavior during an Inspection: 1. All employees shall be cooperative with the inspector. All statements should be factual and accurate. Do not volunteer information or recommend areas that should be inspected. 2. Any records such as accident or training shall be shown upon request , but no copies will be provided without approval from the Safety Department. 3. The inspector shall be accompanied by the foreman at all times. 4. During the inspection, detailed notes should be taken pertaining to areas of concern. 5. The inspector has the right to take pictures and measurements, thus the foreman should do the same to document any items that are in question. Also, document the names of any workers the inspector interviews. 6. All hazards shall be corrected immediately. Corrections done while the inspector is on site and documented by the inspector by either picture or note can possibly reduce the citation. 7. Any corrective action that was taken care of immediately shall be documented. 8. Do not argue, shout, ignore, or disrespect the inspector even if you don't agree with him. 9. Pay attention and stay positive. 68 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) PPE Specific Information Eye and Face Protection - Safety glasses, goggles and face shields It is the policy of the company that as a condition of employment, whether full time, part time, or temporary, all employees working in designated work areas and/or job assignments are required to wear ANSI approved safety glasses, goggles/face shields to help preve nt eye and face injuries, including but not limited to those resulting from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or light radiation, for example. Employees are required to wear eye protection while working around machines, equipment, power tools and operations that present the potential for injury. All employees required to wear safety glasses and/or goggles/face shields must routinely inspect and properly care for their goggles/face shields. Stewart and Tate, Inc. will provide the necessary eye and face protection at no cost to employees with the exception of prescription safety glasses. Partial reimbursement is offered to employees who purchase prescription safety glasses. S&T will reimburse the employee up to $120.00 per pair of prescription safety glasses biennially; said amount may be adjusted on an annual basis by the Company at its discretion. The manager will be responsible for determining eligibility. Employees must purchase ANSI approved safety frames and lenses with side shields. The employee will present a purchase receipt from the optician to the Manager. That purchase receipt will be forwarded to the HR Department, along with the reimbursement form signed by an authorized manager. Reimbursement will be added to the employee's paycheck. Foot Protection -Safety Shoes It is the policy of the company that as a condition of employment, whether full time, part time, or temporary, all employees are required to wear steel toe, composite toe, and/or metatarsal safety shoes with leather over the ankle to help prevent foot injuries, ankle injuries, slips, and falls. The safety shoes must meet ANSI Standards (Z41.1 -1967). Boots with soles not firmly attached to the leathe r, worn out to the point that there are visible holes in the sole or the leather is ripped to the point that any part of your foot is exposed, is not permissible. Failure to comply will result in disciplinary action. The company does not provide reimbursem ent for safety footwear. Hand Protection -- Gloves It is the policy of the company that as a condition of employment, whether full time, part time, or temporary, all employees working in designated work areas and/or job assignments are required to wear gl oves to help prevent hand injuries. This shall include, but not limited to, cuts, punctures, burns, and electrical or chemical hazards. All employees who work in designated work areas and/or job assignments that have the potential 69 for injury are responsible for wearing company provided gloves to comply with this policy. Failure to comply will result in disciplinary action. All employees required to wear protective gloves must routinely inspect and properly care for their assigned gloves (if the gloves are not disposable). Head Protection -- Hard hats It is the policy of the company that as a condition of employment, whether full time, part time, or temporary, all employees working on construction jobsites shall wear hard hats at all times. Employees seated inside vehicles or in fully enclosed mobile equipment (i.e. windows and doors) are not required to wear a hard hat, but must have it in the cab with them at all times to be donned upon exit. Hardhats shall meet the specifications contained in ANSI, Z89.1 -1969. Bump caps are not acceptable alternatives for hard hats. Hard hats are to be worn in compliance with manufacturer recommendations and cannot be modified in any way. This includes wearing hardhats backw ards when not approved by the manufacturer. Baseball style caps may not be worn under hard hats at any time. All employees who work on construction jobsites are responsible for wearing company provided hard hats to comply with this policy. All employees required to wear hard hats must routinely inspect and properly care for their hard hats and shall be worn in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Hard hats must be removed from service after 5 years of initial use. Hearing Protection It is the policy of the company that as a condition of employment, whether full time, part time, or temporary, all employees working in designated work areas and/or job assignments where there is excessive noise levels or duration of exposures t o those specified in the table below, Permissible Noise Exposures, hearing protection devices shall be provided and used. PERMISSIBLE NOISE EXPOSURES | | Sound level Duration per day, hours | dBA slow | response | | 8..................................| 90 6..................................| 92 4..................................| 95 3..................................| 97 2..................................| 100 1/2..............................| 102 1..................................| 105 1/2................................| 110 1/4 or less........................| 115 | When employees are subjected to sound levels exceeding those listed in the table above, feasible administrative or engineering controls shall be utilized. If such controls fail to reduce sound 70 levels within the levels of the table, personal protective equipment shall be provided and used to reduce sound levels within the levels of the table. Plain cotton is not acceptable hearing protection. Clothing - Outerwear All employees are required to wear full length pants and shirts that cover at least the top of the shoulder. Note: Some customers require that shirts have at least a 3inch sleeve. Clothing that is excessively loose, baggy, ragged, or torn is not permitted. Note: Some customers do not allow hooded garments. Respiratory Protection - See Respiratory Protection policy. Cleani ng and Maintenance It is important that all PPE be kept clean and properly maintained by the employee to whom it is assigned. Cleaning is particularly important for eye and face protection where dirty or fogged lenses could impair vision. PPE is to be inspected, cleaned, and maintained by employees at regular intervals as part of their normal job duties so that the PPE provides the best protection. If a piece of PPE is in need of repair or replacement it is the responsibility of the employee to bring it to the immediate attention of his or her supervisor, the dispatcher, or the Safety Manager. It is against work rules to use PPE that is in disrepair or not able to perform its intended function. Note: Some customer's policies are stricter regarding PPE. Make sure you know the customers rules prior to arriving at the job site. 71 Personnel Lifts AERIAL OR ARTICULATING BOOM Aerial lifts come in a variety of sizes and help to make a difficult job easier. Lifts used improperly and recklessly could result in serious injuries or costly damages. Since lifts are normally used around other workers, safety precautions must be taken. When operating these units the following should be observed: 1. The operator must be trained and authorized to operate the unit. 2. The operator is responsible for the safe operation of the unit. 3. Inspect the unit prior to each use. 4. Know the lift you are using and never exceed its capacity. 5. Head protection is required by all personnel on the lift and those working below it. 6. Look around and make sure you have proper clearances. 7. Keep aware of power lines and take into consideration swaying and rocking. 8. Be aware of obstacles in your path. 9. Retract outriggers before moving. 10. Take precautions to avoid tipping, operate a lift on solid surfaces. 11. The use of a full body harness is required before operating a lift and proper anchorage, (not outside the lift) is required. 12. A full body harness is required even when the unit is being moved from one position to another. 13. Never climb on safety rails . 14. Keep platforms clear of ice, snow, and other slippery conditions. 15. Keep the platform free of debris, unused tools, and materials. 16. Never stand on anything inside the lift ; this will put you above the protected safety rails. 17. Never push or pull the lift with any other type of equipment or machinery. 18. Shut off all power before performing any type of maintenance work (lockout/tagout). 19. Always use three points of contact when climbing on or off the unit. SCISSOR LIFTS Any lift that stays within the width of the wheel -base is considered a scissor lift. Here are the regulations for this type of lift: 1. The operator must be trained and authorized to operate the unit. 2. The operator is responsible for the safe operation of the unit. 3. Inspect the unit prior to each use. 4. Know the lift you are using and never exceed its capacity. 5. Head protection is required by all personnel on the lift, and those working below the lift. 6. Stay within the safety rails and never climb on safety rails . 7. Never stand on anything inside the lift, or build platforms on the lift. 8. Keep platforms clear of ice, snow, and other slippery conditions. 9. Keep the platform free of debris, unused tools, and materials. 10. The safety chains, bars or gate at the entrance area must be closed at all times. 11. Always be aware of the surface you are driving on and all obstacles and employees around you (communicate to others on/working around the lift before moving it). 72 Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency Plan Stewart & Tate, Inc. transports road oils, such as bituminous emulsion, and plant -mixed asphalt paving materials to various job sites within a 50-mile radius of York, Pennsylvania. The oils are transported in bulk tankers usually hauling 5,500 gallons or less. Plant -mixed asphalt paving material is hauled in dump trucks, tri-axles, or dump trailers to their appropriate weight class. Spills may occur due to leaks in a tank, truck body, or gate. Valve leaks on bulk trailers can occur when not closed properly or if valve seats or gaskets fail. The most probable leak will occur if a trailer valve or dump gate is intentionally opened as an act of vandalism. Small spills can occur during loading or unloading of product. A vehicle accident during transport could result in the release of material. In order to prevent accidental or intentionally malicious spills of emulsion from tankers, the tanker valves must be locked at all times when not in actual use. If the tanker is left unattended at any time, the valve must be locked. All Stewart & Tate tanker valve locks do not accept EC2 or master keys, but only special keys issued by the Equipment Manager. These keys will be issued only to those requiring access to the tankers and the Equipment Manager will maintain a list of individuals having keys. The oils and paving products are usually shipped hot to enhance their ability to flow. In their cured state, or cold, the flow is greatly reduced and the spill potential is minimal. Spilled material will not travel far from the site. This type of heavy material also tends to pool as it cools. The product does emit noxious fumes but is considered non -toxic. Heated product may result in thermal burns. Small spills should be cleaned up promptly. Sand, dirt, clay media, or absorbent material should absorb oils. Asphalt should be shoveled into a pile and removed. Absorbents should be applied to puddles to help reduce shipping hazards or tracking of material from the site. Large spills should follow the emergency procedures below: 1. Survey the scene to be sure it is safe for you to enter. Keep other workers or pedestrians out of the area. 2. Stop traffic from entering spill site. Even a minor spill can be made worse by vehicles spreading the material. 3. Attempt to stop the leak at the source by closing the valve, plugging the hole or lowering the dump bed. 4. Notify the foreman immediately or if alone, call the dispatcher or operator at the shop. 5. Use dirt, sand, road debris or whatever is nearby to contain leaked material. If available, use spill containment supplies or support equipment, such as a backhoe. In the event of a spill, contact these individuals in the following order: 1. Emergency Response/Fire/Police via 911 2. Dispatcher, who will determine the need to make additional contacts 3. The Fleet Manager or Maintenance Supervisor who serve as spills Managers if needed 4. National Response Center for major spills: 1-800-424-8802, (Large spills only) 73 5. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources: 717-787-4343 (reportable spills) The list of spill equipment maintained on the vehicles is as follows: 1. Dump Vehicles - Shovel 2. Tankers - Oil dry absorbent, spill pads, and shovel The list of spill equipment maintained by the Fleet Manager and the Maintenance Department is as follows: 1. 4 Bales of spill absorbent pads; 2. 3 Bales of spill absorbent booms; 3. Sand pile in shop yard; Shovels, brooms, spreaders, and floats 4. Lumber; Plastic -dry; Earth moving equipment; Excavating equipment; Communication equipment; Portable power supply 5. Barriers, barricades, warning signs 74 Respiratory Protection This voluntary program has been established to protect employees from occupational diseases caused by breathing air contaminated with harmful dusts, fogs, fumes, mists, gases, smokes, sprays, or vapors. All employees who choose to wear a respir ator shall receive of copy of Appendix D per OSHA standards. \"Appendix D to Sec. 1910.134 (Mandatory) Information for Employees Using Respirators When Not Required Under the Standard Respirators are an effective method of protection against designated hazards when properly selected and worn. Respirator use is encouraged, even when exposures are below the exposure limit, to provide an additional level of comfort and protection for workers. However, if a respirator is used improperly or not kept clean, the respirator itself can become a hazard to the worker. Sometimes, workers may wear respirators to avoid exposures to hazards, even if the amount of hazardous substance does not exceed the limits set by OSHA standards. If your employer provide s respirators for your voluntary use, or if you provide your own respirator, you need to take certain precautions to be sure that the respirator itself does not present a hazard. You should do the following: 1. Read and heed all instructions provided by the manufacturer on use, maintenance, cleaning and care, and warnings regarding the respirators limitations. 2. Choose respirators certified for use to protect against the contaminant of concern. NIOSH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, certifies respirators. A label or statement of certification should appear on the respirator or respirator packaging. It will tell you what the respirator is designed for and how much it will prot ect you. 3. Do not wear your respirator into atmospheres containing contaminants for which your respirator is not designed to protect against. For example, a respirator designed to filter dust particles will not protect you against gases, vapors, or very small solid particles of fumes or smoke. 4. Keep track of your respirator so that you do not mistakenly use someone else's respirator. Rigging 75 General Safety 1. Rigging equipment for material handling shall be inspected prior to use on each shift and as necessary during its use to ensure that it is safe. 2. Defective rigging equipment shall be removed from service and either repaired or discarded. 3. Rigging equipment shall not be loaded in excess of its recommended safe working load, as prescribed in Appendix A. 4. The rigger must know the weight of the load and rated capacities of any rigging or rigging hardware. 5. The load should be attached at the center of gravity. 6. Slings should be protected from any sharp edges. 7. Shop hooks and links, or makeshift fasteners, formed from bolts, rods, etc., or other such attachments, shall not be used. 8. Welded alloy steel chain slings shall have permanently affixed durable identification stating size, grade, rated capacity, and sling manufacturer. 9. Wire rope shall not be used if, in any length of eight diameters, the total number of visible broken wires exceeds 10 percent of the total number of wires, or if the rope shows other signs of excessive wear, corrosion, or defect. 10. Slings shall not be shortened with knots or bolts or other makeshift devices. 11. Shock loading is prohibited. Inspection of Rigging 1. Chain slings should not have any of the following; a.) Excessive wear b.) Missing or illegible tags c.) Bent hooks d.) Twisted or bent links e.) Severe corrosion 2. Synthetic web slings should not have any of the following; a.) Snags, punctures, tears, or cuts b.) Broken or worn stitching c.) Illegible or missing tag d.) Burns, melted or charred e.) Any other conditions that may reduce the load rating 3. Wire rope slings should not have any of the following; a.) Missing or illegible tag b.) Kinking, crushing or other damage to the braided structure c.) Bent hooks d.) Severe corrosion e.) Visible broken strands exceed 10% of total strands The rated capacities for all rigging equipment shall meet all OSHA regulations. See the following tables for more details. Roadwork 76 Purpose Due to the hazardous conditions surrounding roadwork it is important to understand how to protect yourself and the passing motorists from becoming involved in a serious accident. There may be times when work is being done besides passing vehicles and/or lanes may need to be restricted or blocked. Many motorists to day are either in a hurry or are preoccupied with cell phones, i -pods, and the many other gadgets that distract drivers' attention away from the roadway. The following steps will be taken where roadwork affects traffic, and is referred to as work zone activity. Safe Work Practices 1. When working near traffic or heavy equipment you must wear a highly visible shirt or vest (CLASS 2). Highly visible means a color such as florescent yellow -green, florescent orange -red, or a florescent combination of these colors. 2. During night you must wear retro reflective vest (CLASS 2) and hardhat. 3. Work or station yourself where drivers can see you. Don't place yourself in shaded areas or too close to other objects that may obscure the motorist's vision and prevent them from seeing you. 4. Never stand behind a backing vehicle unless you can see its mirrors. 5. Radios, i-pods, and similar devices are prohibited. Stay alert at all times. Protective Measures 1. Traffic control plan - Describes the measures used to keep traffic moving safely and efficiently through the work zone. 2. Signs - Regulatory, warning, and guide signs are the 3 types of traffic control signs. 3. Flaggers - There may be times when signs or signals do not provide enough protection for roadway operations and Flaggers may be needed. Flagging is dangerous because it exposes the Flaggers to traffic. All Flaggers must be trained to meet MUTCD standards. 4. Signals - warn of possible or existing hazards and include sign paddles, flags, digital message boards, and flashing arrow displays. 5. Channelization devices - May include, but are not limited to, cones, tubular markers, drums, vertical panels, barricades, and temporary islands. These devices protect workers in the work zone, warn and alert drivers to conditions created by road work and guide motorists. PennDOT Requirements Whenever work is being performed for PennDOT the following PPE and rules apply: 1. Hardhats must be worn at all times. Exception would be if you remain inside an enclosed cab of truck or equipment. As soon as you step outside the cab, the hardhat must be on. 2. Safety vests must be at least CLASS 2 (florescent 360E green), or shirts (florescent yellow -green) must be worn at all times while not in an enclosed cab. 3. Flaggers must have successfully completed a Flaggers training course under standards set forth by MUTCD within the past 3 years. Trained Flaggers shall carry a valid training card with name, signature, and date of training or the Safety Manager can provide a roster of all trained Flaggers to the Engineer prior to the start of flagging operations that contains the names of the Flaggers, training source, and date of completion. Sanitation Requirements 77 Due to the remote location of most jobsites, the availability of certain sanitary requirements becomes a problem. The following guidelines are the minimum standards required on the site. Portable Drinking Water Adequate supply shall be provided in all places of employment. Containers must be tightly closed and have a tap. Containers shall be clearly marked. Single service cups must be provided. No common drinking cup. Disposal facilities shall be provided for discarded cups. Toilet Facilities Toilets shall be provided for employees as follows: Number of Employees Minimum number of facilities 20 or less 1 toilet 20 or more 1 toilet seat and 1 urinal per 40 workers 200 or more 1 toilet seat and 1 urinal per 50 workers Sites without sanitary sewers must be provided with one of the following: Privies (where the use will not contaminate ground or surface water) Chemical toilets Recirculation toilets Combustion toilets Scaffolding Safety 78 Purpose It is this company's purpose in issuing these procedures to further ensures a safe workplace based on the following formal, written procedures for scaffold work. These procedures will be reviewed and updated as needed to comply with new OSHA regulations, new best practices in scaffolding, and as business practices demand. Application This general scaffold plan applies to 1. All employees who perform work while on a scaffold. 2. All employees who are involved in erecting, disassembling, moving, operating, repairing, maintaining, or inspecting scaffolds. General Procedures The following general procedures apply to all scaffold operations for Stewart and Tate, Inc. Capacity 1. Each scaffold and scaffold component we use will support, without failure, its own weight and at least four times the maximum intended load applied or transmitted to it. 2. When we use non -adjustable suspension scaffolds, each suspension rope, including connecting hardware, will support, without failure, at least six times the maximum inten ded load applied or transmitted to that rope. Platform Construction The following safety rules apply for this scaffold platform construction: 1. Each scaffold plank will be installed so that the space between adjacent planks and the space between the platform and uprights is no more than one inch wide. If, in certain situations, we need to make this space wider, we will attach our demonstration in the appendix to this plan. 2. Except for outrigger scaffolds (3 inches) and plastering and lathing operations (18 inches), the front edge of all platforms will not be more than 14 inches from the face of the work, unless we have a guardrail or personal fall arrest system in place that meets regulations. The following additional construction and safety information is included depending on the type of scaffold being erected. Supported Scaffolds 1. Supported scaffolds with a height to base width ratio of more than four to one (4:1) must be restrained from tipping by guying, tying, bracing, or equivalent means. 2. Supported scaffold poles, legs, posts, frames, and uprights will always bear on base plates and mud sills or other adequate firm foundations. 79 Suspension Scaffolds 1. Before a scaffold is used, a competent person will evaluate connections. Our competent person will confirm, based on the evaluation, that the supporting surfaces are capable of supporting the loads that will be imposed. 2. When winding drum hoists are used on a suspension scaffold, they will never contain less than four wraps of the suspension rope at the lowest point of scaffold travel. Gaining Access to Scaffolds We know that getting to the working platform is critical to the safety of our employees. This section outlines the mechanical requirements for gaining access to scaffold platforms such as: 1. Ladders 2. Ramps and walkways 3. Stair rails 4. Direct access from another scaffold. This section is divided into two parts. The first part is for workers gaining access to scaffold platforms to do work; the second part is access for employees erecting and dismantling scaffolds. Working Employees: 1. Portable, hook -on, and attachable ladders will be positioned so as not to tip the scaffold. 2. All stair rail systems and handrails will be surfaced to prevent injury to employees from punctures or lacerations, and to prevent snagging of their clothes. Fall Protection Plan Fall protection planning is critical to the safety and well being of our employees. Our fall protection plan follows the OSHA requirements, which are different depending on the type of scaffold we are using. In this plan, we address fall protection for our scaffold erectors and dismantlers separately. One fact never changes. We know we must provid e fall protection for any employee on a scaffold more than 10 feet above a lower level. Working Employees : This fall protection plan for our working employees is for the following type(s) of scaffold(s): Single or two-point adjustable suspension scaffold 1. We will protect each employee on our single - or two-point adjustable suspension scaffolds by a personal fall arrest system. 2. Our personal fall arrest systems meet the requirements of 1926.502(d) (OSHA's fall protection rule). Self-contained adjust able scaffold supported by the frame structure We will protect each employee on our self-contained, frame structure supported, adjustable scaffolds by a guardrail system. The guardrail system: 1. Has a minimum 200-pound top rail capacity. 2. Will be installed before being released for use by our employees Falling Object Protection All employees must wear hardhats when working on, assembling, or dismantling scaffolds. This is our primary protection from falling objects. Additionally, we will: 80 1. Install all guardrail systems with openings small enough to prevent passage of potential falling objects. 2. Prevent tools, materials, or equipment that inadvertently fell from our scaffolds from striking employees by barricading the area below the scaffold. Using Scaffolds Site preparation, scaffold erection, fall protection, and gaining access to the working platform are only part of the requirements for scaffold work. While this all takes concentration and safe work practices, the most dangerous time can be when employees are concentrating on their work and not particularly aware of the hazards of working from scaffolds. It is critical that employees who use scaffolds be trained, among other things, in the recognition of the hazards associated with the type of scaffold being used and to understand the procedures to control or minimize those hazards. Our competent person will inspect all scaffolds and scaffold components for visible defects before each work shift, and after any occurrence, which could affect a scaffold's structural integrity. However, in addition to that, all users of scaffolds in this company will know and understand the following safety rules: 1. Scaffolds and scaffold components will never be loaded in excess of their maximum intended loads or rated capacities. 2. Debris must not be allowed to accumulate on platforms. Specific Procedures In addition to the general procedures in this written safety plan, there are procedures that apply to specific types of scaffolds. The safety rules for these specific types of scaffolds are found in 1926.452. Prohibited Practices The following practices will not be tolerated: 1. Scaffold components manufactured by different manufacturers will never be interm ixed unless the components fit together without force and the scaffold's structural integrity is maintained. 2. Unstable objects will never be used to support scaffolds or platform units. Footings must be level, sound, rigid, and capable of supporting the loa ded scaffold without settling or displacement. 3. Cross braces will never be used as a means of access. 4. The use of shore or lean-to scaffolds is prohibited. 5. Scaffold components manufactured by different manufacturers will never be intermixed unless the components fit together without force and the scaffold's structural integrity is maintained. 6. Unstable objects will never be used to support scaffolds or platform units. Footings must be level, sound, rigid, and capable of supporting the loaded scaffold without settling or displacement. 7. Cross braces will never be used as a means of access. 8. The use of shore or lean-to scaffolds is prohibited. 81 Duties of Competent and Qualified Persons When working with scaffolds in this company there are some tasks that must be done by our competent or qualified person. By definition they are: 1. Competent Person: One who is capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings or working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to employees, and who has authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them. 2. Qualified Person: One who, by possession of a recognized degree, certificate, or professional standing, or who by extensive knowledge, training and experience, has successfully demonstrated his/her ability to solve or resolve problems related to the subject matter, the work, or the project. Qualified Person: 1. Scaffolds must be designed by a qualified person and shall be constructed and loaded in accordance with that design. 2. Swaged attachments or spliced eyes on wire suspension ropes of suspension scaffolds will not be used unless they are made by the wire rope manufacturer or a qualified person. 3. We will have each employee who performs work while on a scaffold trained by a person qualified in the subject matter to recognize the hazards associated with the type of scaffold being used and to understand the procedures to control or m inimize those hazards. Training Recognizing the need for training for employees who: 1. Perform work while on scaffolds, 2. Are involved in erecting, disassembling, moving, operating, repairing, maintaining, or inspecting scaffolds, and 3. Have lost the requisite proficiency, the following training syllabus is a part of this written safety plan. Employees Who Use Scaffolds: Our employees who perform work on scaffolds will be trained by a qualified person to recognize the hazards associated with the type of scaffold being used and to understand the procedures to control or minimize those hazards. The training will include the following areas as applicable: 1. The nature of and the correct procedures for dealing with electrical hazards. 2. The nature of and the correct procedures for erecting, maintaining, and disassembling the fall protection and falling object protection systems used. 3. The proper use of the scaffold, and the proper handling of materials on the scaffold. 4. The maximum intended load and the load-carrying capacities of the scaffolds used. 5. Any other pertinent requirements of the OSHA rules. Employees, Who Erect, Disassemble, Move, Operate, Repair, Maintain, or Inspect Scaffolds: Our employees who erect, disassemble, move, operate, repair, maintain, or inspect scaffolds will be trained by our competent person to recognize the hazards associated with the work being 82 done. The training will include the following topics as applicable: 1. The nature of scaffold hazards 2. The correct procedures for erecting, disassembling, moving, operating, repairing, inspecting, and maintaining the type of scaffold in question 3. The design criteria, maximum intended load -carrying capacity, and intended use of the scaffold 4. Any other pertinent requirements of this subpart Employees Who Need Retraining: When we have reason to believe that one of our employees lacks the skill or understanding needed for safe work involving the erection, use or dismantling of scaffolds, we will retrain the employee so that the requisite proficiency is regained. Retraining will be done in at least the following situations: 1. Where changes at the worksite present a hazard about which the employee has not been previously trained. 2. Where changes in the types of scaffolds, fall protection, falling object protection, or other equipment present a hazard about which an employee has not been previously trained. 3. Where inadequacies in an affected employee's work involving scaffolds indicate that the employee has not retained the requisite proficiency. 83 Steel Erection Erectors who are on a walking/working surface with an unprotected edge more than 15 feet above a lower level must be protected by conventional fall protection system approved by OSHA. Perimeter safety cables must be installed at the final interior and exte rior perimeters of multi -story structures as soon as the decking has been installed . Connectors and employees working in controlled decking zones must be protected from fall hazards by conventional fall protection when working on a surface with an unprotected edge more than two stories or 30 feet above a lower level; and have completed the connector training as required by OSHA. While working at heights over 15 and up to 30 feet , connectors must be provided with a complete personal fall arrest system or other allowable fall protection, and wear the equipment necessary for tying off. A Controlled Decking Zone (CDZ) can be established as a substitute for fall protection where metal decking is initially being installed and forms the leading edge of a work area over 15 and up to 30 feet above a lower level. Leading -edge workers in a CDZ are required to be protected from fall hazards above 2 stories or 30 feet (whichever is less), and have completed CDZ training in accord ance OSHA standards. Employees who are not engaged in leading -edge work and properly trained in the hazards involved are prohibited from entering the CDZ. The CDZ is required to be no more than 90 feet wide and 90 feet deep from any leading edge; not exceed 3,000 square feet of unsecured decking; and have designated and clearly marked boundaries with control lines or the equivalent. It must also have safety deck attachments placed from the leading edge back to the control line, and have at least two safety deck attachments for each metal decking panel. Lastly, final deck attachments and the installation of shear connectors are prohibited from being done in the CDZ. 84 Minimum Clearance in inches Temporary Heat Temporary heat is a necessary requirement for winter work and if used properly it will be an asset to finishing a project in a timely manner.

The procedures here establish uniform requirements designed to ensure that welding and cutting safety training, operation, and maintenance practices are communicated to and understood by the affected employees. These requ irements also are designed to ensure that procedures are in place to safeguard the health and safety of all employees. It is our intent to comply with the requirements of 29 CFR 1926.350 through .354. These regulations have requirements for welding and cutting operations. We also comply with applicable requirements of: Standard or Regulation: Name: ANSI Z49.1 -1967 Safety in Welding and Cutting CGA Pamphlet P-1-1965 Safe Handling of Compressed Gases 29 CFR 1926, Subpart D Occupational Health and Environmental Controls 29 CFR 1926, Subpart E Personal Protective And Life Saving Equipment 29 CFR 1926.406(c) Electrical \u2014Specific Purpose Equipment and Installations 49 CFR 192 Minimum Federal Safety Standards for Gas Pipelines 49 CFR 178, Subpart C Specifications for Cylinders Administrative Duties Safety Manager is responsible for developing and maintaining the written Welding & Cutting Procedures. These procedures are kept at the following location: Safety Manager's office. Training It is the policy of Stewart and Tate, Inc. to permit only trained and authorized personnel to operate welding and cutting equipment. The Safety Manager will identify all new employees in the employee orientation program and make arrangements with department management to schedule training. The following person(s) will conduct initial training and evaluation: Safety Manager coordinates all training requirements. This instructor(s) has the necessary knowledge, training, and experie nce to train new welding and cutting equipment operators. The qualifications include a certified welder who provides the hands on training and the Safety Manager conducts the in class safety training. Initial Training Our classroom instruction includes the following formats: Lecture, discussion, and videotapes. Our practical training includes these formats: Demonstrations, practical exercises, and hands -on instruction. All welders and cutters are trained and tested on the equipment they will be operating before they begin their job. 86 The operational hazards of welding and cutting operations include: 1. Hazards associated with the particular make and model of the welding and cutting equipment 2. Hazards of the workplace; and 3. General hazards that apply to the operation of all or most welding and cutting equipment 4. An outside company does training. Training Certification After an employee has completed the training program, the instructor will determine whether th e potential welder or cutter can safely perform the job. At this point, the trainee will take a performance test or practical exercise through which the instructor(s) will decide if the training has been adequate. All welding and cutting trainees are tested on the equipment they will be operating. The Safety Manager is responsible for keeping records certifying that each employee who has successfully completed training and testing. Each certificate includes the name of the employee, the date(s) of the training, and the signature of the person who did the training and evaluation. Performance Evaluation Each certified welder or cutter is evaluated annually to verify that the welder or cutter has retained and uses the knowledge and skills needed to operate safely. The Safety Manager does this evaluation. If the evaluation shows that the welder or cutter is lacking the appropriate skills and knowledge, the welder or cutter is retrained by our instructor(s). When a welder or cutter has an accident or near miss or some unsafe operating procedure is identified, we do retraining. Current Welders and Cutters Under no circumstances may an employee operate welding or cutting equipment until he/she has successfully completed this company's welding and cutting training program. This includes all new welders and cutters regardless of claimed previous experience. All employees have a general obligation to work safely with and around welding and cutting operations. Fall Protection 1. A platform with railings, or safety harness and lifeline will be used when welding or cutting above ground or floor levels and there are falling hazards. 2. A clear welding or cutting area will be maintained to prevent slips, trips, and falls. Maintenance Any deficiencies found in our welding and cutting equipment are repaired, or defective parts replaced, before continued use. However, no modifications or additions that affect the capacity or safe operation of the equipment may be made without the manufacturer 's written approval. If such modifications or changes are made, the capacity, operation, and maintenance instruction plates, tags, or decals, must be changed accordingly. In no case may the original safety factor of the equipment be reduced. 87 While defective parts may be found, we prefer to invest time and effort into the proper upkeep of our equipment, which results in day -to-day reliability. Keeping up with the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedules, and completing the proper records, will also increase our welding and cutting equipment's longevity. Small Tool Manger completes a receiving or delivery inspection whenever our company purchases welding and cutting equipment. Small Tool Manager follows the manufacturer's operator instruction manual for daily or weekly maintenance. Periodic maintenance (those completed monthly or less frequently) is done by a factory -trained -expert, or a dealer.

When the body is unable to warm or cool itself, heat or cold related stress can result. Heat and cold stress can contribute t o adverse health effects which range in severity from discomfort to death. The Safety Department has developed this Heat and Cold Stress Safety Program to minimize the effects of heat and cold stress to Stewart and Tate employees. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) does not currently have specific standards for heat or cold stress. However, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 General Duty Clause (Section 5(a)(1)) states that \"Each employer shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.\" In addition, 29 CFR Subpart I relating to personal protective equ ipment requires employers to provide protection to employees exposed to hazards in the workplace. The OSHA website contains Fact Sheets and Guidance Documents that relate to heat and cold stress that have been incorporated into this program. Responsibili ties Safety Department: Safety shall maintain, review, and update this program as needed. Safety will also provide monitoring, upon request, and assist employees with the development of procedures to minimize the adverse effects of heat and cold stress in the workplace. Supervisors: Each supervisor managing employees exposed to heat and/or cold stress has the following responsibilities: Review and comply with the provisions outlined in this program. Ensure all employees are properly trained before working in extreme temperature conditions. Document any in-person training conducted Assess the day-to-day heat or cold stresses on employees. Assess employees' workload and assigning work and rest schedules as needed. Ensure all employees have the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) prior to working in extreme temperature conditions. Ensure employees are familiar with this safety program. Employees: Employees exposed to heat and/or cold stress when performing their job duties have the following responsibilities: Review and comply with the provisions outlined in this program. Complete training before working in extreme temperature conditions. Wear the appropriate PPE. Report heat and cold stress concerns to their supervisor. Heat Related Illness: Signs, Treatment and Prevention Signs and Treatment While working in hot conditions, the human body may not be able to maintain a normal temperature just by sweating. If this happens, heat -related illnesses may occur. The most common health problems caused by hot work environments include: Heat stroke - This is the most serious heat related effect. Heat stroke occurs when the body temperature increases above 1040F. Signs and symptoms of heat stroke are confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures, and lack of perspiration. This condition must be treated as a medical emergency and the employee must receive immediate medical attention. While waiting on medical assistance, the victim should b e moved to a cool/shaded area, cooled with water/wet towels/ice packs, and fanned to increase cooling. Heat exhaustion - Signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion include headache, nausea, dizziness, weakness, irritability, confusion, thirst, heavy perspiration and a body temperature greater than 100.40F. Employees experiencing heat exhaustion should be moved to a cool area, gi ven fluids to drink and given cold compresses for their head, face and neck. Employees should also be taken to a clinic or emergency room to be monitored by medical personnel. Heat cramps - Signs and symptoms of heat cramps include muscle pains usually caused by the loss of body salts/fluids, this can happen later as well. Employees should replace fluid loss by drinking water and/or carbohydrate -electrolyte replacement liquids (e.g. Gatorade ) every 15 to 20 minutes. If cramps are severe, seek medical attention. Heat rash - Heat rash is caused by excessive perspiration and looks like a red cluster of pimples or small blisters. Heat rash usually appears on the neck, upper chest, in the groin, u nder the breasts and in elbow creases. Treatment for heat rash is to provide a cooler, less humid environment. Dehydration - Dehydration is a major factor in most heat disorders. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include increasing thirst, dry mouth, weakn ess or light -headedness (particularly if worse upon standing), and a darkening of the urine or a decrease in urination. Dehydration can be reversed or put back in balance by drinking fluids that contain electrolytes (i.e. Gatorade) that are lost during work related activities. Avoid caffeinated drinks. Prevention While heat related illness are dangerous and potentially life threating, they can be prevented. Prevention methods include: Acclimation - Acclimation is a process by which the physical processes of an employee's body adjusts to the environment over a period of time. Based on data obtained from OSHA, this process usually takes five to seven days. This process could take up to three weeks dep ending on the individual and their work environment. According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association, the process requires a consistent work level for at least two hours each day during the acclimation period in order for an employee to become acc limatized. Mere exposure to heat does not confer acclimatization, nor does acclimatization at one heat stress level confer resistance to heat stress at a higher temperature or more vigorous workload. Employees who are not adequately acclimatized to the hea t may experience temporary heat fatigue resulting in a decline in performance, coordination or alertness. They may also become irritable or depressed. This can be prevented through gradual adjustment to the hot environment. People in good physical condition tend to acclimatize better because their cardiovascular systems respond better. Engineering Controls - For employees working indoors, the best way to prevent heat -related illness is to make the work environment cooler. Where and if possible, use air conditioning to cool the work area. Alternatively, increase the general ventilation as much as possible by opening windows or doors. When available, use cooling fans to aid in increasing ventilation. Safe Work Practices - For employees working outdoors or working indoors without air conditioning or ventilation, take scheduled breaks in cool areas. Ensure there i s plenty of cool water to drink and take water breaks as needed. Immediately report any problems to a supervisor. Supervisors should consider scheduling the hottest work for the coolest part of day, assigning extra employees to high demand tasks, and using work -saving devices (e.g. power tools, hoists or lifting aids) to reduce the body's work load. All employees should watch out for the safety of their coworkers. Heat Index - The Heat Index is a single numeric value that uses both temperature and humidity to inform the public on how the weather outdoors \"feels\". The higher the Heat Index, the hotter the weather feels. OSHA has used the Heat Index to assign protective measures for workers as the Heat Index increases. These protective measures may reduce the likelihood of heat related illnesses. The Heat Index and related protective measures are contained in Appendix A. Cold -Related Illness and Injuries: Signs, Treatment and Prevention Signs and Treatment During cold weather, an employee's body w ill use energy to maintain a normal internal body temperature. This will result in a shift of blood flow from employee's extremities (hands, feet and legs) and outer skin to the employee's core (chest and abdomen). If this happens, cold - related illnesses and injuries may occur if exposed to cold conditions for an extended period of time. The most common health problems caused by cold work environments include: Hypothermia - Hypothermia is a potentially serious health condition. Hypothermia occurs when body heat is lost faster than it can be replaced. When the core body temperature drops to approximately 95\u00b0F, the onset of symptoms normally begins. The employee may begin to shiver, lose coordination, have slurred speech, and fumble with items in the hand. The employee's skin will likely be pale and cold. As the body temperature continues to fall these symptoms will worsen and shivering will stop. Once the body temperature falls to around 85\u00b0F severe hypothermia will develop and the person may become unconscious, and at 78\u00b0F, vital organs may begin to fail. Treatment depends on the severity of the hypothermia. For cases of mild hypothermia move to warm area and stay active. Remove wet clothes and replace with dry clothes or blankets, cover the head. To promote metabolism and assist in raising internal core temperature drink a warm (not hot) sugary drink. Avoid drinks with caffeine. For more severe cases do al l the above, plus contact emergency medical personnel (Call 911 for an ambulance), cover all extremities completely, place very warm objects, such as hot packs or water bottles on the victim's head, neck, chest and groin. Arms and legs should be warmed las t. In cases of severe hypothermia, treat the employee very gently and do not apply external heat to rewarm. Hospital treatment is required. Frostbite - Frostbite occurs when the skin freezes and loses water. In severe cases, amputation of the frostbitten a rea may be required. While frostbite usually occurs when the temperatures are 30\u00b0 F or lower, wind chill factors can allow frostbite to occur in above freezing temperatures. Frostbite typically affects the extremities, particularly the feet and hands. The affected body part will be cold, tingling, stinging or aching followed by numbness. Skin color turns red, then purple, then white, and is cold to the touch. There may be blisters in severe cases. Do not rub the area to warm it. Wrap the area in a soft clot h, move the employee to a warm area, and contact medical personnel. Do not leave the employee alone. If help is delayed, immerse in warm (maximum 105 \u00b0F), not hot, water. Do not pour water directly on affected part. If there is a chance that the affected p art will get cold again do not warm. Repeated heating and cooling of the skin may cause severe tissue damage. Trench Foot - Trench Foot is caused by having feet exposed to damp, unsanitary and cold conditions including water at temperatures above freezing for long periods of time. It is similar to frostbite, but considered less severe. Symptoms usually consist of tingling, itc hing or burning sensation. Blisters may be present. For treatment, soak feet in warm water, then wrap with dry cloth bandages. Drink a warm, sugary drink. Seek medical attention if necessary. Dehydration - It is easy to become dehydrated during cold weathe r. Signs of dehydration include increasing thirst, dry mouth, weakness or light -headedness (particularly if worse upon standing), and a darkening of the urine or a decrease in urination. Dehydration can be reversed or put back in balance by drinking fluids that contain electrolytes (i.e. Gatorade) that are lost during work related activities. Avoid caffeinated drinks. Prevention Just as with heat related illness, cold related illnesses and injuries are dangerous and potentially life threating, however, they can be prevented. Prevention methods include: Acclimation - Employees exposed to the cold should be physically fit, without any circulatory, metabolic, or neurologic diseases that may place them at increased risk for hypothermia. A new employee should not be required to work in the cold full time during the first days of employment until they become adjusted to the working conditions and required protective clothing. New employees should be introduced to the work schedule slowly and be trained accordingly. Engineering Controls - For employees working indoors, the b est way to prevent cold -related illness is to make the work environment warmer. Where and if possible, use heaters to warm the work area. Alternatively, decrease the general ventilation as much as possible by closing windows or doors. Safe Work Practices - For employees working outdoors or working indoors without heat, take scheduled breaks in warm areas. If available, use wind barricades to block the wind from the employees. Ensure there is plenty of water to drink and take water breaks as needed. Immediately report any problems to a supervisor. Supervisors should consider scheduling the most work for the warmest part of day, assigning extra employees to high demand tasks that will require longer periods in cold areas. All employees should watch out for the safety of their coworkers. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) - PPE is an important factor in preventing cold stress related illnesses and injuries. Employees should adhere to the following recommendations when dressing for work in a cold environ ment: Wear at least three layers of clothing; an inner layer of wool, silk or synthetic to wick moisture away from the body; a middle layer of wool or synthetic to provide insulation even when wet; an outer wind and rain protection layer that allows some ventilation to prevent overheating. Wear a hat or hood; up to 40% of body heat can be lost when the head is left exposed. Wear insulated boots or other footwear. Do not wear tight clothing; loose clothing provides better ventilation. Keep a change of clothing available in case work clothes become wet. The Cold Stress Equation - OSHA has incorporated information obtained from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit values into the Cold Stress Equation. As the temperature decreases and/or the wind speed increases, the potential for cold stress related illnesses and injuries increases. The Cold Stress Equation and the Wind Chill Temperature Index is contained in Appendix B. Appendix A: Heat Index The heat index is a simple tool and a useful guide for employers/employees making decisions about protecting employees in hot weather. It does not account for certain conditions that contribute additional risk, such as physical exer tion. Consider taking the steps at the next highest risk level to protect employees from the added risks posed by: Working in the direct sun (can add up to 15\u00b0F to the heat index value) Wearing heavy clothing or protective gear Appendix A: Heat Index Continued... Appendix B: Wind Chill Temperature Index BLOODBORNE PATHOGEN EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN For Compliance With OSHA 1910.1030 1 BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN In accordance with the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 1910.1030, the following exposure control plan has been developed: A. Purpose The Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Program is to reduce occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. B. Exposure Determination Designated employees that may come into contact with human blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM): (list job classifications) 1. Superintendents 2. Project Manager 3. Field Personnel 4. Authorized Visitors C. Methods of Compliance Universal Precautions will be utilized in the handling of all human blood and OPIM's. D. Engineering Controls 1. Hand sinks or hand sanitizer is located on all jobsites and are readily accessible to all employees who have the potential for exposure. 2. Employees will wash their hands and any other exposed skin with soap and hot water immediately or as soon as possible after contact with blood or OPIM, for 15 seconds, in a manner causing friction on both inner and outer surfaces of the hands. 3. Employees will be provided with antiseptic hand cleaner and paper towels when hand washing is not feasible. However, hand washing must still take place as soon as possible after exposure. 2 4. Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm and handling contact lenses is prohibited in work areas where there is the potential for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. 5. If professional medical attention is required, a local ambulance will be the first choice; a personal car will be the second. If a personal car is taken, impervious material should be used to prevent contamination of the vehicle. 6. New employees or employee being transferred to will receive tr aining about any potential exposures. E. Personal Protective Equipment All personal protective equipment used at this facility will be provided without cost to employees. Personal protective equipment will be chosen based on the anticipated exposure to blood or OPIM. The protective equipment will be considered appropriate only if it does not permit blood or OPIM to pass through or reach the employees' clothing, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes under normal conditions of use. F. Disposal of Contaminated Items and Communication of Hazard 1. Employees must: a. Use bleach to disinfect any blood or OPIM. b. Apply the bleach with single -use gloves and allow to sit for 15 minutes. c. Place any single -use gloves that have been contaminated in a biohazardgarbage bag and cover. d. Dispose of the bag. 2. Regulated waste should be placed in appropriate containers, label and dispose of in accordance with applicable state, federal and local laws. G. Housekeeping Maintaining our work areas in a clean and sanitary condition is an important part of Stewart & Tate Inc. Bloodborne Pathogens Compliance Program. Employees must decontaminate working surfaces and equipment with an appropriate disinfectant after completing procedures involving blood or OPIM. All equipment, 3 environmental surfaces and work surfaces shall be decontaminated immediately or as soon as feasible after contamination. 1. Employees must clean and disinfect when surfaces become contaminated and after any spill of blood or OPIM. 2. Employees will use a solution of one part bleach to ten parts water for cleaning and disinfecting. 3. Working surfaces and equipment will be cleaned, disinfected and maintain. 4. Potentially contaminated broken glass will be picked up using mechanical means, such as dustpan and brush, tongs, etc. 5.

It is no substitute for common sense measures. Failure to comply will lead to investigation and disciplinary consequences 2-3. Safety philosophy At Bioenergy DevCo, safety is conside red a condition of employment. The safety program protects the employee, company assets and the environment. Safety is built into the culture of the organization as well as the engineering and design of a facility. While no facility can be guaranteed free from risk of injury, the intent is to minimize risk and every employee has the right to a safe work environment. BDC is dedicated to promoting and providing a Safe and Healthy Workplace using the following principles: Safety will be the responsibility of Management, Supervisors, and all Associates. Management and all Associates will be instructed on their responsibilities within the company structure and company Safety Policies and Procedures. Associates will be trained on the proper Safe ty Methods to use while performing their individual job assignments and responsibilities. All Associates will be properly trained in Accident Prevention to avoid the hazards associated within our industry, company, and individual job assignments. Records of all Safety Training will be kept on file by the Facility Manager, and Safety Director. Records will be available for review by any associate during normal business hours. Company Management will continually monitor the effectiveness of the Safety & Health Program. Company Management will have Associate Safety & Health and the Reduction of Claims as one of its priorities and goals. All Federal, State, Regional ai1d Local Safety Rules & Regulations and Codes and Standards pertaining to Safety and Health will be strictly adhered to and enforced. Employees will be coached and monitored through orientation and training. Communication and teamwork are to be practiced. IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING. All staff must be dedicated to the idea that every accident can be prevented and that all elements of our Safety Program are necessary to ensure that safety gets first consideration in all areas of responsibility. We must all pledge our personal commitment to safety as a way of life and b e guided by the conviction that \"no job is so important and no service is so urgent that we cannot take the time to perform our work safely\". 2-4. Requirements for EHS compliance BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 11 of 129 Compliance emanates from BDC concern and respect for the worker's right to a safe and healthy work experience. Concern and respect cultivate teamwork. State and federal law guides and enforces EHS standards. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) does not require a specific training length. However, OSHA wants to ensure that employers are providing workplace specific training based of the hazards employees may encounter on the job. BDC has established minimum safety training standards for employees. 2-5. Incentives for safety performance Employees will be formally recognized for safe work history and promoting a safe, healthy work environment. 2-6. Disciplinary action for safety violation Lack of regard for safety procedures and careless attitude leads to a breakdown in responsible safety culture. Disciplinary action can be: Counseling/ warning Suspension with pay - deliberate or repeated violation after initial warning; re -training required Dismissal BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 12 of 129 SECTION 3 SAFETY RESPONSIBILITY AND PROGRAM OVERVIEW Safety is everyone's responsibility.

An emergency is defined as any situation where the health and safety of an associate is in danger. Emergency situations that could occur include but are not limited to: Tornado Hurricane Earthquake Fire Bomb threat Spills and gas releases Medical emergencies This plan is designed to protect associates and company property from danger or injury in the event of such circumstances. If the EEAP is changed or any responsibilities or duties associated with the plan are changed, associate s will be promptly notified. 7-1. Media Communication All interaction and communication with outside news media and associate's families will be coordinated through BDC Management. Only the BDC CEO (or designee) is authorized to make statements to the media. No company associates are to discuss, or release, information about ongoing emergency response with the news media. 7-2. EEAP Associate Training Emergency readiness is critical. All associates will be properly trained and capable of executing the EEAP according to their job classification. Management has identified specific hazards that could create or complicate emergency situations. Managers have the responsibility of training associates within their department annually. Newly hired associates will be trained prior to their initial assignment. An evacuation and emergency response/ action plan must be communicated and rehearsed. An overview with Muster Points and shelters to remain posted in a common area. Routine rehearsal drills will be performed quarterly. Types of training will include (but are not limited to) the following: 1. Written Emergency Action Plan. 2. Written evacuation procedures. 3. Alert signal(s) for evacuation. 4. Primary and secondary escape routes. 5. Designated assembly area and accountability. 6. Location of hazardous chemicals or materials in the facility. 7. Specific safety procedures unique to a department. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 24 of 129 7-3. Emergency Evacuation To provide for the safety of associates and visitors, it is essential that early warning of emergency situations be made so that evacuation procedures can be implemented, and emergency response organizations notified of the situation. Evacuation of associates and visitors from the facility is of the utmost importance. Most emergency situations will require the evacuation of all or part of the facility. To achieve a safe and timely evacuation, it is critical that an early warning of the emergency situation be communicated to personnel and action implemented to remove personnel from the hazard area. Management will immediately start actions, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the emergency. Each facility will follow their procedures outlined in the site-specific evacuation plan and: 1. Lead the associates from work areas when evacuation is warranted. 2. Provide necessary assistance to any associates with disabilities. This will be accomplished through the Facility Manager or his/her designee. 3. Escort associates to the designated assembly area. 4. Account for associates and guests at the designated assembly area. This will be accomplished by using timecards, work -assignment sheets, sign -in sheets, and the general knowledge of associates that everyone is accounted for. 5. Notify the Facil ity Manager or his designee with the names of associates not accounted for. Refer to Work Assignment Sheets for employees 6. Provide control of associates at assembly areas. Evacuation Drills Evacuation drills will be conducted at least every 6 months. Prior to the evacuation, all associates should be trained in the procedures outlined in your individual EAP. Copies of the emergency evacuation floor plans and procedures should be given to each associate. It is important that the associate understand that they must: Follow all directions. Form single file lines. No horseplay of any kind will be tolerated. Report to your designated meeting location. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 25 of 129 Once everyone is located at their designated meeting location, only the Facility Manager or his designee can give the clearance to enter the facility. Resuming Normal Activities Once the building has been evacuated, no one shall re -enter the building for any reason, except for designated and properly trained rescue personnel (such as fire department or emergency medical professionals). Untrained individuals may endanger themselves and/or those they are trying to rescue. All associates shall remain at the Designated Assembly Area until the fire department or other emergency response agency notifies The Facility Manager or his designee that either: The building is safe for re-entry, in which case personnel shall return to their workstations; or The building/assembly area is not safe, in which case personnel shall be instructed by The Facility Manager or his designee on how/when to vacate the premises. 7-4. Associate Procedures for Severe Weather Severe weather can take many forms, including tornado, hurricane, or earthquake. Of the types of severe weather listed, all of them could have an impact on Bioenergy Innovation Center. Management Pre-action Most severe weather situations provide some degree of warning or buildup, which will allow for necessary preparations to be implemented. During Thunderstorm season ensure NOAA Weather Radio (with warning alarm & battery backup) is functioning properly. During Tornado Watches, assign a specific person to monitor the radio. During high probability periods or during Tornado Watches, consider placing spotters to warn of approaching systems. This will be accomplished by Security or other outside personnel and all information will be broadcast over the short -wave radios. Pre-alert supervisors concerning the possibility of the need for directing associates to emergency shelter. Tornado watch Keep outdoor activities to a minimum. If outdoors, be observant for revolving, funnel -shaped clouds. Listen to the facility radio for weather updates. During Tornado Watches, place a sign at the main entrance & exit to notify people of the potentially hazardous condition. If a tornado is sighted, immediately take shelter, and notify the Facility Manager Tornado warning Immediately take shelter. Your best protection is a reinforced concrete or steel -framed structure. An interior hallway on the lowest level of the structure will be the safest. [Insert Map] Take action to protect yourself from being blown away or struck by falling or flying objects. Stay away BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 26 of 129 from windows to avoid flying debris. If a tornado is rapidly approaching and you cannot reach a safe shelter, lie flat in the nearest depression or ditch and cover your head with your arms. Types of shelters The best protection in a tornado is usually an underground area. The best above ground areas in a building are: Small interior rooms on the lowest floor without windows. Hallways on lowest floor away from outside doors and windows. Rooms constructed of reinforced concrete, brick or block with no windows and a heavy concrete floor or roof system. Buildings with flat, wide -span roofs are not considered safe. Each facility will have meeting points identified with signs. Earthquakes Earthquakes occur without warning. Some earthquakes are instantaneous tremors and others are significant events followed by aftershocks. Stay indoors if already there. If indoors take cover. Suggested locations inside buildings that provide cover include: Standing in a doorway and bracing your hands and feet against each side. Getting under sturdy furniture, such as worktables or desks. Standing flat against an interior wall. Stay near the center of the building and avoid glass windows and doors. If outdoors, stay in open areas, away from structures, and a safe distance from utility wires. After tremors have stopped quickly leave the building or work area and proceed to the designated emergency meeting location. If you encounter associates or visitors, then you should direct them to evacuate the building or work area and have them proceed to the designated emergency meeting location. Hurricane The nature of a hurricane provides for more warning than other natural and weather disasters. A hurricane watch issued when the hurricane becomes a threat to a coastal area. A hurricane warning is issued when sustained winds of 74 mph or higher, or a combination of danger ously high water and rough seas, are expected in the area within 24 hours. Once a hurricane watch has been issued: o Stay calm and await instructions from the Facility Manager. o Continue to monitor local TV and radio stations for instructions o Be ready to evacuate as directed by your Facility Manager. Flood BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 27 of 129 BIC is above the 500 -year flood plain. When preparing for a flood, a detailed checklist should be developed indicating the order in which processes are to be shut down and the electricity secured. The length of time needed - expressed in hours or days - to acco mplish these tasks should be determined in advance so that appropriate actions can be initiated at the proper time. Then, as each task is completed during either a flood watch or flood warning, check it off and move on to the next one. o Shut down processes safely and drain open tanks of flammable or combustible liquids. o Brace unsupported structural members at construction sites. o Up-date important backup records and move them to a location not vulnerable to flooding. o Anchor yard items that can be mo ved by floodwaters, such as trailers, lumber, or lose yard storage. Move stored materials inside if practical. Barricade critical outdoor equipment with sandbags to provide protection against floating debris. Assemble the following supplies and equipment at a central, secure location: o Portable pumps and hose o Mops and squeegees o Emergency lighting_ o Tarpaulins o Lumber and nails o Power and manual tools o Sandbags o Shovels and axes Ensure that the emergency crew remaining on the premises has the following: o Nonperishable food o Two -way radios o First Aid kit o Stored Drinking water Flood checklist: o Fill emergency generator and fire pump fuel tanks. o Inspect all fire protection equipment to be sure it is in service. o Check travel brakes on movable cranes and bridges. Anchor them in accordance with the manufacturer's out-of-service instructions o Place sandbags at vulnerable building openings and around critical outdoor equipment. o Divert water from critical areas such as holes in foundations, doorways, and skills. o Move important machinery, stock, and reports to higher elevations. By knowing the past flooding history of the area, reasonably safe areas can be selected. If major equipment cannot be moved, coat vulnerable metal surfaces with grease . o Shut off all flammable and combustible liquids and gases lines at their source to pre- vent the discharge of such liquids and gases from piping broken by floating debris. Support exposed piping properly. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 28 of 129 o Make sure above and below ground tanks are properly anchored to prevent flotation. Fill empty tanks with water or product and extend vent lines on active tanks above the anticipated maximum water level. o Tie down portable containers of flammable or combustible liquids. o Main gas and oil lines shut off. o All signs that are not bolted are to be taken inside Trash cans are to be put inside. o Receiving pit covered with tarp and tied down. Dump doors closed o Place all vehicles inside and with full fuel tanks if possible. Remove all overhead objects that are not secured permanently. Inspect each guide wire for tension and clamps. o All debris should be picked up and put away. 7-5. Medical Emergencies It may become necessary in an emergency to rescue personnel and perform some specified medical duties, including first-aid treatment. All associates assigned to perform such duties will have been properly trained and equipped to carry out their assigned responsibilities properly and safely. All Medical Emergency Care Providers will use the proper PPEs as outlined in the Control of Blood -home Pathogens Program and will follow the proper standards of care. All injured or ill associates requiring emergency medical care for life/death medical emergencies will be transported by local Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to the nearest local Hospital. All non -life/death medical emergencies will be managed by the (Occupational Hea lth Care Nurse) and the Facility Manger or his/her designee. All associates who are involved in an injury or accident shall be screened for drugs and alcohol as prescribed by company policy. 7-6. Incident Response - general See Incident Reporting Release: The term \"release\" means any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping or disposing into the environment (including the abandonment or discarding of barrels, containers and other closed receptacles) of any hazardous chemical, extremely hazardous substance or toxic chemical. 7-7. Gas release Gas release is defined as the unintended release of fumes or process gasses to the atmosphere, indoor or outdoor. 7-8. Spill Response and prevention plan Spills are defined as the unintended release of liquid to an uncontained surface, such as water and land, pervious or impervious. The first action is to contact the Supervisor on hand BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 29 of 129 Containment Plan A spill containment plan submitted to DNREC Environmental authorities Contain the spill with the appropriate containment equipment as required by the volume of spill 1-5 gallons can be absorbed by adsorbent powder/ pellets or absorbent pads Spills 5 -55 gallons c an be contained by sock tube type booms until adsorbed by wood chips/ compost.

Do not attempt to clean the spill unless trained to do so. Before cleaning up spills don the proper PPE. Consult MSDS/SDS sheets for information on clean up and disposal instructions. Spill Reporting Spills will be reported as required to the DNREC Emergency Response at 1 -800-662-8802 . Report will be made to Compliance and Permitting Section (C APS) within 24 hours, report in 5 business days. Spills of any quantity that have the potential to impact surface or groundwater (permeating the soil) will be reported . For spills that are contained on an impermeable surface that do not have the potential to flow into surface water or impact groundwater, spi ll quantities will be reported in excess of specified amounts below within any rolling 24 hour period: -25 gallons for petroleum substances, heating oil, motor fuel, used oil -150 gallons for petroleum subs., other than heating oil, motor fuel, used oil -10,000 gallons for any poultry related liquid feedstocks - Other hazardous chemicals on -site will be identified 7-9. Fire Response When an associate becomes aware of a fire on the facility, he/she will immediately notify his/her supervisor. Firefig hting is a specialized skill to be conducted by authorized and trained associates only. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 30 of 129 Prevention Fire Prevention and Safety is described in depth in Section 23. Fire prevention and reporting procedures for compost plant permit requirements must be adhered. Small Fires If the fire is small and localized or in the incipient phase (beginning stage), the Facility Manager or his designee will direct associates to leave the immediate area. The Facility Manager or his/her designee may then direct associates trained in the use of fire extinguishers to put out the small fire. The Facility Manager or his/her designee who was notified has communication responsibilities and will not involve himself/herself in firefighting. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 31 of 129 If the fire appears to be spreading, then the affected Facility Manager or his/her designee will direct the associates fighting the fire to evacuate. The Facility Manager or his/her designee will then implement the procedure for large fires found in the next section. Associates evacuated from the area shall not be allowed to return until the fire has been completely extinguished, the smoke removed, and the area declared safe by the Facility Manager or his designee. Under no circumstances shall an employee attempt to fi ght a fire that has passed the incipient stage (that which can be put out with a fire extinguisher), nor shall any associate attempt to enter a burning building to conduct search and rescue. These actions shall be left to emergency services professionals who have the necessary training, equipment, and experience (such as the fire department or emergency medical professionals). Untrained individuals may endanger themselves and/or those they are trying to rescue. Large Fires When an associate becomes aware of a large -scale fire, he/she will immediately notify their supervisor. When a Facility Manager or his designee is made aware of a large fire, he/she shall immediately direct all associates in the area to leave and shall also leave the area themselves. Associates removed from the facility shall not be allowed to return until the fire has been completely extinguished, the smoke removed, and the Facility Manager or his designee declares the facility safe. 7-10. Terrorist Threat 7-11. Bomb threats However unlikely to even receive a bomb threat, the possibility cannot be dismissed as the consequences are great. It is therefore essential for local management at each location to be familiar with the following policy and procedures for handling bom b threats. The local law enforcement agency must be notified as soon as possible after a bomb threat is received. If received by phone Most bomb threats are received by telephone, so each person answering the phones play a key role in helping to evaluate the situation. Whenever possible, the phone call should be transferred to the Human Resources Department. If the person answering the phone feels that interrupting the caller may frighten him into hanging up, the call should be handled at that pho ne. If this should occur someone. in the area should notify Human Resources of the situation and start to fill out the bomb threat checklist attached to the end of this policy. Whoever handles the call should try to keep the caller on the line so that addi tional information can be obtained. Most of the phones in our facility have caller ID, so writing down any phone numbers would help with identifying the caller. Take notes and ask the caller questions like: When will the bomb explode? BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 32 of 129 Where i s the bomb located? If the caller refuses to answer this remind him that many innocent people may be killed or seriously injured if the bomb area is not cleared. To whom am I speaking? What is your phone number? Your address? What kind of bomb is it? How big is the bomb (physical size)? What does it look like? Is the bomb in a container? Why was the bomb placed? Do you have a friend or relative who works here? Why are you calling now? Note whether the caller was male or female and indicate an estimate of his/her approximate age. Were there unusual characteristics to the voice -- an accent or speech impediment? For example: listen for background noise such as music, laughter, traffic noise, etc. Decide whether to evacuate The decision of whether to evacuate or not will be made by Management. Local authorities will frequently offer counsel and advice, but in most cases they will not make the actual decision. The first consideration in every case must be the safety of all personnel. While th is might seem to dictate automatic evacuation for every threat, it must be remembered that most bomb threats turn out to be hoaxes. Moreover, aside from the expense of a production interruption, the caller's object may be to cause confusion and disruption; thus, automatic evacuation after each threat may precipitate further threats. If evacuation is indicated If, based on the facts available, there is a probability that the bomb threat may be real, a further decision is needed. Should the entire facility be evacuated or only the area around the target? The Facility Managers and Human Resources will make this decision. When the target area is specified by the caller, individuals must be evacuated from a space at least 300 feet surrounding the target. People must also evacuate the same space on floor immediately above and/or below the target. If evacuation on the facility is indicated, then all associates and other individuals must be promptly advised. Associates will be paid for the time spent standing by until the decision has been made to send them home. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 33 of 129 If evacuation is not indicated If, after careful evaluation of the situation, a decision is made that the threat is a hoax and evacuation should not be called, all associates must be promptly advised that a bomb threat has been received, that management has decided the threat is a hoax and that the facility will remain in operation. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 34 of 129 SECTION 8 WORK PLAN \"Plan your work and work your plan\" Thoughtful and thorough planning is the first step in preventing accidents. No work is to be conducted without a written work plan outlining the procedures and tasks and a thorough hazard assessment. Tasks will be described in an SOP 8-1. Contractor and visitor sign-in Contractors and visitors must sign in at the front office upon arrival. They must also not forget to sign out when leaving. The sign-in list is used for head count in the event of an emergency. Unattended facilities associated with the Compost and AD facility should be locked to limit risk to individuals unfamiliar with the surroundings and to ensure that the system continues to operate efficiently. Employees familiar with the facility should always escort visitors. Visitors to the facility are not to operate any switches, controllers, or other electrical functions, including light switches. 8-2. Contractor and Visitor orientation Contractor orientation is site specific and supplements standard OSHA recognized training. The orientation is arranged with the safety director or plant supervisor in advance of the contractor's arriva l. All contractors and each of their staff onsite must go through basic safety training upon initial visit and renew annually. The training reviews the essentials of the Work Plan. A BDC staff member will review the contractor's specific work plan for all activities conducted. Visitors will undergo a general safety review to create a basic awareness of potential hazards during their visit. All visitors will be escorted by an operator or BIC tour guide. Limited access and safety are the responsibility of the escort. 8-3. Contractor Work Plan All contracted work will be outlined in a written document submitted to BDC EH&S prior to acceptance of proposal. The minimum requirements include Who and how many are performing the work? Duration of project Where will the work be conducted? What equipment will be needed? Any Hot Work or Confined - Space Entry? Any elevated work? What assistance will be needed from BDC to complete the task? Is the contractor licensed, insured, and qualified to perform the work? Is any fire watch, retrieval or rescue anticipated? 8-4. Post job walk -through After work is complete, walk through with the supervisor and/or sign off the post -job checklist Tools and parts put away Dust and debris from surfaces in work area have been cleaned up Equipment washed down BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 35 of 129 SECTION 9 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) is the responsibility of the employer to enforce and the responsibility of the employee and contractor to wear. PPE is required when engineering or administrative controls are inadequate. They must be properly selected and worn. Employee and contractor training are required. A pre-Job analysis and hazard assessment are required to determine which equipment is needed. This section serves as an introduction to the PPE Equipment. See relevant sections for specific safety program of each hazardous exposure. 9-1.

BDC Safety Program addresses stress induced by weather and unsafe conditions created by distraction and behavior. 11-1. Distraction Mindful awareness of surroundings must be maintained throughout all operations. Multi -tasking, such as phone conversations, music, sports, and daydreaming distract from focused attention and can lead to injury and loss. 11-2. Heat The following information has been collected from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The purpose of this program is to provide guidance for protecting associates from hazards of high heat conditions and to provide information on engineering, administrative and PPB controls. Being uncomfortable is not the major problem with working in high temperatures. Workers who are suddenly exposed to working in a hot environment face additional and generally avoidable hazards to their safety and health. How the body handles heat The human body, being warm blooded, maintains a relatively constant internal temperature, even though it is being exposed to varying environmental temperatures. To keep internal body temperatures within safe limits, the body must get rid of its excess heat, primarily through varying the rate and amount of blood circulation through the skin and the release of fluid onto the skin by the sweat glands. These automatic responses usually occur when the temperature of the bloo d exceeds 98.6oF and are kept in balance and controlled by the brain. In this process of lowering internal body temperature, the heart begins to pun1p more blood; blood vessels expand to accommodate the increased flow, and the microscopic blood vessels (capillaries) which thread through the upper layers of the skin begin to fill with blood. The blood circulates closer to the surface of the skin, and the excess heat is lost to the cooler environment. If heat loss from increased blood circulation through the skin is not adequate, the brain continues to sense over -heating and signals the sweat glands in the skin to shed large quantities of sweat onto the skin surface. Evaporation of sweat cools the skin, eliminating large quantities of heat from the body. As environmental temperatures approach normal skin temperature, cooling of the body becomes more difficult. If air temperature is as warm as or warmer than the skin, blood brought to the body surface cannot lose its heat. Under these conditions, the heart continues to pump blood to the body surface, the sweat glands pour liquids containing electrolytes onto the surface of the skin and the evaporation of the sweat becomes the principal effective means of maintaining a constant body temperature. Sweating does not cool the body unless the moisture is removed from the skin by evaporation. Under conditions of high humidity, the evaporation of sweat from the skin is decreased and the body's efforts to maintain an acceptable body temperatu re may be significantly impaired. These conditions adversely affect an individual's ability to work in the hot environment. With so much blood going to the external surface of the body, relatively less goes to the active muscles, the brain, and BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 41 of 129 other internal organs; strength declines; and fatigue occurs sooner than it would otherwise. Alertness and mental capacity also may be affected. Workers who must perfo1m delicate or detailed work may find their accuracy suffering, and others may experience diminished comprehension and retention of information. Safety Problems Certain safety problems are common to hot environments. Heat tends to promote accidents due to the slipperiness of sweaty palms, dizziness, or the fogging of saf ety glasses. Wherever there's molten metal, hot surfaces, steam, etc., the possibility of burns from accidental contact also exists. Aside from these obvious dangers, the frequency of accidents, in general, appears to be higher in hot environments than in more moderate environmental conditions. One reason is that working in a hot environment lowers the mental alertness and physical performance of an individual. Increased body temperature and physical discomfort promote irritability, anger, and other emotional states which sometimes cause workers to overlook safety procedures or to divert attention from hazardous tasks. Health Problems Excessive exposure to a hot work environment can bring about a variety of heat -induced disorders. Heat Stroke Heat stroke is the most serious of health problems associated with working in hot environments. It occurs when the body's temperature regulatory system fails, and sweating becomes inadequate. The body's only effective means of removing excess heat is compromised with little warning to the victim that a crisis stage has been reached. A heat stroke victim's skin is hot, usually dry, red, or spotted. Body temperature is usually 105_F or higher, and the victim is mentally confused, delirious, perhaps in convulsions, or unconscious. Unless the victim receives quick and appropriate treatment, death can occur. Any person with signs or symptoms of heat stroke requires immediate hospitalization. However, first aid should be immediately administered. This includes removing the victim to a cool area, thoroughly soaking the clothing with water, and vigorously fanning the body to increase cooling. Further treatment at a medical facility should be directed to the continuation of the cooling p rocess and the monitoring of complications which often accompany the heat stroke. Early recognition and treatment of heat stroke are the only means of preventing permanent brain damage or death. Heat Exhaustion Heat exhaustion includes several clinical disorders having symptoms which may resemble the early symptoms of heat stroke. Heat exhaustion is caused by the loss of large amounts of fluid by sweating, sometimes with excessive loss of salt. A worker suffering from heat exhaustion still sweat s but experiences extreme weakness or fatigue, giddiness, nausea, or headache. In more serious cases, the victim may vomit or lose consciousness. The skin is clammy and moist, the complexion is pale or flushed, and the body temperature is normal or only slightly elevated. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 42 of 129 In most cases, treatment involves having the victim rest in a cool place and drink plenty of liquids. Victims with mild cases of heat exhaustion usually recover spontaneously with this treatment. Those with severe cases may require extended care for several days. There are no known permanent effects. CAUTION: Persons with heart problems or those on a low sodium diet who work in hot environments should consult a physician about what to do under these conditi ons. Heat Cramps Heat cramps are painful spasms of the muscles that occur among those who sweat profusely in heat, drink large quantities of water, but do not adequately replace the body's salt loss. The drinking of large quantities of water tends to dilute the body's fluids, while the body continues to lose salt. Shortly thereafter, the low salt level in the muscles causes painful cramps. The affected muscles may be part of the arms, legs, or abdomen, but tired muscles (those used in performing the wo rk) are usually the ones most susceptible to cramps. Cramps may occur during or after work hours and may be relieved by taking salted liquids by mouth. CAUTION: Persons with heart problems or those on a low sodium diet who work in hot environments should consult a physician about what to do under these conditions. Fainting A worker who is not accustomed to hot environments and who stands erect and immobile in the heat may faint. With enlarged blood vessels in the skin and in the lower part of the body due to the body's attempts to control internal temperature, blood may pool there rather than return to the hea1i to be pumped to the brain. Upon lying down, the worker should soon recover. By moving around, and thereby preventing blood from pooling, the patient can prevent further fainting. Heat Rash Heat rash, also known as prickly heat, is likely to occur in hot, humid environments where sweat is not easily removed from the surface of the\u00b7 skin by evaporation and the skin remains wet most of the time. The sweat ducts become plugged, and a skin rash soon appears. When the rash is extensive or when it is complicated by infection, prickly heat can be very uncomfortable and may reduce a worker's performance. The worker can prevent this condition by resting in a cool place part of each day and by regularly bathing and drying the skin. Transient Heat Fatigue Transient heat fatigue refers to the temporary state of discomfort and mental or psychological strain arising from prolonged heat exposure. Workers unaccustomed to the heat are particularly susceptible and can suffer, to varying degrees, a decline in task performance, coordination, alertness, and vigilance. The severity of transient heat fatigue will be lessened by a period of gradual adjustme nt to the hot environment (heat acclimation). Preparing for the Heat One of the best ways to reduce heat stress on workers is to minimize heat in the workplace. However, there are some work environments where heat production is difficult to control, such as when furnaces or sources of steam or water are present in the work area or when the workplace itself is outdoors and exposed to varying warm weather conditions. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 43 of 129 Humans are, to a large extent, capable of adjusting to the heat. This adjustment to heat, under normal circumstances, usually takes about 5 to 7 days, during which time the body will undergo a series of changes that will make continued exposure to heat more endurable. On the first day of work in a hot environment, the body temperature, pulse rate, and general discomfort will be higher. With each succeeding daily exposure, all these responses will gradually decrease, while the sweat rate will increase. When the body becomes acclimated to the heat, the wo rker will find it possible to perform work with less strain and distress. Gradual exposure to heat gives the body time to become accustomed to higher environmental temperatures. Heat disorders in general are more likely to occur among workers who have not been given time to adjust to working in the heat or among workers who have been away from hot environments and who have gotten accustomed to lower temperatures, Hot weather conditions of the summer are likely to affect the worker who is not acclimated to heat. Likewise, workers who return to work after a leisurely vacation or extended illness may be affected by the heat in the work environment. Whenever such circumstances occur, the worker should be gradually reacclimated to the hot environme nt. Number and Duration of Exposures Rather than be exposed to heat for extended periods of time during a job, workers should, wherever possible, be permitted to distribute the workload evenly over the day and incorporate work -rest cycles. Work -rest cycles give the body an opportunity to get rid of excess heat, slow down the production of internal body heat, and provide greater blood flow to the skin. Workers employed outdoors are especially subject to weather changes, A hot spell or a rise in humidity can create overly stressful conditions. The following practices can help to reduce heat stress: Postponement of nonessential tasks. Permit only those workers acclimated to heat to perform the more strenuous tasks. Provide additional workers to perform the tasks keeping in mind that all workers should have the physical capacity to perform the task and that they should be accustomed to the heat. Rest Areas Providing cool rest areas in hot work environments considerably reduces the stress of working in those environments. There is no conclusive information available on the ideal temperature for a rest area. However, a rest area with a temperature near 76 degrees F appears to be adequate and may even feel chilly to a hot, sweating worker, until acclimated to the cooler environment. The rest area should be as close to the workplace as possible. Individual work periods should not be lengthened in favor of prolonged rest periods. Shorter but frequent work -rest cycles are the greatest benefit to the worker. Drinking Water Over a day's work in the heat, a worker may produce as much as 2 to 3 gallons of sweat. Because so many heat disorders involve excessive dehydration of the body, it is essential that water intake during the workday be about equal to the amount of sweat produced. Most workers exposed to hot conditions drink BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 44 of 129 fewer fluids than needed because of an insufficient thirst drive. A worker, therefore, should not depend on thirst to signal when and how much to drink. Instead, the worker should drink 5 to 7 ounces of fluids every 15 to 20 minutes to replenish the necessary fluids in the body. There is no optimum temperature of drinking water, but most people tend not to drink warm or very cold fluids as readily as they will cool ones. Whatever the temperature of the water, it must be readily available to the worker. Individual drinking cups should be provided, never use a common drinking cup. Heat acclimatized workers lose much less salt in their sweat than do workers who are not adjusted to the heat. The average American diet contains sufficient salt for acclimatized workers even when sweat production is high. If, for some reason, salt replacement is required, the best way to compensate for the loss is to add a little extra salt to the food. Salt tablets should not be used. CAUTION Persons with heart problems or those on a low sodium diet who work in hot environments should consult a physician about what to do under these conditions. Protective Clothing Clothing inhibits the transfer of heat between the body and the surrounding environment. Therefore, in hot jobs where the air temperature is lower than skin temperature, wearing clothing reduces the body's ability to lose heat into the air. When air temperature is higher than skin temperature, clothing helps to prevent the transfer of heat from the air to the body. However, this advantage may be nullified if the clothes interfere with the evaporation of sweat. In dry climates, adequate evaporation of sweat is seldom a problem. In a dry work environment with very high air temperatures, protective clothing could be an advantage to the worker. The proper type of clothing depends on the specific circumstance. Certain work in hot environments may require insulated gloves, insulated suits, reflective clothing, or infrared reflecting face shields. For extremely hot conditions, thermally - conditioned clothing is available. One such garment carries a self -contained air conditioner in a backpack, w hile another is connected a compressed air source which feeds cool air into the jacket or coveralls through a vortex tube. Another type of garment is a plastic jacket which has pockets that can be filled with dry ice or containers of ice. Associate Awareness The key to preventing excessive heat stress is educating the employer and worker on the hazards of working in heat and the benefits of implementing proper controls and work practices. The employer should establish a program designed to acclimatize workers who must be exposed to hot environments and provide necessary work -rest cycles and water to minimize heat stress. Special Considerations During unusually hot weather conditions lasting longer than 2 days, the number of heat illnesses usually increases. This is due to several factors, such as progressive body fluid deficit, loss of appetite (and possible salt deficit), buildup of heat in living and work areas, and breakdown of air -conditioning equipment. Therefore, it is advis able to make a special effort to adhere rigorously to the above preventive measures during these extended hot spells and to avoid any unnecessary or unusual stressful activity. Sufficient BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 45 of 129 sleep and good nutrition are important for maintaining a high level of heat tolerance. Workers who may be at a greater risk of heat illnesses are the obese, the chronically ill and older individuals. When feasible, the most stressful tasks should be performed during the cooler parts of the day (e arly morning or at night). Double shifts and overtime should be avoided whenever possible. Rest periods should be extended to alleviate the increase in the body heat load. The consumption of alcoholic beverages during prolonged periods of heat can cause additional dehydration. Persons taking certain medications (e.g., medications for blood pressure control, diuretics, or water pills) should consult their physicians to determine if any side effects could occur during excessive heat exposure. Daily fluid in take must be sufficient to prevent significant weight loss during the workday and over the workweek. 11-3. Cold Workers who are exposed to extreme cold or work in cold environments may be at risk of cold stress. Extreme cold weather is a dangerous situat ion that can bring on health emergencies in susceptible people, such as those without shelter, outdoor workers, and those who work in an area that is poorly insulated or without heat. What constitutes cold stress, and its effects can vary across different areas of the country. In regions relatively unaccustomed to winter weather, near freezing temperatures are considered factors for cold stress. Whenever temperatures drop decidedly below normal and as wind speed increases, heat can more rapidly leave your b ody. These weather -related conditions may lead to serious health problems. Hypothermia When exposed to cold temperatures, your body begins to lose heat faster than it can be produced. Prolonged exposure to cold will eventually use up your body's stored energy. The result is hypothermia, or abnormally low body temperature. A body temperature that is too low affects the brain, making the victim unable to think clearly or move well. This makes hypothermia particularly dangerous because a person may n ot know it is happening and will not be able to do anything about it. Symptoms of hypothermia can vary depending on how long you have been exposed to the cold temperatures. Early Symptoms Shivering Fatigue Loss of coordination Confusion and disorientation Late Symptoms BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 46 of 129 No shivering Blue skin Dilated pupils Slowed pulse and breathing Loss of consciousness First Aid Take the following steps to treat a worker with hypothermia: Alert the supervisor and request medical assistance. Move the victim into a warm room or shelter. Remove their wet clothing. Warm the center of their body first -chest, neck, head, and groin -using an electric blanket, if available; or use skin -to-skin contact under loose, dry layers of blankets, clothing, towels, or sheets. Warm beverages may help increase the body temperature, but do not give alcoholic beverages. Do not try to give beverages to an unconscious person. After their body temperature has increased, keep the victim dry and wr apped in a warm blanket, including the head and neck. If victim has no pulse, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Frostbite Frostbite is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. Frostbite causes a loss of feeling and color in the affected areas. It most often affects the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, or toes. Frostbite can permanently damage body tissues, and severe cases can lead to amputation. In extremely cold temperatures, the risk of frostbite is increased in workers with reduced blood circulation and among workers who are not dressed properly. Symptoms of frostbite include: Reduced blood flow to hands and feet (fingers or toes can freeze) Numbness Tingling or stinging Aching Bluish or pail, waxy skin First Aid Workers suffering from frostbite should: Get into a warm room as soon as possible. Unless absolutely necessary, do not walk on frostbitten feet or toes -this increases the damage. Immerse the affected area in warm -not hot -water (the temperature should be comfortable to the touch for unaffected parts of the body). BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 47 of 129 Warm the affected area using body heat; for example, the heat of an armpit can be used to warm frostbitten fingers. Do not rub or massage the frostbitten area; doing so may cause more damage. Do not use a heating pad, heat lamp, or the heat of a stove, fireplace, or radiator for warming. Affected areas are numb and can be easily burned. Trench Foot Trench foot, also known as immersion foot, is an injury of the feet resulting from p rolonged exposure to wet and cold conditions. Trench foot can occur at temperatures as high as 60 degrees F if the feet are constantly wet. Injury occurs because wet feet lose heat 25 -times faster than dry feet. Therefore, to prevent heat loss, the body co nstricts blood vessels to shut down circulation in the feet. Skin tissue begins to die because of lack of oxygen and nutrients and due to the buildup of toxic products. Symptoms of trench foot include: Reddening of the skin Numbness Leg cramps Swelling Tingling pain Blisters or ulcers Bleeding under the skin Gangrene (the foot may turn dark purple, blue, or gray) First Aid Workers suffering from trench foot should: Remove shoes/boots and wet socks. Dry their feet. Avoid walking on feet, as this may cause tissue damage. Chilblains Chilblains are caused by the repeated exposure of skin to temperatures just above freezing to as high as 60 degrees F. The cold exposure causes damage to the capillary beds (groups of small blood vessels) in the skin. This damage is permanent, and the redness and itching will return with additional exposure. The redness and itching typically occurs on cheeks, ears, fingers, and toes. Symptoms Symptoms of chilblains include: Redness Itching Possible blistering Inflammation BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 48 of 129 Possible ulceration in severe cases First Aid Workers suffering from chilblains should: Avoid scratching Slowly warm the skin Use corticosteroid creams to relieve itching and swelling Keep blisters and ulcers clean and covered 11-4. Poor Lighting Poor lighting in the work area can lead to poor work practices that result in injuries of many types. Make sure lighting is adequate for the task at hand, replace burnt out bulbs, and point out hazardous areas to your immediate supervisor. 11-5. Fatigue Repetitive motion Ergonomics means \"the study of work.\" The objective of ergonomics is to adapt the job and workplace to the worker by designing tasks, work stations, tools, and equipment within a worker's physical capabilities and limitations. Rather than forcing a person to fit into a job, adapting the task to fit the worker can reduce ergonomic stress and eliminate many potential ergonomic disorders. Injuries resulting from tasks that require a high level of repet itive motion, also known as Repetitive Motion Injuries (RMI), can be very debilitating to an employee and should be avoided. These types of injuries are also referred to as cumulative trauma disorders (CTD) or repetitive motion disorders and are injuries to the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. Tendons and muscles in the upper extremities and hands are the most affected body regions. Fatigue or tiredness in muscles and/or joints is the body's way of telling you to change your pattern of working . Doing the same motion repeatedly or using certain types of positions or grips can cause pain and inflammation. The following steps can be taken to curb or limit an employee's exposure to highly repetitive tasks: Maintain good body posture. Periodic walk -through surveys, or whenever a job task changes. Complete a job analysis for all \"at risk\" positions. Train employees with an ergonomic professional or health care provider. Report early signs and symptoms of a complication to a manager. Encourage employees to take micro -breaks and stretch. Implement a job rotation schedule. Use mechanical assists and implement engineering controls wherever possible. Try to eliminate or reduce overtime work. By following the above preventative measures, you can reduce and even prevent the RMI and CTD in your workplace. Extended sitting or standing BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 49 of 129 Certain jobs require long hours of standing or sitting. These conditions can create back troubles. Get up and stretch frequ ently if required to sit for long periods. If standing, ease the strain on your lower back by changing foot positions often, placing one foot on a rail or ledge. However, keep your weight evenly balanced when standing. Do not lean to one side. Be aware of proper posture when sitting, standing, or reclining. When sitting, your knees should be slightly higher than your hips and your shoulders and upper back should be straight. Work hours Associates and contractors are to work no more than 16 hours per day and 72 hours per week followed by at least one day (24 hours) of rest. A variance to the 72-hour week may be granted on a case -by-case basis with PRIOR approval of upper management. No approval of any kind will be given to exceed 16 hours a day Each employee is required to complete First Aid/ CPR basic training through the Red Cross or equivalent recognized authority. The certification is to be maintained current. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 50 of 129 SECTION 12 HAZARD COMMUNICATION/ RIGHT -TO-KNOW Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) is based on the concept identified in Chemical Hazard Communication (OSHA 3084). -- that employees have both a need and a right to know the hazards and identities of the chemicals they are exposed to when working. Chemicals include hazardous materials in all forms - liquid, gases/ fumes, solids, dusts, and aerosols. Non -hazardous chemicals have no risk of exposure and are not covered in the plan. OSHA has provided a simple summary of the HCS in a pamphlet entitled Chemical Hazard Communication (OSHA 3084). 12-1. Chemical Safety BDS has a safety training program to ensure hazardous chemical safety information is provided to exposed employees. Chemical use includes any situation where a chemical is present in such a way that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency. 12-2. Hazardous Material Classification A four -section multicolor \"square -on-point\" (diamond/placard) is used to address the health, flammability, instability and special hazards presented by short -term, acute exposures that could occur during fires, spills or other similar emergencies. 12-3. Hazardous signage NFPA 704 compliant signage with clear explanation is posted in a common area 12-4. Chemical protective clothing Chemical protective clothing is selected for qualities Puncture resistance Wear resistance Tactility Degradation Permeation Types of chemical protective clothing may include Full Encapsulating suit Splash suit Coveralls Hoods Gloves Boots Boot / Shoe covers BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 51 of 129 Always read the label and MSDS to assure the proper precautions are taken. Chemical protective clothing may be manufactured from materials as follows: Tyvek (white suits) -dusts, dirt, grease Saranex - coated Tyvek, better for mild chemicals Polyethylene - alternative to Tyvek PVC rain suits, splash suits - moderate chemicals Chemical gloves and boots Neoprene - acids, caustics, solvents Butyl rubber - resists gases Nomex - flame protection Kevlar - cut protection MANY OTHERS 12-5. Safety shower A safety shower and eye wash basin will be located near the chemical storage with warm water. A clear path will always be maintained. Daily functional checks are required Eye wash basin Eye Rinse SECTION 13 CHEMICAL STORAGE 13-1. Cabinet requirements 13-2. Labeling BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 52 of 129 Chemical manufacturers evaluate the hazards of the chemicals they produce or import. With that information, they prepare labels for containers and more detailed technical bulletins called material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The details of the Chemical safety program are in section xxxx BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 53 of 129 SECTION 14 INCIDENT REPORTING Objective To ensure all injuries, illnesses, property damage and near misses are being reported in a timely manner it is the responsibility of each associate to work safely and to follow all established safety policies, procedures, and guidelines. Policy Associates must report all loss incidents and near misses immediately to their supervisor no matter how minor. In the case of visitors or contractors. The loss incident or near miss must be reported to the individual responsible for that person on site. Incidents are categorized as follows: A. Near Miss Incident : All incidents that occurred that had the potential to cause injury, illness, significant property damage, or adverse environmental or community impact will be verbally reported immed iately to the plant supervisor and a written report within 8 hours of incident. B. Property Damage Incident : All significant damage to company property or any property damage that had the potential to cause an injury or illness to an associate, contractor or visitor will be verbally reported immediately to the plant supervisor and written report within 8 hours of incident C. Injury or Illness Incident : All injuries or illnesses that occurred to an associate, contractor, or visitor while at work will be verbally reported immediately after the incident. Upon notification of a loss incident or near miss the supervisor will complete an incident report. 14-1. Investigation To ensure proper safety precautions are being followed a comprehensive investigation will be conducted on each loss incident or near miss that occurs on the job. All accidents and incidents including near misses are investigated within 8 hours. All incident investigation forms are sent to the Safety Manager for review and follow -up 14-2. Prevention The incident evaluation will set forth prevention procedures from lessons learned. A Management of Change will document the procedural modification. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 54 of 129 SECTION 15 AREA DESIGNATIONS Access to the facility is restric ted to employees and visitors under strict guidelines. No unauthorized access is permitted. Visitors and deliveries must check in and out at the front office. Areas of the plant are designed for various functions and accessibility. 15-1. Area Signage Signs throughout the facility will be OSHA compliant according to ANSI Z535: Standards for Safety Signs and Labels. Signage, markings, and barriers delineate restricted access to areas as defined in this section. 15-2. Hazard Area Classification The potential for explosive gas condition is always present in the facility. NFPA 497 and API RP500 designate workspace relevant to explosion hazards and classified substances that are combustible and flammable. NFPA occupancy standards contain requirements for area classification. National Electric Code (NEC) has classified hazardous locations in the Facility as Class I, II and III. It subdivides thos e classifications in Division I and Division 2, depending on the likelihood of the hazard existing under normal operating conditions. A Hazard Zone Plan is displayed in the Administrative Office. . Class 1 Division 1 Class 1 Division 2 Engineering controls - Equipment and cabling installed in the NEC classified areas are rated for safe operation under the conditions. No flame or spark producing equipment is permitted in the NFPA classified areas. This includes electronics (e.g. ce llphones, radios) e lectrical tools (drills grinders) spark producing hand tools. Special conditions exist for hot work permits in classified areas. The risk of explosion must be minimized by removing the concentration of explosive or combustible material from the area. Figures showing Classification 15-3. Work Zone hazards Areas that are undergoing non-ordinary operations, such as repair or shutdowns are to be isolated by flagging or cones. The intent is to warn individuals not authorized on the work plan to keep clear. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 55 of 129 15-4. Confined Space Permit classified zones A Confined or Permit Required Space has limited or restricted means for entry or exit and is not designed for continuous occupancy. Confined spaces at BIC include, but are not limited to, tanks, vessels, silos, storage bins, hoppers, vaults, pits, manholes, tunnels, equipment housings, ductwork, and pipelines. Specifically, for BIC facility, this includes buffer tanks for raw and separated liquids, condensate pits, leachate sump pits and Digester tanks. (Policy and procedure is described in Section 22 Confined Space Permit Program ) BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 56 of 129 15-5. Smoking No smoking is permitted on site except for designated smoking areas. The BIC compost permit explicitly prohibits smoking in the receiving , processing, screening and storage area. Smoking or other incendiary or spark producing devices are restricted in the classified areas of the AD plant. 15-6. Eating No food or drink is permitted in the facility operations where organic material and gases may be present BIC_BDCSIteSafetyMa nual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 57 of 129 SECTION 16 ELECTRICAL SAFETY/ LOTO Lockout/ Tagout (LOTO) policy and procedures are administered when machines or equipment are being shut down for service or maintenance. They often contain some form of \"hazardous energy\" that can cause harm to people in the area. Hazardous energy means any type of energy that can be released and might harm a person. This could include energy of the following types: Chemical Electrical Hydraulic Mechanical Pneumatic Thermal Without the use of proper LOTO safety procedures, the serviced equipment can unexpectedly start up or otherwise release these forms of energy. This can lead to serious injuries and even death to the people working on the machine and even to others working in the area or living in the community. The OSHA General Industry standard is 1910.147, The Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout) . 16-2. Preparation for LOTO Prior to applying lock or tag, perform a Job Hazard Analysis and conduct a briefing with all involved and/or affected personnel. Make a survey to locate and identify all isolating devices to be certain which switch(es), breaker(s), valve(s), or other energy isolating devices apply to the equipment. Notify all affected employees that the energized system will be shut down and, if possible, estimate for how long. The authorized employee/ contractor should know the type and magnitude of energy that the machine or equipment utilizes and should understand the hazards thereof and safe procedures for deenergizing the equipment. Contractors may need assistance or procedures to identify all energy sources. The individual that is applying the lock or tag must be wearing the same level of PPE that will be required for the person that is performing the work on the system. 16-3. Tagout Procedure NOTE: \"Tag Only\" procedure is only in rare case If A Lock Cannot Be Used. Tags are to be used together with the lockout procedure. Standardized tags for use in tagging out equipment are available from facilities and grounds. Durable reusable plastic tags are used. The tag has the word \"Danger\" on a red field and the words \"Do Not Operate.\" The tag is attached with a single use, self -locking nylon cable tie. The authorized employee's name and the date of application to a piece or equipment are written on the tag. Locks must be used whenever possible, as tags used alone are essentially a warning device and do not provide the physical restraint that is provided by a lock. If only a tag is used, the following conditions apply: A tag is to be removed only by the authorized employee responsible for it, and it is never to be bypassed, ignored, or otherwise defeated. Tags must be legible and understandable by all employees in order to be effective. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 58 of 129 Tags and their means of attachment must be able to withstand environmental conditions. Tags may evoke a false sense of security and should be understood as part of an overall energy control program. Tags must be securely attached so they cannot be inadvertently or accidentally detached during use. For electrical systems, use of a tag must be supplemented by \"at least one additional safety measure that provides a level of safety equivalent to that obtained by the use of a lock.\" Examples given in the regulation are the removal of an isolating circuit element, blocking of a controlling switch, or opening of an extra disconnecting device 16-4. Lockout Procedure Authorized employees will be issued a standardized lock(s) with an individual key. These locks are only used for this lockout procedure. Additional locks, again issued to a specific authorized employee, are available from the plant supervisor Each lock must have a securely fastened tag with the employee's name and the date of application to a piece of equipment clearly written on the tag. Lockout All Energy Isolating Devices That Will Accept A Lock. If more than one individual is required to lock out equipment, then each shall place his or her own personal lockout device or tagout device on the energy -isolating device(s). When an energy -isolating device cannot accept multiple locks or tags, a hasp or lockbox may be used. Each person will remove his/her lock from the isolating device. One authorized employee will be appointed to oversee the group lockout or tagout device. All employees participating in a group lockout/tagout procedure should be made aware of the type and magnitude of the hazardous energy. Shutdown Shutdown Equipment - Follow normal stopping procedures according to stand operating pr ocedures. Allow motion to stop. Stored electrical energy, which might endanger personnel, must be released, (e.g., capacitors discharged, high capacitance elements short circuited and grounded). Stored non -electrical energy such as springs, hydraulic systems, overhead doors, etc. must be restrained by methods such as repositioning or blocking. Air, steam, gas, or water pressure must be dissipated by bleeding down or other method. Isolation Operate the switch(es), breaker(s), valve(s), or other energy isolating device(s) so that the equipment is isolated from its energy source(s). Stored Energy check BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 59 of 129 Even after the energy source has been disconnected, in step 3 of the lockout safety process, and the machine has been locked out, in step 4, that doesn't entirely guarantee that there's no hazardous energy still stored within the machine or that it's safe to perform maintenance. Look for any hazardous energy that's been \"stored\" within the machine, or any \"residual\" energy. During this phase, any potentially hazardous stored or residual energy must be relieved, disconnected, restrained, or made non-hazardous in some other way. Isolation verification After all previous steps, double -check for safety to work on the machine or equipment. At this point, an authorized employee verifies the machine has been properly isolated and de -energized. Verify isolation - \"Try the switch. Try the start button from the device and SCADA Equipment specific procedures A written procedure detailing the required procedure for each piece of equipment that requires lockout or tagout is developed by the department responsible for the equipment. This procedure will identify all energy sources, the system voltage, and required PPE and shock and flash protection boundaries, and be posted on or near the piece of equipment. Documentation The authorized employee must write his/her name and the date of application to the piece of equipment on the lock or tag. The Authorized Employee who attached the tag Is The Only Person That Can Remove That Tag, (except in the emergency procedure described below). Failure to observe any portion of the BDC lockout/tagout program will be viewed as a serious safety violation and may be subject to disciplinary action. Failure to make use of locks or tags, bypassing, ignoring or otherwise defeating a tag, or any other deviation from the established program will be considered a serious violation. The backside of each tag will bear the warnings \"Do Not Remove This Tag\" and \"Necessary Disciplinary Action Will Be Taken If These Orders Are Disregarded.\" BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 60 of 129 SECTION 17 ELECTRICAL SAFETY GENERAL PROGRAM Associates who face a risk of electrical shock or related injuries must be trained in appropriate electrical safety work practices. In addition, associates that work around -but not on -electrical systems must be trained in the hazards associ ated with electricity. Perdue Agribusiness has developed this electrical safety program to assure that locations understand and comply with the regulatory requirements related to electrical work and assure the safety of associates who may work in the vicin ity of, or on, electrical systems. This Electrical Safety Program describes work practices for both qualified and unqualified persons. (As defined by the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA 70E), the National Electrical Code (NEC), Occupational Safety an d Health Administration (OSHA) and the Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI). General Electrical Safety All portable tools and flexible cords will have Ground -Fault Protection (GFCis) during use. All Ground -Fault Protection (GFCis) shall be tested once a month and after installation. The testing must be documented. Flexible flat extension cords are not allowed in any facility. All electric room doors must swing out and the interior handle must be a panic bar. All facilities will have their Arc-Flash analysis updated every 5 years. 17-1. Electrical safety/ Extension cords 17-2. Electrical Safety/ Equipment inspection The following section provides common practices to help maintain safety by reducing the potential for electrical hazards that may occur at a Compost and AD facility. Daily inspections The facility should instruct operators to perform daily inspections of the electrical system. This inspection should include, but not be limited to, the following: Conduit connections to panels Panel cover integrity Conduit integrity Exposed and damaged wires Corrosion of wires Signs of electrical overheating If there is any sign of the aforementioned problems, operators should contact the site manager or a licensed electrician to resolve the issue. The operator should not attempt to fix the problem unless he or she is the appointed qualified electrician for the facility. 17-3. Electrical Safety/ Task qualification Qualified persons are those who have received specific training and have demonst rated the skills necessary to work safely on or near exposed energized parts. A person may be qualified to work, for BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 61 of 129 example, on circuits up to 600 volts, but may be unqualified to work on higher voltages. Only qualified persons may place or remove locks and tags on energized electrical systems. Unqualified persons are those with little or no such training. Training Training for Unqualified Associates Training for unqualified associates is general electrical safety precautions to provide an awareness and understanding of electrical hazards. Electrical Safety Rules for Unqualified Associates Do not conduct any repairs to electrical equipment. Report all electrical deficiencies to your supervisor. Do not operate equipment if you suspect and electrical problem. Do not use cords or plugs if the ground prong is missing. Do not overload electrical receptacles.

Electrical Safety All AC systems of 50 to 1,000 volts must normally be grounded as required by the NEC and OSHA. The path to ground from circuits, equipment and enclosures must be permanent and continuous. Existing ungrounded premises wiring do not meet the OSHA requirements an d must be replaced or modified as needed to meet this requirement. Conductors entering boxes, cabinets or fittings must be protected from abrasion, and openings through which conductors enter must be effectively closed. Unused openings in cabinets, boxes a nd fixtures must also be effectively closed. All pull boxes, junction boxes and fittings must be provided with covers approved for the purpose. If metal covers are used, then they must be grounded. In completed installations, each outlet box must have a co ver, faceplate, or fixture canopy. Pull boxes and junction boxes for systems over 600 volts, nominal, must provide complete enclosure, the boxes must be closed by suitable covers securely fastened in place, and the cover must be permanently marked \"High Voltage.\" Switchboards and panel boards that have exposed live parts must be in permanently dry locations and accessible to qualified persons only. Panel boards must be mounted in cabinets, cutout boxes or other approved enclosure, and must be dead front unl ess accessible to qualified persons only. Exposed blades of knife switches must be dead when open. Receptacles installed in damp or wet locations must be suitable for the location. Cabinets, cutout boxes, fittings, boxes, and panel board enclosures in damp or wet locations must be installed to prevent moisture or water from entering and accumulating within the enclosure. In wet locations the enclosures must be weatherproof. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 64 of 129 Fixtures, lamp holders, lamps, rosettes, and receptacles may have no live parts normally exposed to employee contact. Screw -base light socket adapters do not maintain ground continuity and may not be used. Multiplug receptacle adapters may not maintain ground continuity or may overload circuits and must not be used. If additional receptacles are needed in a work location, additional circuits and/or receptacles must be installed. Multi -plug power strips with over current protection are acceptable for use with electronic equipment if they are used to reduce line noise or t o provide surge or over current protection. Electrical equipment, wiring methods and installations of equipment in hazardous classified locations must be intrinsically safe, approved for the location, or safe for the location. Hazardous classified location s are areas where flammable liquids, gases, vapors, or combustible dusts or fibers exist or could exist in sufficient quantities to produce an explosion or fire. Any exception to the above and/or to any code requirement must be approved by the Electrical D ept. Refer to Electrical Standards for all electrical installations that are not directly covered in this policy. Requirements for Temporary Wiring Temporary electrical power and lighting installations 600 volts or less, including flexible cords, cables, extension cords and distribution panels, may only be used during and for renovation, maintenance, repair, or experimental work. Temporary wiring may also be used for decorative lighting for special events and similar' purposes for a period not to e xceed 90 days. The following additional requirements apply: Ground -fault protection (e.g., ground -fault circuit interrupters or GFCI) must be provided on all temporary -wiring circuits, including extension cords, used on construction sites. GFCI must also b e used when extension cords and/or equipment are used in wet, damp, or conductive locations. In general, all equipment and tools connected by cord and plug must be grounded. Listed or labeled double insulated tools and appliances need not be grounded. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 65 of 129 SECTION 18 HEARING PROTECTION PROGRAM Conservation of hearing is an important preventative measure. To reduce occupational hearing loss, all associates, who work in potentially noisy areas, are provided hearing protection, training and annual hearing tests. OSHA's hearing conservation standard is covered in 29 CFR 1910.95. A copy of the Noise Standard and Hearing Conservation Amendment 1910.95 must be posted in the workplace and accessible to associates. 18-1. Training At time of hire and annually thereafter, all affected associates must attend Hearing Conservation Training. The initial training is conducted as part of the New Hire Orientation Program by the Facility Manager and consists of: The effects of noise on hearing. The purpose of hearing protectors. The advantages, disadvantages, and attenuation of various types of hearing protectors. The purpose of audiometric testing, with an explanation of the test procedures. 18-2. Engineering Controls After it is determined that noise exposure above 85 dBA is present, engineering controls should be evaluated and implemented to reduce the noise exposure before administrative controls are initiated. Some examples of engineering controls include: Noise -reducing baffles. Compartmentalization. Installing noise reducing gears. Installing rubber pads under machinery. When new equipment or machinery is evaluated for purchase, the Safety Manager should be consulted to conduct an evaluation from a safety and health standpoint. One criteria of the evaluation should include the amount of noise the equipment will produce and how it will affect the overall noise exposure. 18-3. Administrative Controls After engineering controls are evaluated for effectiveness or f easibility, administrative controls should be considered to reduce noise exposure. Administrative controls include restricting exposure time or using personal protective equipment (PPE). Personal Protective Equipment, such as ear plugs or muffs, may be use d to reduce the amount of noise exposure. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 66 of 129 Each plug or muff has a noise reductions factor (NR) as evaluated by ANSI Standards. For example, if work area has an ambient noise exposure of 96 dba, then the hearing protectors should be rated 6 NR or better to be effective. Hearing Protection Devices Hearing protectors must be made available to all associates exposed to 85 dBA or greater. Use of hearing protectors is mandatory for associates in the hearing conservation program who: Are exposed to greater than 90 dBA TWA. Have demonstrated a Standard Threshold Shift. Have been employed by the company for 6 months, are exposed to 85 dBA TWA or greater and whose baseline audiograms have been delayed because a mobile test service visits the facility only once a year. Use of Hearing Protectors Management, Supervision and Associates shall properly wear the prescribed hearing protectors while working in or traveling through any section of a location that is designated a High Noise Area. (Excludi ng offices, break rooms, and rest facilities). The following rules will be enforced: Personal stereos, such as I-Pods, etc., will not be permitted in production area. Hearing protectors, at least two types of plugs and one type of muffs, will be provided and maintained by BDC. Hearing protectors and replacements will be provided free of charge. \u00b7 Hearing protectors must always be properly worn, except in offices, break rooms, rest facilities. Preformed earplugs and earmuffs should be washed period ically and stored in a clean area, and foam inserts should be discarded after each use. It is important to wash hands before handling pre -formed earplugs and foam inserts to prevent contaminants from being placed in the ear which may increase your risk of developing infections. Noise Monitoring A complete and up-to-date noise survey must be conducted every three (3) years and be on record. Monitoring must be repeated whenever a change in production process, equipment or controls increase noise exposures enough to affect the hearing conservation program. Associates must be informed of the results of monitoring. Audiometric Testing 1. A baseline audiogram (after 14 hours of quiet or supervised hearing protection use) must be obtained within 6 month s of hire (1 year if a mobile testing service is used). BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 67 of 129 2. Associates must be tested at least annually thereafter (anytime during work shift). Audiometer calibration, test environment background noise levels and tester qualifications must meet OSHA standards. The audiometric test must include test frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz. Audiometric Data Analysis and Follow -up The audiologist, otolaryngologist or physician must review problem audiograms and determine the need for further evaluation. If the annual audiogram shows a Standard Threshold Shift (STS) an average change of 10 dBA or more from the baseline at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, the following actions are required: Counsel and inform the associate of the STS in writing within 21 days of determination. If the associate is currently not wearing hearing protection and is exposed to 85 dBA or greater, hearing protection use is now mandatory. The associate should be fit with hearing protection and trained in its care and use. If the associate is currently wearing hearing protection that does not offer adequate protection, then different protective devices with greater noise reduction must be provided. Hearing protection fit should be checked, the associate refit if necessary and retrained in the proper use and care of hearing protection. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 68 of 129 SECTION 19 RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PROGRAM The respiratory protection program is designed to protect associates by establishing accepted practices for respirator use, providing guidelines for training and respirator selection, and explaining proper storage, use and care of respirators. 19-1. Assignment of Responsibility Bioenergy DevCo (BDC) is responsible for providing respirators to associates when they are necessary for health protection. BDC will provide respirators that are applicable and suitable for the intended purpose at no charge to affected associates. Any other expenses associated with the respirator y protection program such as training, medical evaluations and respiratory protection equipment will be paid for by BDC. The Program Administrator for BDC is the Safety Manager. The Program Administrator is responsible for administering the respiratory pro tection program. Duties of the program administrator include: Identifying work areas, process or tasks that require workers to wear respirators. Evaluating hazards. Selecting respiratory protection options. Conducting qualitative fit testing. Administering the medical surveillance program. Evaluating the program. Updating written program, as needed. Facility Managers are responsible for ensuring that the respiratory program is implemented in their areas. In addition to being knowledgeable about the program requirements for their own protection, facility managers must also ensure that the program is understood and followed by the associates under their charge. Duties of the Facility Manager include: Ensuring that associates under their supervision (including new hires) receive appropriate training, fit testing, and annual medical evaluation. Ensuring the availability of appropriate respirators and accessories. Being aware of tasks requiring the use of respiratory protection. Enforcing the proper use of respiratory protection when necessary. Ensuring that respirators are properly cleaned, maintained, and stored according to this program. Coordinating with the Program Administrator on how to address respiratory hazards or other concerns regarding this program. Each associate is responsible for wearing his or her respirator when and where required and in the way they are trained. Associates must also: Care for and maintain their respirators as instructed, guard them agains t damage, and store them in a clean, sanitary location. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 69 of 129 Inform their supervisor if their respirator no longer fits well and request a new one that fits properly. Inform their supervisor or the Program Administrator of any respiratory hazards that they feel is not adequately addressed in the workplace and any other concerns that they have regarding this program. Use the respiratory protection in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and the training received. 19-2. Applicability This program applies to all associates who are required to wear respirators during normal work operations as well as during some non -routine or emergency operations such as confined space rescue and HAZMAT. In addition, an ass ociate who voluntarily wears a respirator when one is not required is subject to the medical evaluation, cleaning, maintenance, and storage elements of this program, and will be provided the necessary training. Associates who voluntarily wear filtering fac e pieces (dust mask) are not subject to the medical evaluation, cleaning, storage, and maintenance provisions of this program. 19-3. Respiratory Program The Program Administrator will select respirators to be used on site, based on the hazards to which workers are exposed and in accordance with OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard. The proper type of respirator for the specific hazard involved will be selected in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. A list of associates and appropriate respiratory protection will be maintained by the program administrator. The proper type of respirator for the specific hazard involved will be. selected in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A list of associates will be maintained by the Prog ram Administrator. 19-4. Training The Facility Manager will provide training to respirator users. The training course will cover the following topics: The BDC Protection Program. The OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134). Respiratory hazards encountered and their health effects. Proper selection and use of respirators. Limitations of respirators. Respirator donning and user seal (fit) checks. Fit testing. Emergency use procedures. Maintenance and storage. Medical signs and symptoms limiting the effective use of respirators. Associates will be retrained annually or as needed. Associates must demonstrate their understanding of the topics covered in the training through hands on exercises and written testing. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 70 of 129 NIOSH Certification All respirators must be certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and shall be used in accordance with terms of that certification, Also, all filters, cartridges, and canisters must be labeled with the appropriate NIOSH approval label. Respirator Use The Facility Manager and Program Administrator shall authorize all voluntary users on a case -by-case basis, depending on specific workplace conditions and the results of medical evaluations. Associates who choose to wear a half piece APR must comply with the procedures for medical evaluation, respirator use, cleaning, maintenance, and storage portions of this program. When air monitoring has established time weighted averages that are below the permissible exposure level, associates may be provided a filtering face piece (i.e. dust mask) upon request. Only filtered face pieces (i.e. dusk masks) will be permitted for voluntary use and do not require medical evaluations or fit testing. All associ ates and processes that fall under the provisions of this program are listed in Appendix D of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134. Fit Testing Associates who are required to or who voluntarily wear respirators will be fit tested prior to being allowed to wear any respirator with a tight -fitting face piece annually; or when there are changes in the associate's physical condition that could affect respiratory fit. Associates will be fit tested with the make, model, and size of respirator that they will wear. The Program Administrator or his designee will conduct fit tests in accordance with the OSHA Reparatory Protection Standard. 19-5. General Respirator Use Procedures Associates will use their respirators under conditions specified in this program, and in accordance with the training they receive on the use each model. In addition, the respirator shall not be used in a manner for which it is not certified by NIOSH or by its manufacturer. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 71 of 129 All associates shall conduct user seal checks each time they wear their respirators. Associates shall use either the positive or negative pressure check as specified in the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard. Positive pressure test: This is test is performed by closing off the exhalation valve with your hand. Breathe air into the mask. The face fit is satisfactory if some pressure can be built up inside the mask without any air leaking out between the mask and the face of the wearer. Negative pressure test: This test is performed by closing of the inlet o penings of the cartridge with the palm of your hand. Some masks may require that the filter holder be removed to seal off the intake valve. Inhale gently so that a vacuum occurs within the face piece. Hold your breath for ten (10) seconds. If the vacuum remains, and no inward leakage is detected, the respirator is fit properly. Associates are not permitted to wear tight -fitting respirators if they have any condition, such as facial scars, facial hair, or missing dentures that would prevent a proper seal. Cartridge change schedules Respirator cartridges shall be replaced as determined by the Program Administrator, Supervisors, and the manufacturer's recommendations. Cleaning Respirators are to be regularly cleaned and disinfected at the end of each shift. The Facility Manager shall ensure an adequate supply of appropriate cleaning and disinfection materials at the cleaning station. Maintenance Respirators are always to be properly maintained to ensure that they function properly and protect asso ciates adequately. Maintenance involves a thorough visual inspection for cleanliness and defects. Worn or deteriorated parts will be replaced prior to use. No components will be replaced, or repairs made beyond those recommended by the manufacturer. Repairs to regulators or alarms of atmosphere - supplying respirators will be conducted by the manufacturer. Respirators that are defective or have defective parts shall be taken out of service immediately. If an associate finds a defect durin g an inspection, he/she shall bring the defective respirator to the attention of the supervisor. Storage After inspection, cleaning, and necessary repairs, respirators shall be stored appropriately to protect against dust, sunlight, heat, extreme cold, excessive moisture, or damaging chemicals. Each associate will clean and inspect their own respirator in accordance with the provisions of this program and will store their respirator in accordance with the provisions of this program, and will store their res pirator in a plastic bag in the designated area. Each associate will have his/her name on the bag and that bag will only be used to store that associate's respirator. Respirators maintained at stations and work areas for emergency use shall be stored in compartments built specifically for that purpose, and always be quickly assessable and clearly marked. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 72 of 129 19-6. Emergency Procedures In emergency situations where an atmosphere exists in which the wearer of the respirator could be overcome by a toxic or oxygen -deficient atmosphere, the following should be followed. When the associate is made aware that a hazardous atmosphere exists, he/she must immediately don their emergency respirator and exit the building. All associates must immediately evacuate the building following the facilities emergency action plan. If associates must remain in a dangerous atmosphere the following precautions shall be followed: Associates must never enter a dangerous atmosphere without fi rst obtaining the proper protective equipment and notification of the Facility Manager. Associates must never enter a dangerous atmosphere without at least one additional associate present. The additional associate must remain in the safe atmosphere. Communications must always be maintained between both associates. 19-7. Qualitative Fit Testing Protocol and Signoff Sensitivity Screening An irritant or pungent smoke chemical is administered while wearing the fitted respirator. Staff indicates detection before and after administration Before After Pressure checks o Positive pressure check (Close off exhalation valve) o Negative pressure check (Close off inlet opening) Test Exercises Test Exercises o Normal breathing (about 1 minute) o Deep breathing (about 1 minute) o Turning head side to side (about 2minutes) o Moving head up and down (about 2 minutes) o Talking (about 1 minute, rainbow passage or count backward from 100 or ABC's) o Bending over (about 1 minute) This is to certify that I have been administered a successful fit test and that I will wear my respirator in the exact manner as prescribed. Failure to wear this respirator as prescribed can lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination. If any changes to this program are made only the Facility Manager with the direction of the safety manager can make any changes. Print Name: Date: Signature: - BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 73 of 129 SECTION 20 PINCH POINTS (See also Machine Guarding) A pinch point or often called \"Nip Point\" is a ny space where a part of or a person's body can be caught between a stationary and a moving object or between two moving objects. Pinch Points include equipment, machinery doors, drawers, hammer, and shovel action. If a person or their body part occupies that space during the pinching movement, there is a high probability of injuries such as crushing of tissues, fractures and even amputations. Pinch Point Safety Precautions: Identify possible pinch point hazards in your work area Focus on objects that move or possibly could move. Ask yourself, \"What will happen if this moves? Will I be in the path of that movement? Be aware of pinch points created by objects that move and come into direct contact with relatively fixed objects Be on guard whenever you put your hands, fingers, toes, or feet \"between\" anything. Discuss and point out pinch point hazards as part of your JSA. Verify effective communication methods are established before the work begins when working with someone else or as a group to avoid putting your safety in someone else's control. Pay attention when opening drawers, doors, filing cabinets, etc. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 74 of 129 SECTION 21 ELEVATED WORK Working at elevated heights creates the need for fall protection and safety. Fall protection is primarily designed into the facility, such as guard rails and platforms and ladder cages. Any open edge higher than six (6) feet requires: o Guardrail System o Safety Net System o Personal Fall Arrest System Any fixed ladder higher than 20 feet requires o Ladder Safety Device (with body harness) o Safety Cage with offset landings every 30 feet 21-2. Personal fall protection Personal fall protection is used in Confined Space Entry and other special work applications Full Body Harness Lanyard (regular or retractable) Shock Absorber Locking Snap Hooks (no single action) Lifeline (as needed) Anchorage o Must hold 5000 lbs. 21-3. Elevated work safety - for non-stationary applications Ladder safety 21-4. Basic Ladder Safety Survey the area for overhead power lines before setting up and climbing ladders Inspect ladders before usage - never use damaged or unsafe ladders Verify ladder capacity before climbing BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 75 of 129 Don't use the ladder for anything other than the job they're intended for- Do not use as platform or scaffold Use only approved ladders Use both hands, three points of contact on the ladder always One person on the ladder only Firm, level footing Use fall arrest if > 6 ft. working from ladder Secure top of extension ladders to platform or anchor point Extend 3 feet above access or working level Use 4:1 lean ratio; no more, no less Working alone at heights with extension ladders, scaffolding, or any other type of ladder can be dangerous. It's always best to have someone else with you to make working at height safer. 21-5. Rolling Staircases The Rolling Safety ladder is also known as Rolling Warehouse Ladder or Rolling Staircase. They are used by many warehouses, retail outlets, storage facilities, fire stations, and even truck stops to name a few. They are made of fiberglass, aluminum, and steel. Guidelines you should adhere to: Keep rolling ladders in good mechanical condition Keep rolling ladders free of oil, grease, wet paint, and other slipping hazar ds including rain, snow, and ice Rolling ladders that are stored outside should be regularly inspected for rust and corrosion Rolling ladders that have been damaged or \"sprung\" must be removed from service Rolling ladders that have missing rubber feet should have them replaced Rolling ladders should be climbed facing the ladder - not facing outward unless designed for this purpose Climb rolling ladders using 3-point contact (two hands and one foot, or one hand and two feet) Do not carry loads that are too bulky or heavy Do not over -reach - could cause ladder to tip Do not stand on the handrails Climb down from \"rolling\" scaffold/ staircase prior to moving it; do not move an occupied ladder Never stand with one foot on the ladder and the other on an object such as shelving Do not set up rolling ladders in passageways, doorways, driveways, or any location where they may be displaced Avoid setting up rolling ladders in direct proximity to any type of vehicle traffic Do not tamper with or modify rolling ladders Remove tools and equipment before moving a rolling ladder Use the step brake / lock assembly if equipped Consider tying off or securing the rolling ladder if tipping is a concern BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 76 of 129 Do not attempt to gain additional height by standing on boxes or buckets atop rolling ladder platforms 21-6. Rolling scaffold DO NOT RIDE ROLLING SCAFFOLDS. SECURE OR REMOVE ALL MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT from platform before moving scaffold. CASTER BRAKES MUST always BE APPLIED when scaffolds are not being moved. CASTERS WITH PLAIN STEMS shall be attached to the panel or adjustment screw by pins or other suitable means. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MOVE A ROLLING SCAFFOLD WITHOUT SUFFICIENT HELP - watch out for holes in the floor and overhead obstructions. DO NOT EXTEND ADJUSTING SCREWS ON ROLLING SCAFFOLD MORE THAN 12\". USE HORIZONTAL DIAGONAL BRACING near the bottom and at 20' intervals measured from rolling surface. DO NOT USE BRACKETS ON ROLLING SCAFFOLDS without consideration of overturning effect. THE WORKING PLATFORM HEIGHT OF A ROLLING SCAFFOLD must not exceed four times the smallest base dimension unless guyed or otherwise stabilized. 21-7. Scaffolding Following are some common -sense rules designed to promot e safety in the use of steel scaffolding. The rules do not purport to be all-inclusive or to supplant or replace other additional safety and precautionary measures to cover usual or unusual conditions. They are not intended to conflict with, or supersede, any state, local, or federal statute or regulation; reference to such specific provisions should be made by the user. Scaffolding must be erected by \"Competent Person\" on sound, rigid footing Stay within rated weight limit - No overloading \"Scaffold Grade\" Planking or walk boards are to be used Railings / toeboards are needed, otherwise Tie-off if no railing Access ladders are secured to the scaffolding. No portable ladders to be placed on scaffolding 21-8.

This section contains requirements for practices and procedures to protect employees in general industry from the hazards of entry into permit -required confined spaces. 22-1. Identify Permit Areas Confined space is defined as any space that: (1) Is large enough and so configured that an employee can bodily enter and perform assigned work (2) Has limited or restricted means for entry and exit (3) Is not designed for continuous employee occupancy. Examples of confined spaces include manholes, stacks, pipes, storage tanks, trailers, tank cars, pits, sumps. Entry into permit required confined spaces without proper precautions could result in injury, impairment, or death. A permit required confined space is defined by a space that: (1) Contains or has a potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere (2) Contains a material that has the potential for engulfing an entrant (3) Has an internal configuration such that an entrant could be trapped or asphyxiated by inwardly converging walls or by a floor which slopes downward and tapers to a smaller cross section; or (4) Contains any other recognized serious safety or health hazard. The facility manager shall ensure a survey of the worksite is conducted to identify confined spaces. This survey can be partially completed from initial and continuing site characterizations, as well as other available data (i.e., blueprints and job safety analyses). The purpose of the survey is to develop an inventory of those locations and/or equipment at their site that meets the definition of a confined space. This information shall be communicated to personnel, and appropriate confined space procedures shall be followed prior to entry. The initial surveys shall include air monitoring to determine the air q uality in the confined spaces. If the workplace contains permit spaces, the employer shall inform exposed employees, by posting danger signs or by any other equally effective means, of the existence and location of and the danger posed by the permit spaces. NOTE: A sign reading DANGER -- PERMIT -REQUIRED CONFINED SPACE, DO NOT ENTER or using other similar language would satisfy the requirement for a sign. If the employer decides that its employees will enter permit spaces, the employer shall develop and implement a written permit space program that complies with this section. The written program shall be available for inspection by employees and their authorized representatives. 22-2. Permit Scope and Duration BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 79 of 129 A permit is only valid for one shift. For a permit to be renewed, the following conditions shall be met before each reentry into the confined space: The Facility manger shall verify that all precautions and other measures called for on the permit are still in effect. Only operations or work originally approved on the permit shall be conducted in the confined space. 22-3. Responsibilities Entry Supervisor The employer shall ensure that each entry supervisor: o Knows the hazards that may be faced during entry, including information on the mode, signs or symptoms, and consequences of the exposure. o Verifies, by checking that the appropriate entries have been made on the permit, that all tests specified by the permit have been conducted and that all procedures Rescue Team Employees who have been designated to provide permit space rescue and emergency services shall take the following measures: o Provide affected employees with the personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to conduct permit space rescues safely and train affected employees, so they are proficient in the use of that PPE. o Complete a training drill using mannequins or personnel in a simulation of the confined space prior to the issuance of an entry permit for any confined space and at least annually thereafter. o Respond immediately to rescue calls from the Attendant or any other person recognizing a need for rescue from the confined space. o In addition to emergency response training, receive the same training as that required of the authorized entrants. o Have current certification in first aid and CPR. Entrants Associates who are granted permission to enter a confined space shall: o Read and observe the entry permit requirements. o Remain alert to the hazards that could be encountered while in the confined space. o Properly use the personal protective equipment that is required by the permit o Alert Attendant(s) when a prohibited condition exists and/or when warning signs or symptoms of exposure exist o Immediately exit the confined space when: they are ordered to do so by an authorized person they notice or recognize signs or symptoms of exposure a prohibited condition exists the automatic alarm system sounds. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 80 of 129 Equipment Personal protective equipment insofar as feasible engineering and work practice controls do not adequately protect employees. Each authorized entrant shall use a chest or full body harness, with a retrieval line attached at the center of the entrant's back near shoulder level, above th e entrant's head, or at another point which the employer can establish presents a profile small enough for the successful removal of the entrant. Wristlets may be used in lieu of the chest or full body harness if the employer can demonstrate that the use of a chest or full body harness is infeasible or creates a greater hazard and that the use of wristlets is the safest and most effective alternative. Ventilating equipment needed to obtain acceptable entry conditions o Positive - blowing air into the space, exhaust is through openings o Negative - pulling air out of the space, exhaust through blower inlet o Explosion -proof equipment if needed o Purging / Inerting - inert gas (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon) used to replace oxygen atmosphere in space for HOT work Other equipment: o Communications equipment - Both Attendant and associate entering the permitted confined space must have functional two -way radio in place before entering permitted confined space o Barriers and shields o Equipment, such as ladders, nee ded for safe ingress and egress by authorized entrants. o Lighting equipment needed to enable employees to see well enough to work safely and to exit the space quickly in an emergency 22-4. Protect the area When entrance covers are removed, the opening shall be promptly guarded by a railing, temporary cover, or other temporary barrier that will prevent an accidental fall through the opening and that will protect each employee working in the space from foreign objects entering the space. 22-5. Isolation and Lockout/ Tagout Safeguards All energy sources that are potentially hazardous to confined space entrants shall be secured, relieved, disconnected, and/or restrained before personnel are permitted to enter the confined space. Equipment systems or processes shall be locked out and/or tagged out as required by the BDC Lockout/Tagout Progran1 prior to permitting entry into the confined space. 22-6. Atmospheric testing BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 81 of 129 Atmospheric testing shall be conducted, and the results should be within acceptable limits. If atmospheric test results are not within acceptable limits, precautions to protect entrants against the hazards should be addressed on the permit and should be in place. Atmospheric testing conducted with a calibrated direct -reading instrument, in accordance with Appendix B to section 1910.146 would be considered as satisfying the requirements. If a hazardous atmosphere is detected during entry: Each employee shall leave the space immediately. The space shal l be evaluated to determine how the hazardous atmosphere developed; and measures shall be implemented to protect employees from the hazardous atmosphere before any subsequent entry takes place. Test or monitor the permit space throughout the procedure to determine if acceptable entry conditions are being maintained during the course of entry operations; and when testing for atmospheric hazards, test first for oxygen, then for combustible gases and vapors, and then for toxic gases and vapors. Provide each authorized entrant or that employee's authorized representative an opportunity to observe the pre-entry and any subsequent testing or monitoring of permit spaces. Reevaluate the permit space in the presence of any authorized entrant or that emp loyee's authorized representative who requests that the employer conduct such reevaluation because the entrant or representative has reason to believe that the evaluation of that space may not have been adequate; Communicate with the attendant as necessary to enable the attendant to monitor entrant status and to enable the attendant to alert entrants of the need to evacuate the space. Communicate with authorized entrants as necessary to monitor entrant status and to alert entrants of the need to evacuate the space Monitor activities inside and outside the space to determine if it is safe for entrants to remain in the space and orders the authorized entrants to evacuate the permit space immediately under any of the following conditions: The entrant recognizes any warning sign or symptom of exposure to a dangerous situation if the attendant detects a prohibited condition If the attendant detects the behavioral effects of hazard exposure in an authorized entrant If the attendant detects a situation outside the space that could endanger the authorized entrants; or If the attendant cannot effectively and safely perform all the duties required Summon rescue and other emergency services as soon as the attendant determines that authorized entrants may need assistance to escape from permit space hazards. Take the following actions when unauthorized persons approach or enter a permit space while entry is underway: Warn the unauthorized persons that they must stay away from the permit space, advise the unauthorized persons that they must exit immediately if they have entered the permit space Inform the authorized entrants and the entry supervisor if unauthorized persons have entered the permit space Perform non-entry rescues as specified by the employer's rescue procedure Perform no duties that might interfere with the attendant's primary duty to monitor and protect the authorized entrants. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 82 of 129 22-7. Vertical/ Horizontal Rescue Procedure The purpose of this procedure is to establish general procedures to follow in the event of an emergency that requires the rescue of a person or persons at this facility. However, each rescue must be evaluated on an individual basis since situations vary based on the spac e and circumstances involved. The Facility Manager is responsible for coordinating rescues with the in-house rescue team, and the local fire department. The attendant must try to rescue a victim from the outside the space whenever possible. Under no circumstances should the attendant enter a confined space to perform rescue. The attendant must notify the facility manager by if a rescue is needed and must stay at the space to be sure others who are not trained in rescue do not enter. The attendant must take whatever steps possible to prevent the situation from becoming worse, such as securing the entrants lifeline. The local fire department must be contacted to respond. Emergency phone numbers will be written on the permit. The facility manager or his designee will respond to the location and call for all available hands. The facility manager or his designee will then assign personal based on level of training to perform rescue tasks. 22-8. Training The Rescue Supervisor shall train affected employees to perform assigned rescue duties. The employer must ensure that such employees successfully complete the training required to establish proficiency as an authorized entrant. Training Frequency The Facility Manager shall provide training to each affected associates: before the associate is first assigned duties within a confined space before there is a change in assigned duties when there is a change in permit space operations that presents. a hazard for which an associate has not been trained when the facility manager has reason to believe that there are deviations from the confined space entry procedures required in this program, or that there are inadequacies in the associate' s knowledge or use of these procedures. The training shall establish associate proficiency in the duties required in this program, and shall introduce new or revised procedures, as necessary, for compliance with this program. Verification of Training Periodic assessment of the effectiveness of associate training shall be conducted by the facility manager. Training sessions shall be repeated as often as necessary to maintain an acceptable level of personnel competence. The complete policy and definitions are described here: BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 83 of 129 https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9797 BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 84 of 129 SECTION 23 FIRE AND EXPLOSION PROTECTION AND SAFETY 23-1. Fire prevention monitoring The following statements are from the BDG Compost Permit: BDG shall cond uct and record daily temperature monitoring for all Aerated Static Piles (ASPs) and windrows in the composting process. If routine temperature monitoring shows a location in a windrow where temperatures are greater than 160F, then employees shall flag the location and report it to the Facility Manager immediately. BDG shall conduct and record weekly temperature monitoring for all windrows in the curing phase and feedstock piles provided that the conditions set forth in Permit Section III.E.4 are met. If smoke is detected, employees shall flag the location and report it to the Facility Manager immediately The Facility Manager shall act promptly to investigate all issues related to fire safety. Employees shall be trained in the proper procedures for fighti ng a compost fire. If a fire is detected, BDG shall call 911 to request assistance from the local firefighting agency. BDG shall notify the Compliance and Permitting Section (CAPS) of the Delaware Department of Natural resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) at (302) 739 -9403 ext. 8 of any fire within 24 hours of detection. BDG management shall meet with the representatives from the Blades Volunteer Fire Department 23-2. Flash point 23-3. LEL/ UEL LEL is monitored around the biogas facility. We monitor CH4 levels through LEL monitors. We have chosen a CH4 monitoring system over an O2 monitoring system, because our concern is combustible gases being emitted and creating an explosive environment. The locations that have LEL sensors are also well ventilated, emphasizing the need to monitor CH4 versus O2. The lower explosive limit (LEL) is the minimal amount of concentration needed of a particular chemical to cause an explosion. The LEL is determined empirically for each pure chemical and air mixture at a given temperature. If more than than one chemical is dispersed in the air, as is normally the case, then LeChatelier's mixing rule can be applied to get the cumulative LEL for the mixture. Concentrations lower than the Lower Explosive Limit are 'too lean' to burn; those above the Upper Explosive Limit (UEL) are too rich to burn.The amount of gas present is specified as a percentage (%) of LEL. Zero percent Lower BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 85 of 129 Explosive Limit (0% LEL) denotes a combustible gas-free atmosphere. One hundred percent lower explosive limit (100% LEL) denotes an atmosphere in which gas is at its lower flammable limit. The relationship between percent LEL and percent by volume differs from gas to gas. In conce ntrations of 0-5% Methane in air, the mixture is too lean to ignite or burn. Methane BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 86 of 129 concentrations between 5% and 17% will support ignition and are considered highly flammable. At levels above 17%, the atmosphere is too rich for the methane to ignite. 23-4. Fire extinguisher Safety If fire extinguishers are available for employee use, it is the employer's responsibility to educate employees on the principles and practices of using a fire extinguisher and the hazards associated with fighting small or developing fires. [29 CFR 1910.157(g)(1)] This education must be provided annually and when a new employee is first hired. [29 CFR 1910.157(g)(2)] Employees who have been designated to use fire extinguishers as part of the emergency action plan, must be trained on how to use the fire extinguishers appropriately in the workplace. [29 CFR 1910.157(g)(3)] This training is a specialized form of education that focuses on developing or improving skills and it must be provided annu ally and when employees are first assigned these duties. [29 CFR 1910.157(g)(4)] Using a Fire Extinguisher The following steps should be followed when responding to incipient stage fire: Sound the fire alarm and call the fire department, if appropriate. Identify a safe evacuation path before approaching the fire. Do not allow the fire, heat, or smoke to come between you and your evacuation path. Select the appropriate type of fire extinguisher. Discharge the extinguisher within its effective range using the P.A.S.S. technique (pull, aim, squeeze, sweep). Back away from an extinguished fire in case it flames up again. Evacuate immediately if the extinguisher is empty and the fire is not out. Evacuate immediately if the fire progresses beyond the incipient stage. Pull Pin, Tamper Seal, Aim, Sweep, Squeeze Most fire extinguishers operate using the following P.A.S.S. technique: PULL... Pull the pin. This will also break the tamper seal. AIM... Aim low, pointing the extinguisher nozzle (or its horn or hose) at the base of the fire. o NOTE: Do not touch the plastic discharge horn on CO2 extinguishers, it gets very cold and may damage skin. SQUEEZE... Squeeze the handle to release the extinguishing agent. SWEEP... Sweep from side to side at the base of the fire until it appears to be out. Watch the area. If the fire re -ignites, repeat steps 2 - 4. If you have the slightest doubt about your ability to fight a fire. .. EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY! 23-5. Fuel and gas cylinder storage All flammable materials such as, but not limited to, gas, paints, thinners, etc. shall be stored in fireproof cabinets. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 87 of 129 Hundreds of different materials are packaged in compressed gas cylinders \u2014atmospheric gases, fuel gases, refrigerant gases, po ison gases, etc. The hazards associated with these gases include oxygen displacement, explosion hazards, toxic effects and the physical hazards of a ruptured cylinder. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) references general requirements for compressed gases in 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.101 and specific gas requirements are found in: 29 CFR 1910.102 - Acetylene 29 CFR 1910.103 1910.104 - 1910.105 - Nitrous Oxide 29 CFR 1910.110 - Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG) 29 CFR 1910.111 - Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia Gas Cylinder Inspection: General Requirements 29 CFR 1910.101(a) states employers must visually inspect compressed gas cylinders to ensure t hat they are in a \"safe condition.\" Visual cylinder inspections should look for leaks, bulging, defective valves, evidence of physical abuse, fire or heat damage, pitting, rusting or corrosion. If cylinders do not pass a visual inspection they need to be r epaired and re -qualified per Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. Visual and other inspections must be conducted as described in the DOT Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR 171 - 180). Where the DOT regulations are not applicable, visual and other inspections must be conducted as prescribed in the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA) C-6 Standard for Visual Inspection of Steel Compressed Gas Cylinders (revised June 28, 2013) and C-8 Standard for Requalification of DOT -3HT, CTC- 3HT and TC-3HTM Seamless Steel Cylinders (revised November 6, 2017) pamphlets. Gas Cylinder Storage and Handling: General Requirements Per 29 CFR 1910.101(b), the in-plant handling, storage and utilization of all compressed gas cylinders must be in accordance with CGA Pamphlet P -1 Standard for Safe Handling of Compressed Gases in Containers (revised March 23, 2015). Gas cylinders should always be properly secured to prevent tipping, falling or rolling. They can be secured with straps or chains connected to a wall bracket or other fixed surface, or by use of a cylinder stand. The gas cylinders should be stored in a cool, dry, well -ventilated, fire -resistant area that meets all applicable federal, state and local regulations. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 88 of 129 When a gas cylinder is empty or not being used, ensure that the valve is closed, the regulator removed and the valve protector cap is secured in place. Gas cylinders should be transported using hand trucks designed for that purpose and the cylinders should be secured so that they do not tip, fall or roll. Appropriate lifting devices, such as cradles or nets, are required when a crane, hoist or derrick is used to transport gas cylinders. Do not use magnets or slings to lift gas cylinders. Do not use the valv e protection cap for lifting a gas cylinder. It is necessary to take precautions so that gas cylinders are not dropped or allowed to strike each other or other objects. Dropping or striking may damage the gas cylinder valve, which could turn the gas cylinder into a dangerous torpedo with the potential to destroy property and/or injure personnel. Consult the appropriate safety data sheet (SDS) for detailed information on the chemical contained in the gas cylinder. Specific chemical handling and storage precautions will be outlined in the SDS. The SDS will also have specifications for appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for worker protection. Always reference the OSHA specific requirements highlighted earlier if handling or storing Acetylene, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrous Oxide, LPG, or Anhydrous Ammonia in your facility. 23-6. Housekeeping A key factor in fire prevention is good housekeeping or controlling accumulations of flammable and combustible waste materials. The following procedures will be followed to ensure that good housekeeping is in order. No items will be stored in the electrical rooms, except that which is used in the control circuits such as fuses, heaters, etc. The electrical rooms shall always be kept neat and clean. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 89 of 129 SECTION 24 EQUIPMENT TRAINING Training according to OEM will be required before a new hire may operate a piece of heavy equipment or utility vehicle. Each subsection is specific to the make/ model to be operated. 24-1. Forklift Forkli ft training BTSNA is obligated by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to provide heavy equipment operators with the proper safety and skills training. Operators at BIC AD facility may be required to operate electric or internal combustion lift trucks. Forklift operators must be trained to safely operate and maintain forklifts through a certification program as requir ed by OSHA Powered Industrial Truck requirements [29 CFR 1910.178] and industry best practices. No operator will be assigned to operate a forklift or other rolling stock such as front -end or skid -steer loader or tele -handler until completing a thorough training and maintenance program for the specific unit to be assigned. The training will combine written instruction with hands -on skill building and assessment. The heavy equipment training will cover operating conditions and tasks relevant to material handling in organic waste and compost facilities. Training program topics involve the environment around the forklift and operating hazards. The instructor will cover how to maintain stability on different surfaces, ramps, slopes and in tight workplaces or near pedestrians and clients' vehicles. Th e goal is to teach operators to identify potential dangers for reducing workplace accide nts. OSHA Publication 3949 Safe Forklift Operation Forklift operators and employees working around these operations are at risk of hazards such as collisions, falls, tip -overs, and struck -by conditions. Ways to prevent these hazards include: Forklift Ope rations Always operate the vehicle according to the manufacturer's instructions. Always wear a seatbelt when the forklift has one. Never exceed the rated load and ensure it is stable and balanced. Do not raise or lower the load while traveling. Keep a safe distance from platform and ramp edges. Be aware of other vehicles in the work area. Have clear visibility of the work area and ensure you have enough clearance when raising, loading, and operating a forklift . Use proper footi ng and the handhold, if available, when entering the lift. Use horns at cross aisles and obstructed areas. Watch for pedestrians and observe the speed limit. Do not give rides or use the forks to lift people. Safety Training Only trained and certif ied workers may operate a forklift. Ensure operators are trained on types of trucks in use. Forklift Maintenance Remove from service any forklift found to be in unsafe operating condition. Keep forklifts in clean condition, free of excess oil and gre ase. Repair and maintain according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 24-2. Windrow turner 24-3. Skid - steer implements 24-4. 24-5. Heading level 2 BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 90 of 129 Body Heading level 3 BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 91 of 129 SECTION 25 CRITICAL SAFETY DEVICES 25-1. Policy This section is to prevent the personal injury, environmental impact, or financial loss due to property damage, product loss, business interruption caused by the failure of Critical Control Devices (CSD). A Critical Safety Device (CSD) is defined as any device used to mitigate the consequences of a significant undesirable process incident. Consequences include risk to plant personnel, the community, assets, property, or the environment. Each location is required to evaluate its facility and develop an inventory/metrics of all Critical Safety Devices or equipment and the equipment or process they affect. This inventory must be reviewed annually and updated as changes occur in the facility. Examples of CSD may include: Pressure detection and release o Boiler pressure o Methane pressure o Digestate or liquid feed line pressure Emergency Stop system Alarm system Gas leak detection Fire Detection/ Suppression Safety Interlocks; feedback signals Flare optical sensor Conveyor Zero Speed sensor Machine guards Moisture leak sensors Emergency lighting and power back -up Safety Shower/ eye wash An inspection and testing program must be developed to confirm Critical Safety Devices are functioning as required. The frequency of inspection/ testing will be dependent upon manufacturer's recommendation, local/state/federal requirements, and assessment from engineering/safety. If a CSD is removed during maintenance or repair procedures the device will be tested after reinstallation to confirm proper operation. Documentation of the inspection and testing will be maintained in facility files. Inspections/testing must be kept on file for a minimum of 2 years plus current year. The installation of new equipment and/or process changes will include an evaluation of potential hazards that could occur to determine the need for CSD. Any new devices will be added to the inventory of Critical Safety Devices and the inspection/testing frequency must be identified prior to putting the equipment or process change into operation. Changes to existing CSD will be reviewed utilizing Management of Change procedures (PSM Facilities) or utilizing hazard assessment. (See Attachment) Equipment shall not be operated with nonfunctioning CSD unless a By -Pass Permit has been issued. (See Attachment) BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 92 of 129 25-2. Training All affected associates shall be trained on the presence of CSD in the facility. Training is required at initial hire, whenever there is a change and/or every 3 years. The trai ning shall include, at a minimum, the: Review of the CSD Policy Purpose of CSD Type of CSD utilized at the facility and their control function Prohibition of altering or disabling a CSD Immediate reporting of non -operating or malfunctioning devices By-Pass Permit procedures 25-3. Critical Safety By-Pass Permit The permit provides the Facility Manager or Superintendent permission to operate this process or piece of equipment without the associated CSD for a specific period identified. The permit is designed to be used as a temporary measure until the affected CSD is repaired or replaced. Operation under this permit is not allowed as a usual/continuous condition. The permit has a maximum life of seven days from the date of issuance and must be replace d by a new permit at the end of the seven -day period. Permits are required to be kept on file for 2 years plus current year. Permits will be uploaded as an incident BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 93 of 129 SECTION 26 HOUSEKEEPING A clean and organized workspace is the first step toward a safe, efficient, and pleasant working environment. An organized, clean workspace is an indication to inspectors that the crew is conscientious and compliant. What is the purpose of workplace housekeeping? 26-1. Purpose Effective housekeeping can help control or eliminate workplace hazards. Poor housekeeping practices frequently contribute to incidents. If the sight of paper, debris, clutter, and spills is accepted as normal, then other more serious hazards may be taken for granted . Housekeeping is more than cleanliness. It includes keeping work areas neat and orderly, maintaining halls and floors free of slip and trip hazards, and removing of waste materials (e.g., paper, cardboard) and other fire hazards from work areas. It also requires paying attention to important details such as the layout of the whole workplace, aisle marking, the adequacy of storage facilities, and maintenance. Good housekeeping is also a basic part of incident and fire prevention. Effective housekeeping is an ongoing operation: it is not a one-time or hit -and-miss cleanup done occasionally. Periodic \"panic\" cleanups are costly and ineffective in reducing incidents. Poor housekeeping can be a cause of incidents, such as: tripping over loose objects on floors, stairs and platforms being hit by falling objects slipping on greasy, wet or dirty surfaces striking against projecting, poorly stacked items or misplaced material cutting, puncturing, or tearing the skin of hands or other parts of the body on projecting nails, wire or steel strapping To avoid these hazards, a workplace must \"maintain\" order throughout a workday. Although this effort requires a great deal of management and planning, the benefits are many. 26-2. Benefits Copy Effective housekeeping results in: reduced handling to ease the flow of materials fewer tripping and slipping incidents in clutter -free and spill-free work areas decreased fire hazards lower worker exposures to hazardous products (e.g. dusts, vapors) better control of tools and materials, including inventory and supplies more efficient equipment cleanup and maintenance better hygienic conditions leading to improved health more effective use of space reduced property damage by improving preventive maintenance less janitorial work improved morale improved productivity (tools and materials will be easy to find) BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 94 of 129 Maintenance The maintenance of buildings and equipment may be the most important element of good housekeeping. Maintenance involves keeping buildings, equipment and machinery in safe, efficient working order and in good repair. It includes maintaining sanitary facilities and regularly painting and cleaning walls. Broken windows, damaged doors, defecti ve plumbing and broken floor surfaces can make a workplace look neglected; these conditions can cause incidents and affect work practices. So it is important to replace or fix broken or damaged items as quickly as possible. A good maintenance program provides for the inspection, maintenance, upkeep and repair of tools, equipment, machines and processes. Dust and Dirt Removal Enclosures and exhaust ventilation systems may fail to collect dust, dirt and chips adequately. Vacuum cleaners are suitable for removing light dust and dirt that is not otherwise hazardous. Industrial models have special fittings for cleaning walls, ceilings, ledges, machinery, and other hard -to-reach places where dust and dirt may accumulate. Special -purpose vacuums a re useful for removing hazardous products. For example, vacuum cleaners fitted with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters may be used to capture fine particles of asbestos or fiberglass Dampening (wetting) floors or using sweeping compounds before sweeping reduces the amount of airborne dust. The dust and grime that collect in places like shelves, piping, conduits, light fixtures, reflectors, windows, cupboards, and lockers may require manual cleaning. Compressed air should not be used for removing dust, dirt or chips from equipment or work surfaces. Employee Facilities Employee facilities need to be adequate, clean and well maintained. Lockers may be necessary for storing employees' personal belongings. Washroom facilities require cleaning once or more each shift. They also need to have a good supply of soap, towels plus disinfectants, if needed. If workers are using hazardous products, employee facilities should provide special precautions as needed such as showers, washing facilities and change rooms. Some facilities may require two locker rooms with showers between. Using such double locker rooms allows workers to shower off workplace contaminants and reduces the chance of contaminating their \"street clothes\" by keeping their work clothes separated from the clothing that they wear home. Smoking, eating or drinking in the work area should be prohibited where hazardous products are handled. The eating area should be separate from the work area and should be cleaned properly each shift. Surfaces Floors: Poor floor conditions are a leading cause of incidents so cleaning up spilled oil and other liquids at once is important. Allowing chips, shavings and dust to accumulate can also cause incidents. Trapping chips, shavings and dust before they reach the floor or cleaning them up regularly can prevent their accumulation. Areas that cannot be cleaned continuously, such as entrance ways, should have anti -slip flooring. Keeping floors in good order also means replacing any worn, ripped, or damaged flooring that poses a tripping hazard. Walls: Light -colored walls reflect light while dirty or dark -colored walls absorb light. Contrasting colors warn of physical hazards and mark obstructions such as pillars. Paint can highlight railings, guar ds and other safety equipment, but should never be used as a substitute for guarding. The program should outline the regulations and standards for colors. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 95 of 129 Maintain Light Fixtures Dirty light fixtures reduce essential light levels. Clean light fixtures can improve lighting efficiency significantly. Aisles and Stairways Aisles should be wide enough to accommodate people and vehicles comfortably and safely. Aisle space allows for the movement of people, products and materials. Warning signs and mirrors can improve sight - lines in blind corners. Arranging aisles properly encourages people to use them so that they do not take shortcuts through hazardous areas. Keeping aisles and stairways clear is important. They should not be used for te mporary \"overflow\" or \"bottleneck\" storage. Stairways and aisles also require adequate lighting. Spill Control The best way to control spills is to stop them before they happen. Regularly cleaning and maintaining machines and equipment is one way. Another is to use drip pans and guards where possible spills might occur. When spills do occur, it is important to clean them up immediately. Absorbent materials are useful for wiping up greasy, oily or other liquid spills. Used absorbents must be disposed of properly and safely. Tools and Equipment Tool housekeeping is very important, whether in the tool room, on the rack, in the yard, or on the bench. Tools require suitable fixtures with marked locations to provide an orderly arrangement. Returning tools promptly after use reduces the chance of it being misplaced or lost. Workers should regularly inspect, clean and repair all tools and take any damaged or worn tools out of service. Waste Disposal The regular collection, grading and sorting of scrap contribute to good housekeeping practices. It also makes it possible to separate materials that can be recycled from those going to waste disposal facilities. Allowing material to build up on the floor wastes time and energy since additi onal time is required for cleaning it up. Placing scrap containers near where the waste is produced encourages orderly waste disposal and makes collection easier. All waste receptacles should be clearly labelled (e.g., recyclable glass, plastic, scrap metal, etc.). Heading level 2 Body Heading level 3 o Heading level 4 26-3. Equipment and Tool Storage Picking up tools, parts and debris is required before closing out a work plan. Tools must be returned to their proper storage location. Good organization of stored materials is essential for overcoming material storage problems whether on a temporary or permanent basis. There will also be fewer strain injuries if the amount of handling is reduced, especially if less manual material handling is required. The location of the stockpiles should not BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 96 of 129 interfere with work, but they should still be readily available when required. Stored materials should allow at least three feet of clear space under sprinkler heads. Stacking cartons and drums on a firm foundation and cross tying them, where necessary, reduces the chance of their movement. Stored materials should not obstruct aisles, stairs, exits, fire equipment, emergency eyewash fountains, emergency showers, or first aid stations. All storage area s should be clearly marked. Flammable, combustible, toxic and other hazardous materials should be stored in approved containers in designated areas that are appropriate for the different hazards that they pose. Storage of materials should meet all requirements specified in the fire codes and the regulations of environmental and occupational health and safety agencies in your jurisdiction. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 97 of 129 SECTION 27 MACHINE GUARDING Machine Guarding is included in the list Of Critical Safety Devices. The policy of BDC is to permit only trained and authorized associates to operate machinery, tools, or equipment at any time. This written Machine/Equipment Safety and Guarding Plan describes methods and practices for care and use of machines, equi pment, and tools that can be read and understood by all managers, supervisors, and BDC associates. No associate shall operate and/or cause to be operated any machinery without proper protective guards in place or modify/disable any protective guards on mac hinery without contacting a supervisor or implementing the lockout/tagout policy. 27-1. Definitions Guards: Barriers that prevent Associates from contacting any moving portions or parts of exposed machinery or equipment that could cause physical harm to them. Enclosures: Mounted physical barriers which prevent access to moving parts of machinery or equipment. Point -of-Operation: The. area on a machine or item of equipment, where work is being done and material is positioned for processing or change by the machine. Power Transmission: Any mechanical parts which transmit energy and motion from a power source to the point -of-operation. Example: Gear and chain drives, cams, shafts, belt and pulley drives and rods. NOTE: Components which are (7) feet or less from the floor or working platform shall be guarded. Nip Points: Running Machine or equipment parts, which rotate towards each other, or where one part rotates towards stationery objects. Shear points: The reciprocal (back and forth) movement of a mechanical part, past a fixed point on a machine. Rotating Motions and exposed mechanism are dangerous unless guarded. Even a smooth, slowly rotating shaft or coupling can grasp clothing or hair upon contact with the skin and force an arm or hand into a dangerous position. Affixed or hinged guard enclosure protects against this exposure. Reciprocating: Reciprocating motions are produced by the back and forth movements of certain machine or equipment parts. This motion is hazardous, when exposed, offering pinch or shear points to an Associate. A fixed enclosure such as a barrier guard is an effective method against this exposure. Transverse Motions: Transverse motions are hazardous due to straight line action and in -running nip points. Pin ch and shear points also are created with exposed machinery and equipment parts operating between a fixed or other moving object. A fixed or hinged guard enclosure provides protection against this exposure. Cutting Actions: Cutting action results when rotating, reciprocating, or transverse motion is imparted to a tool so that material being removed is in the form of chips. Exposed points of operation\u00b7 must be guarded to protect the operator from contact with cutting hazards, being caught between the operating parts and from flying particles and sparks. Shearing Action: The danger of this type of action lies at the point of operation where materials are actually inserted, maintained and withdrawn. Guarding is accomplished through fixed barriers, interlocks, remote control placement (2 hand operation controls), feeding or ejection. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 98 of 129 Interlocking Guard: A guard equipped with a safety switch so that when the guard is opened or removed, it automatically shuts off the moving parts. Shaft: A device that transmits movement to an object. Shafts are used frequently to attach a roller to a conveyor. Keyway: A notch in a shaft to attach a roller, spindle, bearing, etc. Guards must prevent hands, arms or any part of an associate's body from making contact with hazardous moving parts. A good safeguarding system eliminates the possibility of the operator or other associates from placing parts of their bodies near hazardous moving parts. Associates should not be able to eas ily remove or tamper with guards. Guards and safety devices should be made of durable material that will withstand the conditions of normal use and must be firmly secured to the machine. Guards should ensure that no objects can fall into moving parts. An e xample would be a small tool which is dropped into a cycling machine could easily become a projectile that could and injure others. Guard edges should be rolled or bolted in such a way to eliminate sharp or jagged edges. Guard should not create interference which would hamper associates from performing their assigned tasks quickly and comfortably. Lubrication points and feeds should be placed outside the guarded area to eliminate the need for guard removal. Fan blades, chain or belt drives less t han 7 feet above the floor or working level shall be guarded. Fan guards shall have no openings larger than 1/2 inch. 27-2. Operating Procedures Associates may not remove a guard for any reason while operating any piece of machinery or equipment. All necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn while the machinery or equipment is running. If an associate is distracted or unable to focus on the work with the machinery or equipment, they must stop work with that machinery or equipment. Upon finishing with a piece of equipment, tool, or machine, basic maintenance must be performed. It should be kept sharp, oiled, and stored per manufactures recommendations Problem equipment must be immediately reported to your supervisor so it can be repaired or replaced. Associates must always use the proper piece of machinery or equipment for the job, Requirements for Safeguards Safeguards shall meet these minimum general requirements: Prevent contact: The safeguard shall prevent hands, arms, and any other part of a worker's body from contacting dangerous moving parts. An effective safeguarding system eliminates the possibility of the operator or another worker placing parts of their bodies near hazardous moving parts. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 99 of 129 Secure: Workers s hould not be able to easily remove or tamper with the safeguard. Guards and safety devices shall be made of durable material that will withstand the conditions of normal use. Guards shall be affixed to the machine where possible and secured elsewhere if fo r any reason attachment to the machine is not possible. Protect from falling objects: The safeguard shall ensure that no objects can fall into moving parts. A small tool which is dropped into a cycling machine could easily become a projectile that could strike and injure someone. Create no new hazards: A safeguard defeats Its own purpose if it creates a hazard of its own such as a shear point, a jagged edge, or an unfinished surface which can cause a laceration. The edges of guards, for instance, should be rolled or bolted In such a way that they eliminate sharp edges Create no interference: Any safeguard which impedes a worker from performing the job quickly and comfortably might soon be overridden or disregarded. Proper safeguarding can enhance e fficiency since It can relieve the worker's apprehensions about injury. Allow safe lubrication: If possible, one should be able to lubricate the machine without removing the safeguards. Locating oil reservoirs outside the guard, with a line leading to the lubrication point, will reduce the need for the operator or maintenance worker to enter the hazardous area. 27-3. Shafts and Keyways Rotating exposed shafts shall not protrude through a bearing, power transmission etc. longer than \u00bd the shaft's diamete r (the width of the shaft). For example, if a shaft is 2 inches wide, it can only protrude 1 inch. If the shaft cannot be cut, then a non-rotating cap must be used. All keyways must be covered with a non -rotating cap or ground smooth. Powered Hand Tool Guards Hazardous moving parts of a power tool need to be safeguarded. For example, belts, gears, shafts, pulleys, sprockets, spindles, drums, fly wheels, chains, or other reciprocating, rotating, or moving parts of equipment shall be guarded if such parts are exposed to contact by employees. Safety guards shall never be removed when a tool is being used. 27-4. New Equipment Start -up Inspection Procedures Before operation of the equipment in the workplace, all specialty departments must signify that the equipment meets all expectations in their area of concern. The facility manager is accountable for all phases of installation and for making sure equipment is safe and efficient to run before letting associates operate it. Bench Grinders Fixed Bench Grinde rs shall be securely anchored to prevent movement or designed in such a manner that in normal operation they will not move. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 100 of 129 The tongue guard is the adjustable metal guard that reaches from the outer diameter of the abrasive wheel to the guard that encloses the upper part of the abrasive wheel. The tongue guard should be adjusted to be within \u00bc\" of the diameter of the wheel. Because the wheel wears down with use, the tongue guard is to deflect pieces of an exploding grinding wheel away from the user. Grinding wheels can fail when either a work piece has been caught between the work rest and the wheel, or when a crack has developed in the abrasive wheel. Work rests provide support to the work piece during an offhand grinding operation. By supporting the work piece, they allow the operator to better control the grinding operation. They also help prevent gouges into the wheel itself by the work piece. However, to be effective, they must be properly adjusted (i.e. Less than 1/8\" from the outer diameter of the wheel). If the gap between the rest and the wheel .is too wide, a work piece can be trapped between the abrasive wheel and the work rest. Since any abrasive wheel wears with use, work rests must be periodically adjusted. Portable Hand Grinders - Safety guards used on right angle head or vertical portable grinders shall have a maximum exposure angle of 180 degrees. The guard shall be located so that it is between the operator and the wheel during use. Adjustment of the guard shall be such that pieces of an accidentally broken wheel will be deflected away from the operator. Mounting and Inspection of Abrasive Wheels All abrasive wheels will be inspected before mounting them. A ring test or other manufactures recommendations needs to be comp leted at this time. Wheels must be dry and free of all dust when applying the ring test. It should be noted that organic bonded wheels do not emit the same clear metallic ring as do vitrified and silicate wheels. Tap wheels about 95 degrees each side of th e vertical centerline and about 1 or 2 inches from the periphery. Then rotate the wheel 45 -degrees and repeat the test. A sound and undamaged wheel will give a clear metallic tone. If cracked, there will be a dead sound, not a clear \"ring\". Grinding wheel s shall fit freely on the spindle and remain free under all grinding conditions. Anchoring Grinders and other Fixed Machinery Grinders and other fixed machinery must be properly anchored. The intent is to prevent machinery from moving or \"walking\" during use. Grinders can be dangerous equipment if used improperly. 27-5. Disciplinary Procedures Constant awareness of and respect for machine, tool, and equipment safety procedures and compliance. with all safety rules are considered conditions of employ ment. Supervisors and individuals in the Safety and Personnel Department reserve the right to issue disciplinary warnings to associates, up to and including termination, for failure to follow the guidelines of this machine, tool, and equipment safety progr am. Walking On Conveyors (Screws, Drag, and Belts) BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 101 of 129 The practice of stepping, climbing, or walking on or over conveyors (including screws, drags, or belt type conveyors) is forbidden except for the following: Approved designated crossover walkways, and diamond plated areas covering conveyors, may be used to cross over ground level or elevated conveyors when designed for this purpose. Ground level conveyors in the normal path of walking must be designed for crossover with appropriate diamond plate or step over engineering controls. If not, you must walk around. Conveyors, which are not designed to be used as walkways, must be locked out and tagged out by the associates, prior to walking on the conveyor(s). Note: Conveyors which are designed as walkways do not require lockout. 27-6. Training Sign -off I, certify that I have been trained by my employer, Bioenergy DevCo, on the Machine Guarding Policy. The following have been covered and I understand the basic knowledge in each topic. Removing machine guards. Proper replacement of machine guards. Reporting of machine guard problems. Not operating equipment unless guards are in place. The practice of stepping, climbing, or walking on or over conveyors (including screws, drags, or belt type conveyors) is forbidden except for the following: Approved designated crossover walkways, and diamond plated areas covering conveyors, may be used to cross over ground level or elevated conveyors when designed for this purpose. Ground level conveyors in the normal path of walking must be designed for crossover with appropriate diamond plate or step over engineering controls. If not, you must walk around. Conveyors, which are not designed to be used as walkways, must be locked out and tagged out by the associates, prior to walking on the _conveyor(s). BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 102 of 129 SECTION 28 HAND TOOL SAFETY Use of tools makes many tasks easier. However, the same tools that assist us, if improperly used or maintained, can create significant hazards in our work areas. Associates who use tools must be properly trained to use, adjust, store, and maintain tools properly. This program covers hand, electrical, pneumatic, powder driven, and hydraulic tool safety. 28-1. General Safety Precautions Associates who use hand and power tools and who are exposed to the hazards of falling, flying, abrasive and splashing objects, or exposed to harmful dusts, fumes, mists, vapors, or gases must be provided with the particular personal equi pment necessary to protect them from the hazard. All hazards involved in the use of tools can be prevented by following five basic safety rules: Keep all tools in good condition with regular maintenance. Use the right tool for the job. Examine each tool for damage before use. Operate according to the manufacturer's instructions, Provide and use the proper protective equipment. Hand Tools Hand tools are non -powered. They include anything from axes to wrenches. The greatest hazards posed by hand tools result from misuse and improper maintenance. Some examples: Using a screwdriver as a chisel may cause the tip of the screwdriver to break and fly, hitting the user or other associates. If a wooden handle on a tool such as a hammer or an axe is loose, splintered, or cracked, the head of the tool may fly off and strike the user or another worker. A wrench must not be used if its jaws are sprung, because it might slip. Impact tools such as chisels, wedges, or drift pins are unsafe if they have mushroomed heads. The heads might shatter on impact, sending sharp fragments flying. 28-2. Guards Hazardous moving parts of a power tool need to be safeguarded. For example, belts, gears, shafts, pulleys, sprockets, spindles, drums, fly wheels, chains, or other reciprocating, rotating, or moving parts of equipment must be guarded. Guards, as necessary, should be provided to protect the operator and others from the following: Point of operation Nip points Rotating parts Flying chips and sparks Safety guards must never be removed when a tool is being used. For example, p01iable circular saws must be equipped with guards. An upper guard must cover the entire blade of the saw. A retractable lower BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 103 of 129 guard must cover the teeth of the saw, except when it contacts the work material. The lower guard must automatically return to the covering position when the tool is withdrawn from the work. 28-3. Safety switches The following handheld powered tools are to be equipped with a momentary contact \"on-off'' control switch: Drills, tappers, fastener drivers, horizontal, vertical and angle grinders with wheels larger than 2 inches in diameter, disc and belt sanders, reciprocating saws, saber saws, and other similar tools. These tools also may be equipped with a lock -on control if turnoff can be accomplished by a single motion of the same finger or fingers that tum it on. The following handheld powered tools may be equipped with only a positive \"on/off' control switch: Plate sanders, disc sanders with discs 2-inches or less in diameter; grinders with wheels blade shanks \u00bc-inch wide or less. Other handheld powered tools such as circular saws having a blade diameter greater than 2 inches, chain saws, and percussion tools without positive accessory holding means must be equipped with a constant pressure switch that will shut off the power when the pressure is released. Due to the p ossibility of a wheel disintegrating (exploding) during start -up, the associate should never stand directly in front of the wheel as it accelerates to full operating speed. Portable grinding tools need to be equipped with safety guards to protect workers not only from the moving wheel surface, but also from flying fragments in case of breakage. 28-4. Power Grinder Safety Precautions Always use eye protection. Turn off the power when not in use. Never clamp a handheld grinder in a vise. 28-5. Pneumatic Tools Pneumatic tools are powered by compressed air and include chippers, drills, hammers, and sanders. There are several dangers encountered in the use of pneumatic tools. The main one is the danger of getting hit by one of the tool's attachments or by fastener the worker is using with the tool. Eye protection is required, and face protection is recommended for associates working with pneumatic tools. Working with noisy tools such as jackhammers requires proper, effective use of hearing protection. When using pneumatic tools, associates are to check to see that they are fastened securely to the hose to prevent them from becoming disconnected. A short wire or positive locking device attaching the air hose to the tool will serve as an added safeguard. A safety clip or retainer must be installed to prevent attachments, such as chisels on a chipping hammer, from being unintentionally shot from the barrel. Screens must be set up to protect nearby workers from being struck by flying fragments around chippers, riveting guns, staplers, or air drills. Compressed air guns should never be pointed toward anyone. Users should never \"dead -end\" it against themselves or anyone else. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 104 of 129 28-6. Powder -actuated Tools Powder -actu ated tools operate like a loaded gun and should be treated with the same respect and precautions. In fact, they are so dangerous that they must be operated only by specially trained associates. Hydraulic Power Tools The fluid used in hydraulic power tools must be an approved fire -resistant fluid and must retain its operating characteristics at the most extreme temperatures to which it will be exposed. The manufacturer's recommended safe operating pressure for hoses, valves, pipes, filters, and other f ittings must not be exceeded. 28-7. Jacks All jacks - lever and ratchet jacks, screw jacks, and hydraulic jacks - must have a device that stops them from jacking up too high. Also, the manufacturer's load limit must be permanently marked in a prominent place on the jack and should not be exceeded. A jack should never be used to support a lifted load. Once the load has been lifted, it must immediately be blocked up. Use wooden blocking under the base, if necessary, to make the jack level and sec ure. If the lift surface is metal, place a I -inch -thick hardwood block or equivalent between it and the metal jack head to reduce the danger of slippage. To set up a jack, make certain of the following: The base rests on a firm level surface. The jack is correctly centered. The jack head bears against a level surface, and the lift force is applied evenly. Proper maintenance of jacks is essential for safety. All jacks must be inspected before each use and lubricated regularly. If a jack is subjected to an abnom1al load or shock, it should be thoroughly examined to make sure it has not been damaged. Hydraulic jacks exposed to freezing temperatures must be filled with adequate antifreeze liquid. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 105 of 129 SECTION 29 HOT WORK The Hot Work procedures define a system of control that will allow work involving possible sources of ignition to be carried out safely to minimize or eliminate fire hazards associated with hot work operations. Hot work permits (see Appendix A) are to be completed and filed for any work that can generate sparks or flame. Hot work requirements are specific to the classification of the work zones. A hot work permit will be required for any activity that requires the use of a flame or generates sufficient heat or sparks that might serve as a source of ignition. Persons performing hot work and signing permits must have completed training and approved by the regional manager. The person conducting the hot work will complete a permit and meet all the requirements of this policy. The hot work policy and permit process applies to contractors as well as Perdue associates. Permits will be issued to the contractor by the authorized person on the site prior to any hot work starting. 29-1. Definitions Hot Work - any activity that results in sparks, fire, molten slag, or hot material that has the potential to cause fires or explosions. Examples of Hot Works: Cutting Brazing Soldering Thawing Pipes Torch Applied Roofing Grinding and Welding. Special Hazard Occupancies - Any area containing Flammable Liquids, Dust Accumulation, Gases, Plastics, Rubber and Paper Products. Combustible - a material capable of sustained burning when ignited and in the presence of air. Flammable - a liquid having a flashpoint below 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Fire Watch - a trained individual stationed in the hot work area that monitors the work area for the beginnings of potential, unwanted fires both during and after the hot work for at least 4 hours. Individuals must be trained and familiar with the operation of portable fire extinguishers and methods to activate building fire alarm systems. Fire watch can have other assigned duties if these do not prevent him/her from being an effective fire watch. Special attention should be paid to weather conditions. If there is wind or the potential for wind is present, then extra precautions should be taken to avoid ho t slag from blowing beyond the protection zone. Cutting or welding shall not be permitted in the following situations: In areas not authorized by management. In sprinkled buildings while such protection is impaired. In the presence of potentially explosive atmospheres, e.g... an NFPA classified flammable area. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 106 of 129 In areas near the storage of large quantities of exposed, readily ignitable materials. In areas where there is dust accumulation within 3 5 feet of the area where welding/hot work will be conducted. All dust accumulation should be cleaned up following the housekeeping program of the facility before welding/hot works are permitted. Suitable extinguishers shall be provided and maintained ready for instant use. A fire watch person shall be provided during and at least 4 hours past the completion of the hot work project. The facility manager may add additional time. A hot work permit will be issued on all welding or cutting outside of the designated welding area. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 107 of 129 SECTION 30 BLOOD -BORNE PATHOGENS PURPOSE: Blood borne pathogens, especially hepatitis and human Immune deficiency virus (which causes AIDS), can rarely be transmitted in the workplace during an associate's duties. To prevent this from occurring, and in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1030, BDC is implementing this policy. A \"Potentially Infectious Materials\" means: Blood The following human body fluids: vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardia! fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva In dental procedures, any body fluid that Is visibly contaminated with blood and all body fluids In situations where it Is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids. EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN: Exposure Determination: The following job classifications convey occupation exposure: All nurse positions (Lead, Head, Charge, Day, Night, etc.) Non -nurse positions in medical departments who have hands -on contact with patients. All physician positions The following job classifications may convey occupational exposure to some associates in those jobs: Designated first responder to accident scenes Note that associates responding to an accident, as \"Good Samaritans'' are not Included as being at risk. Tasks In which occupational exposure may occur Include: Injections into patients (vaccines, tuberculin tests, allergy tests, etc.) Saliva exposure (during alcohol breath tests, pulmonary function tests, resuscitation, etc.) First aid post laceration or other trauma. Examination and treatment of broken skin (allergies, rashes, dermatitis, infections, etc.) Methods of Compliance: Universal blood and body fluid precautions shall be used in the care of all patients. Work Practice Controls All associates shall routinely use appropriate barrier precautions to prevent skin and mucous - membrane exposure when contact with blood _or other body fluids of any-patient is anticipated. Gloves shall be worn for touching blood and body fluids, mucous membranes, or non -Intact skin of all patients, for handling items or surfaces soiled with blood or body fluids and for performing vein puncture and other vascular access procedures. Gloves shall be changed after conta ct with each patient. Masks and protective eyewear shall be worn during procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or other body fluids BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 108 of 129 to prevent exposure of mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. Gowns shall be worn during procedures that are likely to generate splashes of blood or other body fluids. Hands and other skin surfaces shall be washed Immediately and thoroughly if contaminated with blood or other body fluids. Hands shall be washed immediately after glo ves are removed. Needles and Other Sharps: All associates shall take precautions to prevent injuries caused by needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices during procedures, when cleaning up after procedures, during disposal of used needles, and when handling sharp instruments after procedures. To prevent Needle -stick injuries, needles shall not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand, removed from disposable syringes or otherwise manipulated by hand. Rather the syringes with uncapped needles shall be placed directly In appropriate containers for subsequent disposal. These containers shall be: Puncture resistant Labeled or color coded with the universal \"Biohazard\" label, the label to be fluorescent orange or orange -red with lettering or symbols in a contrasting color. Leakproof on sides and bottom. To minimize the need for emergency mouth -to-mouth resuscitation, mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices shall be available for use in areas in which the need for resuscitation is predictable. Healthcare workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis shall refrain from all direct patient care and from handling patient care equipment until the condition resolves. All waste contaminated with blood or body fluids will be placed in red trash bags to Identify it for proper disposal. Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm and handling contact lenses are prohibited in the part of medical departments whose patien ts are treated and in any other work areas where there is reasonable likelihood of occupational exposure. All procedures Involving blood or other potentially Infectious materials shall be performed in such a manner as to minimize splashing, spraying, spatt ering and generation of droplets of these substances. Personal Protective Equipment When there Is occupational exposure, Perdue Farms Inc. provides, at no cost to the associate, appropriate personal protective equipment such as, but not limited to gloves, gowns, laboratory coats, masks, eye protection and mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or other protection devices. Personal protective equipment Is deemed \"appropriate\" only If It does not permit blood or other potentially infectious materials to pass through to associates' work clothes, street clothes, skin, eyes, mouth -or other mucous membranes under normal conditions of use. When there -is occupational exposure, the associates shall use the appropriate equipment as outlined above. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action unless rare circumstances occurred ln which, in the associate's professional judgment, the use of such equipment would have prevented the delivery of health care or would have posed a hazard to the associate or to the injured Individual. When the associate makes that judgment, the circumstances shall .be investigated and documented In order to determine whether changes can be Instituted to prevent such occurrences in the future. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 109 of 129 Accessibility: All appropriate personal protective equipment shall be readily accessible and in good repair. Soiled Garments: When a garment is penetrated by blood or other infectious material, the garment shall be removed immediately or as soon as feasi ble. When personal protective equipment shall be removed prior to leaving the work area. When personal protective equipment ls removed, it shall be placed in an appropriately designated area or container for storage, washing, decontamination or disposal. Gloves shall be worn when It can be reasonably anticipated that the associate may have hand contact with blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin; when performing vascular access procedures and when handling or touching contaminated items or surfaces. Disposable (single use) gloves such as surgical or examination gloves, shall be replaced as soon as practical when contaminated or as soon as feasible if they are torn, punctured, or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised; they shall not be washed or decontaminated for re-use. Utility gloves may be decontaminated for re-use if the integrity of the glove Is not compromised. However, they must be discarded if they are cracked, peeling, torn, punctured, or exhibits other signs of deterioration or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised. Masks, Eye Protection, and Face Shields Masks In combination with eye protection devices, such as goggles or glasses with solid side shield, or chin -length face shield, shall be worn whenever splashed, spray, splatter, or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials may be generated and eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be reasonably anticipated. Housekeeping All equipment and environmental and work surfaces shall be cleaned and decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant immediately or as soon as feasible after any spill of blood or other potentially infectious materials. Regulate d Waste Contaminated Sharps Discarding and Containment Used syringes and other contaminated sharps shall be discarded immediately or as soon as feasible in containers that are: Closable Puncture resistant Leak proof on sides and bottom Labeled on color -coded During use, containers for contaminated sharps shall be: Easily accessible to personnel and located as close as is feasible to the immediate area where sharps are used or can be reasonably anticipated to be found; Maintained upright throughout use; and replaced routinely and not be allowed to overfill. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 110 of 129 When moving containers of contaminated sharps from the area of use, the containers shall be: closed Immediately prior to removal or replacement to prevent spu1age or protrusion or contents during handling, storage, transport or shipping; Placed in a secondary container If leakage is possible. The second container shall be: Closable Constructed to contain all contents and prevent leakage during handling, storage, transport, or shipping; and Labeled or color -coded. Reusable containers shall not be opened, emptied, or cleaned manually or In any other manner, which would expose associates to the risk of percutaneous injury. Other Regulated Waste Containment Regulated waste (defined as waste containing potentially infectious material) shall be placed In containers which are: Closable Constructed to contain all contents and prevent leakage of fluids during handling, storage, transport, or shipping Labeled or color -coded; and Closed prior to removal to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents during handling, storage, transport, or shipping. Disposal of all regulated waste shall be in accordance with applicable Regulations of the United States, States and Territories, and political subdivisions of States and Territories. Laundry Contaminated laundry shall be handled as little as possible with a minimum of agitation. Contaminated laundry shall be bagged or containerized at the location where it was used and.shall not be sorted or rinsed in the location of use. Contaminated laundry shall be placed and transported In bags or containers labeled or color - Associates who have contact with contaminated laundry shall wear protective gloves and other appropriate personal protective equipment. When a facility ships contaminated laundry off -site to a second facility which does not utilize Universal Precautions in the handling of all laundry, the facility generating the contami nated laundry must place such laundry in bags or containers which are labeled or color -coded as contaminated. Hepatitis B vaccination and post -exposure evaluation and follow -up: BDC makes available the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series for all ass ociates who have occupational exposure and for all associates who have had an exposure Incident. Appropriate evaluations and vaccination policies are performed by licensed health care professionals under the supervision of a licensed physician and are available at no cost to the associate. Vaccination regimens are to be performed In accordance with current US Public Health Service recommendations. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 111 of 129 The vaccination series Is available to all associates with occupational exposure within ten ( 10) days of Initial assignment unless: The vaccination series has previously been received, or Antibody testing h8s revealed that the associate Is immune (defined as anti HBs greater than 10 mlU/ml) or, The vaccine ls contraindicated for medical reasons. The vaccination series consists of one (1) dose (20 mcg of plasma -derived vaccine {Heptavax and others] or 10 mcg of recombinant vaccine (Recombivax and others] given initially, followed by the same dose at one (1) month and at six (6) months, a vaccine must be given in deltoid muscle, not in hip. If an associate has previously received vaccination series In other than deltoid muscle (e.g. hip), antibody status check is available to associate, and vaccination series is available (but onl y recommended after checking antibody level and finding it to be anti HBs less than 10 mlU/ml). If an associate with occupational exposure declines the vaccine, then that associate must sign the following statement (Included as Appendix A): I understand that due to my occupational exposure to blood or other potentially Infectious materials I may be at risk of acquiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) Infection. I have been given the opportunity to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, at no charge to myself. However, I decline hepatitis B vaccination currently. I understand that by declining this vaccine, l continue to be at risk of acquiring hepatitis B, a serious disease. If, in the future, I continue to have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials and I want to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, I can receive the vaccination series at no charge to me. The vaccination series continues to be availab1e to that associate if later and still subject to occupational exposure, the associate desires it. Post exposure evaluation and follow -up: Following a report of an exposure Incident, an Immediate medical evaluation shall be carried out by the BDC Medical Department, to include: Documentation of the routes of exposure and the circumstances. Identification and documentation of the source individual, unless the employer can establish that Identification Is infeasible or prohibited by state or local law The source individual's blood shall be tested as soon as feasible and after consent is obtained to determine HBV and HIV infectivity. If consent Is not obtained, II shall be documented that legally required consent cannot be obtained. When the source individual's consent Is not required by law, the source individual's blood, if available, shall be tested and the results documented. When the source individual is already known to be infected with HBV or HIV, testing for the source Individual's known HBV or HIV status need not be repeated. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 112 of 129 Results of the source individual's testing shall be made available to the exposed associate and the associate shall be Informed of applicable laws and regulations concerning disclosure of the Identity and Infectious status of the source individual. Collec tion and testing of blood for HBV and HIV serological status: The exposed associate's blood shall be collected as soon as feasible and tested after consent Is obtained. If the associate consents to baseline blood collection but does not give consent at that time for HIV serologic testing, the sample shall be preserved for at least 90 -days. If, within 90 - days of the exposure incident, the associate elects to have the baseline sample tested, such testing shall be done as soon as feasible. Serologic testin g includes: HIV HBs Antigen Anti-HBs Anti-HCV Post -exposure prophylaxis - As recommended by the US Public Health Service, and under the direction of a local physician: Following an occupational exposure to potentially infectious material (as defined in part \"II\" of this policy) 2. 3. if source hepatitis B status Is. positive for HBs Antigen or Is unknown. 4. If exposed associate's antibody levels are protective (anti HBs greater than 10 mlU/ml) no further Immunization is necessary. 5. If exposed associate's antibody levels are not protective or not available within 24-hours, Hepatitis B Immune Globulin .06mllkg intramuscularly (hip or deltoid) shall be administered as soon as possible, preferable with 24-hours, and 6. If exposed associate's hepatitis B antibody levels are not protective, primary immunization shall be carried out in accordance with III -C-1-b of this policy (including signed statement if associate declines). 7. If source hepatitis Bs Antigen is negative, no further Intervention is necessary. HIV post -exposure treatment. *Note: Prophylaxis must begin immediately.

BDC shall comply with the requirements Involving transfer of records set forth In 29 CFR 1910.20 BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 115 of 129 SECTION 31 SLIP, TRIP AND FALL PROTECTION 31-1. Site inspection A site inspection for potential slip, trip or fall hazards is part of operator daily checks and to be included in the work plan OSHA maintains general industry regulations on walking/working surfaces that guard a gainst hazards including clutter, protruding objects and wet conditions. These hazards can harm everyone in a facility, regardless of title or job responsibilities. Slips, trips, and falls cause nearly 700 fatalities per year and many more injurious accidents in the workplace according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are three physical factors involved in slips, trips, and falls: friction, momentum, and gravity. Each one plays a role. Friction is the resistance between objects, mome ntum is affected by the speed and mass of an object, and gravity is the force exerted on an object by the Earth. SLIPS Slips are a loss of balance cause by too little friction between your feet and the surface you walk or work on. Loss of traction is the l eading cause of workplace slips. Slips can be caused by wet surfaces, spills, or weather hazards like ice or snow. Slips are more likely to occur when you hurry or run, wear the wrong kind of shoes, or don't pay attention to where you're walking. You can help avoid slips by following these safety precautions: Practice safe walking skills. Take short steps on slippery surfaces to keep your center of balance under you and point your feet slightly outward. Clean up or report spills right away. Even minor spills can be very dangerous. Don't let grease accumulate at your workplace. Be extra cautious on smooth surfaces such as newly waxed floors. Also be careful walking on loose carpeting. Trips Trips occur whenever your foot hits an object, and you are moving with enough momentum to be thrown off TRIPS balance. Trips are more likely to happen when you are in a hurry and don't pay attention to where you're going. To prevent trip hazards: Make sure you can see where you are walking. Do not carry loads that you cannot see over. Keep walking and working areas well lit, especially at night. Keep the workplace clean and tidy. Store materials and supplies in the appropriate storage areas. Arrange furniture and office equipment so that it does not interfere with walkways or pedestrian traffic in your area. Properly maintain walking areas, and alert appropriate authorities regarding potential maintenance related hazards. Falls Falls occur whenever you move too far off your center of FALLS balance. Falls account for more workplace fatalities than any other reason. Employee Training There are no formal training requirements for slips, BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 116 of 129 trips, and falls. However, employees are to be trained to recognize and avoid unsafe conditions, which could include the hazards listed here. To avoid falls consider the following measures: Don't jump off landings or loading docks. Use the stairs Repair or replace stairs or handrails that are loose or broken Keep passageways and aisles clear of clutter and well lit. Wear shoes with appropriate non -slip soles Training Tips Use the employee handout to explain the hazards of slips, trips and falls with the employees. Review OSHA 1910.22 Walking/Working Surfaces and explain to your employees what is expected of them to prevent accidents. Review ways that your employees can protect themselves from slip, trip and fall hazards. Based upon your workplace, discuss how to right choice of shoe can help prevent slips, trips, and falls. Show new employees areas that might create slip, trip or fall hazards. Discuss any company programs for shoe purchase or reimbursement. Show new employees areas that might create slip, trip or fall hazards. For more information see: 29 CFR 1910.22 -.30 Walking/working surfaces. 31-2. Fall Protective Falls from heights or same level BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 117 of 129 SECTION 32 SAFE LIFTING PROCEDURES Bioenergy DevCo requires the procedures in this plan to be followed to provide a safe working environment. We have implemented these procedures on safe lifting practices to ensure that associates are trained to protect themselves from the hazards of improper lifting practices. It is the responsibility of management at BDC to ensure that these policies are implemented. It is the responsibility of management to ensure that this policy and the information necessary to carry out these polices is communicated to associates. It is the responsibility of all associates to follow safe work practices and comply with these rules regarding work practices. The effectiveness of the back -safety plan depends upon the active support and involvement of all affected associates. Associates in the Operations and Maintenance departments have job duties that require lifting or materials handling. These associates are to be trained on and follow the rules of this back -safety plan. 32-1. Safe Lifting Techniques The following points outline good lifting practices and procedures, safe lifting techniques that may be taught to associates to minimize their risk of back injury and pain. These practices are written with the lifter in mind. Lifting remains an important function despite the level of mechanization found in the workplace today, so atten tion must be directed toward safe lifting practices. The basics of good lifting are: S- Straight back A- Approach the object F - Feet flat E - Enter the squat position L - Lift with the legs I - Improve lift with proper breathing F - Firmly hold the object T - Turn with the feet Material handling is an important part of our day-to-day jobs, whether it is manual or mechanical. Back support belts do not substitute for proper lifting technique and will not prevent back injuries. If not used correctly bac k belts can be of more harm than good. Only the medical department can issue back belts. 32-2. Alternative Materials Handling Techniques BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 118 of 129 Alternative materials -handling techniques for carrying or moving loads are to be used whenever possible to minimize manual lifting and bending requirements. These alternative materials -handling techniques include use of: Hoists Forklifts Dollies Carts 32-3. Other Safe Work Techniques Work issues other than lifting are related to back pain or injury. You can avoid them or improve work techniques related to them. Catching objects and working low When catching falling or tossed objects, feet should be firmly planted, with the back straight and knees slightly bent. Legs should absorb the impact, not the back. When working on something low, bend at the knees, keeping the back as straight as possible. Bending from the waist can lead to back pain. Other Material Handling Tasks Tasks such as lowering, pushing, pulling, and carrying can create hazards to the back as well. If the task feels uncomfortable or unnatural, utilize the alternative materials -handling techniques listed in this Back -Safety Plan. \" BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 119 of 129 SECTION 33 LINE BREAKING This policy establishes a procedure to minimize the risk of injury to associates engaged in the breaking or disconnecting of a line or hose that has contained hazardous substances. Hazardous Substances Include: Mineral Oil Steam Compressed Air Fats, Oils, Grease (FOG) Hydraulic Oil Hazardous Chemicals Liquid AD feedstock This policy does not apply to any Propane, Natural Gas or Hexane lines. You are to follow the PAB Policy for Line Breaking of Propane, Natural Gas or Hexane. Examples of operations, which could be considered, line breaking: Removing a strainer basket. Working on a transfer pump seal. Removing a valve from a line to replace or repair. This policy covers all emergency situations where it is necessary to break into a closed system containing a hazardous material. It does not apply to planned shutdo wns or plant purge outs. Policy: Breaking Lines Whether a line currently contains or did contain the above listed hazardous materials, the line break policy is to be followed. For such work, a line -breaking permit must be completed. Procedures for issuance of line breaking permits are as follows: This procedure applies to jobs requiring the opening, or working on any line, connecting fitting, valve, pump, filter, temperature wells, pressure gauges, flow meter, hose fitting, sight gauge or level devi ce which have contained a hazardous substance, flammable material is not limited to compressed gas, steam, air or liquid is present. A properly completed line -breaking permit must be displayed at the job site. The line -breaking permit must always be posted until the work is completed and restored to service. Any associate or contractor assigned to the job must sign off on the permit. Permits apply to contractors, service workers and employees If it is a normal routine to disconnect and connect mechanical eq uipment such as Chicago fittings, Dixon Fitting, or check valve quick couplings will not require a line breaking permit. Example (Compressors, BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 120 of 129 sand pots, PTO hydraulics) When using Chicago fittings, it will require a line bleed off fitting be fore disconnecting. Protective Equipment, Staff, and Procedures In addition to the standard personnel protective equipment required, the following may be required: Rubber Boots Coveralls - Cloth, Tyvek, or Chemical. Gloves - Leather, Long, or Rubber. Goggles Acid Hood Respirator - Full Face, Half Face, Air Supplied, or SCBA Shield - Face or Special Shielding Suit - Acid, Hot, or Rain Spill Containment Barricades Blank flanges may need to be installed Fire Extinguishers Grating, floor opening covered Lock/Tag/Verify Plan Required Atmospheric monitoring Non -sparking Tools Piping Support - straps, rigging Pump Locked Out Standby Person System Flush System temperature less than 100 degrees C Ventilation - Exhaust or Dilution Water Hose Precaution in Breaking Lines Breaking a line is, in essence, breaking into a closed system. Regardless of the checking done or the instruments employed, it must be assumed that, at the point where the line is to be broken, there is an extremely hazardous substance liquid or off-gas which (if released) could present a hazard to associates. The following precautions are to be taken in line breaking operations: If pumps, motors, or automatic valves are present, they must be locked out and danger tags applied. Push buttons to operate pumps or valves must be tried to ensure the system is locked out. The portion of the line being worked on shall be isolated from those preceding and following it in the most effective way. This will usually consist of shutting valves and locking them out. This guards against confusion arising out of the use of non -rising stem valves, quick opening valves, and other valves which are peculiar to the unit, or which have their own peculiarities, perhaps known only to the plant personnel. The person in charge of the operation will verify that the correct valves are closed and locked out. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 121 of 129 Before the breaking occurs, the immediate area shall be set up for maximum protection to near -by persons. Barriers shall be employed where applicable. Ensure that when work is performed on elevated piping or equipment and there is potential for liquids to fall, the area below the work is barricaded and posted, as needed, with suitable containment when applicable. Prevention of hazardous liquid from entering drains must be taken. The line shall be drained completely, making sure that vents are opened to prevent the possibility of an air lock. The following steps shall be followed to ensure actual dismantling of the line: Loosen the bolts of a flange which are farthest away from the worker Shield whenever possible. Stand aside to avoid any spray Prepare the lines for additional work by purging or rinsing out the line. Responsibilities: The person in charge of the operation and associates/contractor assigned to task is responsible for declaring the equipment safe to be opened. They will take any steps to prevent any violations of safeguards covered in this policy. Line breaking jobs within a department must be approved and continually observed for concurrence with this policy until the work is complete. All openings made during the job shall be documented and individual permit(s) closed out before completion of the job and all danger tags removed before the equipment is restored to service. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 122 of 129 SECTION 34 LINE BREAKING - FUEL OR GAS The Maintenance Supervisor/Facility Manager will determine the scope of work that can be performed by BDC Associates/Contractors based on their work experience or qualifications. Prior to approving work that falls within the scope of this procedure, as applicable to the job, Operations personnel shall: Ensure that, to the extent possible, the lines or equipment has been emptied, purged, flushed, drained, vented, isolated (including flow and pressure) and tested to ensure the system is free from recognized hazards. Ensure that lockout tagout procedures have been used to isolate equipment that may have contained hazardous material or may have been used under pressure prior to line breaking activities. When possible, verify de -pressurization of lines or equipment and absence of material has been accomplished by opening vents and/or drains and ensure they are cleared. Where present, pressure gauges will be checked for pressure reading and bleeders will be opened and cleared. Issue proper line breaking and hot work permits. Gas line purging To prevent an explosive environment within the gas line or area near the opening, the gas line must be purged with an inert gas such as nitrogen or CO2 prior to line breaking. Purge inlets and outlets have been designed into each gas line. Purging will continue until the gas concentration is less than 20% of the LEL. Prior to performing work that falls within the scope of this procedure Maintenance/Contractor shall: Ensure that the lines or equipment have been properly prepared. Ensure that when work is performed on elevated piping or equipment and there is potential for liquids to fall, the area below the work is barricaded and posted, as needed. Ensure that all applicable permits have been obtained and that all the requirements have been met. Ensure that the appropriate level of personal protective equipment is clearly defined and available for use. Ensure that personnel are in a defensive position to avoid a spray or release when attempting the initial opening. (Flanges will be cracked open on the opposite side of the line from the employee.) Consider means of egress and location of eyewash/safety shower before commencing work. Personal Protective Equipment The appropriate type of personal protective equipment given in any line breaking situation will vary with the hazards associated with the material, equipment, location, and the ability to verify that the equipment/line is clear. The minimum protective equipment in any line-breaking situation shall be: Hardhat Gloves BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 123 of 129 Face shield Goggles or safety glasses as determined by the hazard. Appropriate chemical protective clothing as needed. Personal gas monitors Additional PPE may be required, depending upon the job. After the line break is completed and hazards have been identified, PPE may be downgraded per job requirements. Additional Safe Practices All piping systems will be considered pressurized until line breaking is complete. When opening a flanged pipe, maintain a safe position, loosen bolts farthest away from yourself (to avoid a spray) then loosen bolts on either side and pry open side farthest away from yourself cautiously until there is obviously no pressure in the line. In breaking a union joint, loosen cautiously and flex the joint away from yourself (to avoid spray) making certain all pressure is relieved. Be aware of pinch points due to spring back, shrinkage, or expansion. Be aware of the potential for flow to resume when working on systems that contain highly viscous or frozen liquids. Close valves and use blind flanges to isolate the area being serviced. Use a box wrench instead of an open -end wrench whenever possible. Tighten all bolts to the required torque specification and certify all welds prior to pressure testing. Testing Requirements Low pressure line test (< 1psig) may be tested with a solution of mild soap and water spray. Do not attempt to locate leaks with open flames or other methods that provide a source of ignition. High Pressure line test- conduct a visual examination of the system prior to pressure test. The test medium shall be nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Oxygen or air shall never be used. The test must meet municipal requirements but shall be no less than 1 \u00bd times the maximum working pressure, but not less than 3 psig (20 kPa gauge). Where the test exceeds 125 psig {862 kPa gauge) care should be taken to not exceed the strength of the pipe. The test duration shall be \u00bd hour for each 500 ft3 of pipe volume, but not less than 10 minutes or more than 24 hours. Any reduction of tes t pressure shall be deemed to indicate the presence of a leak unless such reduction can be readily attributed to some other cause. Any pressure testing should be done with the proper range gage that has been certified through a lab. Documents of certificat ion should be filed on site. Underground lines BDC requires that all underground biogas, natural or LP gas lines be pressure tested using the following intervals of frequency: Metal gas lines will be tested every five years unless the age of the piping is greater than 25 years. Then testing will occur annually. Poly gas lines will be tested every five years regardless of service life. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 124 of 129 Above ground lines BDC requires that all above ground natural or LP gas lines be tested for leaks annually. Calibrated Gas Indicator Test - Sniff test exposed above ground lines. If Gas Indicator sniff test is not available a leak detection solution can be used and applied over the joints to see if bubbling occurs. Training Operations, Maintenance and Contractor personnel who engage in line breaking activities must be trained in safe line breaking procedures prior to participating in line breaking activities. Refresher training must be provided a minimum of every three years. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 125 of 129 SECTION 35 FACILITY INSPECTION PROGRAM 35-1. Internal Inspection Inspection of work areas and audits of safety programs are tools that can be used to identify problems and hazards before these conditions result in accidents or injuries. Audits also help to identify the effectiveness of safety program management and can be used as a guide to assure regulatory compliance and a safe workplace. Responsibilities of Management 1. Schedule audit and inspection procedures for all work areas, processes and procedures. 2. Conduct routine audits and inspections using the monthly inspection checklist. 3. Ensure audits are conducted by associates who understand the various safety programs and policies. Responsibilities of Supervisors 1. Conduct informal daily safety inspections and ensure all unsafe conditions are corrected. 2. Conduct documented monthly inspections and ensure all unsafe conditions are corrected. Corrections All safety deficiencies found during audits and inspections should be corrected as soon as possible. Documentation of corrections should be made on the audit or inspection sheet, and conditions that present a hazard are to be corrected or controlled immediately. This will be done by using a work order. Types of Inspections Supervisor & Management Daily Walk -through: this is an undocumented inspection that is made daily prior to startup and shift change to ensure the facility and equipment are in safe conditions for Associates. All noted unsafe areas are placed in a safe condition prior to Associates working in the area. Monthly Safety Team Inspection: Each month members of the Safety Team will tour the entire facility with the Facility Manager. This tour is to ensure Safety Team Members are familiar with all areas of the operation. Record of problem areas, committee recommendations and deficiencies will be recorded and provided to management. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 126 of 129 35-2. Government Inspections It is the policy of BDC to permit inspections by representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA). Such inspections shall be accomplished in accordance with the following procedures. Greeting the Inspector Refer the OSHA compliance officer arriving on the premises to the designated production area of the facility. No associates other than the facility manager or his designated person should communicate with the OSHA compliance officer prior to the opening conference. If the facility manager or his designated person is not available, then the inspector is to wait for the facility manager or designated person. If the facility manager or the designated person will not be available within a reasonable time, (30 to 60 minutes) the inspector is to be informed of the fact. Do not let the OSHA compliance officer wander around. The facility manager should review the OSHA compliance officer's credentials as well as obtain his or her business card with an address and phone number to ensure that the compliance officer is on an official inspection. Photocopy and give back to the inspector. Determine from the OSHA compliance officer the purpose, scope, and the circumstances of the visit to the facility. If the inspection is based on a compliant, obtain a copy of the complaint. Photocopy an d give back to the inspector. Determine if the compliance officer has a warrant to conduct the inspection. If yes, find out the scope of the warrant. Photocopy and give back to the inspector. Notify the designated Perdue representatives of OSHA's presence. At a minimum, the Regional Manager and Safety Manager must be contacted prior to beginning the opening conference. Fax all copies (credentials, compliant, and warrant if it applies) to Human Resources before the opening conference. Opening Conference Have an opening conference with the OSHA compliance officer to establish: The focus areas of the inspection. The scope and route of the walk -around inspection. The designated trade -secret areas or processes. The procedure for conducting associate interviews and producing documents. The schedule of interviews. The documents for review by OSHA. The compliance officer should be asked to put all requests for company information and/or documents in writing. Inform the OSHA complianc e officer that all documents will be controlled though the senior management and the safety manager. The facility's rules and procedures OSHA will be expected to follow. Conduct all necessary safety and health advising/training of OSHA compliance officers prior to access to restricted areas. Ensure that the OSHA compliance officer wears all necessary personal protective equipment and follow all company safety and health policies. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 127 of 129 The facility manager or his designated person shall always stay with the OSHA compliance officer during the inspection except during hourly associate interviews. If the hourly associate request that the facility manager or his designated person stay with them during the interview this is approved by B DC. All salaried management must not in any way be interviewed by themselves. Perdue policy requires that another salaried manager be present during the interview. The facility manager or his designated person should take detailed notes, including date(s) of inspection, areas inspected, pictures taken, measurements taken, associates interviewed, and any items discussed during the visit. If the compliance officer deviates from the focused area(s) discussed during the opening conference, then the faci lity manager of his designated person should inquire as for the reason for the deviation. When appropriate, photographs should be taken of areas inspected by the OSHA compliance officer as well as all items photographed by the compliance officer. Video als o should be utilized, if used by the compliance officer. Duplicate pictures or video should be taken at the same angle as the inspector took. This also applies for any measurements taken. The facility manager or his designated person should immediately hav e corrected any alleged violations identified by the OSHA compliance officer to the extent possible but should not acknowledge that a citation is appropriate. Do not verbally admit to any alleged violation during the inspection. If the OSHA complianc1: off icer ask about what it would require to correct an alleged violation the response should be to have the OSHA compliance officer state what the violation is and what corrective action the OSHA compliance officer recommends. All work rules and safety procedures should be enforced and applicable to the OSHA compliance officer and walk -around team during the inspection. Document all samples or monitoring test taken by the OSHA compliance officer and request copies of all sampling and monitoring results a s well as all photographs and videos taken. The company should request the OSHA compliance officer to schedule sampling and monitoring at a time when the company can conduct its own sampling and monitoring. Closing Conference Primarily listen to the OSHA c ompliance officer's proposal, and do not argue or debate the initial proposed findings. Provide information and documentation relevant and supportive of the company's position as well as any information which shows abatement of any alleged violation(s). Take detailed notes on the alleged hazards identified and the problem areas indicated by the OSHA compliance officer 35-3. Insurance Inspections/ Audits 35-4. Conducting Safety Audits Records BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 128 of 129 Records of audits and inspection will be maintained in accordance with the requirements of the specific programs. As a minimum, the last two program audits will be kept on record. Routine inspection records will be maintained on a most current basis. Records of deficiency corrections will be main tained for one calendar year from date of correction. There are four basic questions an audit should answer. The persons or team designated to conduct the audits should take a fact-finding approach to gather data. These auditors should be familiar with both the company program and the various local, state, and federal requirements. All audit comments, recommendations and corrective actions should focus on these four questions: Does the program cover all regulatory and best industry practice requirements? Are the program requirements being met? Is there documented proof of compliance? Is associate training effective? BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 129 of 129 SECTION 36 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC) A management system is established for ensuring that changes to processes are properly analyzed, documented, and communicated to affected personnel. MOC is a written structured program that reviews and obtains approval for any change that could affect safety. Examples at BIC include changes in process setpoints, change in equipment operation, change in operating procedures or other facility operations Types of System Design MOC: Process chemicals Technology Equipment Procedures Facilities 36-1. Analysis The first step in the Management of Change pro cess is to fill out a \"Request For Change\" form. This form would describe the proposed change and the reason for the change. (An example RFC form can be seen by clicking on the RFC icon.) The RFC form would then be approved by the originator's manager and forwarded to the Management of Change manager. At smaller facilities this position is not a full time position. The MOC manager would consult the originator and the affected party to determine if the change should be pursued. BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 130 of 129 Once the decision has been made to pursue the change, the determination is then made if the change is a Replacement in Kind (RIK) or a Management of Change (MOC). If the change is a replacement in kind, then that should be noted on the Request For Change and the RFC forwarded to the maintenance/production scheduler. A \"Replacement in Kind\" is a replacement that meets the original design specifications of the item being replaced and will be discussed in more detail in the next slide. If the change to be considered is not a Replacement in Kind, then it enters the MOC system. An MOC form, task review, and hazard review need to be completed. This is often a multidisciplinary review. The outcome of this review is MOC documentation of the controls needed in or der to implement the Management of Change in a safe manner. Replacement -in-kind If an item is replaced with a similar item that meets the original design specification, then the replacement item is a replacement in kind . As an example, a piping specification may call for a threaded 1 -1/2\" stainless steel ball valve. A 1 -1/2\" stainless ball valve by any manufacturer of such a valve, such as Apollo or Jamesbury, would be a replacement in kind. A threaded brass ball valve by American Valve or by Wat ts would not be a replacement in kind since the material of construction is different. A gate valve by Apollo or by Jamesbury also would not be a replacement in kind since the type of valve has changed. Pre-implementation requirements 36-2. Documentation BIC_BDCSIteSafetyManual_2020 -11-05_R00 Page 131 of 129 The MOC system should also include: Maintaining a Management of Change log of every approved change for the past two years. A Management of Change form with approval signatures must be used. Design calculations should be attached. A Readiness checklist (PSSR) should be used for the startup after the Management of Change. Conducting periodic monitoring (field checks) of the Management of Change procedures. The Management of Change system should be audited with the annual Process Safety Audit. 36-3.
