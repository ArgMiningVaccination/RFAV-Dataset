EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 9MAYOR'S LETTER May 31, 2023 Dear Residents of San Francisco, I am honored to present my proposed balanced budget for the City and County of San Francisco for Fiscal Years (FY) 2023-24 and 2024-25. We are in a unique moment as we face both uncertainty and incredible opportunity. This budget reflects that by closing our projected $780 million two-year shortfall, protecting jobs, and minimally impacting services, while allowing for strategic investments to lift our City up and set us up for a brighter, more prosperous future. We are a city that can deliver on both safety and justice. A city that believes everyone deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. A city that celebrates our innovative spirit, where the next great idea is created by world-leading businesses and where we create opportunities for all our residents to succeed and thrive. First, the proposed budget invests in public safety. This budget recognizes a national trend that San Francisco is not immune to: a chronic understaffing that plagues public safety departments and places stress on minimum staffing levels. The budget funds contract agreements reached with our police officers, firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, and 911 dispatchers that recognize the tremendous work these men and women do for our City day in and day out, and also acknowledges the difficulty these departments have in recruiting new talent. Police officers choosing to begin their careers in San Francisco will now be the highest paid in all large Bay Area cities and new retention bonuses aim to extend the careers of current officers. I'm confident these investments will help build back our police force in the coming years. Additional public safety investments build upon our successes in expanding alternatives to policing and civilianization of law enforcement work, including through the use of Police Service Aides and Community Safety Ambassador programs that make our streets more welcoming and safe for both residents and tourists. Ambassadors will continue to play a key role in improving street conditions citywide, and specifically in the Tenderloin, mid- Market, Mission, and in and around BART stations. All ambassadors will now be coordinated through a new Department of Emergency Management lead, improving deployment strategies to maximize their effectiveness. San Francisco needs to strengthen its support for creating economic success in this time of dramatic shifts in how people work and shop. Remote LONDON N. BREED Mayor, City and County of San Francisco per year with mental health services and 4,500 per year with substance use issues. Our budget will continue and expand critical behavioral health programs, including funding our Street Response Teams, opening additional mental health beds, and expanding immediate access to services through our Behavioral Health Access Center. We'll expand treatment options for those most at-risk of overdose and open wellness hubs - safe and supervised spaces to get drug use off the streets and connect people to services. This budget also addresses other key priorities including children and youth programming to address systemic inequities in education, funding for food security, support of nonprofit partners, continuance of the Dream Keeper Initiative, and advancing the Climate Action Plan, all of which are vital to San Francisco's future. We couldn't do it all. Deficits require difficult choices. This budget includes reductions across departments from current levels of spending, only minimally funds our capital program, and reduces salary budgets in some departments with high vacancy rates. It also uses some reserves to balance out lower revenue levels in the coming years, but maintains our largest reserves to hedge against the uncertainties ahead. I look forward to working with the Board of Supervisors, the community, and all stakeholders to pass a budget that reflects these priorities and our shared values and vision for the City we call home. London N. Breed Mayor 10 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY10 EXECUTIVE SUMMARYwork and the changing nature of retail continue to impact our City, but we can't just sit back and wait for things to go back to the way they were. We have to act to set our City up to recruit new businesses, stabilize the ones we have, and fill vacant office and retail spaces across our City. This budget proposes changes to business and commercial rent taxes aimed to incentivize new businesses and ease the burdens of San Francisco's taxes on our existing businesses. I'm also setting aside funds for small business relief as well as dollars for downtown and neighborhood events, and for storefront activations to bring all our commercial corridors to life - from Powell Street to the Castro to West Portal and beyond. Helping everyone have a safe and affordable place to call home requires a commitment to building more housing at all income levels, and also providing support for the most vulnerable populations in our City. San Francisco saw a 15 percent reduction in unsheltered homelessness between 2019 and 2022, but there remains significant work to do. The budget makes critical investments in new housing, shelter, and homelessness prevention as outlined in our citywide strategic plan, to create 594 new shelter beds, 545 new housing slots, and 825 new homelessness prevention and problem-solving slots over the next two years. We are a city that leads with services for those who are in need of support. San Francisco's Department of Public Health serves 16,000 people 10 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 11 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 11EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The budget for the City and County of San Francisco (the City) for Fiscal Years (FY) 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 is $14.6 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively. Just over half of the budget consists of self-supporting activities, primarily at the City's Enterprise departments, which focus on City- related business operations, and include the Port, Municipal Transportation Agency, Airport, and Public Utilities Commission. General Fund monies comprise the remaining half, which support public services such as public health, housing, support for those experiencing homelessness, safety and fire services, parks management, and others. The City receives funds into its General Fund from a combination of local tax revenues, such as SAN FRANCISCO'S BUDGET property, transfer, sales, hotel, and business taxes, as well as state and federal resources, and fees for service. Each year, the City makes decisions on how to allocate the City's budget based on the resources that are available and the priorities and needs of the City and its residents. The table below summarizes total spending in each of the next two years in the City's Major Service Areas. The City and County of San Francisco is also a major employer. The proposed budget for FY 2023-24 includes salaries and benefits for 33,476 employees. This represents a 0.8 percent growth in the labor force compared to the FY 2022-23 budget. The City's budget process begins in September with preliminary revenue projections for the upcoming budget years. In December, the Mayor's Office and the Controller's Office issue budget instructions to departments, which contain detailed guidance on the preparation of departments' budget requests. Departments then prepare their budget requests and submit them to the Controller by mid-February. The Controller consolidates, verifies, and refines the departments' proposed budgets, and turns the proposals over to the Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance. From March through May, the Mayor's Office analyzes each budget proposal, examining policy and service implications, in order to meet citywide needs and reflect the Mayor's goals and priorities for the upcoming year. Concurrently, the Mayor conducts budget outreach with community members to obtain feedback on budget priorities.

For the proposed budget for FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, the Mayor's Office hosted a public meeting to obtain input on budget priorities understand community members' neighborhood and citywide priorities for the upcoming budget. All San Franciscans had the opportunity to share their budget feedback and priorities by emailing the Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance or using an online form. Feedback from these various forums was used to make decisions about the upcoming budget. The Mayor presents a balanced two-year budget proposal for departments by the first business day in June of each year. The Board of Supervisors' Budget and Appropriations Committee holds public hearings on the budget in June, makes recommendations for approval, and makes changes to the budget before it goes to the full Board. The entire budget is heard and must be voted on and approved by the full Board of Supervisors by August 1st. Finally, the budget returns to the Mayor for signature and final adoption. In November of 2009, voters passed Proposition A, which amended the City Charter to require the City to transition to a two-year budget cycle for all departments beginning in FY 2012-13. Four departments - the Municipal Transportation Agency, the Public Utilities Commission, the Airport, and the Port -adopted fixed two-year budgets in last year's budget cycle for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24. Since the four enterprises are on a fixed two-year budget cycle, the departments budgets were closed this budget cycle. Any changes in departments with a fixed budget above or below the percentage threshold require approval from the Board via supplemental. All other departments retain a rolling two-year budget. Five-Year Financial Plan and Budget Instructions for Fiscal Years 2023-24 and 2024-25 In January 2023, the Mayor's Office, along with the Controller's Office and the Board of Supervisors' Budget and Legislative Analyst, released an updated Five-Year Financial Plan for FY 2023-24 through FY 2027-28. The report projected a General Fund deficit of $200.8 million in FY 2023-24 and $527.5 million in FY 2024-25, for a cumulative deficit of $728.3 million. The report also projected that the deficit would grow to $1.2 billion by the end of the forecast period. The forecast was driven by a number of key factors, including the persistence of remote work, with impacts to commercial and residential real estate, as well as taxable gross receipts; implementation of measures adopted by voters in 2022; previously negotiated wage increases on employee contracts; escalating health insurance costs; pension costs; inflationary increases on non-personnel operating costs; and projected capital and technology project spending. In recognition of the projected deficit, the Mayor required departments to propose General Fund budget reductions totaling 5 percent in FY 2023-24, and an ongoing 8 percent in FY 2024-25. Five-Year General Fund (728.3)12 EXECUTIVE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 13 12 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 13Five-Year General Fund Shortfall: January (728.3)Update to Prior Projections In March 2023, the three offices released an update to the Five-Year Financial Plan, known as the March Update. This report showed the two upcoming fiscal years, the period for which the City is required to adopt a balanced two-year budget, the three offices projected a $779.8 million shortfall, or $51.5 million more than the deficit of $728.3 million projected in the January report. The worsening trends are largely the result of lower revenue projections, higher employee benefit costs, and new spending proposals adopted by the City since the January forecast. As a result of the worsened fiscal outlook, the Mayor instructed departments to propose additional General Fund reductions that is equivalent to at least another 5 percent in each fiscal year and identify project balance savings as one-time sources to help balance the budget. Balancing the Budget The Mayor's proposed budget is balanced with a combination of departmental budget reductions, savings and spending reductions in citywide operating costs, the use of one-time project savings and fund balance, as well as the use of some reserves. The budget also leverages non-General Fund revenue sources to support critical programs, notably in homelessness and public health. The projected two-year deficit was closed using the following solutions: Departmental Budget Reductions: Departments and the Mayor's Office reduced General Fund expenditures by cutting salary budgets to account for position vacancies, limiting professional services and some grant budgets, and shifting costs to non-General Fund sources. Citywide Operating Savings: Savings in other citywide costs include reduced funding levels for capital, IT, and equipment spending; savings in fleet, fuel, and workers' compensation costs from prior projections; reductions in costs in the City's debt portfolio, and savings targets in technology and real estate expenses in FY 2024-25. Use of Special Funds: The budget leverages multiple non-General Fund sources to support programs, including Our City, Our Home (\"Prop C\") funds to support spending in homelessness; recent opioid settlement funding to support overdose prevention, behavioral health, and other related programs; and reductions to the Early Care and Education General Fund baseline to support funding for food access programs. Fund Balance and Project Savings: The proposed budget appropriates the projected FY 2022-23 year-end surplus of $36.3 million as starting fund balance in FY 2023-24. Budgeted fund balance also includes $137.0 million in various project and other one-time savings across departments for projects that are complete, funded with other ongoing sources, or non-critical to core department operations. Revenue Improvements: Modest revenue improvements from the March Update to the Five-Year Financial Plan in FY 2023-24 help balance the first year of the budget, but are not sustained in FY 2024-25.Five-Year General Fund Shortfall: SUMMARY Use of Reserves: The proposed budget utilizes an additional $75.8 million in reserves in order to balance, including $29.5 million from the Business Tax Stabilization Reserve and $41.3 from the Federal and State Emergency Grant Disallowance Reserve. The proposed budget also utilizes and $90.2 million from the City's Fiscal Cliff Reserve, which was originally appropriated in the prior two-year budget and remains unchanged. This leaves a balance of approximately $130.3 million in the Fiscal Cliff Reserve to help the City hedge against future budget shortfalls, in addition to $40 million in the Federal and State Emergency Grant Disallowance to help the City address any FEMA reimbursement recoveries reduction, in addition to the City's rainy day reserves. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE FISCAL YEARS 2023-24 AND 2024-25 BUDGET The Mayor's proposed FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 budget makes investments the following priority areas discussed further below and throughout this book: Public safety; Homelessness; Behavioral health; Economic recovery; Children and families; Community and climate; Good government. Public Safety The Mayor's proposed budget makes a number of investments to meet key public safety priorities, both through traditional public safety departments such as the Police, Fire, Sheriff, and Emergency Management Departments, as well as in continuing and expanding civilianization efforts and alternatives to law enforcement. These investments acknowledge and address the difficulty public safety departments have had in recruitment and retention, while building on the success of existing programs, such as Police Service Aides and citywide Community Safety Ambassadors. The proposed budget prioritizes building back the police force to meet long-term hiring goals, expanding alternatives to policing to free up officers to focus on crime prevention and safety, delivering more tools for addressing open-air drug markets, and improving coordination to get resources to San Franciscans most in need quickly and efficiently. Building Back Our Police Force The Mayor's proposed budget expands investments within the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) to promote recruitment, restore staffing to pre-pandemic 2023-24 FY 2024-25 142.6 158.4 Citywide Operating Savings 133.3 214.3 Use of Special Funds 63.9 66.2 Fund Balance and Project Savings 46.7 126.4 General Fund Revenue 31.7 (17.2) Departmental Revenue (0.9) 3.0 Use of Reserves 6.5 69.2 General Fund Investments Public Safety Investments (48.2) (34.4) Labor Agreements - Public Safety (16.7) (42.7) Community & Nonprofit Support (31.6) (49.0) Economic Recovery Investments (21.2) (2.9) Behavioral Health & Homelessness Investments (15.2) (2.5) Adjusted Surplus/(Shortfall) - - 14 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 15 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 15to free up officers to focus on the crime and safety issues they are trained to confront. Community Police Service Aides (PSAs) are civilian employees of the SFPD who provide a variety of support services to sworn officers and are an integral part of civilianization of the Department, allowing for relationship building within communities and faster response times to non-emergency calls. The proposed budget includes investments of $2.2 million in FY 2023-24 and $3.0 million in FY 2024-25 to support an additional 22 PSA positions and 2 PSA Supervisors to add staffing resources at more district stations. The proposed budget also makes key investments in a variety of ambassador programs in the City Prop F Community Ambassadors. These are formerly-retired SFPD officers who have been specially trained to build relationships with the community. They are assigned to specific neighborhoods and work to develop trust and understanding between the police and the people they serve, and are limited to a part-time status. The SFPD budget includes $2.8 million in FY 2023-24 and $2.9 million in FY 2024-25 to support expansion by an additional 24,000 hours of Ambassador time per fiscal year. In addition to retired Police Officers, the budget continues the recent expansion of Community Safety Ambassadors in other key areas throughout the City, including the Tenderloin and mid-Market area, the Mission, and in and around BART stations with $26.5 million in FY 2023-24 and $16.0 million in FY 2024- 25 in funding. The Mission cohort was first deployed in May 2023 and a full-year of funding for this new program is included in the budget. Improving Coordination Coordination of the City's safety ambassador programs will be led by the Department of Emergency Management (DEM), which recently hired a Street Ambassador Coordinator to improve and coordinate existing programs citywide through strategic planning, and deployment. These include ambassador programs that are operated or contracted by the City, as well levels, and promote public safety, while continuing to focus on reform and the use of non-sworn civilian staff to help carry out department operations. San Francisco has seen an increase in applications for Police Department academies over the last six months, and interest continues to grow. Seeking to capitalize on this momentum, the budget sets dynamic Academy class goals so that the Department is ready to start classes as soon as they fill. Taken together, these classes aim to backfill a total of 220 officers over the next two budget years. Given the challenges the Department is facing with recruitment and retention, the Mayor's proposed budget also includes new funding to support efforts to attract new officers and retain those already employed by the Department. In April 2023, the City agreed to a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) which will adjust both entry-level and continuing salaries for incoming and current officers. The proposed budget fully funds wage increases of 7.75 percent for all sworn staff across FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, as well as retention pay increases of 3 percent when officers reach five, seven, and eight years of service. These wage increases make San Francisco the highest paid starting salary for officers of large Bay Area cities and provide significant retention incentives to prevent the outflow of experienced officers. Furthermore, in the upcoming fiscal year, the Mayor's Office will convene a Police Staffing Accountability Working Group with representatives from SFPD, the Department of Human Resources, and the Controller's Office. This group will work collaboratively over the course of the year to improve and track outcomes in hiring, leave management, and overtime usage within the Police Department. Expanding Alternatives to Policing San Francisco continues to be a leader in moving non-law enforcement work away from police officers to provide more tailored responses, and 16 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY16 EXECUTIVE SUMMARYas those operated by nonprofit organizations, Community Benefits Districts, and Business Improvement Districts. Collectively, these programs employ over 800 public, private, and contracted employees in ambassador roles supporting safety, cleanliness, wellness, and hospitality. These programs are a critical component of San Francisco's street response efforts. Earlier this year, under the Mayor's direction, DEM implemented a Unified Command structure to coordinate multi-departmental responses that are tailored to address challenging neighborhood conditions that can vary by location, from the Castro, to the Tenderloin, South of Mission, to the Mission District. Unified Command will be expanded under DEM's leadership so that city agencies work in concert to ensure that all of the city's Street Response teams, Department of Public Health's (DPH) neighborhood-based street care teams, and other local and state agency resources\u2014including law enforcement\u2014are deployed to get as many people into care as possible. Ensuring Accountability Around Open-Air Drug Markets Key to the Mayor's priorities of delivering a clean and safe city, restoring downtown, and continuing progress on homelessness and mental health, is combating open-air drug markets. These cause harm to those struggling with addiction, and the larger communities. In addition to targeting the markets directly, the Mayor's strategy includes expanded treatment and service options through DPH and other outreach programs. To ensure there is accountability and strict enforcement of these open-air drug markets, the proposed budget funds prosecutors in the District Attorney's Office dedicated to targeting drug trafficking. Staffing Investments in Core Public Safety Services The Mayor's proposed budget also includes resources within the DEM to return to sufficient 911 dispatcher staffing levels in order to meet their service standard. The service standard is to answer 90 percent of 911 calls in 10 seconds or less. Currently, the Department is only able to achieve approximately 75 percent of 911 calls answered in 10 seconds or less and needs at least 40 more fully- trained dispatchers to meet the service standard. The Mayor's proposed budget provides $2.9 million over two years for 911 dispatchers' salary increases due to a recently negotiated MOU, which aims to combat the high level of dispatcher vacancies. To help reach recruitment goals, the proposed budget includes additional human resources staff as well. With these investments, the Department expects academy classes to be filled to capacity in FY 2023-24. Homelessness Mayor Breed's proposed budget makes critical investments in new housing, shelter, and prevention as called for in the recently released citywide strategic plan, \"Home by the Bay: An Equity-Driven Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness in San Francisco.\" The plan calls for new investments and strategies to reduce unsheltered homelessness by half over the next five years. The FY 2023-24 and FY 2024- 25 proposed budget allocates approximately $98.6 million in Our City, Our Home Fund (OCOH) sources to implement the plan's goals and strategies, along with leveraging state grants and reprogramming $21 million of the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing's (HSH) General Fund budget to meet these goals. These shelter and housing resources are supported by a citywide network of crisis response, behavioral health, and homeless outreach teams that make connections with people every day so that they can exit homelessness. Maintaining and Expanding Temporary Shelter and Crisis Interventions The Mayor's proposed budget supports operating approximately 521 beds of non-congregate shelter and other programs established during the COVID-19 pandemic that would otherwise sunset without continued funding. In addition, the budget also increases shelter beds at the City's existing sites and allocates funds to operate new sites. These 16 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 17 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 17investments will increase HSH's shelter capacity by approximately 594 beds to operate a total of 3,656 beds. The budget also invests in improving services and extends shelter hours to accommodate more people, with an ultimate goal of improving outcomes overall. Shelter investment highlights include: Expanding adult shelter capacity to pre-pandemic levels by adding 395 shelter beds at existing sites. $24.6 million over two years to create and operate a new shelter site in the Bayview and operate a 60-cabin project in the Mission District. $2.3 million in FY 2023-24 and $5.5 million in FY 2024-25 to continue operations of 70 cabins. $150,000 in funding for a vehicular assistance program. $820,000 to expand hours and services at family and adult shelters. Expanding New Housing Over the last three years as part of the Mayor's Homelessness Recovery Plan, San Francisco successfully leveraged local, state and federal dollars for the largest expansion of supportive housing in over 20 years. The City has expanded housing options to include a broad range of subsidies, vouchers, and units to meet the diverse needs of people who are exiting homelessness. The Mayor's proposed budget funds 75 new PSH units in FY 2024-25 through OCOH. In addition, the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD), in partnership with HSH, administers the Local Operating Subsidy Program (LOSP), which provides housing units with supportive services for formerly homeless households. Over the next two fiscal years, approximately 258 permanent supportive housing (PSH) units are under construction and are expected to be completed by June 2025. The Mayor's proposed budget also makes a significant investment in housing expansion beyond PSH units funded, including: $14 million over two years for 350 new rapid re- housing slots for adults. $1.5 million ongoing investment for 60 new family shallow rental assistance subsidies. $1.1 million ongoing investment for 60 new adult shallow rental assistance subsidies. Doing More in Homelessness Prevention One of the most effective solutions to homelessness is to keep people stably housed or to rapidly resolve their homelessness. As such, the Mayor's proposed budget will increase the HSH prevention budget by $18.2 million dollars in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024- 25, through the addition of 825 new prevention and problem-solving slots. This significant investment will help reduce the inflow of people entering homelessness. Increasing Capacity and Accountability The budget also funds positions to ensure HSH has the capacity to execute the ambitious five-year strategic plan and implement accountability measures to ensure effective use of this funding. The Mayor's proposed budget adds nine new positions in FY 2023-24, and four additional positions in FY 2024- 25, for a total increase of 13 new positions over two years. This additional staffing will help build the Department's organizational capacity to carry out its existing workload and implement expansions funded in the two-year budget. The new staff will also fill gaps in essential functions across housing, shelter, and program compliance to achieve strategic goals. Leveraging Every Dollar Available Even with all of the progress the City has made, San Francisco continues to face a significant need for more shelter and housing solutions. While the City faces a budget deficit, there are significant resources in the Our City, Our Home (OCOH) Fund that are unspent because of the prescriptive spending plan outlined in the code that governs the fund. On a one- time basis, the Mayor's proposed budget reallocates $60 million in unspent and unprogrammed OCOH funds to support critical investments in preventing and reducing homelessness in San Francisco. The 18 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY18 EXECUTIVE SUMMARYbudget seeks to authorize two years of flexibility to allow unspent and unprogrammed OCOH funds to be transferred across categories. These funds will support expansions in shelter and prevention categories and create flexibility in the fund to support time-limited housing solutions. During this time of tremendous need, these unspent funds must be leveraged to fill in every gap possible and provide the right supports for the most vulnerable San Franciscans. Behavioral Health The proposed budget builds on the Mayor's commitments to expand and improve behavioral health treatment primarily through the continued implementation of Mental Health SF (MHSF), legislation passed in December 2019 that proposed a comprehensive overhaul of San Francisco's mental health system. The proposed budget leverages General Fund, Our City Our Home (OCOH), State grants, and Opioid settlement funding to continue critical behavioral health efforts, including in residential treatment expansion, overdose prevention efforts in targeted communities, coordinating a robust street outreach program, expanding abstinence-based treatment programs, launching CARE Court implementation, and opening wellness hubs. Continued Investments in Behavioral Health Programs In the recent year, the City launched and implemented key initiatives and programs funded with the OCOH allocation that support important mental health and substance use services for people experiencing homelessness. These accomplishments include: adding the seventh Street Crisis Response Team (SCRT) that provides 24/7 coverage of San Francisco and respond to nearly 80 percent of eligible 911 calls for behavioral health cases, launching the second Street Overdose Response Team (SORT), opening over 160 new residential care and treatment beds that brings the total of new beds opened under Mental Health SF to over 350, and adding three TAY and Transgender Mental Health clinicians focused on providing behavioral health services for trans and non-binary TAY experiencing homelessness. Despite revenue shortfalls in gross receipts business tax that impact the OCOH budget, the Mayor's proposed budget includes over $200 million over the two years to continue these key behavioral health initiatives, which includes adding Office of Coordinated Care case managers for justice-involved individuals and expanding follow-up for people exiting involuntary holds, pursuing the opening of 50 additional residential care and treatment beds to approach completion of the 400-bed goal, working to implement the Mental Health Service Center as a one-stop behavioral health clinic, strengthening street- based follow-up care and linkage treatment, expanding overdose prevention services, and launching the behavioral health element of the Permanent Housing Advanced Clinical Services program. Coordinated Street Outreach The Mayor's proposed budget will continue to fund the City's Street Response Teams, coordinated by DEM, as discussed above. The City's multi- department approach to helping people in crisis on its streets coordinates Police, Fire, Public Health, and Homelessness and Supportive Housing. As of April 2023, over 18,000 calls have been diverted from police to street response teams. The Department of Public Health's neighborhood- based street care teams have expanded to five neighborhoods working seven days a week to get people into care. The Street Medicine team, serving nearly 3,000 patients a year, will continue to provide medical and behavioral health care to people experiencing homelessness in streets, parks, and encampments. The City will continue to expand buprenorphine distribution by emergency responders and medical professionals in the community. More than 5,000 San Franciscans get access to buprenorphine or methadone annually. 18 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 19 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 19Addressing the Opioid Crisis The City reached historic settlements with pharmaceutical chains, drug manufacturers, and distributors for their role in fueling the opioid epidemic in San Francisco. Through the work of the City Attorney's Office, San Francisco has secured over $290 million of settlement funding over the course of multiple years. The Mayor's proposed budget includes $100 million of settlement funding over the two years, allowing the City to progress in implementing the Overdose Prevention Plan released in October 2022. This evidence-based, equity- oriented plan aims to reduce fentanyl and other drug-related deaths, increase access to treatment for opioid use disorder (including addiction to fentanyl) and stimulant use disorder, increase social support for and reduce the stigma experienced by people at risk of overdose, and improve the community conditions in which drug use occurs. Settlement funding in the proposed budget includes $18.9 million to open up to three Wellness Hubs over the two budget years to improve the health and well-being of people who use drugs, including those experiencing homelessness, and reduce public drug use. These sites will provide low- to no-barrier: Overdose prevention services and resources; Resources to improve a person's health, including basic needs such as housing, food assistance, and basic medical services; Connections to outpatient and inpatient residential treatment. Any possible inclusion of safe consumption would be funded by private entities. The Mayor's proposed budget also enhances investments in high-risk overdose communities. While the African-American community represents less than 6 percent of the San Francisco population, they represent 28 percent of overdose deaths over the last two years. To address the City's disproportionate overdose deaths among African American people and people experiencing homelessness, the Mayor's proposed budget will fund culturally congruent programs tailored to serve at-risk communities, as well as expanded overdose prevention education, overdose prevention champions, and links to care, including abstinence-based treatment. Additionally, the Mayor's proposed budget invest in expansion of recovery programs, including $2.0 million each year for expanding contingency management, a motivational incentive model for treatment that has shown efficacy against stimulant use disorder. The proposed budget also includes $3.0 million for new investments in sober living programs, medication- assisted treatment programs, especially methadone, and preventing overdose in high-risk housing settings such as single-room occupancy hotels. Additional funding will also expand abstinence-based treatment services, including a women's abstinence-based therapeutic community, which supports those exiting the criminal justice system who have experienced addiction, domestic violence, and family separation and will support additional abstinence-based treatment services. Finally, the Mayor's proposed budget also allocates $36.0 million of settlement funds across the two years to sustain investments in the Behavioral Health Services and the Population Health Division previously supported with by the General Fund. These funds offset some of the sizable investments the City has had to make to address opioid use disorder as the epidemic has grown over the last few years. CARE Court Implementation This fall, the State will begin implementing the new Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Court, connecting clients struggling with untreated health issues with a court-ordered CARE plan for up to 24 months. San Francisco is among the first seven counties in California to implement CARE Courts. This program is designed to bring people into care who are not ready to engage voluntarily but not eligible for programs like conservatorship. CARE Courts allow family members, healthcare providers, or 20 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY20 EXECUTIVE SUMMARYfirst responders to petition for an individual to enter the programs. In these procedures, a CARE Plan is established, and a judge can use court orders with support such as short-term stabilization medications and beds, as well as wellness and recovery offerings. The Mayor's proposed budget includes funding for engagement and assessment staff, new City attorneys dedicated to CARE Court implementation, increased capacity for treatment and housing, and outreach and educational efforts. Improvements at Laguna Honda Hospital Beyond behavioral health, this budget makes investments in DPH's budget for Laguna Honda Hospital, which is actively working towards gaining recertification with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). DPH is currently implementing the action plan submitted to CMS, and it represents a significant facility-wide effort and includes hundreds of process improvements. The Mayor's proposed budget includes over $3.5 million of new annual investment to support the implementation of the action plan and sustain the improvements, including staffing in key areas, including education and training, patient care experience, medication management, and leadership within the San Francisco Health Network. Economic Recovery The Mayor's proposed FY 2023-24 and FY 2024- 25 budget invests $24.4 million over the two years in support of the Roadmap for Downtown San Francisco's Future, and broadly supports economic recovery across the entire City. While critical components around recovery include investments in public safety and street conditions, there are also targeted improvements and programs to support a thriving economy, both downtown and throughout the City's neighborhood commercial corridors. Providing Tax Relief and Incentives To keep existing businesses stable and to recruit new businesses, the Mayor's budget includes key changes to the City's business taxes. In November 2020, San Francisco voters passed Proposition F, which phased out the payroll expense tax, while gradually increasing gross receipts tax for businesses across most industries. The proposition also delayed gross receipts tax increases until 2023 and 2024 for industries hit hardest by the pandemic. In March 2023, the Mayor introduced legislation to further delay tax increases for maintenance and laundry businesses, retail trade, food services, manufacturing, accommodations, arts, entertainment, and recreation until 2025 and 2026. The proposed budget includes revenue assumptions aligned with these tax changes. The City must also attract new businesses to fill its office vacancies, support customer-serving businesses, and bolster future revenue through gross receipts tax, property tax, and contributions to other revenue sources. The Mayor's legislation will offer a discount for up to three years on the office-based gross receipts tax for new offices locating in San Francisco in the information, administrative and support services, financial services, insurance, professional scientific and technical services industries. Finally, the budget proposes a change to the Commercial Rent Tax, which was passed by voters in June 2018. The change seeks to pause the collection revenues on sub-leases of commercial spaces through 2029 to ensure commercial properties are only subject to a single commercial rent tax, rather than also being taxed for sub-leasing the space. Profits on subleases will continue to be collected. Supporting Small Businesses The Mayor's proposed budget continues the small business grant program, providing $5 million in direct grants to help small businesses across the city to stabilize, scale, and adapt business models to changed conditions. The program will target businesses in commercial corridors that have experienced the highest drop in sales tax to fill vacancies, or expand into new storefronts, while providing business assistance to improve operations and renegotiate leases . 20 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 21 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 21The proposed budget also continues the First-Year Free program. This citywide initiative promotes economic recovery for small businesses by waiving first-year permits, initial licenses, and initial business registration fees. Over 2,400 brand new businesses have participated in the program since its launch in November 2021. Restoring Vibrancy Downtown and Across Neighborhoods The Mayor's proposed budget includes $12 million of funding for programs to restore vibrancy and fill empty storefronts Downtown, and ensure stability of the City's neighborhood commercial corridors. This includes the new Vacant to Vibrant program, which matches pop-up activations with property owners with vacant ground floor spaces and larger public space activations. To bring life to one of the City's most active tourist areas, the budget funds streetscape improvements and support for new tenants on Powell Street near the Cable Car Turnaround. The budget also includes $1 million dedicated to commercial corridor improvements in the Mission, one of San Francisco's neighborhoods that has been especially hard hit since the pandemic. The Mission District, and neighborhoods citywide, will also benefit from continued funding for the Department of Public Works' street vending permit program. Along with ensuring continued access to BART stations and Muni stops, the program discourages the sale of stolen goods through enforcement by Public Works' street inspectors. Investing in Clean and Welcoming Streets The Mayor's proposed budget includes $8.2 million over the two years to continue funding for Welcome Ambassadors stationed in key transit and tourist nodes such as Downtown BART stations, Union Square, Moscone Convention Center, and along the Embarcadero. These Downtown-focused Ambassadors provide a consistent and visible presence as well as proactive positive engagement and friendly assistance in wayfinding, making referrals and recommendations, and coordinating with other City departments and community- based efforts to support positive street conditions and experiences by business owners, employees, residents, and visitors, alike. The proposed budget also includes increased funding for Public Works to enhance street cleaning operations across the City. This includes continued or expanded deployment of Public Works cleaning crews and contractors who power wash sidewalks, remove litter, and sweep gutters. The Department will also continue providing courtesy graffiti removal for storefronts and other private property in the City's diverse neighborhood commercial corridors. Children & Families The Mayor's proposed FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 budget prioritizes children, youth, and families through a series of investments centered around wellness, access to childcare, and overall family supports. Afterschool and Summer Programs The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) provides approximately $41M in funding for school year and summer programs, which include programs focused on learning, enrichment, skill-building, and leadership strategies. DCYF's Comprehensive Year-Round and Summer Learning programs (around $35 million annually) are designed to ensure continuous support and programming for children and youth outside of school hours throughout the school year and summer. Last summer, the Summer Together Initiative served over 30,000 youth. The FY 2023-24 budget includes grant and City funding to continue reaching 30,000 youth in the summer of 2023. Student Success Fund In 2022, San Francisco voters approved Proposition G that established the Student Success Fund, which provide grants to the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) and schools to implement programs that improve academic achievement and social/ emotional wellness of students. The Mayor's proposed budget includes $11.0 million in FY 2023-24 and 22 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY$35.0 million in FY 2024-25 for the Fund. DCYF is working closely with SFUSD to release a request for funding proposal in 2023, seeking to make grant funds available for the 2024-25 school year. The first year will be focused on providing funding support for crisis and emergency needs at school sites, critical non-core staffing, school readiness and preparation for grant application, and the workforce pipeline to address workforce shortages in after school, paraprofessional, school social worker, and school district nurse staffing. Early Childhood The Mayor's proposed budget includes funding for early childhood and education, ensuring sustained distribution of childcare vouchers to low-income families, continued funding for the landmark compensation initiative for early educators, pipeline programs to support recruitment and retention of early educators, and childcare facilities construction and improvements. In April 2022, the Mayor and the Office of Early Care and Education (OECE), now the Department of Early Childhood (DEC), announced a new initiative to invest up to $71 million annually to advance pay raises, increase benefits, and improve working conditions and support educational attainment for San Francisco's workforce of over 2,000 City- funded early educators. The Mayor's proposed budget continues the ongoing funding for these early educator raises and earmarks another $60 million to ensure these funds are available as the economic outlook fluctuates, ensuring educators are paid more fairly for their crucial work, and to help attract new, quality educators to the field. This program is funded by the Commercial Rent Tax that was passed by voters in June 2018 and funds are dedicated to serving early childcare programs in San Francisco. The Mayor's budget proposal also includes funding in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 to for early learning scholarship childcare vouchers. Families that make up to 110 percent of the Area Median Income are eligible for this program, which provides children from birth to 5 years old with financial assistance to ensure the youngest San Franciscans have access to quality early care and education. Food Security In response to the pandemic and financial crisis that ensued for many individuals, the Human Services Agency (HSA) established the City's COVID-19 food support program, now referred to as the Food Access Program. This program successfully reaches tens of thousands of families. Despite the City's transition from the pandemic, the high cost of living and increased food costs persists. The Mayor's proposed budget continues the City's investments in food pantries, grocery vouchers, and meals and markets, targeting community-based organizations that meet unique population needs. The budget allocates $20 million in FY 2023-24 and $10 million in FY 2024- 25 to support these integral programs in HSA. An additional $5 million in new funding each year for food access programs will be made available through a partnership between the Department of Public Health and the Dream Keeper Initiative. In addition to community funding, HSA will continue to combat food insecurity by connecting people to other longer-term assistance such as CalFresh, WIC, Medi- Cal, CalWORKs and IHSS, and coordinating with other departments on food security interventions. Community & Climate Despite the deficit, the Mayor's proposed budget adds additional funding to support its non-profit partners and sustains funding for major initiatives including Dream Keeper and the Climate Action Plan. Supporting Nonprofit Partners The Mayor's proposed budget recognizes the central role that nonprofit providers play in administering City services. The proposed budget makes a significant investment in helping organizations address inflationary pressures, providing 3 percent cost-of- doing-business increase for next fiscal year, an ongoing cost of approximately $27 million per year. In addition, EXECUTIVE SUMMAR Y 23 22 EXECUTIVE SUMMARYthe proposed budget makes an additional 1 percent investment, an ongoing cost of $5.5 million per year, for contracts that provide services related to health and homelessness, which have some of the highest rates of staff vacancies according to a recent Controller's Office survey. Additionally, the proposed budget goes one step further by targeting the wages of lowest paid workers that help provide City services through updates to the Minimum Compensation Ordinance (MCO). The budget includes $3.3 million in FY 2023- 24 to bring wages to $18.93 per hour, providing pay equity and promoting retention of trained staff. In FY 2024-25, the budget invests an additional $4.3 million to bring wages up to $20.25 per hour. The proposed changes to the MCO will ultimately increases wages to $23 per hour by FY 2025-26. These new investments are aimed at promoting retention of staff, and ultimately contributing to improved service delivery. Continuing Investment in the Dream Keeper Initiative In June of 2020, the Mayor and Board of Supervisors announced the City's $60 million ongoing annual investment into San Francisco's Black communities. An impact evaluation of the last two years has found that the Dream Keeper Initiative (DKI) is beginning to deliver on its mission of remedying historical exclusion and divestment. Programs include technical and financial assistance for small or emerging Black businesses, which have already reached over 150 different businesses and 400 individuals. The Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development supports two programs through DKI - the Dream Keeper Down Payment Assistance Loan Program (DALP) that offers up to $500,000 to help cover the cost of a mortgage down payment, and the Senior Home Repair Program (SHRP) that helps low-to-moderate-income older adults in historically underserved communities with property rehabilitation. The Department of Public Health's DKI funding has supported hundreds of families with services that address physical and mental health needs. DKI grants in DCYF continue to support youth through educational investments in tutoring, homework assistance, and career planning. The Mayor's proposed budget will preserve these investments and continue to build on the progress in the coming two years. Advancing the Climate Action Plan The Climate Action Plan, released in 2021 with contributions from the Mayor's Office, Mayor Breed's Zero Emission Building Task Force, the Department of the Environment, and other City partners, details a data-driven, community-informed, and people- focused plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, while building a more just and equitable future. The Mayor's proposed budget invests $2 million over the two years to support staff at the Department of Environment (ENV) to continue their work advancing the Climate Action Plan, enabling the Department to secure Federal and State funding to further accelerate progress toward these goals. Good Government Finally, the Mayor's proposed budget includes funding for building on citywide reforms to hiring, contracting, and other core operations. It also funds ongoing and new IT projects and makes investments in capital maintenance and critical repairs, though at lower levels than planned. Hiring and Contracting Reform The Mayor's proposed budget continues its investment in staffing resources for the Government Operations Recovery initiative, a citywide effort focused on improvements to hiring, contracting, and other City processes that support the efficient and timely delivery of City services. In the upcoming year, cross-departmental teams in contracting, hiring, and financial management will build on new initiatives launched this past year. In contracting, projects include centralized contract review processes and the creation of a one-stop shop that consolidates procurement plans from Chapter 6 departments. In 24 EXECUTIVE SUMMARYhiring, projects include the creation of online, on- demand assessments and automated scoring for certain recruitments. Investing in Capital and Information Technology Given the uncertain economic future, as the City recovers from the impact of COVID-19, the proposed capital budget remains at a reduced level compared to the City's 10-year Capital Plan, and significantly lower than before the pandemic. The proposed General Fund support for the Pay-As- You-Go Program is $118 million over two years, supported by an additional $58.4 million in debt- funded capital for street resurfacing and other critical renewal needs. The Mayor's proposed budget primarily funds urgent repairs, including roofs, HVAC systems, elevators, potholes, as well as, crucial projects across the park system, and ADA needs. The City continues to invest in vital technology projects through the Committee of Information Technology (COIT) allocation. The proposed COIT budget is $53.9 million over the next two fiscal years, $26.8 million lower than the City's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plan from the Five-Year Report. Given the fiscal outlook, the City is focused on IT projects that are crucial for the City's technology operations and advancement. Major projects funded include the replacement of two critical City systems - the Computer Aided Dispatch system, and the Property Tax System. The budget continues funding for the Sheriff's Jail Management System, JUSTIS Data Center of Excellence, Infrastructure Modernization, and digital accessibility. New projects include replacement of the legacy Legislative Management System and a new platform to help manage the implementation of the new Empty Homes Tax passed by voters recently. Balancing a $780 million Deficit These investments are made possible by making reductions across City spending and leveraging all available funding sources beyond the General Fund. City departments and the Mayor's Office made reductions to General Fund budgets by eliminating balances in non-critical or completed projects, reducing contracts, cutting salary budgets to account for vacancies, and shifting existing program spending to special funds with dedicated revenue sources, including the Children's Fund, Hotel Tax for Fund, Our City Our Home Fund and Early Care and Education Fund. It also budgets new funding secured through historic settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors to pay for both existing and new overdose prevention, treatment, and outreach programs. The proposed budget sets savings targets in FY 2024- 25 by reducing the budget for real estate expenses, software and technology licenses, and materials and supplies. By reducing budgets in the second year, the Mayor's Office plans to work with City departments in the year ahead to continue identifying areas for greater efficiencies. The budget also includes savings in the City's debt portfolio, including through re- financing, and maximizes interest earnings. Finally, it makes lower-than-planned investments in citywide equipment, IT, and particularly, in capital spending. The City's Ten-Year Capital Plan proposed investing an additional $30 million each year in cash-funded capital maintenance and improvement projects. This budget leaves General Fund capital funding mostly flat, at around $59 million each year. Finally, the proposed budget includes a use of reserves to help balance, but maintains the bulk of the City's reserves to hedge against continued economic uncertainty. Even with these reductions and use of reserves, the City's projected structural deficit remains significant, at over $500 million in FY 2025- 26 and greater after that. Future budgets will need to continue making reductions or identify new revenue sources to address these deficits. Ultimately, the proposed budget sustains funding for the key City services and critical programs that support children and families, while making targeted investments in public safety, homelessness and mental health, and economic revitalization. 24 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 25HOW TO USE THIS BOOK The Mayor's proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 and 2024-25 budget for the City and County of San Francisco (the City) contains citywide budgetary and fiscal policy information as well as detailed departmental budgets for General Fund and Enterprise Departments.

It is the only consolidated city and county in the State, exercising the governmental powers of both a city and a county under California law. The City's governance structure, codified in the City Charter of 1996, is similar in form to the federal government. The Mayor's Office comprises the Executive branch, while the Board of Supervisors and Superior Court act as the Legislative and Judicial branches, respectively. The Mayor and all 11 members of the Board of Supervisors serve four-year terms. In November 2022 San Francisco voters passed Proposition H, shifting Mayoral elections to even-numbered years starting with the next Mayoral election, which will be held in November 2024. Board of Supervisors elections are held in even-numbered years and are staggered, with five or six seats being open each election. Any vacancies on the Board of Supervisors are filled by Mayoral appointment. Both the Mayor and members of the Board of Supervisors are limited to two terms. Each of the City's 11 districts is represented by a member of the Board of Supervisors. Beginning in November 2000, the Board of Supervisors was elected by district for the first time since the 1970s. The Mayor appoints the heads of most city departments. Many departments are also advised by commissions or boards whose members are citizens appointed by the Mayor or, in some cases, by a combination of the Mayor, the Board of Supervisors, and other elected officials. Other elected officials include the Assessor-Recorder, City Attorney, District Attorney, Public Defender, Sheriff, Superior Court Judges, and Treasurer.CITY GOVERNANCE AND STRUCTURESAN FRANCISCO: BoardController Airport CommissionAcademy of SciencesAsian Art Commission Fire CommissionFine Arts MuseumsHomelessness and Supportive HousingHealth Commission Human Rights CommissionJuvenile Probation CommissionHuman Services CommissionLibrary Commission Municipal Transportation AgencyRent Stabilization BoardRecreation & Parks CommissionRetirement System Board Commission on the Status of Women War Memorial Board of Trustees Office of Community Investment and InfrastructureChildren, Youth & Their FamiliesGSA City AdministratorCivil Service Commission Convention Facilities ManagementAnimal Care & ControlMedical ExaminerCounty Clerk Purchaser/Contract Administration Public & Families CommissionPolice CommissionE E E EE E A A = Appointed E = Elected S = Shared Appointment by Various Elected OfficialsE E E A S S SS S A S SHuman Resources Law Library Board of Trustees Police AccountabilityPort Commission Sheriff AccountabilityEarly ChildhoodEmergency Communications Public Utilities CommissionSAN FRANCISCO: AN OVERVIEW 33 ELECTED OFFICIALS Mayor London N.

International immigration has long been a major contributor to San Francisco's cultural diversity. About 36 percent of the City's population over the age of five was born outside of the United States, and about 43 percent speak a language other than English at home. Immigration and its legacy contribute to a sense of diversity in San Francisco and positions the City's future labor force for success in the global economy. According to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2017-2021, 39.2 percent of the San Francisco population identifies as white, 34.1 percent identifies as Asian, 15.4 percent identifies as Hispanic or Latino, 5.3 percent identifies as Black or African American, 4.9 percent identifies with two or more races, 0.3 percent identifies as Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, and 0.2 percent identifies as American Indian and Alaska Native. Incorporated on April 15th, 1850, San Francisco is the fourth largest city in the State of California and geographically the smallest county. Occupying just 49 square miles of land, the city is located on a peninsula bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west, San Francisco Bay to the east, the entrance to the Bay and the Golden Gate to the north, and San Mateo County to the south. While the government has played a key role in San Francisco's development, the true wealth of the City resides in the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of its pioneering citizens. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, San Francisco's population was 808,437 on July 1, 2022. From July 2021 to July 2022, the City's population decreased by 2,816 people, a 0.3 percent decline. The decline in 2021 was much more significant, 59,140 (or 6.8 percent). Comparatively, in 2022, Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties lost 90,704 and 15,650 people, respectively.

While post-pandemic changes in work and retail create new challenges for the City's economic future, the long-term fundamentals of the City's economy remain strong. The strength of San Francisco's economy comes from a diverse portfolio of well-established industries and businesses, as well as emerging and growing sectors. In addition to being an economic center for advanced, knowledge-based services such as professional and financial services, information technology and digital media, and healthcare, San Francisco is pushing to develop new and innovative fields in civic-based and green technologies to help grow its manufacturing sector. According to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), in 2019, there were over 760,000 jobs in San Francisco\u2014the most at any point in the City's history. However, in 2020, due to COVID-19 related slowdown, the City's employment fell by 9.9 percent to about 685,000 people. Leisure and hospitality - including restaurants, hotels, arts, and recreation service industries fared the worst. Since then the City began to experience an economic recovery in early 2021, and according to the latest QCEW figures, the City's employment stood around 786,000 in September 2022 (an 81,000 jobs or 8.9 percent gain from 2020 level). This means that the city gained back all the jobs lost during the shutdown period in 2020. Similarly, the San Francisco Metropolitan Division, which includes San Mateo County, lost about 183,000 jobs from February to April 2020 but has since more than fully recovered (gained about 185,000 jobs) by March 2023. Before the pandemic, San Francisco led economic growth in the Bay Area and California, and had been at full employment for over three years. Although San Francisco represents only 2.1 percent of the State's population, it accounted for 9.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product growth in California from 2012 to 2021. During the same period, the City created 1 in 4.5 new jobs in the nine-county Bay Area. Nonetheless, San Francisco must contend with major structural changes adopted during the pandemic that persist, namely, the high level of remote work. This has significant economic implications for San Francisco. Office attendance in large metropolitan areas is only 45% - 65% of pre-pandemic levels. The San Francisco area is LOCAL ECONOMY NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS PERMITTED. 3 Month Moving Average, San Francisco, through March, 2023.Month and YearNumber of Permits 050100150200250300350 Mar-23Feb-23Jan-23Dec-22Nov-22Oct-22Sep-22Aug-22Jul-22Jun-22May-22Apr-22Mar-22Feb-22Jan-22Dec-21Nov-21Oct-21Sep-21Aug-21Jul-21Jun-21May-21Apr-21Mar-21Feb-21Jan-21Dec-20Nov-20Oct-20Sep-20Aug-20Jul-20Jun-20May-20Apr-20Mar-20Feb-20Jan-20Number of Pre-Pandemic Average, 2019SAN FRANCISCO: AN OVERVIEW 37trailing most other metro areas in office attendance, and office industries produce approximately three- quarters of the City's Gross Domestic Product. Remote work is one of the major reasons why San Francisco's economy has been slower to recover than other cities. Meanwhile, the City's housing market remains under pressure due to the higher interest rate environment and other factors. The City residential building permit activity dropped by 37.4 percent in 2020, mainly due to COVID-19 related shutdown. The City issued 2,004 permits in 2020, whereas in 2019, 3,200 permits were issued. The situation improved in 2021 when the city issued 2,519 (a 25.7 percent increase), but in 2022 the City issued only 2,044 permits (an 18.7 percent decline). The City's residential building permit applications showed unusual strength at the end of 2022. Building permits are a volatile indicator, as 1,019 units were permitted from November to December last year. However, more recently, through March 2023, there has been a sharp drop off in housing permit activity, with only 22 units permitted from January to March. High interest rates are not just affecting building permit activity - they're also hampering real estate transactions, which have an impact on the City's property tax revenues. In 2023 and beyond, the key macroeconomic question is how inflation responds to rising interest rates. If the Fed is required to maintain unusually high interest rates for an extended period of time to curb inflation, that will continue to curtail the investment that drove San Francisco's property values for the past decade. Structural changes to the City's economy that were brought about by the pandemic combined with macro-economic forces, including interest rates and inflation, will determine the outlook for the City's budget in the next several years. Nonetheless, San Francisco's long-term economic fundamentals\u2014the quality of its workforce, business environment, technological base, and general quality of life\u2014remain among the strongest of any city in the United States.

This helps to evaluate the effectiveness of services provided by the City and County of San Francisco. Each department collects data on a series of performance measures connected with their strategic plan. Departments report on their results in the prior year, in addition to their projected performance this year and performance targets for the next two fiscal years. Performance data for every City department is available in the Department Budget section of the Budget Book. This section features a selection of measures related to some of the Mayor's priorities: public safety, housing, homelessness, and transportation. The charts below include monthly and annual data showing how the City has performed in these key service areas in recent years. SAN FRANCISCO PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT Public Safety Crime The San Francisco Police Department (POL) reports the number of violent crimes and property crimes to the FBI under the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. Thefts from vehicles is a subset of Part I Property crimes. All three categories experienced a drop in reports halfway through FY 2019-20, reflecting the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated response, but began trending up shortly thereafter through the end of FY 2021- 22. Since the beginning of FY 2022-23, all three categories are experiencing a positive downward trend. The performance measure program mandates annual targets, and POL sets targets for Property Crime and Violent Offenses based on expected outcomes given historical trends. For this report, those annual targets are divided into monthly values indicated by the dotted lines. An annual target is not set for UCR: Number of Thefts from Vehicles (UCR Part I Property Crimes, Larceny-Theft). Fiscal YearNumber Number of Part I property UCR I property oenses reportedNumber of from Vehicles (UCR Part I Property I violent UCR I property oenses reportedNumber of from Vehicles (UCR Part I Property I violent Response Times The San Francisco Police Department measures the Median Response Time of Priority A, B, and C Calls from the time that the call is entered into the dispatch system by the Department of Emergency Management (DEM) to the time that a POL officer is on scene. POL works with DEM to respond to 911 calls that are received to facilitate dispatch of officers on the scene. This response time measure accounts for the time POL may have knowledge of a call to the time a POL unit arrives in response, and differs from other police response time measures which include DEM call response and entry time. Response time decreased from FY 2017-18 to FY 2020-21 for each of the three priority categories. From FY 2020-21 forward, response time steadily increased for Priority B and C categories, going over their annual targets. Priority A response time remains under the 8-minute target. Street Crisis Response The Street Crisis Response Team (SCRT) provides rapid, trauma-informed response to people experiencing crisis in San Francisco with the aim to reduce law enforcement encounters and unnecessary emergency room use. SCRT launched in November 2020 and there are currently seven teams that provide citywide coverage 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Teams are staffed through the Department of Public Health and the Fire Department. In the first half of FY 2022-23, SCRT responded to between 500 and 800 crisis calls each month.

The Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development is responsible for working with private developers to ensure their below market rate units are meeting the BMR unit requirements. The number of new BMR rental units peaked in FY 2019-20 while the number of new BMR ownership units peaked in FY 2020-21. The number of new units constructed varies year-to-year because the construction of below market rate housing is subject to the same market forces as market-rate housing. Economic conditions at the time a market-rate project containing BMR units submits its land use entitlement applications or moves toward construction are inconsistent year- to-year. Similarly, BMR unit targets are subject to change based on the number of projects that have been approved by the Planning Department. 0100200300400500 FY22 FY21 OF NEW BMR RENTAL UNITS, BY FISCAL YEAR.

San Francisco's count of unsheltered and sheltered individuals experiencing homelessness decreased by 3.5 percent between 2019 and 2022. The number of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness dropped by 15 percent in the same time frame. Direct Exits from Homelessness The Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing operates programs to help households exit homelessness to housing. This measure of direct exits counts the number of households (both individuals and families) who exit homelessness each year through participation in these City programs. Permanent supportive housing offers long-term affordable housing with a range of supportive services, including case management and housing retention assistance. Rapid re-housing is a time- limited subsidy for tenants to live in private-market units and access supportive services. Housing problem solving includes relocation assistance, financial assistance, and other interventions to divert or rapidly exit people from homelessness. For FY 2017-18 through FY 2019-20, housing problem solving included only the Homeward Bound program, which provided relocation assistance. For FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22, housing problem solving exits include all types of assistance.

Transportation Muni Ridership Muni ridership is measured by the number of passengers boarding Muni vehicles during weekdays. Muni ridership dropped significantly in FY 2019- 20 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and has since partially rebounded to levels that remain below those in FY 2018-19. The SFMTA has set their target ridership for FY 2022-23 at 422,000, to reflect reduced ongoing demand for transit after the pandemic. Ridership has remained around that target during the first half of FY 2022-23. Percent of Scheduled Service Hours Delivered The percentage of scheduled service hours delivered is one measurement of reliability of Muni services. The target of 98.5 percent is set in the City Charter. The percent of scheduled service hours delivered dropped to around 30 percent in April 2020 after the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order, though rebounded to about 99 percent in September 2020 as the schedule was adjusted to reflect operating conditions. Since the beginning of FY 2022-23, the percent of scheduled service hours delivered has been close to the FY19 FY20 FY21 FY2320%40%60%80%100% BY MONTH.44 SAN FRANCISCO: AN OVERVIEW44 SAN FRANCISCO: AN OVERVIEW BUDGET PROCESS 4546 BUDGET PROCESS46 BUDGET PROCESS BUDGET PROCESS 47The Constitution of the State of California requires all cities to adopt a balanced budget wherein revenues match expenditures. To ensure that San Francisco can meet its immediate needs while planning for long-term growth, the City has adopted a process that develops annual budgets alongside multi-year financial plans. This process assumed its current form with the passage of Proposition A on November 3, 2009, which replaced annual budgeting with two-year budgeting, and required additional long-term financial planning. The sections below provide an understanding of the processes that guide San Francisco's multi-year and annual financial plans. Multi-Year Financial Planning Process The City operates on a two-year budget, which is guided by two fundamental components. The first consists of the City's revenue and expenditure projections, which are developed via four analytical assessments. The second consists of the City's financial and reserve policies, which assume unexpected fiscal pressures that may not be accounted for in the revenue and expenditure projections. In addition, the City's long-term information technology and capital needs are assessed through citywide processes. The components and processes that guide San Francisco's multi-year plans are described in more detail below. Two-Year Budget Cycle On November 3, 2009, voters approved Proposition A, amending the City Charter to stabilize spending by requiring two-year budgeting for all city departments and multi-year financial planning. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2010-11, the City adopted two- year budgets for the following four departments: Airport, Port, Public Utilities Commission, and Municipal Transportation Agency. These four enterprise departments are on a fixed two year budget cycle and any changes to their budget in FY 2023- 24 would require approval from the Board through the supplemental process. The rest of the City's departments will submit rolling two-year budgets over the same period. Two-year budgeting has been in effect for all departments since FY 2012-13. Long-Term Operating Revenue and Expenditure Projections The City's budget process is guided by operating revenue and expenditure projections. The Controller's Office, Mayor's Office, and the Board of Supervisors are responsible for the City's long-term financial planning. These three offices cooperate to produce four reports, including a Five-Year Financial Plan each odd calendar year, the Joint Report each even calendar year, and the Six- and Nine-Month Reports each February and May. Together, these reports provide the basis for developing the City's budget. The reports are described below and can be accessed online at sfcontroller.org . The Controller's Six-Month Budget Status Report, published annually in early February, projects the year-end status of the City's General Fund and key special revenue and enterprise funds based on financial activity from July through December. Issues identified within this report can then be incorporated into mid-year budgetary adjustments as necessary. The Four-Year Budget Projection (\"Joint Report\"), published each even calendar year, reports on projected citywide revenues and expenditures for the following four fiscal years. First required by voters in 1994, this analysis captures significant one-time budgetary items in addition to forecasting revenue and expenditure trends into the future. Beginning in FY 2011-12, the Joint Report was extended to forecast four years into the future (prior to FY 2011- 12, the report projected three years into the future.) This change was required by Proposition A, which also LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS48 BUDGET PROCESSrequired adoption of a biennial Five- Year Financial Plan. The Joint Report now serves as an \"off-year\" update to the Five-Year Financial Plan and projects out the remaining four years of the prior year's plan. The Joint Report was last published on March 31, 2022, as an update to the City's Five-Year Financial Plan for FY 2022-23 through FY 2025-26. The Five-Year Financial Plan, published first in December of each odd calendar year and then updated in March, forecasts expenditures and revenues over a five-year period, proposes actions to balance revenues and expenditures during each year of the plan, and discusses strategic goals and corresponding resources for city departments. On January 13, 2023, the Mayor proposed the City's seventh Five-Year Financial Plan for Fiscal Years 2023-24 through 2027-28, which was updated on March 31, 20231 and heard by the Board of Supervisors on April 12, 2023. The Controller's Nine-Month Budget Status Report, published annually in early May, reports financial activity from July through March and includes the projected year-end status of the City's General Fund and key special revenue and enterprise funds. A comprehensive review of revenue and spending to date and discussions with financial officers at major city departments drive the report's year-end projections. Taken as a whole, these reports are used by the Mayor's Office to prepare a balanced budget to propose to the Board of Supervisors each year and to plan for long-term financial needs. The reports provide information on the financial resources available to fund the City's programs and projections of future costs. Capital and Information Technology Projections As noted above, the City also engages in long-term planning for the City's infrastructure and information technology (IT) needs. Managed by the City Administrator, the City has completed comprehensive assessments of the City's near- and long-term capital and IT needs through the creation of the Ten-Year Capital Plan and the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Plan, each of which is issued biennially in odd calendar years in conjunction with the City's Five-Year Financial Plan. The Capital Plan is prepared under the guidance of the Capital Planning Committee (CPC), while the Committee on Information Technology (COIT) oversees the ICT Plan. Both committees work to identify, assess, and prioritize needs for the City as they relate to capital and IT investments. They also present departments with the opportunity to share information about the impact to operating costs that projects generate. Funding for capital and technology is appropriated through the City's budget process. While the creation of the Capital and ICT Plans does not change their basic funding mechanisms, the priorities in the capital and IT budgets do reflect the policies and objectives identified in each respective plan. Further information about capital and IT planning and expenditures can be found in the Capital Planning and Information Technology sections of this book. Financial Policies and Enhanced Reserves The City's budget is further guided by financial policies that plan for unforeseen financial circumstances that cannot be factored into revenue and expenditure projections. Proposition A charges the Controller's Office with proposing to the Mayor and Board of Supervisors financial policies addressing reserves, use of volatile revenues, debt, and financial measures in the case of disaster recovery, and requires the City to adopt budgets consistent with these policies once approved. In May 2010, legislation was adopted to codify the City's practice of maintaining an annual General Reserve for fiscal pressures not anticipated in the budget and to help the City mitigate the impact of BUDGET PROCESS 49multi-year downturns. This included augmentation of the existing Rainy Day Reserve and the creation of a new Budget Stabilization Reserve funded by excess receipts from volatile revenue streams. Finally, independent auditors who certify the City's annual financial statements and credit ratings from the national bond rating agencies provide additional external oversight of the City's financial matters. Mission-driven budgeting, as described by the City Charter, requires department budget requests to include goals, programs, targeted clients, and strategic plans. The requested budget must tie program funding proposals directly to specific goals. In addition, legislation passed by the Board of Supervisors requires performance standards to increase accountability. The City and County of San Francisco operates under a budget that balances all operating expenditures with available revenue sources and prior-year fund balance. Governmental financial information statements are reported using the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized when they are measurable and available, and are considered available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. Expenditures are generally recorded when a liability is incurred as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures and expenditures related to vacation, sick leave, and claims and judgments are recorded only when payment is due. ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS The City adopts annual budgets for all government funds on a substantially modified accrual basis of accounting, except for capital project funds and certain debt service funds that generally adopt project-length budgets. The budget of the City is a detailed operating plan that identifies estimated costs and results in relation to estimated revenues. The budget includes: the programs, projects, services, and activities to be provided during the fiscal year; the estimated resources (inflows) available for appropriation; and the estimated changes to appropriations. The budget represents a process through which policy decisions are deliberated, implemented, and controlled. The City Charter prohibits expending funds for which there is no legal appropriation. Two-Year Budget Cycle As described in the previous section, in November 2009, voters passed Proposition A, which amended the City Charter to require the City to transition to a two-year budget cycle for all departments by FY 2012-13. In FY 2010-11, the City adopted two- year budgets covering FY 2010-11 and FY 2011-12 for four early implementation departments: the Airport, Municipal Transportation Agency, Public Utilities Commission, and Port Commission. FY 2012-13 was the first year that all city departments submitted a two-year budget for FY 2012-13 and 2013-14. Also for the first time that year, the four early-implementation departments had a \"fixed\" two-year budget. This means that in the second year, these departments could only amend their budget if proposed revenues or expenditures were 5.0 percent above or below projections. All other departments retained a variable two-year budget and thus are open to changes and must be rebalanced as part of the next two-year budget. Moving to a fixed two- year budget for all departments would require the passage of legislation by the Board of Supervisors. The two-year budget is developed, approved, and implemented pursuant to the process described below.50 BUDGET PROCESSKey Participants Residents provide direction for and commentary on budget priorities throughout the annual budget process. Input from residents through virtual feedback forms, stakeholder working groups convened by the Mayor's Office, public budget hearings, and communication with elected officials are all carefully considered in formulating the Mayor's proposed budget. City departments prioritize needs and present balanced budgets for review and analysis by the Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance. The multi-year budget projections described in the previous section as well as the Capital Planning Committee (CPC) and Committee on Information Technology (COIT) provide guidance to the Mayor's Office on both long-term fiscal trends as well as citywide priorities for capital and IT investments. The Mayor, with the assistance of the Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance, prepares and submits a balanced budget to the Board of Supervisors on an annual basis. The Board of Supervisors is the City's legislative body and is responsible for amending and approving the Mayor's proposed budget. The Board's Budget and Legislative Analyst also participates in reviews of city spending and financial projections and makes recommendations to the Board on budget modifications. The Controller is the City's Chief Financial Officer and is responsible for projecting available revenue to fund city operations and investments in both the near- and long-term. In addition, the City Services Auditor Division of the Controller's Office is responsible for working with departments to develop, improve, and evaluate their performance standards. Calendar and Process Beginning in September and concluding in July, the annual budget cycle can be divided into three major stages (see calendar at the end of this section): Budget Preparation: budget development and submission to the Board of Supervisors. Approval: budget review and enactment by the Board of Supervisors and budget signing by the Mayor . Implementation: department execution and budget adjustments. Budget Preparation Preliminary projections of Enterprise and General Fund revenues for the next fiscal year by the Controller's Office and Mayor's Office staff begin in September. Around this time, many departments begin budget planning to allow adequate input from oversight commissions and the public. In December, budget instructions are issued by the Mayor's Office and the Controller's Office with detailed guidance on the preparation of department budget requests. The instructions contain a financial outlook, policy goals, and guidelines as well as technical instructions. Three categories of budgets are prepared: General Fund department budgets: General Fund departments rely in whole or in part on discretionary revenue comprised primarily of local taxes such as property, sales, payroll, and other taxes. The Mayor introduces the proposed General Fund budget to the Board of Supervisors on June 1. Enterprise department budgets: Enterprise departments generate non-discretionary revenue primarily from charges for services that are used to support operations. The Mayor introduces the proposed Enterprise budgets to the Board of Supervisors on May 1. Capital and IT budgets: Capital and IT budget requests are submitted to the CPC and COIT for review. The recommendations for each committee are taken into account during the budget preparation process. The City's Ten-Year Capital Plan is brought before the Board of Supervisors and Mayor for approval concurrently with the General Fund and Enterprise department budgets. BUDGET PROCESS 51Between December and early February, departments prepare their budget requests and submit them to the Controller by mid-February. The Controller consolidates and verifies all of the information that departments have submitted. The Controller submits departments' proposed budget requests to the Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance for review in early March. From March through June, the Mayor and the Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance analyze each budget proposal, examining policy and service implications in order to meet citywide needs and reflect the Mayor's goals and priorities for the upcoming year. Concurrently, the Controller's Office certifies all revenue estimates. From February through May, the Mayor and Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance staff conduct a comprehensive outreach process to understand the budget priorities of San Francisco's communities and address these priorities in the budget. Additionally, the Mayor and the Mayor's Office of Public and Policy Finance meet with community groups to understand community members' neighborhood and citywide priorities for the upcoming budget. All San Franciscans have the opportunity to submit their budget priorities and feedback to the Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance by email and/or online form. The Mayor's Office use all feedback to make decisions about the upcoming budget that reflect the needs and priorities of San Francisco community members. Total budget requests must be brought into balance with estimated total revenues, which requires the Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance to prioritize funding requests that typically exceed projected available revenues. Before the Mayor's proposed budget is introduced to the Board of Supervisors, the Controller ensures that the finalized budget is balanced and accurate.Approval Upon receiving the Mayor's proposed budget, the Budget and Appropriations Committee of the Board of Supervisors holds public hearings during the month of June to review departmental requests and solicit public input. The Budget and Appropriations Committee makes recommendations to the full Board for budget approval along with their proposed changes. Since budget review lapses into the new fiscal year, the Interim Budget\u2014usually the Mayor's proposed budget\u2014is passed by the Board as a continuing resolution and serves as the operating budget until the budget is finalized in late July. The Mayor typically signs the budget ordinance into law by August. The Budget and Appropriations Committee works closely with the Board of Supervisor's Budget and Legislative Analyst (BLA), which develops recommendations on departmental budgets. Informed by departmental discussions that center on justifications for proposed expenses and comparison with prior year spending, the BLA forwards a report with recommended reductions. The Budget and Appropriations Committee reviews the Budget Analyst's recommended expenditure reductions, along with department and public input, before making final budget recommendations to the full Board of Supervisors. Because the budget must be balanced, expenditure reductions that are made to General Fund departments represent unallocated monies that the Board of Supervisors can apply to new public services or to offset proposed budget cuts. The Board of Supervisors generates a list of budget policy priorities that the Budget and Appropriations Committee uses to guide funding decisions on the unallocated pool of money. The Budget Committee then votes to approve the amended budget and forwards it to the full Board by June 30th. As required by the City Charter, the Board of Supervisors must vote on the budget twice between 52 BUDGET PROCESSBoard of Supervisors Review and Enactment of BudgetMayor and Office of Public Policy & Finance ReviewDec.

At the first reading, which occurs the first Tuesday after July 15, amendments may be proposed and, if passed by a simple majority, added to the budget. These amendments may be proposed by any member of the Board of Supervisors and can reflect further public input and/or Board policy priorities. At the second reading, the Board votes on the amended budget again, and, if passed, the budget is forwarded to the Mayor for final signature. If additional amendments are proposed during the second reading, the budget must go through another reading a week later. Final passage by the Board must occur before the August 1 deadline. The Mayor has 10 days to approve the final budget, now called the Budget and Appropriation Ordinance. The Mayor may sign the budget as approved by the Board, making it effective immediately, or may veto any portion, whereupon the budget returns to the Board of Supervisors. The Board has ten-days to override any or all of the Mayor's vetoes with a two- thirds majority vote. In this case, upon Board vote, the budget is immediately enacted, thus completing the budget process for the fiscal year. Should the Mayor opt not to sign the budget within the ten-day period, the budget is automatically enacted but without the Mayor's signature of approval. Once the Budget and Appropriation Ordinance is passed, it supersedes the Interim Budget. Implementation Responsibility for execution of the budget rests largely with departments. The Mayor's Office and the Controller's Office monitor department spending throughout the year and take measures to mitigate overspending or revenue shortfalls. Both offices, as well as the Board of Supervisors, also evaluate departments' achievement of performance measures on a periodic basis. Budget adjustments during the fiscal year take place in two ways: through supplemental appropriation requests, and through grant appropriation legislation. Supplemental appropriation requests are made when a department finds that it has inadequate resources to support operations through the end of the year. Grant appropriations occur when an outside entity awards funding to a department. Both supplemental and grant appropriation requests require approval by the Board of Supervisors before going to the Mayor for final signature.BUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLES5354 BUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLESBUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLES 55Each year, the City prepares a budgetary forecast of General Fund-supported operating expenditures and revenues, and projects either a surplus or shortfall between the two. In odd-numbered years, the Mayor's Office works with the Controller's Office and the Board of Supervisors' Budget and Legislative Analyst to forecast revenue and expenditures to prepare the City's Five-Year Financial Plan. The most recent update to the Five-Year Financial Plan (also called the Joint Report) was released in March 2023. The March Joint Report projected deficits of $290.9 million in FY 2023-24 and Total General Fund resources - which include revenue, transfers, fund balance, and use of reserves - are projected to increase by $70.9 million in FY 2023-24, or 1.0 percent above the FY 2022- 23 original budget, and increase by $193.5 million, or 2.8 percent, in FY 2024-25. REGULAR REVENUES. General Fund regular revenues make up 93.8 and 92.0 percent of total General Fund resources in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, respectively. General Fund tax revenues have been profoundly affected by the pandemic. The revenue outlook for the City is closely tied to the recovery of sectors most impacted or transformed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including tourism and office-using industries. In this budget, the revenue forecast assumes long-term structural change in office usage due to the prevalence of hybrid and remote work. This negatively impacts property, transfer, and business taxes beyond the budget period. The City's hospitality-based taxes are expected to rebound by FY 2027-28 if not earlier. $488.9 million in FY 2024-25 and shortfalls of and FY 2027-28 respectively. The City is legally required to balance its budget each year. The proposed FY 2023-24 budget totals $14.6 billion, a $611.8 million, or 4.4 percent, increase over the FY 2022-23 budget. The proposed FY 2024-25 budget totals $14.6 billion, a $40.5 million, or 0.3 percent, decrease over the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. Regular revenues are budgeted to increase by $241.6 million in FY 2023-24, 3.9 percent more than the FY 2022-23 original budget, and increase by $55.0 million in FY 2024-25, 0.9 percent higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. The FY 2023-24 increase is largely driven by property tax, hotel tax, and interest income, with increases of $130.5 million, $114.0 million, and $76.6 million respectively from FY 2022-23 budget. These increases are partially offset by significant anticipated losses of real property transfer tax and Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursements of $168.5 million and $73.4, respectively. In FY 2024-25, revenue growth moderates from FY 2023-24, with strength in business, hotel and transfer taxes, growing $83.8 million, $39.1 million, and $47.7 million, respectively from the FY 2023- 24 budget. These gains are mostly offset by reductions to Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursements.GENERAL FUND REVENUE & EXPENDITURE TRENDS OVERVIEW TRENDS IN GENERAL FUND SOURCES56 BUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLESUSE OF FUND BALANCE AND USE OF RESERVES. The proposed budget allocates $406.1 million in General Fund year-end fund balance as a source in the two budget years. The budget also withdraws $172.3 million from reserves in the two budget years, including $90.2 million from the Fiscal Cliff Reserve, $41.3 million from the Federal and State Emergency Revenue Reserve, $29.5 million from the Business Tax Stabilization Reserve, and $11.4 million from various other reserves. Detail about General Fund Revenues Property Tax Revenue Property valuations are in flux following a rapid increase in interest rates, reduction in time spent in offices, and a pause in construction of some entitled development projects. Assessments and taxes are based upon market valuations as of January 1st preceding any new fiscal year (starting on July 1st). The FY 2023-24 General Fund share of property tax revenue is budgeted at $2,510.0 million, which is $130.5 million, or 5.5 percent, more than the FY 2022-23 budget. The FY 2024-25 General Fund share of property tax revenue is budgeted at $2,474.0 million, which is $36.0 million, or 1.4 percent, less than the proposed FY 2023-24 budget. The budget assumes secured roll growth of four percent in FY 2023-24 and 2.5 percent in FY 2024- 25, including the two percent inflation allowed under the state constitution, and unsecured values are projected to decline 0.5 percent in each year. Approximately $90.0 million is assumed diverted from the General Fund to various tax increment financing districts, including redevelopment projects and infrastructure financing districts in FY 2023- 24, increasing to $96.0 million in FY 2024-25. The budget assumes $2.5 billion of reductions in current year local assessment values over the course of each of the two budget years, which translates to approximately $14.0 million in General Fund property tax revenues refunded annually. Additionally, the budget assumes refunds of $64.0 million in General Fund revenue from appeals of assessed values filed in FY 2023-24 and $103.0 million from appeals filed in FY 2024-25 will need to be paid at such time as the Assessment Appeals Board determines reductions. Supplemental assessments capture changes in value for the portion of the tax year remaining after an assessable event\u2014a change in ownership or new construction\u2014results in a change in the base year assessed value of a property. Supplemental property taxes are estimated at $46.0 million in FY 2023-24, dampened in the second half of the year due to the Assessor's planned migration to new assessment software, and $45.0 million in FY 2024-25. Escape assessments capture a full year's increase in assessed value up to four years after the event trigger date and are estimated to generate $13.0 million in each of the budget years. Excess Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF) revenue represents the amount of property tax revenues initially diverted from the City to help the state meet its funding obligations for K-14 education. The amount that exceeds these entities' revenue limits is returned to the City. Excess ERAF revenues are budgeted at $365.0 million in FY 2023-24 and $322.0 million in FY 2024-25, based on current state law. Business Tax Revenue FY 2023-24 General Fund business tax revenue is budgeted at $846.7 million, which is $55.6 million, or 6.2 percent, less than what was budgeted in FY 2022-23. FY 2024-25 business tax revenue is budgeted at $930.5 million, which is an additional $83.8 million, or 9.9 percent, higher than the proposed FY 2023-24 budget. Business tax revenue is comprised of business registration fees, administrative office tax, and gross receipts tax. San Francisco gross receipt taxes are determined in part by the proportion of businesses' BUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLES 57employees that physically work within the City limits. Responding to the pandemic, workers who previously commuted into the City began telecommuting from home, outside the City, and business tax revenue fell accordingly. While office attendance increased over the course of the pandemic, in recent weeks office attendance in the Bay Area has stagnated around 45 percent of pre-pandemic levels, according to office security company Kastle Systems. With lower office attendance and recent layoffs in the technology industry, office vacancy rates continue to rise. Real estate firm JLL reports that office vacancy in the City increased to 26.4 percent in the first quarter of 2023. Considering the stable levels of remote work and office occupancy, the projection assumes economic growth rates of 0 percent in 2023-24 and 1 percent in 2024-25. In November 2020, voters passed Proposition F, which eliminated the payroll tax, modified gross receipt tax rates, reduced business registration fees for businesses with less than $1.0 million in gross receipts, and raised the small business exemption for gross receipts taxes to $2.0 million. The impacts of Proposition F are accounted for in the budget. Additionally, the budget assumes two pieces of pending legislation that impact this source will pass: a delay of tax increases for business categories most acutely affected by the pandemic, and a tax reduction for businesses that sign new leases in the City . Sales Tax Revenue In FY 2023-24, local sales tax revenue is budgeted at $200.1 million, which is $17.2 million, or 9.4 percent, higher than what was budgeted in FY 2022-23. FY 2024-25 local sales tax revenue is budgeted at $205.2 million, which is $5.2 million, or 2.6 percent, higher than the proposed FY 2023-24 budget. Sales tax experienced significant losses during the COVID-19 public health emergency shut-downs. The budget assumes sales tax revenues will stagnate in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 at FY reach pre-pandemic levels by FY 2025-26. This is largely due to the persistence of fewer in- commuters, travelers, and residents. Transient Occupancy (Hotel) Tax The FY 2023-24 General Fund share of hotel tax revenue is budgeted at $302.9 million, which is $114.0 million, or 60.4 percent, more than what was budgeted in FY 2022-23. FY 2024-25 revenue is budgeted at $342.0 million, an increase of $39.1 million, or 12.9 percent, from the proposed FY 2023-24 budget. The City's hotel tax experienced an unprecedented decline in FY 2020-21, with a 90 percent revenue drop compared to pre-pandemic levels. The City's budget assumes hotel tax returns to pre- pandemic levels by FY 2027-28, as the resumption of large group events, conventions, business, and international travel contribute to growth in the budget years. Conventions drive up hotel room rates through compression pricing, which is important to the full recovery of the City's hotel tax base. San Francisco's hotel tax is derived from hotel stays from individual business travelers, group events such as conferences and meetings, and leisure tourists . These visitors primarily travel to the City by air. In April 2020, at the height of the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, enplanements at San Francisco International Airport decreased by 97 percent compared to prior year. Enplanements at San Francisco International Airport have improved steadily since the onset of the pandemic. As of March 2023, domestic and international enplanements throughout FY 2022-23 were 43.3 percent greater but behind FY 2018-19 by 19.8 percent.58 BUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLESReal Property Transfer Tax Revenue Real property transfer tax revenue is budgeted at $222.0 million in FY 2023-24, representing a decrease of $168.5 million, or 43.2 percent, below what was budgeted in FY 2022-23. In FY 2024-25, revenue is budgeted at $269.6 million, an increase of $47.7 million, or 21.5 percent, above the proposed FY 2023-24 budget. The high interest rate environment makes borrowing more difficult for residents and businesses, and the persistent remote work makes office space less attractive. The budget assumes FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 transfer taxes grow from a low in FY 2022-23 to a new long-term average by FY 2026-27. FY 2022-23 transfer activity has dropped across- the-board not seen since FY 2003- 04 and FY 2009-10. Considering the highly volatile nature of this revenue source, the Controller's Office monitors collections throughout the fiscal year and provides regular updates to the Mayor and Board of Supervisors. Overpaid Executive Tax The overpaid executive tax is budgeted at $100.0 million in FY 2023-24 and $100.0 million in FY 2024-25. In November 2020, voters adopted Proposition L, a new tax on businesses in the City, where compensation of the businesses' highest- paid managerial employee compared to the median compensation paid to the businesses' employees based in the City exceeds a ratio of 100:1. The measure took effect on January 1, 2022 for tax year 2022, and revenue was first collected in FY 2022-23. This tax is expected to be highly volatile due to the narrow base of expected payers, annual fluctuations in the value and form of executive compensation, and the risk of tax-avoidance. In tax year 2022, the top five payers owed 64 percent of the total tax. Estimates based on prior years' activity may not be predictive of future revenues. State and Federal Grants and Subventions General Fund federal grants and subventions are budgeted at $505.1 million in FY 2023-24, which is $55.3 million, or 9.9 percent, less than what was budgeted in FY 2022-23. In FY 2024-25, federal grants and subventions are budgeted at $422.4 million, which is $82.7 million, or 16.4 percent, less than the proposed FY 2023-24 budget. These changes are largely driven by reimbursements from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the City's COVID-19 emergency response. FEMA reimbursements are budgeted at $170.0 million in FY 2023-24, which is $73.4 million, or 30.1 percent, less than what was budgeted in FY 2022-23. In FY 2024-25, FEMA reimbursements are budgeted at $80.0 million, which is $90.0 million, or 52.9 percent, less than the proposed FY 2023- 24 budget. The City's FEMA forecast is based on updated timelines upon which FEMA will obligate and remit funds for the COVID-19 public health emergency. General Fund state grants and subventions are budgeted at $947.8 million in FY 2023-24, which is $58.9 million, or 6.2 percent, more than what was budgeted in FY 2022-23. In FY 2024-25, General Fund state grants and subventions are budgeted at $1,002.7 million, which is $4.0 million, or 0.4 percent, less than the proposed FY 2023- 24 budget. The increase in FY2023-24 is driven by growth in social service subventions, health and welfare realignment, and health and mental health subventions, and public safety sales tax, partially offset by reductions public safety realignment. Operating Transfers-In Transfers-in to the General Fund are budgeted at $208.7 million in FY 2023-24, which is $5.75 million, or 0.1 percent, more than what was budgeted in FY 2022-23. In FY 2024-25, transfers- in are budgeted at $206.4 million, which is $2.4 million, or 0.0 percent, less than the proposed FY 2023-24 budget. These transfers include a portion of Airport concessions revenue and 15 percent of commercial rent tax collections as authorized by June 2018 Proposition C.BUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLES 59The General Fund represents 46.9 percent and 48.4 percent in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, respectively, of the City's total budget. General Fund discretionary spending capacity, however, is less, due to voter- approved minimum spending requirements. San Francisco voters have passed ballot measures that require minimum spending levels for certain operations, including the Children's Baseline, the Transitional Youth Baseline, Our City Our Homes Baseline, Early Care and Education Baseline, the Public Library Baseline, the Public Transportation Baseline, the City Services Auditor operations, the Municipal Symphony Baseline, Housing Trust Fund, Dignity Fund, Street Tree Maintenance Fund, Recreation and Parks Baseline, Mission Bay Transportation Improvement Fund, and required reserve deposits. These requirements are discussed in detail in the Controller's discussion of the Mayor's Budget, also known as the Revenue Letter, published the second week of June 2023.SPENDING MANDATES AND DISCRETIONARY SOURCESPersonnel Expenses The proposed budget includes an increase in total labor costs of $222.7 million, or 3.4 percent, from FY 2022-23 and an additional increase of $162.4 million, or 2.4 percent, for all funds in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, respectively. This total increase includes an increase in General Fund labor costs of $63.2 million, or 2.0 percent, in FY 2023-24 and an additional increase of $112.7 million, or 3.6 percent, in FY 2024-25. The change in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 is driven by cost of living adjustment increases to wages for all City employees and increases in employee benefit costs in health and retirement. Non-Personnel Expenses General Fund non-personnel expenses - including professional services, materials and supplies, aid assistance, grants, capital projects and equipment, debt service, and contributions to reserves - will decrease by $16.0 million, or 0.7 percent, to $2.4 billion in FY 2023-24 and will decrease further by $36.7 million, or 1.5 percent, to $2.37 billion in FY 2024-25. In FY 2023-24, the change is primarily due to one-time FY 2022-23 investments in nonprofit capital and community base organization (CBO) grants, and shifting CBO grants in FY 2023- 24 to non-General Fund sources. The change in FY 2024-25 is primarily due to a one-time deposit to the General Reserve made in FY 2023-24. Transfers Out Transfers Out of the General Fund are budgeted at $1.3 billion and $1.42 billion in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, respectively, representing an increase of $23.7 million in FY 2023-24 from the previous year and an increase of $117.5 million in FY 2024-25. Changes are due to increases in mandatory baseline funded requirements. USE TRENDS 60 BUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLESBUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLES 61 60 BUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLESFUND STRUCTURE The fund structure chart below maps out how the City's revenue and expenditures are organized within the budget. At its most basic, a budget is divided into revenues (sources) and expenses (uses). Budgets like San Francisco's (a consolidated city and county), contain a detailed organizational scheme to group, categorize, and identify revenues and expenses. The tables displayed in the following pages summarize proposed revenues and expenditures by funding sources and uses at multiple levels, by service area, and by full time equivalent FTE employee counts. In the public sector, financial activity is planned and recorded in a series of funds, which are created to reflect restrictions on the uses of different types of revenue. For example, enterprise funds are used to account for activities primarily funded by user charges, such as the Port, Airport, MTA and Public Utilities Commission. The General Fund is the City's largest single fund. Because it contains revenues with the broadest allowable uses (tax proceeds), it is the focus of a large amount of budget discussion and deliberation. A fund is a high-level classification unit that is organized according to its purpose. An account is a unique six digit code that identifies the general nature of a source or use, at its lowest level of detail. A value between 400000 and 499999 denotes a source, while a value between 500000 and 599999 denotes a use. Accounts can be summarized at different levels. For the reports contained in this book, accounts are summarized at Level 5, into a 4 digit code. For example, accounts 501010 - Permanent Salaries and 501070 - Holiday Pay roll up to an Account Level 5 of 5010 - Salaries. 62 BUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLESBUDGET INFORMATION & SUMMARY TABLES

and natural history museum in the heart of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park . The Academy's mission is to regenerate the natural world through science, learning, and collaboration. It is a leading institution for biodiversity research and exploration, environmental education, and sustainability across the globe. For more information about this department's services, please visit calacademy.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $7.5 million for the Academy of Science is approximately $0.04 million, or 0.5 percent, higher than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to reduced reimbursements to the Academy offset by increased costs in salaries and benefits. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $7.3 million is $0.1 million, or 1.8 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is primarily due one- time capital funding in FY 2023-24. Philanthropic Endeavors The Academy of Science's fundraising efforts are focused on major initiatives such as Coral Reefs, California & Tropical Island Biodiversity, and Museum Accessibility. These initiatives align with the Academy's mission and leverage exhibits within the museum to inspire better understanding and regeneration of the natural world. Exhibits The Academy's exhibits and seasonal festivals bring science and nature to life for visitors of all ages. Public engagement specialists orchestrate more than 30 interactive presentations and activities throughout the Academy every day to connect guests with science concepts and ideas.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/adult-probation-department The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $58.5 million for the Adult Probation Department $0.4 million, or 0.7 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to on-going investments in re-entry services including transitional housing and behavioral health treatment programs. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $57.6 million is $0.8 million, or 1.4 percent lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to one-time funding for community programs in FY 2023-24. Restoring Vibrancy in San Francisco through Improved Public Safety Adult Probation Department's core functions of supervision, investigations and re-entry are crucial to improved public safety. Through collaboration with City and community partners, ADP provides transitional housing and supportive services to justice-involved adults. Supportive services include employment, medication management, drug treatment and case management. The Mayor's BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS proposed budget includes $3.7 million in grants to community-based organization funding to preserve these services. The proposed budget also continues to invest $3.5 million annually to support a treatment and transitional housing program for justice-involved, un-housed individuals with 75 units of transitional housing. The project is a partnership between the Department of Public Health and ADP. In addition to transitional housing, participants have access to on- site wraparound services, including outpatient mental health and substance disorder treatment. Participants will also have access to case management, medication management and support groups. The proposed budget also includes $3.3 million annually in continued funding for the department's abstinence-based Treatment Recovery and Prevention (TRP) program. The program is a peer-led, abstinence-based, therapeutic teaching community and transitional housing program offering 105 beds. 88 ADULT PROBATIONFY 2021-22 HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES.

SFO is the Bay Area's largest airport by passenger volume. For more information about this department's services, please visit flysfo.com The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $1.3 billion for the Airport is $148.4 million, or 12.8 percent, higher lower than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits and debt service. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $1.5 million is $187.3 million, or 14.3 percent higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is primarily due to increases in revenue from charges for services, such as landing fees, parking fees, and airline rentals. COVID-19 Impact on Passenger Levels The Airport's revenues are primarily driven by passenger levels. As the graphic on passenger levels indicates, there are encouraging signs that travel demand is recovering. The Airport anticipates the full recovery to pre-pandemic FY 2018-19 levels in FY 2024-25, according to passenger enplanement forecasts. Enhancing Health, Safety and Security Passengers, employees, airlines, and tenants depend on Airport systems and processes to provide a safe and secure travel environment. The Airport is committed to exceeding all aviation safety and security regulations in response to COVID-19, and maintains measures to facilitate physical distancing, on-site vaccinations, and testing, as BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS needed. Through the use of advanced technology and implementation of best practices, the Airport continues to advance its safety and security profile. Investing In Capital The Mayor's proposed budget continues to support the implementation of the Airport's Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). In January 2023, the Airport Commission approved a mid-year update REDUCTION IN PASSENGER LEVELS DUE TO COVID-19. Passenger traffic continues to recover and as of February 2023 has recovered close to 80 percent of total budget from $7.8 billion to $8.9 billion to take advantage of potential federal funding opportunities and prioritize certain capital projects related to the modernization of the West Field and supporting the Airport's infrastructure. In addition, the Airport is currently in the process of developing a new FY 2023-24 CIP focusing on capital projects that are critical for Airport operations and forecasted passenger growth. Approximately $5.9 billion of the current CIP project costs have been financed to date, and many CIP projects have been completed, such as the AirTrain Extension to the long-term parking garages, the Harvey Milk Terminal Boarding Area B, the Courtyard 3 Connector post-security passenger connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, and the rehabilitation of Runway 10L-28R. Construction activity continues on major projects such as the expansion of Terminal 1 Center and North Areas, the International Terminal departures level expansion of both security checkpoints, Wayfinding Enhancement Program, and the Terminal 3 West Modernization. Diversity, Equity & Inclusion The Airport continues to use the Racial Equity Action Plan as the blueprint that guides and helps focus our efforts towards advancing racial equity in all aspects of the department's work. Airport leadership and employees are are looking both inward and outward to address existing gaps. For workforce, priority areas include increasing opportunities and resources for career development; implementing process improvements to better address employee workplace concerns, including complaints of equal employment opportunity (EEO); as well as providing team members with practical racial equity tools that inform decision-making, measurement, and accountability. Accelerating Sustainability SFO is halfway through its journey to be the first airport in the world to achieve \"triple zero\": zero net carbon operations, zero net energy facilities, zero waste going to landfill, and healthy and safe indoor environments by 2030. Key milestones include achieving Level 4 of the Airport Carbon Accreditation Program, a first for large-hub airports in North America; completing a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) study to identify sites for new solar generation; receiving the first airport Platinum certification under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED v4.1) for Communities program; leading the industry in Sustainable Aviation Fuel pipeline deliveries.

The Commission values the transformative power of art as critical to strengthening neighborhoods, building infrastructure and fostering positive social change. Additionally, the Commission strives to ensure a vibrant San Francisco where creativity, prosperity and progress go hand in hand. For more information about this department's services, please visit sfartscommission.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $40.9 million for the Arts Commission is less than $0.1 million, or 0.05 percent, lower than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to decreases in capital funding offset by increases in hotel tax revenue. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $28.9 million is $12.0 million, or 29.4 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to expiration of one-time capital funding. Hotel Tax Arts Allocation Hotel tax revenue allocated to ART supports San Francisco artists and arts organizations representing historically underserved communities through grants, technical assistance and capacity building, economic development, arts education initiatives and community-based Cultural Centers. Hotel tax is expected to continue to increase in the next fiscal years. In FY 2023-24, the Mayor's proposed budget includes $14 million of funding from Hotel Tax in the Arts Commission to fund programs and to support artist and art organizations. The San Francisco Arts Commission will continue working towards providing equitable access to cultural resources and creating more sustainable impact across the arts ecosystem.BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS HOTEL ROOM TAX ONGOING FUNDING TO THE ARTS COMMISSION.

As visitors return to performances and special events, the local economy is stimulated through dining and shopping at small businesses. The arts and culture sector produces employment opportunities for the creative community and draws residents and tourists to neighborhoods' cultural sites across the City. Individual artists from the Art Vendor Program also participated in the City Hall holiday and Small Business Week craft fairs, creating economic opportunities for local artists to showcase SF-made artwork and goods. Civic Art Collection The Monuments and Memorials Advisory Committee (MMAC) is a body that will establish the criteria and guidelines by which to determine the future of historic monuments and memorials in the City's Civic Art Collection. This initiative was established by Mayoral directive and is a partnership between ART, the Human Rights Commission (HRC), and the Recreation and Parks Department (REC). The MMAC is responsible for examining the history of monuments in the public realm in San Francisco, the individuals, events, and ideals they represent and how the narratives associated with these monuments align or do not align with San Francisco's values today. The MMAC meetings began in early 2022 and are set to finalize its recommendations by the end of FY 2022-23. Organizational Improvements ART is actively recruiting to fill all open budgeted positions to improve core service delivery and is on track to be fully staffed by the end of FY 2022-23. ART has invested in professional development to ensure that staff is well-trained and has access to job related tools, resources, and opportunities. It has also just completed development of a new grants management system that aims to streamline grant applications and monitoring. In FY 2023-24, the Commission will begin its strategic and business planning process. ART will engage in a process to work with a variety of community stakeholders to help plan the City's cultural future and assess the impact of past and present programs, practices and policies to help set priorities and identify opportunities.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sfassessor.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $37.4 million for the Office of the Assessor- Recorder is $2.3 million, or 6.4 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to costs associated with the ongoing maintenance and staff for the new Property Assessment System as well as, staffing for the Assessment Appeals team. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $38.0 million is $0.6 million, or 1.7 percent higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to increases in salaries and benefits. Goal-to-Roll and Assessments The assessed roll for FY 2022-23 continued its growth trajectory, increasing 5.4 percent over the prior year to $330 billion. These assessments equate to approximately $3.9 billion in revenue that the City relies on to maintain critical programs in the areas of public safety, mental health, homelessness, and more. In June 2022, staff closed the roll on time for the fourth year since clearing a historically large backlog. By implementing technology improvements, standardizing work processes, and establishing performance expectations, the Department continues to set production targets to ensure it is advancing transparency, accessibility, and integrity to ensure the financial stability of the City and best serve taxpayers. Recorder Revenues ASR is projecting a decline in recorder revenue due to a decline in the volume of recorded documents from the prior year. In order to respond to this trend, the Department is shifting costs from the General Fund by increasing the use of one-time fund balance to cover the decrease in annual fee collections each year. Real Property Transfer Tax The Department's Recorder Division collects Real Property Transfer Tax (RPTT) when a building changes ownership. Over the last five years, RPTT has generated an average of $369 million annually to support the General Fund and free community college. ASR maintains a robust RPTT Audit Program that closely reviews high value transactions to ensure these entities are not underreporting their transfer tax obligations. Since 2015, ASR has recovered $75 million through the audit program. BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS106 ASSESSOR-RECORDERAssessment Appeals In the year ahead, ASR will focus on successful roll close while balancing the increase in assessment appeals and implementing major improvements to ASR's primary technology platform. The focus on Assessment Appeals will be important as appeals filed in FY 2021-22 increased 8 percent over the prior year, with open appeals representing $531 million in revenue-at-risk, a 54 percent increase from FY 2020-21. The Mayor's proposed budget invests $0.2 2023-24 and $0.5 million in FY 2024-25 to support four new appeals support positions, advancing the Department's ability to dedicate time to assessment appeals. Modernizing Technology Through the City's Committee on Information Technology, San Francisco has made significant investments to improve and modernize the systems that assess properties and bill, collect, and allocate property tax revenue. The Property Assessment and Tax System program encapsulates the integrated systems of the Assessor-Recorder, Treasurer-Tax Collector, and Controller. The modernization and upgrade of these antiquated systems will: Increase efficiency and quality of work product by eliminating the need for manual processes. Improve the revenue collection process for the Treasurer and Tax Collector through decreasing turnaround time for property assessments tax billing, revenue collection, and certification to reduce revenue at risk. Strengthen and modernize technology infrastructure that is the system foundation for the City's property tax revenue stream. Increase access to data and reporting for the public as well as policymakers and city leaders by creating a system that can store all Assessor property information and analysis in a single system. Improve taxpayer service and transparency. The Treasurer-Tax Collector's tax billing and collection system went live in 2020, and Phase I of the Property Assessment System went live in 2021, with Phase II to follow in December 2023. The Mayor's proposed budget includes new ongoing investments to support the maintenance and staff needed for this system, totaling $2.7 million in FY 2023-24 and $3.5 million in FY 2024-25. Over the next year, ASR's project team will work to integrate its components with the Treasurer-Tax Collector's system. The project will VALUE OF CERTIFIED ASSESSMENT ROLL.

Over the past three years, the average number of appeals filed has climbed to an average of 2,500. The increase in open appeals has resulted in a dramatic over 335 percent increase in potential property tax impact from FY18-19 to now, up from $174 million to over $750 million.also undertake a major change management effort for hundreds of users who rely on assessment data. Community Engagement In 2022, ASR partnered with community groups and engaged with residents online and in-person. The office held webinars to share updates on new state laws such as Proposition 19, property tax basics, and continued outreach and education on the benefits of estate planning and tax savings programs to strengthen intergenerational wealth building particularly for communities of color.ASR will continue to expand recruitment efforts to a broader talent pool, support professional development for all staff, and implement California Assembly Bill 1466 (AB 1466). AB 1466 was signed into law by Governor Newsom in 2021 and requires that all county recorder offices work to identify and redact unlawfully restrictive covenants from real property records. This effort to uphold the implementation of AB 1466 is made possible with the ongoing support of the Mayor's proposed budget which makes investments to continue supporting two positions tasked with finding and redacting discriminatory language from recorded documents.

DBI oversees the effective, efficient, fair, and safe enforcement of Building, Housing, Plumbing, Electrical, and Mechanical Codes, along with Disability Access Regulations. For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/department-building-inspection The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $81.3 million for Building Inspection is $11.5 million, or 12.4 percent, lower than the FY 2022-23 budget. This change is due to aligning decreased spending with declining revenues, generated by reduced spending on non- personnel services, contracts with community- based organizations, projects, as well as, services performed by other City departments. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $83.0 million is $1.7 million, or 2.1 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits. Revenue Changes The COVID-19 pandemic slowed construction activity over the past three years, and permitting activity remains below pre-pandemic levels. The pandemic's impact on permitting activity has resulted in reduced revenues for DBI. As a self-supporting department that relies on the revenues it collects, revenue decline has a direct impact on the department's budget. Over this time, DBI has been reducing its expenditures, to the extent possible, and leveraging its reserves to balance its budget. However, reliance on reserves is not a sustainable option for the Department. As such, in 2023, DBI began conducting a fee study to bring revenue and expenditures closer in alignment. This is also crucial, given that the last fee change was a reduction in 2015. The fee study will address the recent revenue decline and ensure appropriate cost recovery in the long-run. As part of this effort, the Department will also continue to monitor revenues TOTAL INSPECTIONS PERFORMEDFiscal identify expenditure savings. As such, DBI's focus will remain on providing core services and making operational improvements with existing resources. In addition, given the continued downward trend in construction activity, the Department continues to assume slowed revenue in both years of the budget. Streamlining Permitting and Application Review As part of the Mayor's Housing for All Executive Directive, DBI will assess permitting timelines, identify opportunities to reduce review times, and implement process improvements to expedite housing delivery in San Francisco. The Department will specifically implement changes to the Site Permit review process. Changes, including standardization of the site permit process, will establish greater transparency and a more predictable project review process. Permit applicants will receive clear direction from the City about the information and additional permits required for their project. Fiscal YearsNumber ISSUED.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/ departments/child-support-services The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $13.7 million for the Department of Child Support Services is $0.1 million, or 0.6 percent, higher than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to anticipated increases in non-personnel costs. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $13.7 million is $0.1 million, or 0.4 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 budget, which remains in line with projected State and Federal allocations. Ongoing Initiatives The Department will continue to focus its energy and resources on the following five key initiatives during FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25: Paternity Establishment A collaboration with SF General Hospital and other San Francisco birthing centers to support children with an opportunity for financial and emotional support from both parents. Serving Incarcerated Parents Expanding collaboration with the Sheriff's Department to provide both virtual and in-person assistance to incarcerated parents ensures they have equitable access to the program and opportunities for debt relief. Providing More Parents with Debt Relief The Debt Relief program is an expansion of the familiar Compromise of Arrears Program (COAP) that allows more parents to qualify to settle government- owned debt - reducing the negative consequences of debt burden and promotes parent stability in getting more resources to their children.

To increase diversity and employment equity the department seeks to work with the Department of Human Resources to create child support officer positions that allows community representation. Community Input through Advisory Committee DCSS is building an Advisory Committee to work directly with parents and community based organizations on issues of concerns to families to promote equitable change and effectively guide the department. A New Approach to Child Support for San Francisco Families The Department understands that parents work together in many ways to support their children. In recognition of this fact, CSS partnered with the San Francisco Superior Court in 2021 to create a non-cash payment alternative to the traditional child support order. A non-cash payment alternative, also referred to as in-kind support, is an arrangement between parents to care for their children. The arrangement may involve the exchange of goods or services such as transportation, clothing, shoes, groceries, housing, rent, or other items. Working with the San Francisco Superior Court, the Department coordinates a pilot program to acknowledge the various ways that parents provide for their children and reflect those arrangements in their formal child support court order. Recruitment of families into the voluntary program is currently underway. Enrolled parents will work with court mediators to draft their in-kind support agreements; the court will monitor the agreements for compliance, and child support will enforce the monetary portion of the child support order.CHILD SUPPOR T SERVICES Fiscal Y ear Goal2021-2022 Actuals 2022-2023 ed Target 2023-2024 Target 2024-2025 Target Be innov ative in meeting the needs o f families Number o f unemancip ated childr en ated childr in San Francisco caselo ad Deliv er ex cellent and consist ent cust omer ser vices stat ewide Percentage o f IV-D cases in San Francisco with p aternity established for childr en in caselo ad born out o f wedlock San Francisco or ders established as a per centage o f cases needing an or der Develop and str engthen collaborativ e partnerships Amount o f child suppor t collect ed by SF DCSS annually , in millions Enhance pr ogram per formance and sustainability Statewide cases with collections on arr ears during fiscal y ear as a per centage o f cases with arr ears owed Statewide curr ent collections as a per centage o f curr ent suppor t owed Increase suppor t for California childr en San Francisco cases with collections on arr ears during the fiscal y ear as a per centage o f all cases in San Francisco San Francisco curr ent collections as a per centage o f this drop down list CHILD SUPPOR T SERVICES CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES 125Executive Administration LegalOperations CHILD SUPPORT SERVICESDepartment Total Budget Historical Comparison (Mayor's Proposed) Budget Year 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 Department Total Budget Historical Comparison CSS Child Support Services Sources Intergovernmental: Federal 8,359,395 64.12 (2.12) 63.47 (0.64) Uses - By Division Child Support Services 13,582,056 13,666,530 84,474 54,576 Page 17 of 58TOTAL COMPARISON FUNDED POSITIONS2022-2023 ORIGINAL BUDGET2023-2024 PROPOSED BUDGETCHANGE FROM 2022-20232024-2025 PROPOSED BUDGETCHANGE FROM 2023-2024CHILDREN, YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES CHILDREN, YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES 127MISSION The Department of Children, Youth and Their Families (DCYF) has administered San Francisco's powerful investments in children, youth, transitional age youth, and their families through the Children and Youth Fund since 1991 . With a deep commitment to advancing equity and healing trauma, DCYF brings together government agencies, schools, community-based organizations to strengthen San Francisco communities to lead full lives of opportunity and happiness . The Department strives to make San Francisco a great place to grow up. For more information about this department's services, please visit dcyf.org symptoms of mental health needs, provide clinical support services for CBO staff, and increase agency capacity to provide wellness and referral services. The investment also funds an expansion The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $342 million for the Department of Children, Youth and their Families (DCYF) is $9 million, or 2.7 percent higher, than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to the newly approved Student Success Fund, which set asides $11 million in FY 2023-24 for new programming, offset by savings in non-personnel services and the expiration of grant funding. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $343.3 million is $1.3 million, or 0.4 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to the Student Success Fund of $24 million, offset by the expiration of one-time grant funding. Mental Health and Family Wellness The Mayor's proposed budget continues allocating $5 million annually to address critical mental health needs and support family wellness. This includes a Mental Health Support Pilot with UCSF, where clinicians and graduate students will work with community-based organizations (CBO) to provide onsite support to children and youth, train and coach CBO staff to identify signs and BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS INVESTMENTS BY SERVICE AREA (FY 2022-23).

As part of the budget, DCYF will continue to partner with CBOs to provide parents and caregivers additional support related to parenting and understanding their child's developmental needs. Citywide Referral and Navigation Supports The exacerbated need for support during the pandemic highlighted that City services can be difficult to understand and access. As part of the Children and Family Recovery Plan, the Mayor's proposed budget includes $2.5 million in FY 2023- 24 and $2.6 million in FY 2024-25 to support enhanced referral and navigation for citywide resources, making it easier for children and families to get the support they need to thrive. This initiative increases communication and improves coordination to reach more children, youth and families across City agencies and the San Francisco Unified School District. This reduces confusion for families, lowers barriers to accessing services and reaches vulnerable families who might otherwise not know about services that exist for them. Restoration of Technical Assistance The City is committed to improving program quality and driving better outcomes for program participants. To that end, DCYF offers technical assistance and capacity building training workshops, and other support to all its grantees. After a brief period of reduced funding during the pandemic, the Mayor's proposed budget maintains DCYF's Technical Assistance programming budget in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25. San Francisco Unified School District and the City College of San Francisco The proposed budget continues to invest in the Free City College Program at City College of San Francisco (CCSF). Further, in 2022, San Francisco voters approved Proposition G to establish the Student Success Fund to provide grants to the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) and schools to implement programs that improve academic achievement and social/emotional wellness of students. The amended Charter requires an annual appropriation to the Fund for 15 years based on a calculation of the City's excess Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (Fund) allocation in specified fiscal years.

The SCSCP was developed with the explicit goals of intervening and preventing escalation of violent incidents and coordinating supports and services for youth with City Departments, SFUSD, and CBO partners. In FY 22-23, DCYF received its first STOP School Violence Program grant and is in the process of applying for the second grant to expand this project. The Mayor's proposed budget includes $11.0 million in FY 2023-24 and $35.0 million in for the Fund. DCYF is partnering with SFUSD on implementation. In addition, the budget includes a one-time use of $2 million from the Free City College reserve to alleviate student fees to support students with course enrollment.Equity and the 5-Year Granting Cycle DCYF's equity-based funding framework is developed through a three-part planning process which includes Community Needs Assessment (CNA), Services Allocation Plan (SAP), and Request for Proposal (RFP) for services implemented by CBOs. The CNA process utilizes equity metrics that help DCYF identify the high need groups. The SAP process is the way that DCYF makes meaning of CNA findings and turns them into services that meet the needs of the City's residents. The five-year RFP is the procurement process used to identify CBO providers with the experience, cultural competence and community connection to implement the services DCYF funds in support of the Department's racial equity and equity goals.

Examples of the Agency's functions include public safety, internal services, civic engagement, capital planning, asset management, code enforcement, disaster mitigation, tourism promotion, and economic development. For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/city-administrator The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $594.7 million for the City Administrator is $16.0 million, or 2.6 percent, lower than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to the expiration of one-time capital expenditures in FY 2022-23. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $603.1 million is $8.5 million, or 1.4 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to increased costs in salaries and benefits, non-personnel services, and services of other departments. Improving the Customer Experience The Mayor's proposed budget for the City Administrator's Office funds an overall improvement to resident and non-resident experience. At the Permit Center, new staffing will aid the on-going interdepartmental effort to centralize customer services by consolidating standard questions to a single-entry point, handling simple inquiries, and routing more complex inquiries to the permitting department for resolution. Centralizing points of intake makes it easier for customers to ask questions and receive a faster and efficient response. Similarly, the proposed budget funds County Clerk's service upgrades to its current queuing system, facilitating pre-check-in text notifications in multiple languages, and improving queue management and customer flow. In addition, the County Clerk is replacing paper applications with an online portal to allow customers to submit forms and applications remotely. Finally, the budget also continues to invest in bringing better digital services to all citywide departments via the Digital Services program. Currently, in collaboration with the Department of Technology and the Department of Building Inspection, the program is piloting an electronic version of the \"pink form\" that allows building permit applicants to send their data and documents directly into City systems from their own device and get a confirmation email with a tracking link immediately. Helping to Meet Climate and Housing Goals The Fleet Management Division laid the research, procurement, and operational groundwork to double the City's fleet of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS134 CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICETREASURE ISLAND/YERBA BUENA ISLAND HOUSING PIPELINE. Housing Calendar Year.The Mayor's proposed budget in FY 2023-24 funds the planning for development of a City- operated hydrogen fuel cell station, which will provide the City's fleet with reliable access to a zero-emission fuel. In addition, the Treasure Island Development Authority has made substantial progress with the completion of new roadways, utilities, parks, and a ferry terminal in support of future housing. So far, 229 new units have been completed, 119 of which are affordable units including the Maceo May Apartments, which houses formerly homeless veterans and their families. An additional 740 units are currently in progress for completion by the end of 2024, 178 of which will be affordable. At full buildout, the project will deliver 8,000 new units of housing, 27.2 percent of which will be permanently affordable. The proposed budget includes $15 million of new expenses related to the TICD Developer Housing Subsidy as well as $1.5 million of new expenses for anticipated operations and maintenance of new parks and open spaces scheduled to open in FY 2023-24. Contracting Reform and Community Safety Under the Mayor's proposed budget, new staffing under the Office of Contract Administration will help with citywide contracting reform and contribute to future cost savings by conducting procurement analysis across departments and identify efficiencies. The proposed budget also sustains funding for the Community Ambassadors Program (CAP) under the Office of Civic Engagement and Immigrant Affairs. CAP is a community safety and neighborhood engagement program and provides visible, non- law enforcement safety presence in several neighborhoods across San Francisco.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/department-technology The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $167.3 million for the Department of Technology (TIS) is $13.9 million, or 9.0 percent higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increased cost of salary and benefits, software contracts, and services of other departments. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $171.0 million is $3.7 million, or 2.2 percent higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to increase in salaries and benefits. Accelerating a Digital City The Department continues to deliver shareable enterprise-level business applications and modernize the City's technology infrastructure. Emphasizing infrastructure resiliency and migrating departments to a new software defined network increases capacity and performance. New applications speed up City services, and modernized infrastructure delivers security, performance, reliability, and enables new services such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Data Center of Excellence Since decommissioning the Justice Tracking Information System (JUSTIS) legacy mainframe, the Department has jumpstarted the Data Center of Excellence which manages the JUSTIS Hub. The hub empowers justice organizations with in-depth data analysis and streamlined workflows to make data-driven decisions about public safety and criminal justice issues. The full-fledged JUSTIS Hub will soon provide easy-to-use dashboards and thorough insights to criminal justice agencies in the City and County of San Francisco. Cloud Center of Excellence The Department is expanding its team of cloud architects and engineers to deploy cloud solutions for business partners. The center will reduce costs and increase operational capacity by helping to migrate processes and data to the cloud. This work simultaneously makes City systems more secure and resilient, bringing together constant improvement and diligent defense. The Cloud Center of Excellence is well-positioned to help other departments accomplish more with less and tap into cloud technology with DT Cloud Desktop in place of costly device refreshes.BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS140 CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE - TECHNOLOGYInformation Technology Support Nexus The Department is committed to collaboration across the City and County of San Francisco to expand digital services, validate election results, and secure enterprise applications.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sfcityattorney.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $108.9 million for the Office of the City Attorney is $5.5 million, or 5.3 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to new attorney positions related to the California CARE Court, cost increases to outside counsel expenses, court reporters and legal vendors, and a one- time workorder with the Department of Human Resources. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $113.2 million is $4.3 million, or 3.9 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to the increases in salaries and benefits and ongoing outside service costs. Major Opioid Settlements In May 2023, the Office helped secure a $230 million settlement with Walgreens over the company's role in the opioid epidemic for the City of San Francisco, the largest ever paid by a pharmacy chain to a local government in connection with the opioid crisis. The settlement will be used to fund programs and services to address the opioid crisis in San Francisco, including treatment, prevention, and harm reduction. In addition to the settlement with Walgreens, the Office has also reached settlements with other pharmaceutical companies and distributors involved in the opioid crisis. In total, the City Attorney has generated over $350 million in cash payments, benefits, and fees from the opioid industry through these settlements, which will provide the City a new revenue source to defray general fund expenditures and provide a reliable ongoing funding source. CARE Court The California CARE Court is a new system created to help those with severe mental illness who are not otherwise receiving treatment, and is meant to be a supportive environment where a person, upon referral to the court by a family member or law enforcement officer, can be assigned a case manager who will develop a comprehensive and holistic treatment plan. The City Attorney's Office will play an important role in the administration and success of the CARE Court program. The Mayor's proposed budget includes resources that will allow the Office to begin hiring CARE Court-specific attorneys to handle upcoming caseloads.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf-planning.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $59.3 million for Planning is $4.7 million, or 7.3 percent, lower than the FY 2022-23 budget. This change is due to aligning decreased spending with declining revenues, generated by deleting vacant positions, with no impacts to service, and expiring one-time project spending. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $56.4 million is $2.9 million, or 4.9 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is also due to continued expected revenue decline, and reductions to grants-related project spending. Updated Revenue Outlook The largest changes in City Planning's (Planning) budget relate to revenue changes. Given the past several years of slowing fee revenue, the Mayor's proposed budget adjusts revenue downward to align with these trends. While volume of cases reviewed has increased, it has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. As such, Planning is aligning its expenditures with updated revenue expectations to create a balanced budget. Streamlining Permitting and Application Review In alignment with the recently adopted Housing Element and the Mayor's Executive Directive on Housing for All, the coming fiscal year will focus on streamlining permit and application review by creating a more predictable and transparent process to approve housing.

Community Engagement: Housing Element Rezoning As part of the City's implementation of the Housing Element, the Department has committed to engaging with the community to have an inclusive conversation about the need for additional housing, solicit feedback on zoning proposals to create affordable housing, build community facilities, enhance economic development, improve urban design, support small businesses, and create community capacity, understanding, and awareness of the City's priorities and upcoming housing-related actions. As such, Planning will partner with the City's wide range of communities to hold community conversations with neighborhood merchants and other groups, host focus groups, conduct open houses for the general public, sponsor educational workshops to break down technical housing and land use information, and convene topical roundtable discussions to help inform decision-making. These activities will culminate in a series of webinars, open to the general public, where the Department will report back on how community input has informed the final zoning proposals.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/civil-service-commission The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $1.4 million for the Civil Service Commission is $0.1 million, or 4.5 percent, lower than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to salaries and benefits savings from vacant positions. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $1.4 million is less than $0.1 million, or 1.6 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to increased costs in salaries and benefits. The Department is committed to the citywide government operations recovery initiative to develop faster hiring processes for City staff and job applicants, make contracting less resource- demanding for City staff, and to use data to understand challenges and measure the impact of changes. Supporting the City's Workforce The Department continues to work closely with City departments in order to meet the growing demand for public service employees. The Department also supports the Mayor's initiatives of accountability and equity in services by conducting trainings, investigations, and hearing appeals. CSC works with hiring managers, employees, department staff, and union representatives when reviewing policies and current practices in addition to proposing rule or policy amendments to expedite and expand equity in hiring. The Department staff educates employees and union representatives to increase their knowledge of the merit system, impacts on City employment, and what employees TYPES OF APPEALS IN FY 2021-22.

CSC also works closely with the City Attorney's Office and Contract Management staff from other City departments to search for alternative methods to efficiently move forward contracts while maintaining transparency with the union and the public. Ensuring Equity in Hiring The Department is mandated by Charter to establish an equitable merit system to ensure the City hires the most qualified people for public service jobs. With the ongoing ability to conduct virtual public meetings, Civil Service Commissioners and Department staff have been able to build an even stronger connection with City employees and the public they serve. Department staff will continue to operate in this hybrid environment and find new ways to be more inclusive and further expand opportunities for City employees as part of the citywide government operations recovery initiative. Many of these methods demand an equitable lens (e.g. the Racial Equity Action Plan) that in return, diversifies the City's hiring process, creating a public service workforce that is reflective of the City's diverse communities.

OCII is responsible for development in Mission Bay, Transbay, and the Hunters Point Shipyard/Candlestick Point neighborhoods which will collectively provide over 22,000 new housing units and 14 million square feet of new commercial space; the management of significant assets in the City; and the development of over 7,000 affordable housing units and over 400 acres of parks. For more information about this department's services, please visit sfocii.org OCII is a separate legal entity from the City and County of San Francisco and does not rely on General Fund appropriation. Rather, OCII uses property tax increment authorized under state law. Accordingly, OCII's budget is considered separately from the City and County budget. OCII operates with an annual budget with expenditures approved by the California Department of Finance and required to complete enforceable obligations. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 proposed budget is presented here and is consistent with DOF's approval of expenditures dated April 14, 2023. The proposed FY 2023-24 budget of $717.4 million for the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure is $0.1 million more than the FY 2022-23 budget of $717.3 million. The FY 2023-24 proposed budget of $717.4 million is approximately equivalent to the FY 2022-23 proposed budget.OCII funds its construction programs primarily with bond proceeds generated by the issuance of tax allocation bonds. In FY 2023-24, OCII anticipates expending $151.0 million on its debt program, including bond debt service. The FY 2023-24 proposed budget includes three new debt issuances of $129.0 million, which will fund infrastructure in Transbay and affordable housing projects. The Department anticipates spending $331.6 million for affordable housing, $178.5 million for infrastructure, $2.1 million for community and workforce development, and $54.3 million for project management and operations, including a payment of $33.7 million to the Transbay Joint Powers Authority for the Transbay Terminal Project. Housing Obligations To build a more equitable San Francisco, OCII funds affordable housing that serves low or very low-BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS158 COMMUNITY INVESTMENT AND INFRASTRUCTUREincome households. OCII's total housing production obligation includes 21,927 units, of which 7,116 will be affordable and 65 percent will be funded by OCII. As of July 1, 2023, OCII will have completed 9,316 units of housing, of which 2,752 are affordable. These units are known as OCII's Retained Affordable Housing Production Obligation. In FY 2023-24, OCII will complete 148 affordable housing units in Mission Bay South and 77 units in Hunters Point Shipyard Phase 1. Land Use & Infrastructure OCII contributes to livability and vibrancy through its delivery of public infrastructure, including funding for parks and streetscape improvements that are required under existing enforceable obligations. At completion, HPS2/CP will include 326 acres, Mission Bay will include 49 acres, and Transbay will include 4 acres of parks. In FY 2023-24, OCII will complete 5.6 acres of park space, as well as a street segment, in Mission Bay. Community & Workforce Development OCII contributes to diversity, equity, and inclusivity through its equal opportunity program for contracting and workforce. OCII works with private contractors, CityBuild, and community- based organizations to foster job creation for local workers and to improve opportunities for small, local, minority and women-owned businesses to participate on OCII projects. To date, the Department has awarded over $5.7 billion in contracts with nearly $1.8 billion or 32 percent credited to small business enterprises. Of this amount, $973 million or 54 percent has been awarded to San Francisco-based small businesses. Over 49,890 workers, of which 7,401 or 15 percent are San Francisco residents, have performed 18.3 million construction hours on OCII-administered projects since 2012. Local residents have performed 3.5 million hours or 19 percent, garnering $154.7 million in wages. OCII'S TOTAL HOUSING PRODUCTION OBLIGATION.

The Department strives to be a model for good government and to make the City a better place to live and work. For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/controllers-office The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $84.2 million for the Office of the Controller (CON) is $2.5 million, or 3.0 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increased costs in accounting services and the addition of the new Refuse Rates division to the Controller's Office. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $84.4 million is $0.3 million, or 0.3 percent higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to increases in salaries and benefits offset by non-personnel savings. Training and Developing the City's Financial Professionals A highly qualified financial workforce is the backbone of the City and County of San Francisco's (City) financial operations. An array of technical expertise and experience is required to successfully manage and support the City's vast complex financial activities. In FY 2023-24, the Controller's Office proposed the expansion of its training programs to establish financial standards across the City and County of San Francisco. In order to address this issue, a pilot program will be created to develop and retain senior-level financial and accounting management talent. The program will prepare managers for accounting leadership positions and will expand their knowledge and financial management experience. This new program is made possible with investments from the Mayor's proposed budget to support staffing required to begin this initiative. A comprehensive training program on the City's budget cycle for staff with budget preparation and management duties will ensure that departments and central agencies gain professionals with a consistent and current training. Controller as Refuse Rate Administrator On June 7, 2022, voters approved Proposition F, which amended the Refuse Collection and Disposal Ordinance to restructure the refuse rate-setting process and membership of the Refuse Rate Board (\"Board\"). The Controller's new role is to serve as Refuse Rate Administrator, replacing the Director of Public Works as the party responsible for monitoring and proposing new rates to the Board. The Refuse Rate Administrator must present its proposals at public hearings to the Commission on the Environment and the Sanitation and Streets Commission before submitting proposed rates to the Board.

The Controller's Office continues to work with the City Administrator's Office and the Department of Human Resources to implement key initiative that support more efficient and timely City services to the public. The Mayor's proposed budget continues to support this initiative and invests $0.2 million in both FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 to hire for previously vacant positions. In the coming year, Gov Ops will continue to work towards further streamlining the City's contracting procurement and reducing citywide vacancy rates. 164 CONTROLLERalso consider all written objections and public input to the refuse rates and address them with the Board. Lastly, the Refuse Rate Administrator is responsible for monitoring the financial and operational performance of refuse collectors, performing studies and investigations, and advising the Board to ensure rates are just and reasonable, considering any applicable service standards and environmental goals established by law. Government Operations Recovery Government Operations Recovery (Gov Ops) continues to focus on improvements to the City's GROWTH OF FINANCIAL STABILIZATION RESERVES. The strength of the City's economy during the past decade, combined with financial management reforms, have driven improvement in the City's overall financial condition, which includes fully funding the City's economic stabilization reserves. In FY 2018-19, the City reached its reserve target of 10 percent of General Fund reserves, with an economic stabilization reserve balance of $588 million. In FY 2019-20, economic stabilization reserve balances are $537 million, which is at 10 percent of General Fund reserve when adjusted for one-time Coronavirus Relief Fund and Federal Emergency Management Agency revenues related to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FY 2020-21 budget included a use $156.5 million of the economic stabilization reserves, but a de minimus use was assumed in the FY 2021-22 budget while the City is eligible to withdraw $57.3 million per the voter-adopted 2023-2024 Target 2024-2025 Target Ensur e Gov ernment is Accountable t o City R esidents Count o f code r equir ed audits complet ed Percent o f audit r ecommendations implement ed within 2 y ears after repor t issuance.

This is primarily due to an increase in personnel budget to account for current staffing, new attorney positions, and an overall increase in salaries and benefits. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $92.2 million is $2.4 million, or 2.7 percent higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to increases in salaries and benefits. Combatting Open-Air Drug Markets The proposed budget includes funding for three dedicated attorneys to focus on open-air drug markets and drug trafficking throughout the City. The DAT has prioritized the prosecution of high- level dealers and are working closely with the San Francisco Police Department to file narcotics sales cases, and this new investment will expand the Office's capacity to address open-air drug dealing. Public Safety Services and Programs DAT continues to be forward-thinking in its approach to ensuring public safety and combatting crime in the 21st century. The Department focuses on ensuring that all residents and families thrive as they interact with the criminal justice system, especially the most vulnerable and those who have been historically subjected to discrimination within the criminal justice system.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sfdec.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $324.5 million for the Department of Early Childhood (DEC) is $50.6 million, or 13.5 percent, lower than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to reductions in commercial rent tax (Proposition C) revenues. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2024-25 proposed budget of $345.8 million is $21.2 million, or 6.5 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget due to Proposition C revenue improvement. The department will leverage both prior year balances of Proposition C revenue and new projected revenues to maintain programming. Establishing the New Department In FY 2023-24, The Department of Early Childhood (DEC) will be in its second year of operation. Through this budget cycle, DEC will continue its progress on building administrative and program capacity to administer Proposition C (Prop C) funds in support of young children and their families. This includes setting up merged offices, implementing a unified financial structure, and developing a single procurement procedure.Early Care and Education Programs The Mayor's proposed budget includes funding for early childhood and education, ensuring sustained distribution of child care vouchers to low income families, continued funding for the landmark compensation initiative for early educators, pipeline programs to support recruitment and retention of early educators, and child care facilities construction and improvements. These efforts are largely funded by the June 2018 Prop C that created the Babies and Families Fund, with revenues for early childhood expenditures totaling $360 million over FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25. Proposition C initiatives will support recovery of the local economy by providing early learning subsidies to families earning less than 110 percent of area median income (AMI) for infants, toddlers, and preschool aged children. These subsidies will allow more families to work outside of the home, increasing the number of available child care vouchers from 10,000 to 12,000 per year by investing another $3.8 million. BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS172 EARLY CHILDHOODDEC's budget also includes over $2 million to establish infrastructure to track programs and evaluate their impact. This will allow DEC to enhance accountability. In addition, DEC is providing funding to address inequity in early education. The Department will be funding targeted professional development opportunities to improve the cultural responsiveness of the early care and education workforce. Early Educators Pay Raise In April 2022, the Mayor announced a new initiative to invest up to $71 million annually to advance pay raises, increase benefits, improve working conditions, and support educational attainment for San Francisco's early education workforce. The Mayor's proposed budget includes ongoing funding for this program and earmarks another $60 million to ensure these funds are available as the economic outlook fluctuates, ensuring educators are paid more fairly paid for their crucial work, and also help attract new, quality educators to the field. This investment will continue to ensure early educators are more equitably paid for their crucial work and that centers and family childcare sites continue to attract new, quality educators to the field. Over the next budget cycle, DEC will expand the program from stipends and wage increases to also include funding for direct supports to educators to attain permits/degrees and enhance professional development. TEN-YEAR GROWTH IN CITY- FUNDED EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION ENROLLMENTS.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/ departments/office-economic-and-workforce-development The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $152.6 million for the Office of Economic and Workforce Development is $11.4 million, or 6.9 percent, lower than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to one-time economic recovery investments funded in FY 2022-23. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $124.1 million is $28.4 million, or 18.6 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to the expiration of one-time economic recovery investments in the proposed FY 2023-24 budget. Small Business & Economic Recovery OEWD is the primary City agency charged with economic recovery and revitalization efforts. The Mayor's proposed budget includes funding for OEWD to spark economic recovery, enhance the safety and beautification of key downtown areas, and restore vibrancy through activating and transforming downtown and neighborhood commercial corridors. This budget includes a total of $22.3 million over the next two years to promote the economic recovery of the City, which continues to adapt to the post-COVID remote work economy. Acknowledging that the last two years have significantly restructured the downtown landscape, this budget includes $17 million over the two years for OEWD's Economic Development Division and the Office of Small Business to continue to pursue innovative strategies BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS 9% 38%26% African American 13% Caucasian SF CONSTRUCTION WORKER DEMOGRAPHICS.

The Workforce Development Division connects job seekers in San Francisco, who are unemployed, under-employed or have barriers to employment, with job opportunities in growing industries. OEWD will continue to invest in Sector Training programs, particularly the CityBuild construction program, TechSF, Hospitality and the HealthCare Academy, as well as opportunities responsive to the local economy. The Department will maintain workforce development activities in sectors that are in demand, face staffing shortages, and have the capacity to provide significant career pathway opportunities and work with local employers to tailor the Department services to meet their workforce needs. for downtown's economic recovery and to ensure other neighborhoods' economic stability. This investment includes support for small businesses by providing grants to fill vacancies, renegotiate leases, and improve their business operations. Similar programs and capital improvements targeted along Powell Street will work in tandem with investment in the Street Vibrancy Initiative that includes streamlining the permitting process for special events, facilitating recurring outdoor activations, and filling vacant retail spaces through the Vacant to Vibrant pop-up program. The budget also includes funds for similar operations in neighborhood commercial corridors, with a dedicated fund for the Mission.

The Department administers elections and complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including the Voting Rights Act, the Help America Vote Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the City's Language Access Ordinance. For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/department-elections The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $23.0 million for the Department is $0.3 million, or 1.3 percent, lower than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to savings in salaries and benefits due to less temporary election staff need. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $26.4 million is $3.4 million, or 14.7 percent, higher than the FY2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to anticipated elections cost. These changes in both budget years are primarily due to holding two elections in March and November 2024, which may be among the largest and most complex elections in San Francisco's history. The three primary factors informing this expectation are: 1) the historically high voter turnout for presidential elections, 2) long ballots, and 3) correspondingly large Voter Information Pamphlets. Equitable and Convenient Voting Services In FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, the Department of Elections (Elections) will conduct two elections, the March 5, 2024 Presidential Primary Election and the November 5, 2024 Consolidated General Election. For each election, the Department will work to provide equitable and convenient voter services BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS for all eligible voters in San Francisco as well as the City's most vulnerable residents - including those who do not speak English fluently, people with disabilities, people involved with the justice system, and people experiencing homelessness. These services include a universal vote-by-mail ballot program, in-person voting, emergency ballot delivery to homebound or hospitalized voters, and ballot delivery to incarcerated voters. The Mayor's proposed budget includes funding to maintain public-facing aspects of these voting services while, expanding access to election programs for all voters and potential registrants. Voter Education and Outreach With two historic elections scheduled over the next two fiscal years, the Mayor's proposed budget includes the funding necessary to provide effective, equitable, and accessible voter outreach programs designed to build awareness of election services and encourage voter participation. Elections will maintain its outreach to the general public, which includes distribution of digital and print materials at community events, mailing of election notices, placement of news and radio 180 ELECTIONSBALLOTS CAST BY VOTING METHOD AND ELECTION. Implementation of Vote-by-Mail provisions has significantly increased the use of that method for ballot delivery since 2020. advertisements, and broadcasting of public service announcements, all in multiple languages and formats. With the support of the Mayor's proposed budget, the Department will continue liaising with local nonprofit organizations that work with San Francisco's vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations - coordinating with these organizations to help ensure that all residents have access to safe, barrier-free registration and voting options. Public Engagement with Elections Processes With the goal of maximizing public transparency and involvement in government operations, Elections will continue to work on raising public awareness and engagement with elections processes. Such engagement includes election observation, poll worker service, and participation in Voting Accessibility and Language Accessibility Advisory committees. With the goal of instilling civic interest and participation among the youth, the Mayor's proposed budget will maintain several programs designed to engage students in the High School Student Poll Worker and Ambassador programs. The Mayor's proposed budget continues to support strategies for engaging local populations and agencies with election processes.

DEM is the vital link in emergency communication between the public and first responders, providing key coordination and leadership to city departments, stakeholders, residents, and visitors. For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/department-emergency-management The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $138.8 million for the Department of Emergency Management is $2.5 million, or 1.9 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits, technology projects, and enhanced street response coordination. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $135.3 million is $3.4 million, or 2.5 percent lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to loss in one-time funding for programs budgeted only in FY 2023-24. The FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 Mayor's proposed budget focuses on enhancing core service delivery, and ensuring that all emergencies in San Francisco are responded to efficiently and safely. The Mayor's proposed budget proposes increases in the following areas: Improving 9-1-1 Core Services Ensuring that the 9-1-1 Call Center is fully staffed is essential to ensuring the safety of the public. Due to hiring challenges, DEM has not been able to replace the annual attrition of veteran dispatchers with new recruits. Through the recent hiring of a full-time recruiter, DEM plans to increase staffing levels in FY 2023-24 with 40 new dispatcher trainees for a total cost of $2.4 million in FY 2023-24 and $2.3 million in FY 2024-25. This investment, included in the Mayor's proposed budget, will allow the City to improve response times for emergencies. The proposed budget also invests $1.4 million in FY 2023-24 and $1.5 million in FY2024-25 for recently negotiated MOUs to increase wages for dispatchers. Expanded Street Response Support and Coordination of Citywide Initiatives DEM continues to lead citywide efforts in Street Response. The Mayor's proposed budget includes three new positions to coordinate the various street teams under San Francisco's Street Crisis Initiative, Department dedicated staff, and their stakeholders in order to more effectively serve the people experiencing crisis on the streets. Additional funding of $0.25 million in FY 2023-24 will be used to support the development of Drug Market Intervention (DMI) that eliminates the overt open air drug market and addresses the most serious community harms in the most impacted areas of the City.BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS184 EMERGENCY MANAGEMENTCALL VOLUME VERSUS PERFORMANCE. Service Standard v. Average Daily Emergency Call Volume.Improving Resiliency of the Citywide Data Center The Mayor's proposed budget includes capital investments totaling $0.9 million in FY 2023-24 to ensure continuity of operations for the City's Data Center. Projects include a power load distribution study to test critical electrical components, replacing end of useful life cooling units, and refreshing outdated electrical component panels of essential generator systems. Data Support for Public Safety DEM holds all the relevant data for emergency response and dispatch within the City that spans across all other public safety departments. DEM is responsible for conducting analysis on the types and quantity of calls coming into the 9-1-1 system, which enables the City to better respond to emergencies in a safe and timely manner. The Mayor's proposed budget includes capital funding for facility enhancements that help maintain these vital City systems. The City is also continuing to invest in the replacement of Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System. CAD systems are used by dispatchers to prioritize and record incident calls. Dispatchers identify the status and location of responders in the field, and dispatch responders to the scene. The current system was purchased in 2001 and is at end- of-life. The new system is planned to go live in 2023.

ENV implements change-making environmental policies and delivers programs and services directly to residents and businesses that help promote zero waste, protect human health, increase energy efficiency, prevent pollution, enhance biodiversity, and reduce personal vehicle trips . ENV also works in partnership with city agencies and the public to implement San Francisco's ambitious Climate Action Strategy, also known as \"0-80-100-Roots\" to reach net-zero citywide emissions by 2040 and strengthen community resilience. For more information about this department's services, please visit sfenvironment.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $32.1 million for the Department of Environment is $0.6 million, or 2.0 percent, higher than FY 2022- 23 budget. This is primarily due to new Federal and State funding and investments to support staff working on the Climate Action Plan. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $30.9 million is $1.2 million, or 3.8 percent lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is primarily due to the loss of one-time funding from FY 2023-24. Environmental Justice ENV manages several programs focused on improving access to clean transportation. ENV is currently administering funds to develop a plan to electrify medium and heavy-duty vehicles in the City and to install three electric vehicle fast- charging plazas. ENV will be leading an engagement process to inform this work and has prioritized outreach in areas like Bayview Hunters Point, a neighborhood disproportionately impacted by major freeways and vehicle congestion. Additionally, the Fix Lead SF program completed several residential retrofits to remove lead hazards from residential homes. Their learnings and best practices will inform the 2023 program rollout in southeast neighborhoods with high incidences of lead-hazards in households. Finally, ENV is partnering with a coalition to implement a Citywide electric bicycle (e-bike) program for app-based food delivery workers. The program will provide up to 30 delivery workers with e-bikes and collect data to evaluate the impact on efficiency, working conditions, income, and safety. Climate Action Plan The Climate Action Plan (CAP), released in 2021 with contributions from the Mayor's Office, Mayor Breed's Zero Emission Building Task Force, ENV, and other City partners details a data-driven, BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS188 ENVIRONMENTcommunity-informed, and people-focused plan which contains implementable strategies to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 while building a more just and equitable future. Along with work done by the Department, investments from the Mayor's proposed budget allow for continued work to be done regarding the CAP. In FY 2023-24, the proposed budget will invest $0.7 million to support current staff whose priority is to maintain and secure Federal and State funding relating to climate action. This investment continues into FY 2024-25 with an investment of $1.3 million from the Mayor's proposed budget to continue supporting these positions in the Department. In the current year, ENV has been working on creating new grants and programs to empower local communities while continuing the work needed to implement the CAP with an equity lens. An example of this work is the continued efforts to establish the Climate Equity Hub, a one- stop-shop with resources about decarbonization and support for residents and business owners to learn how to achieve the City's growing electrification and net-zero carbon requirements. While this process will take time, the investments from the Mayor's proposed budget guarantee ENV the staffing needed to continue various initiatives relating to the CAP. Climate Action in Small Businesses The SF Green Business Program (SFGBP) provides free technical assistance to help businesses save money and go green. To become a Green Business, businesses must implement best management practices in the areas of pollution prevention, water conservation, energy efficiency, zero waste, clean transportation, and employee engagement. The program offers rebates and \"prebates\" to offset costs. From 2020 to 2023, the SFGBP has provided businesses with $68,240, assisting businesses in conserving resources, reducing utility usage, and attracting clientele to the City's businesses.

The Department acts as a filing officer, administers campaign finance, lobbying, and ethics programs; advises city departments on ethical matters, conducts policy analysis and issues reports; and performs audits, investigations, and administrative enforcement. For more information about this department's services, please visit SFethics.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $7.2 million for the Ethics Commission is $0.4 million, or 4.7 percent, lower than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to salaries and benefits savings from vacant positions. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $8.6 million is $1.4 million, or 18.8 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to an increased contribution to the Election Campaign Fund. Election Campaign Fund The Election Campaign Fund (Fund) is established in the City's Campaign Finance Reform Ordinance to fund the City's system of partial public financing for candidates for the Office of the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors. The Fund was created by San Francisco voters in 2000 and enables eligible candidates to qualify for a limited amount of public funds in their campaigns. The Fund is capped at a maximum of $7.0 million. Annual required allocations into the Fund are based on a formula in the law of $2.75 per resident to ensure adequate program funding, with additional allocations required in the case of a Mayoral or Board of Supervisors vacancy. No more than 15 percent of the total budget in the Fund for any given election may be used for administering the public financing program. Ethics@Works The Ethics@Work division was created to ensure that City officials, employees, and contractors are equipped to navigate ethical issues. The program is developing multimedia and multilingual content to engage all City departments to establish individually curated training approaches, including overviews of common issues like gifts, financial disclosures, conflicts of interest, and the misuse of positions. Enforcement The Enforcement Division investigates and pursues penalties for violations of the laws administered by the Commission. This essential function deters future violations and establishes consequences and, where possible, remedies for past violations. In FY 2021-22, the Enforcement Division increased its size from four to eight BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS192 ETHICS COMMISSIONfull-time employees in order to decrease the time it takes to resolve cases, increase the number of cases completed, and allow for more complex and thorough investigations. This has successfully resulted in more timely and effective case resolutions, providing capacity to develop more advanced investigatory and prosecutorial techniques and processes.

The Fine Arts Museums' mission is to connect visitors with local and global art in order to promote their knowledge of and curiosity about the past, deepen their engagement with the art and ideas of today, and stimulate their creative agency in their own futures. FAM is further envisioned as a forum that stimulates community and visitor conversations and explorations by applying inclusive and equitable perspectives to collections and the histories they embody, and to support staff to realize their potential in an inclusive and equitable workplace. For more information about this department's services, please visit famsf.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $23.3 million for the Fine Arts Museum is $2.1 million, or 10.0 percent, higher than the FY 2022- 23 budget. This is primarily due to capital funding. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $23.0 million is $0.3 million, or 1.5 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is primarily due to reductions in capital funding. Exhibitions that Embrace Inclusive Narratives while Supporting Economic Recovery The Fine Arts Museums (Museums) offer a wide range of programs that expand knowledge and provide audiences with an inclusive and equitable lens on historic and contemporary issues. This inclusive programming supports economic recovery by welcoming an expanded audience to the Museums. The Museums will offer several major special exhibitions in FY 2023-24 covering a wide range of art and artists, including the following: Kehinde Wiley - A monumental new body of work created against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, and ANNUAL VISITORS.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf-fire.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $511.8 million for the Fire Department is $13.2 million, or 2.6 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increased overtime and increased costs associated with recently negotiated employee labor contract, offset by new one-time and ongoing ambulance revenues. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $526.7 million is $14.9 million, or 2.9 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to ongoing salaries and benefits costs related to the labor contract, offset by ongoing ambulance revenues. Hiring to Support Operations As the San Francisco Fire Department (FIR) emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and the City embarks on its recovery, FIR has undertaken a number of hiring initiatives to support the daily emergency staffing operations of the Department. Fire Department call volume has increased, and the Department is staffing to restore levels of personnel that were lost during the pandemic. The FY 2023- 24 and FY 2024-25 proposed budget funds Firefighter academies and two additional H-3 EMT/Paramedic EMS academies to support these initiatives. These academies aim to increase sworn staffing levels to pre-pandemic levels and to backfill positions to support front-line Fire Suppression, EMS, and Community Paramedicine services to the public. Recognizing the role FIR plays in key public safety priorities, the proposed budget includes new funding to support efforts to attract new recruits and retain those currently employed. In April 2023, the City agreed to a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) which adjusts salaries for incoming and existing sworn staff. The proposed budget fully funds wage increases of 7.75 percent for all sworn staff across FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, as well as a retention pay increase of 2 percent when sworn staff reaches twenty-one years of service.

Emphasis on Community Paramedicine The FY 2023-24 and 2024-25 budget continues the collaborative work amongst City partners on the City's Street Teams, including the Street Crisis Response Team, the Street Overdose Response Team, and the EMS-6 program. These teams expand the Fire Department's Division of Community Paramedicine and support the efforts of the Community Paramedicine Program to coordinate programs across the City and expand the resources available. Equipment and Fleet Replacement The Mayor's proposed budget continues the Department's multi-year Equipment and Fleet replacement plan.

The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $14.0 million is $0.1 million, or 0.6 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits.

For more information about this department's services, please visit hsh.sfgov.org. The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $690.3 million for the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing is $18.3 million, or 2.7 percent, higher than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increase in one-time state funding, as well as, increased spending on salary and benefits, and services performed by other City departments. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $660.6 million is $29.7 million, or 4.3 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to expiring one-time state funding budgeted in FY 2023-24, offset by increases in salary and benefits, as well as, spending on services performed by other City departments. Investments in the Citywide Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness The newly released, citywide five-year strategic plan, \"Home by the Bay: An Equity-Driven Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness in San Francisco,\" is built upon the three pillars of equity, quality, and innovation. The Plan calls for expanding HSH's housing, shelter, and prevention inventory and implementing new strategies to achieve a 50 percent reduction in unsheltered homelessness in the next five years with greater focus on equity, homelessness prevention, and housing retention. The Mayor's proposed FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 budget allocates approximately $98.6 million in Our City, Our Home Fund (OCOH) sources to implement the plan's goals and strategies, along with leveraging state grants and reprogramming $21 million in the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing's (HSH) General Fund budget to meet these goals. On a one-time basis, the proposed budget reallocates unspent OCOH funds to support critical investments in preventing and reducing homelessness in San Francisco. The two-year budget invests $46 million in new housing initiatives, $18.2 million in additional prevention strategies, and $34.4 million in additional shelter beds and shelter services. The investments include: 750 new slots of emergency rental assistance. Acquisition funding for Transitional Age Youth (TAY) and Family Housing in FY 2024-25. 75 new units of permanent supportive housing (PSH) for adults. 350 slots of rapid re-housing for adults. Capital funding for legacy permanent supportive housing (PSH) sites.BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS212 HOMELESSNESS AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING 60 additional shallow rental subsidies for families and 60 additional shallow rental subsidies for adults. A pilot program for TAY for a Bridge Housing model that provides shared housing with services for young people with high behavioral health care needs. 75 slots of problem-solving assistance set aside for Latine youth experiencing homelessness. Expanded money management services for tenants at PSH sites. Maintaining and Expanding Emergency Shelter The Mayor's proposed budget leverages OCOH, and repurposes General Fund and state grant funds, to operate a total of 3,656 shelter beds citywide, including reopening beds closed during the pandemic and maintaining capacity that was previously added with expiring funds. This includes the addition of 594 new shelter beds, while also investing in improved services and extended hours to accommodate more people. The proposed budget's shelter investments include funding to: Expand adult shelter capacity to pre-pandemic levels by adding 395 shelter beds at existing sites. Build and operate a non-congregate shelter site in the Bayview, a new cabin site in the Mission District, and continue 70 cabins at the 33 Gough Street site. Expand hours and services at family and adult shelters . Create a vehicular assistance program for people living in their vehicles. Add hotel vouchers for families needing emergency shelter. Investments in Staffing The Mayor's proposed budget also funds positions to ensure HSH has the capacity to execute the ambitious five-year strategic plan and to implement accountability measures to ensure that this funding is being used effectively. The budget adds 9 new positions in FY 2023- 24, and four additional positions in FY 2024-25, for a total increase of 13 positions over two years. This additional staffing will help build the Department's organizational capacity to carry out its existing workload and implement expansions funded in the two-year budget. The new staff will also fill gaps in essential functions across housing, shelter, and program compliance to achieve strategic goals. NUMBER OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS.

This is primarily due to costs related to negotiating labor agreements, hosting the SF Fellows program, and salaries and benefits. Other increases include technology investments to improve citywide hiring practices. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $150.6 million is $1.0 million, or 0.6 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to having no planned labor negotiations occurring in FY 2024-25. Human Resources Modernization Human Resources Modernization is an ongoing Citywide initiative to simplify hiring practices and provide tools to enable City staff to do their best work. The Mayor's proposed budget continues to invest in the Department of Human Resources (DHR) to continue advancing in modernization HR practices: Digital Records, Onboarding, and the Intranet/Employee Portal. These projects are unified in providing all City employees with a common human resources access point and experience. The Digital Records project establishes the base of employees' careers in the City. The Electronic Onboarding project will improve the beginning of EXTERNAL HIRES.

Fiscal Year Filings Negotiations The Employee Relations Division is responsible for negotiating all non-Municipal Transportation Agency labor contracts for City employees. It also conducts all required meet-and-confer sessions with labor unions under the City Charter and state law. In FY 2023-24, DHR will be negotiating collective bargaining agreements on behalf of 88 percent of the City's workforce covered by 34 unions contracts. SF Fellows The Department also hosts the annual San Francisco Fellows Program. This program serves as a talent pipeline and has delivered diverse recent college graduates into the City's workforce for the past 13 years. San Francisco Fellows support important analytical projects across various City departments. Over half of the San Francisco Fellows become part of the City's permanent workforce after they graduate from the program. In the Mayor's proposed budget for FY 2023-24, 29 Fellows are funded across 11 departments. Workers' Compensation The City self-insures for workers' compensation and is financially responsible for all workers' compensation liabilities. In the proposed budget, the Workers' Compensation Division will continue to advance its safety & health initiatives and partner with departments to implement the Temporary Transitional Work Assignment (TTWA) policy to improve Return to Work outcomes. Citywide workers' compensation expenditures in the next two fiscal years are expected to grow slower than previously anticipated with fewer claims since a COVID-19 peak. Career Center The Mayor's proposed budget includes funding for the new Career Center at City Hall which will help City employees access existing programs and resources that support their career goals such as City University and SEIU's work training program. In addition, the Department will launch and promote new career pathway programs, including a public safety pathway program and a health worker pathway program that support employees with upskilling, career exploration, and preparation and application support to apply for other City jobs that offer career advancement opportunities.

The HRC advocates for human and civil rights, and works in service of the City's anti- discrimination laws to further racial solidarity, equity, and healing. For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/human-rights-commission The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $19.2 million for the Human Rights Commission is $4.0 million, or 26.7 percent, higher than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to spending related to a new state grant, increases in salaries and benefits, and spending on services performed by other City departments. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $19.3 million is $0.2 million, or 1.0 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits. Dream Keeper Initiative Over the last several years, HRC's programming has significantly increased, largely due to the annual $60.0 million annual commitment made by the Mayor to the Dream Keeper Initiative (DKI) for citywide community engagement and grant- making, which is coordinated by HRC. Since the start of DKI, these funds have been allocated to more than 70 San Francisco-based organizations to provide direct services and programs to the City's diverse Black and African American communities. DKI programming has wide reach and includes a variety of direct services, such as workforce development training, educational assistance, down BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS payment mortgage support, home repair subsidies, preventative healthcare, case management supports, comprehensive wraparound services for children and their families, and spotlighting Black arts and culturally important programming.

OFA provides paid internships, mentorship, and career services to youth aged 13 to 24 from across the City. The program serves more than 3,000 youth each summer, and is a crucial support for their personal, academic, and professional development. OFA offers a spectrum of opportunities through placements at companies, community organizations, and City departments.

San Francisco also faces a persistent gap between the number of potentially eligible residents and the number actually enrolled in public assistance benefits like CalFresh and Medi-Cal. To maintain food security, especially among underserved populations, HSA plans to purchase a mobile office vehicle that will enable eligibility workers to visit different food distribution sites each weekday, enroll clients, and issue benefits on-site. Additionally, the Citywide Food Access Team (CFAT) supports community-based organizations that provide food resources centered on dignity, cultural relevance, quality and choice. CFAT invests in neighborhood-run grocery distributions, grocery vouchers, and meals in order to combat hunger and bridge the gap left by state and federal food programs. To date in FY 2022-23, CFAT has distributed 600,000 grocery bags, 180,000 meals, and 60,000 grocery vouchers. CFAT also supports food sovereignty The Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 proposed budget of $1.2 billion for HSA is $65.3 million, or 5.8 percent, more than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increased aid payments in IHSS and CalWORKs, increased costs in salaries, and increased child care spending in CalWORKs. The proposed budget includes IHSS costs reflecting the recently negotiated MOU described below. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $1.2 billion for HSA is $21.2 million, or 1.8 percent, more than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is due to increased aid payments in the IHSS Program, increased costs in salaries and benefits, and costs related to the relocation of HSA's headquarters at 170 Otis. In addition, the proposed budget in both FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 includes savings related to positions being held vacant and other non-personnel spending. Food Support The demand for food assistance in the CalFresh Program has grown since March 2020 and has not waned since the transition from the COVID-19 pandemic. Food insecurity will BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS224 HUMAN SERVICES AGENCYefforts aimed at ending food insecurity through community kitchens and other community-driven initiatives. These community-based efforts ensure that low-income San Franciscans have dignified access to culturally-relevant food through a diverse portfolio of strategies and across all districts in the City. The Mayor's proposed budget continues this vital work with investments of $20 million in FY 2023-24 and $10 million in FY 2024-25, as well as the replacement of five temporary positions with permanent staff in order to continue program, contract, and planning support. Family and Children's Services (FCS) Children's Crisis Continuum Pilot The Mayor's proposed budget reflects the award of $8.5 million in state funding to establish a regional Children's Continuum of Care Pilot that will enable foster youth in crisis to receive stabilization and long-term wellness services close to their homes and families. In collaboration with regional Child Welfare and Behavioral Health departments, FCS will establish a range of additional high-end programs and placement options that will support dependent youth with complex needs, increasing alternatives for them to receive targeted care in the least restrictive settings possible. In-Home Supportive Services The Department's In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program continues to grow due to the general aging of the City's population and state expansions to Medi-Cal eligibility. There is, however, a nationwide shortage of home care workers, which results in consumers not having a reliable support system. The City and its partners' ability to recruit and retain a workforce sufficient to deliver essential home care services to all eligible San Franciscans constitutes the central challenge facing the program over the next two years.The City - through the IHSS Public Authority - and IHSS independent providers (IPs) - through Service Employees International Union Local 2015 - have now reached agreement on a new 4-year labor contract, which will begin on July 1, 2023 and continue through FY 2026-27. This agreement will bring the wage for in-home care providers to $25.50 per hour by the contract's conclusion. It also establishes a training and education fund, enabling IPs to embrace career development opportunities, as well as offers caregivers a limited number of transit passes on a pilot basis. Despite the many challenges facing the City right now, this agreement provides a well-deserved lift to San Francisco's more than 24,000 IHSS providers, who perform vital supportive services for 28,000 San Franciscans daily. Contract Mode IHSS, which serves consumers unable to direct their own care due to complex health and behavioral issues, continues to be a critical service in San Francisco, especially among newly-housed residents in the City's permanent supportive housing system. San Francisco's Contract Mode provider has rolled out a number of recruitment and retention initiatives to meet the increasing need for services. The Department of Disability and Aging Services (DAS) will continue to work on strategies to address the shortage and ensure that care is available to those in need. Disability Community Cultural Center In collaboration with the Disability community, City partners, and service providers, DAS is currently procuring services to begin implementation of the nation's first City-funded Disability Community Cultural Center. The budget includes $680,000 from the Dignity Fund and State grant funds for a community-based provider to lead the continued development of the Center which will create a space for diverse people HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY 225CALFRESH CASELOAD BY MONTH.

Prioritize diversion and connection to appropriate services and responses at every stage of the youth's contact with JUV. Ensure youth are returned home as quickly as possible, whenever appropriate, and that families are provided comprehensive support. Maximize the utilization of community-based services that provide high quality care for all youth and their families.

This is primarily due to a decrease in one-time balances of state funding for the Youthful Offender Block Grant (YOBG) and Juvenile Probation Activities Funding (JPAF), and reduced security services at Log Cabin Ranch. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $45.3 million is $4 million, or 8 percent, less than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. The decrease is due to one-time sources in FY 2023-24 going away in FY 2024-25 and reductions in non-personnel services. Department Goals The Juvenile Probation Department (JUV) is guided by these goals, developed in collaboration with the Juvenile Probation Commission: BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS230 JUVENILE PROBATIONopportunities, power, and resources; that advances youth- and family-centered case plans and goal development to help justice-involved youth and their families thrive. Create a non-institutional home-like secure setting for both detained and incarcerated youth and young adults that is healing-centered, family-centered, community-connected, culturally responsive, and developmentally appropriate. Continue to organize and right-size the JUV department and budget to reflect changes in caseloads, increased emphasis on community- based services, and changes in approach and responsibilities, including Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) realignment duties. Advance the goals of the City and DJJ Realignment Subcommittee in the ongoing implementation of DJJ Realignment to effectively support the most impacted youth and young adults, both in the community and in the Secure Youth Treatment Facility located in Juvenile Hall. Juvenile Justice Landscape & Priorities In the prior year, the Department experienced a 46 percent increase in law enforcement referrals and a 25 percent increase in Juvenile Hall admissions. This coincided with a seismic shift that created local new responsibilities related to the closure of California's youth prison system. The Department is focused on maintaining staffing levels critical to implement juvenile justice system transformation, meet statutory obligations, and advance community safety.

This is primarily due to a decrease in office lease costs. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $1.9 million is $0.1 million, or 3.2 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits. Legal Resources for San Franciscans The Law Library's (LLB) priority is to provide professional, legal reference assistance and resources to the City's departments and agencies. Post-COVID-19, demand significantly increased for law library assistance related to housing, employment, discrimination, consumer debt, domestic violence, MUNI & building codes, health services, homelessness, and small business.

For more information about this department's services, please visit https://sf.gov/departments/office-mayor The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $196.7 million for the Mayor's Office is $23.4 million, or 10.6 percent, lower than the FY 2022- 23 budget. This is primarily due to due to the expiration of one-time investments made in FY 2022-23, and reduction in spending on contracts with community-based organizations. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $206.5 million is $9.8 million, or 5.0 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to increases in developer-funded, one-time housing investments. Maximizing Affordable Housing Opportunities The Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) continues to work closely with the City Planning Department to develop policy objectives that reinforce practices and programs in support of new affordable housing, housing preservation, and community stabilization. As outlined in the Mayor's Housing for All Executive Directive, MOHCD will continue to collaborate with agency and community partners to accelerate delivery of the City's affordable housing pipeline.In FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, MOHCD will continue to expand its new construction pipeline of affordable housing projects and expand the supply of permanent supportive housing units serving San Franciscans experiencing homelessness. Recent Notices of Funding Availability (NOFAs) will result in the acquisition of new affordable housing sites, capital improvements to existing MOHCD-funded properties, and new permanently affordable educator housing projects. Projects selected for funding under these NOFAs will be announced this summer. Significant efforts will continue with HOPE SF, the City's signature initiative to transform its most distressed public housing communities, directing considerable resources to advance racial equity by focusing on preservation of communities of color. For the first time since the initiative was launched in 2016, construction of new replacement housing is underway at three of four HOPE SF sites. The Dream Keeper Down Payment Assistance Program launched in FY 2022-23 made great strides in increasing Black homeownership in San Francisco and will continue with an additional $10 million investment in FY 2023-24. To date, MOHCD BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS238 MAYORhas assisted 22 new homeowners with 5 more in escrow to close on their first home. Additionally, the program is preparing another 190 Black San Franciscans for homeownership to utilize the FY 2023-24 funding. In the Mayor's proposed budget, the largest increase in FY 2023-24 is an $8.0 million housing developer subsidy from a Mission Bay housing developer to be used for downpayment assistance at Mission Bay South 9a. The largest budget increase in FY 2024-25 is a $17.9 million housing developer subsidy from a Treasure Island Development Authority housing developer. Eviction Prevention and Housing Stabilization MOHCD funds community-based organizations to deliver essential anti-displacement services to residents, including eviction legal assistance (Tenant Right to Counsel), tenants' rights counseling and education, tenant-landlord mediation and technical assistance, ongoing rental subsidies, and one-time emergency rental assistance. In FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, MOHCD will continue to provide guaranteed full-scope legal representation for all individuals facing unlawful detainer notices as well as continue to stabilize housing for our most vulnerable residents through financial assistance and subsidies as these communities begin to recover from the economic effects of the pandemic. MOHCD administers the Local Operating Subsidy Program (LOSP) which currently provides over 2,338 subsidized housing units for formerly homeless households, through a work order with the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. Approximately 258 permanent supportive housing units are under construction and are expected to be completed by June 2025, of which 152 units are LOSP-supported. Fostering Community and Neighborhood Vitality Community programs such as cultural districts also continue to be supported by the MOHCD budget. This program is designed to celebrate and strengthen the unique cultural identities of San Francisco's communities and currently encompasses 10 different cultural districts located throughout the city. MOHCD currently coordinates the partnerships with the City's 10 cultural districts that cover San Francisco's diverse neighborhoods and cultural communities, and will NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS COMPLETED.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sfmta.com The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $1.5 billion for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency is $81.6 million, or 5.9 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increased salary and benefit costs, non-personnel services costs, and increased capital investments. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $1.5 billion is $6.2 million, or 0.4 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to a decrease in benefits costs and non- personnel services costs, offset by increased capital investments and expiring federal revenues. Customer Experience The Mayor's proposed budget supports transit service that is a lynchpin of San Francisco's economic recovery. It invests in improving the customer experience for public transportation in San Francisco in a variety of ways, including increased budgets for car cleanings, signage, and transit stop maintenance. The SFMTA continues to expand transit priority lanes to increase system speed and reliability. Since 2019, the SFMTA has nearly doubled red transit-only lanes from 11 miles to 20 miles, with more expansions planned. The FY 2023-24 budget does not raise any fares, helping make transit a more affordable and attractive option to riders. This budget's funds continues the Free Muni for all Youth program, allowing all San Franciscans 18 and under to ride SFMTA services for free. Capital Investment The FY 2023-24 SFMTA capital budget is $388.2 million. The largest component is $143.9 million towards the transit fleet, which includes buses and Muni subway cars. The proposed capital budget also funds $32.4 million for replacement of the Muni Metro Train Control System, $67.5 million towards upgraded facilities for better maintenance, and $37.3 million for street safety improvements. These investments will improve system reliability and allow the SFMTA to support San Francisco's long-term economic recovery.BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS242 MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCYFiscal Cliff and Continued Recovery In FY 2023-24, the SFMTA is projected to use $247 million in federal funds for operating purposes to balance its budget. Remaining federal relief will be used in FY 2024-25, at which point it will be exhausted. After FY 2024-25, the SFMTA faces a projected fiscal cliff due to transit fare revenue losses and the Department's will need to identify new revenue sources and implement expenditure controls to maintain service levels. The FY 2023-24 budget invests in human resources and workforce development staff to help SFMTA fill vacancies. The Department's apprenticeship program is also being expanded to create new skilled labor hiring pathways. These enhancements will position SFMTA to maintain service for public transportation as the City continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/department-police-accountability The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $10.0 million for the Department of Police Accountability is $0.2 million, or 2.2 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to one-time funding to support Sheriff's investigations work. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $9.8 million is $0.2 million, or 1.7 percent lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to holding positions vacant and the loss of one-time funding in the prior year. Case Tracking The Department of Police Accountability's cases are increasingly complex and require additional review due to the prevalence of video evidence. The Department will continue using existing programs and resources to ensure that it meets mandated investigation levels. In addition, the Department is also actively investigating complaints filed against the Sheriff's Office until the Office of Inspector General becomes operational. DPA has endeavored to meet community and Police Commission expectations by exercising its charter-mandated authority to conduct periodic biased policing audits of the San Francisco Police Department.

The Department provides responsive policing through collaboration with the community, and works to maintain and build trust and respect . For more information about this department's services, please visit sanfranciscopolice.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $776.8 million for the Police Department is $62.8 million, or 8.8 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increased overtime, increased costs associated with recently negotiated labor agreements, and new Police Service Aide and Community Ambassador positions. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $787.9 million is $11.1 million, or 1.4 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to salaries and benefits costs related to the labor contract and continuing new positions, offset by overtime savings. Recruitment and Retention The Mayor's proposed budget includes expanded investments within the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) to promote recruitment, restore staffing to pre-pandemic levels, and promote public safety within the City. San Francisco has seen an increase in applications for Police Department academies over the last six months, and interest continues to grow. Seeking to capitalize on this momentum, the budget sets dynamic Academy class goals so that the Department is ready to start classes as soon as they fill, and taken together will total up 100 new recruits in FY 2023-24 and 120 new recruits in FY 2023-24, with the goal backfilling a total of 220 officers over the next two budget years. Recognizing challenges the Department is facing with recruitment and retention, the Mayor's proposed budget also includes new funding to support efforts to attract new officers and keep those currently employed. In April 2023, the City agreed to a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) which will adjust both entry-level and continuing salaries for incoming and POLICE DEPARTMENT END OF YEAR SWORN FULL DUTY STAFFING. Staffing levels continue to fall behind recommended levels as separations have outpaced recruiting.YearNumber Sworn In 100015002000 2023 (May)2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS252 POLICE DEPARTMENTcurrent officers. The proposed budget fully funds wage increases of 7.75 percent for all sworn staff across FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, as well as retention pay increases of 3 percent when officers reach five, seven, and eight years of service. Taken together, these wage increases make the City the highest paid starting salary for officers of large Bay Area cities (100,000 or more) and provide significant retention incentives to prevent the outflow of experienced officers. In addition to fully funding these wage increases, the proposed budget provides overtime funding support to account for the Department's chronic understaffing to ensure necessary deployment levels as the Department staffs up. Prop F Ambassadors The Mayor's proposed budget includes $2.8 million in FY 2023-24 and $2.9 million in FY 2024-25 to support expansion of the Prop F Community Ambassador program. Prop F Officer Ambassadors are a group of formerly-retired sworn officers who have been specially trained to build relationships with the community. They are assigned to specific neighborhoods and work to develop trust and understanding between the police and the people they serve, and are limited to a part-time status. This investment supports an additional 24,000 hours of Ambassador time per fiscal year, as the Department has identified and hired an additional 25 Prop F Officers in April 2023. Community Police Service Aides The Mayor's proposed budget includes $2.2 million in FY 2023-24 and $3.0 million in FY 2024-25 to support expansion of the Community Police Service Aide (PSA) program. PSAs are civilian employees of the San Francisco Police Department who provide a variety of support services to sworn officers. PSAs are not peace officers and do not carry firearms, but are required to wear uniforms and are an integral part of civilianization of the Department, allowing for relationship building within communities and faster response times to non-emergency calls. This investment supports an additional 22 PSA positions and 2 PSA Supervisors. Reform Sustainability and Transparency The Department continues its progress on the Collaborative Reform Initiative recommendations. As of May 2023, the SFPD has achieved substantial compliance in 245 of the 272 recommendations. The California Department of Justice has agreed to continue being the independent third-party monitor for the remaining 27 recommendations, of which, 19 require investments in information technology to progress forward. The budget continues funding to continue reform work; positions for Community Policy Working Groups to gather community input and feedback on Department General Orders or Department Manuals; and additional positions to support Public Records Act requests for improved transparency. Vehicles and Equipment The Mayor's proposed budget includes $4.5 million investment over the two budget years to replace vehicles of the SFPD's aging fleet, outfit existing vehicles with new technology, and provide state-of-the-art drug detection equipment to all District stations. Efficiency Gains Through Technology The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program has transitioned to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and will only accept incident data adhering to the NIBRS format. The proposed budget includes $4.9 million in FY 2024 to help implement a new NIBRS-compliant Record Management System (RMS). SFPD will have a modern RMS system that will reduce the burden of using multiple disparate systems and improve data reporting capabilities and crime data quality.POLICE DEPARTMENT 253Police Commission Assistant Chief Chief of StaffAssistant Chief Operations Administration Special OperationsAirportStrategic ManagementChief of PoliceDepartment of Police Accountability InvestigationsORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE: OperationsPOLICE Fiscal Year Goal2021-2022 Actuals2022-2023 Projected Target2023-2024 Target2024-2025 Target Improve Responsiveness Ensure the safety of persons riding public transportation (MUNI) in the City; offenses reported as per 1,000 riders Median Response Time to Priority A Calls (Minutes, Call Entry to On-Scene) Median Response Time to Priority B Calls (Minutes, Call Entry to On-Scene) Median Response Time to Priority C Calls (Minutes, Call Entry to On-Scene) Measure and Communicate Firearm seizures Number of 'driving under the influence' arrests Percentage of citations for top five causes of collisions UCR: Number of UCR homicides per 100,000 population UCR: of UCR Part I property offenses reported UCR: Number of UCR Part I property offenses reported per 100,000 population UCR: Number of UCR Part I violent offenses reported per 100,000 population UCR: Number UCR Part I violent offenses reported0.7 6.6 1,086 253 55% 6.2 46,568 5,323 49,372 5,642 610 5,3440.0 253 45,404 5,190 564 4,9360.0 8.0 1,159 48,138 5,501 595 5,2100.0 8.0 20 60Select a department from this drop down list POLICE 1,182 POLICE DEPARTMENTDepartment Total Budget Historical Comparison (Mayor's Proposed) Budget Year 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 Department Total Budget Historical Comparison POL Materials 94.94 11,091,616 Page 44 of 58TOTAL COMPARISON FUNDED POSITIONS2022-2023 ORIGINAL BUDGET2023-2024 PROPOSED BUDGETCHANGE FROM 2022-20232024-2025 PROPOSED BUDGETCHANGE FROM 2023-2024254 POLICE DEPARTMENT PORT 255PORT MISSION The Port of San Francisco (PRT) manages the waterfront as a gateway to a world-class city and advances environmentally and financially sustainable maritime, recreational, and economic opportunities to serve the City, Bay Area region, and California. For more information about this department's services, please visit sfport.com Additionally, the Mayor's proposed budget includes approval of new contracts to allow for maintenance of non-standard improvements at the Mission Rock and Pier 70 development sites. These development projects include unique improvements which do not meet the Department of Public Works (DPW) standards, and therefore cannot be maintained by DPW. The proposed new contracts provide for the needed maintenance at a savings to the City. Pursuing Economic Recovery The Port launched COVID-19 pandemic recovery efforts in 2021 and experienced early success with the allocation of up to $114 million in stimulus funding which provided an economic reprieve to the Port's operations and budget, sustaining a safe and active waterfront, and allowing the Port to support its tenants and drive new leasing. Actual FY 2022 results showed the recovery was well underway, with operating revenues nearing pre- pandemic levels and cruise passenger volumes reaching historic highs. In FY 2023-24 the Port will continue to focus on economic recovery, maximizing revenue from business such as cargo and cruise, seeking and investing in new tenants, revitalizing historic piers, activating waterfront neighborhoods, and The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $150.1 million for the Port is $43.6 million, or 22.5 percent lower than the FY 2022-23 budget because the majority of the $114 million of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) economic recovery stimulus funds received by the Port was appropriated in FY 2022- 23. The proposed FY 2024-25 budget of $151.0 million is $0.9 million, or 0.6 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to increased salary and benefit costs. Addition of Mission Bay Parks FY 2023-24 is the second year of the biennial budget previously approved by the Mayor and Board of Supervisors, and includes two budget items that were not previously approved. The Mayor's proposed budget includes funds to provide for the ongoing operations of select Mission Bay parks that were previously operated by the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII). State law requires OCII to dispose of their real property interests, including parks in Mission Bay which are on Port property. The Mayor's proposed budget includes approximately $1.0 million in revenue from the Community Facilities District in Mission Bay to fund annual operating costs.BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS256 PORTidentifying external funding sources to improve facilities, support resilience, and reduce its capital backlog. Waterfront Resilience Program In recognition of the need to address both seismic and flood risk, the Port of San Francisco has created the Waterfront Resilience Program and is advancing assessments, policies, plans and projects to reduce these risks as efficiently and effectively as possible. As of 2018, the rough estimated cost to reduce these risks for the three miles of the Embarcadero Seawall is over was up to $5 billion, with less than $1 billion in funding sources identified. The Port is now working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on a more detailed study of coastal flood risks and the strategies to address them across the full 7.5 miles of Port waterfront (as compared to the three miles of Embarcadero Seawall). The Port expects to report the projected timeline and cost of such measures during the first half of 2024. Initial funding sources include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), General Obligation bonds, and Port contributions. While advancing the broader resilience work with USACE, the Port has identified 23 potential Embarcadero early projects to advance into the design phase based on its extensive risk assessment work, including the Embarcadero Seawall Multi- Hazard Risk Assessment and the joint Disaster Response Exercise conducted with the Department of Emergency Management. These projects address immediate needs and improve safety along the Embarcadero. Pursuing Equity The Port will continue to prioritize racial equity in FY 2023-24. In the coming fiscal years, the Port will make equity a key aspect of daily operations pursuing multiple internal and external equity actions, including building a culture of inclusion through an active employee mentorship program, improved diversity in recruitment, and the addition of an ombudsperson to support employee development. External equity efforts include funding to implement a line of credit program for Local Business Enterprises (LBE) in partnership with the Treasurer Tax Collector, workforce development in partnership with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development, and efforts to attract more LBE tenants to lease affordable Port space.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sfpublicdefender.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $50.9 million for the Public Defender's Office is $0.7 million, or 1.3 percent, higher than FY 2022- 23 budget. This is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $51.7 million is $0.8 million, or 1.6 percent higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due increases in salaries and benefits. Providing People with the Tools and Support to Rebuild their Lives and Increase Community Health The Mayor's proposed budget includes $1.2 million of grant funding for The Freedom Project, which will allow PDR to continue administering post-conviction resentencing available under new legislation and evolving case law. The Freedom Project is dedicated to safe and successful post- release transition and post-conviction systemic change through ensuring every individual released is connected to housing, social services and ongoing, indefinite support. Additionally, the Project assists with other immediate needs such as cell phones, providing DMV vouchers, benefit enrollment assistance, employment referrals and more. This investment allows the Department to expand its indigent defense services for the City and County in client representation, including addressing Racial Justice Act violations, reviewing resentencing opportunities and parole suitability. The Public Defender strives to maintain this vital program so the Department may continue to meet the individual needs of its clients, their families and the overall community's need for a just and equitable system.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/department-public-health The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $3.2 billion for the Department of Public Health is $238.2 million, or 7.9 percent, higher than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increases in salaries mandated by labor agreements, new programs supported by opioid settlement funding, and state and private funding for capital improvements and mental health services. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $3.2 billion is $25.3 million, or 0.8 percent, lower than the FY 2023- 24 proposed budget. This change is driven by the expiration of one-time State and private funding that supported capital expenditures, offset by projected labor cost growth. Opioid Settlement Funds Through the work of the City Attorney's Office, San Francisco has now reached historic settlements with pharmacy chains and distributors for their role in fueling the opioid epidemic. The City has been dealing with the impacts of opioids for years, including the need for direct treatment and support for those struggling with addiction. The Mayor's proposed budget includes the first two years of the settlement funds, with over $100 million over the two budget years to address the devastating impacts of the opioid crisis. These funds will allow for the City to make progress in implementing the Overdose Prevention Plan released in October 2022. This evidence-based, equity-oriented plan aims to reduce fentanyl and other drug-related deaths, increase access to treatment for opioid use disorder (including addiction to fentanyl) and stimulant use disorder, increase social support for and reduce the stigma experienced by people at risk of overdose, and improve the community conditions in which drug use occurs. The plan builds upon decades of commitment and success by advocates, people who use drugs, and community organizations, whose partnership with the City is vital in this work. CARE Court and Bridge Housing Programs This fall, the State will begin implementing the new Community Assistance, Recovery and Empowerment (CARE) Court to connect clients struggling with untreated behavioral health issues with a court-ordered CARE Plan for up to 24 months. Under this pilot, Behavioral Health Service (BHS) will be responsible for the clinical evaluation of clients, who may be referred by a family member, health provider, or other community member with knowledge of their medical history. San Francisco has agreed to be part of the first cohort of counties implementing CARE Court, beginning October 2023 and has received $4.3 million in State funding for the first year of implementation. The Department must engage referred clients and, for those who are eligible, either reach a voluntary treatment agreement with them or develop a CARE Plan for review and adoption by a court order.

To support and maintain improvements gained through the recertification process, the Mayor's proposed budget supports 18 new positions in key areas including education and training for staff, patient care experience, medication management, and facility operations. Capital and Bed Expansion Investments through State and Private Partnerships The Mayor's proposed budget includes significant new investments in its Behavioral Health Services facilities expansion and at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital funded by the State and by private partners. The Department continues to successfully leverage outside capital investments to meet its ambitious goals for expanding capacity and improving facilities. These investments include: A $33.7 million state grant awarded to DPH to build new inpatient and outpatient psychiatric facilities for youth at ZSFG, which include 12 inpatient beds to up to 450 young people each year . An $18.3 million grant from the ZSFG Foundation for phase one of the build-out and additional improvements of the Outpatient Care Center, at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. When completed, all outpatient services will be centralized into this building, which provides 500,000 patient visits per year. Two different Community Care Expansion grants from the State: \u00bbOne of the grant is for $7.4 million, to be administered jointly with the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development, to provide operating subsidies towards leases costs and grants to licensed board and care operators towards the facility acquisition. \u00bbThe second grant is $9.5 million that will support the renovation and expansion of the residential treatment step-down site on Treasure Island. SORT POST-OVERDOSE ENGAGEMENT TEAM ENGAGEMENT OUTCOMES. The goals of the of the SORT Post-Overdose Engagement Team (POET) are to reduce the risk of opioid-related death of individuals who have recently experienced an overdose, contribute to an overall reduction in overdose deaths through referrals and care coordination with community-based organziations, and to provide support to people who have survived any overdose. PUBLIC HEALTH 267CalAIM Expansion for People At-Risk of Institutionalization and Justice-Involved People The State of California is continuing its multi-year roll out of California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM), a new framework that encompasses a broad-based delivery system, program, and payment reform across the Medi-Cal program with a whole-person care approach. For the proposed FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 budget, the focus is on the roll-out of expanded benefits to people at risk of long-term institutionalization and justice-system involved people exiting jail. As CalAIM focuses on stabilizing patients in community settings as much as possible, the enhanced care management (ECM) benefit allows for Medi-Cal to pay for hands-on support to address both the clinical and non-clinical needs of medically complex patients to keep them out of institutions. Health Equity Investments through the Mental Health Services Act The Mayor's proposed budget includes $32.0 million in FY 2022-23 and $17.7 million of ongoing in additional Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) funds. These funds will be used to ensure the continuity of existing MHSA programming; support new, innovative and culturally congruent services to meet the pressing needs of the Black/African American community and sustain a pilot effort to provide mental health support for Black mothers. New initiatives in this budget include $15.0 million for a three-year pilot from FY 2023-24 through FY 2025-26 with the Dream Keeper Initiative to create a talk therapy, telehealth program for people in San Francisco, with a particular focus on Black/African American residents. Fee for Service Transition In January 2023, the San Francisco Health Plan (SFHP) and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) expanded its use of the fee-for- service model to maximize revenues. By expanding the use of fee-for-service, ZSFG will recover more funding from the SFHP and the State, while maintaining quality care for its patients. DPH projects $36.7 M in additional revenues in FY 2023- 24 and $36.9 M in FY 2024-25 as result of the shift that is included in the Mayor's proposed budget. STREET RESPONSE TEAM. The goals of the San Francisco Street Overdose Response Team (SORT) are to reduce the risk of opioid-related death of individuals who have recently experienced an overdose, contribute to an overall reduction in overdose deaths through referrals and care coordination with community-based organziations, and to provide support to people who have survived any overdose. 05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,000 Clients Who Accepted Harm Reduction SuppliesCalls That Include Buprennorphrine StartsCalls Including an OverdoseCalls Handled by SORTNumber of Calls Types of Calls268 PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH 269PUBLIC HEAL TH Fiscal Y ear Goal2021-2022 Actuals 2022-2023 Project ed Target 2023-2024 Target 2024-2025 Target Ensur e Equitable Access t o All Percentage o f San Francisco R esidents with Health Cov erage Protect & Pr omot e the Health o f all San Franciscans Total managed car e program enr ollees in the San Francisco Health Netw ork, the City 's health syst em Number o f participants in the Healthy San Francisco pr ogram for uninsur ed residents Number o f childr en r eceiv e dental scr eening, fluoride v arnish, education or sealant Number o f new HIV diagnoses Percent o f HIV infect ed patients who ar e virally suppr essed within one y ear o f diagnosis Number o f complaint inv estigations per formed by the Healthy Housing and V ector Contr ol Pr ogram Percentage o f Healthy Housing and V ector Contr ol Pr ogram complaints ab ated within 30 days Number o f unique individuals r eceiving a Mental Health ser vice in the SF Health Netw ork Number o f unique clients under 18 y ears old in specialty mental health car e Number o f unique individuals r eceiving a Substance Use Disor der ser vice in the SF Health Netw ork Number o f unique p atients on bupr enorphine (citywide) Number o f unique Number o f Nalo xone kits distribut ed Number o f Deaths due t o Acut e Toxicity (ov erdose) Provide San Franciscans with W orld-Class Car e Average Daily P opulation at Zuck erber g San Francisco General Hospital Zuck erber g San Francisco General Hospital' s Occup ancy Rat e Percentage o f time that Zuck erber g San Francisco General Hospital Emer gency is unable t o accept lower-priority emer gency cases Percentage o f primar y car e patients rating their pr ovider as 9 or 10 ov erall on the San Francisco Health Netw ork patient a department from this drop down list PUBLIC HEAL TH FISCAL YEAR FY2021-22 FY2022-23 FY2023-24 FY2024-25 GOAL ACTUALS PROJECTED HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH 269ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE: PUBLIC HEALTH OperationsHealth Commission Director of Health Zuckerberg San Francisco GeneralCommunity Health Equity & Promotion Public Health Emergency Preparedness & Response Center for Learning & Innovation Center for Public Health Research Office of Equity & Quality ImprovementAmbulatory Care Environmental Health Disease Prevention Control Emergency Medical Services Applied Research, Community Health, Epidemiology Surveillance Bridge HIVBehavioral Health Primary Care Maternal, Child, Adolescent HealthLaguna Honda Hospital Managed Care Quality Management Jail HealthPopulation Health SF Health Network Whole Person Integrated Care270 PUBLIC HEALTHDepartment Total Budget Historical Comparison (Mayor's Proposed) Budget Year 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 Department Total Budget Historical Comparison DPH Public Sources Sources 11,975,000 2,600,000 Balance - 7,771.60 38.56 Uses - By Page 23 of 58Department Total Historical Comparison (Mayor's Proposed) Budget Year 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 Department Total Budget Historical Comparison Uses - By Division Description HJH Jail Health (25,294,614) Page 24 of 58TOTAL COMPARISON FUNDED POSITIONS2022-2023 ORIGINAL BUDGET2023-2024 PROPOSED BUDGETCHANGE FROM 2022-20232024-2025 PROPOSED BUDGETCHANGE FROM 2023-2024270 PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC LIBRARY 271PUBLIC LIBRARY MISSION The Public Library (Library) is dedicated to providing free and equal access to information, knowledge, independent learning, and reading for the community . The Library consists of the Main Library at Civic Center, 27 branch libraries geographically distributed throughout San Francisco, four Bookmobiles that travel around the City, and a digital library collection via sfpl.org . In addition to the Library's collection of over 3.8 million items in various formats and more than 50 languages, the Library offers high-speed internet through free wireless and public access computers as well as educational, cultural, and literary programming. For more information about this department's services, please visit sfpl.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $200.2 million for the San Francisco Public Library is $14.5 million, or 7.8 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits, and increased capital investments. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $186.2 million is $13.9 million, or 7.0 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to increased salaries and benefits costs, offset by one-time capital funding. Equity and Recovery The San Francisco Public Library (SFPL) is an essential resource for the City's diverse communities, offering an equitable and safe space for people of all ages to gather, gain knowledge, and participate in shared experiences. The SFPL is committed to advancing racial equity through its core services to the community. Equity investments include bolstering BIPOC representation in the circulating collections, which starts with Black and Native American peoples, and expanding Scholars@Home program to include the successful Summer Together and BIPOC Everybody Reads programs. The Library's budget also includes position changes to add analytical and clerical support to the department's overall racial equity efforts in Human Resources, and funding to expand bookmobile capacity to support least served communities. The Library's budget continues to invest in its successful Work It and Tech Time services, as well as the Smart Money Coaching program through the Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector. Robust Collections In addition to its focused collection development on BIPOC authors, the Library continuously enhances its library collections based on usage each cycle to better meet the needs of San Francisco's diverse communities in the future. The Library purchases materials in various formats and multiple languages to support the City's diverse BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILScommunity. Print books remain the primary material format for patrons; however, e-Media circulation continues to grow. Given the current budgetary environment, the Library will maintain $22.2 million allocated in FY 2023-24 and $22.2 million in FY 2024-25. Library collections investments over these two fiscal years are more than 12 percent of the Library's operating budget, which is above the industry standard of 10 percent. Digital Access The Library continuously refreshes its technology to meet the needs of San Franciscans. The Mayor's proposed budget includes obtaining a book scanner for the DigiCenter in the Main Library to allow Digitized books allow free public access to unique, rare, fragile, and/or high-demand materials - many of which are only available at SFPL - to researchers and curious browsers all over the world. Digital access expands access for patrons, and two other key digital access 272 PUBLIC LIBRARYinvestments this cycle include ongoing enhancements to the digital access management system that digitizing archives and virtual programming software and hybrid programming kits for the public so they can participate remotely in live-streamed or recorded library programming. The budget also includes new positions to expand the Media Services capacity to support public programming and implement lessons learned while delivering programming through the COVID-19 pandemic. Mission Branch Renovation The proposed budget includes $3.0 million in additional funding for the SFPL's Mission Branch Renovation Project, which has been under contract since 2018 and will update and improve the historic library building in the Mission District.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sfpuc.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $1.8 billion for the Public Utilities Commission is $136.5 million, or 8.3 percent, higher than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increased power purchasing and power delivery costs for the Power enterprise. The FY 2024-25 budget of $1.8 billion is $3.1 million, or 0.2 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is primarily due to increased costs for salaries and benefits. The SFPUC has a fixed 2-year (biennial) operating budget for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24. FY 2023-24 represents the second year of the fixed biennial budget, and as such only critical changes are proposed. FY 2024-25 represents a \"rollover\" budget with minor adjustments that will be revisited as part of the Department's next budget cycle. SFPUC's budget was developed based on the following three overarching priorities which continue to resonate through the second year of the fixed budget: Responsible Management SFPUC's budget is grounded in responsibility and transparency, with a focus on core service delivery. The SFPUC will prioritize financial sustainability, meet regulatory requirements, ensure public confidence, advance environmental stewardship, and maintain critical infrastructure. Some examples of this in the FY 2023-24 budget include: Through the Mayor's proposed budget, the Department is continuing to work on the acquisition of PG&E's San Francisco electricity distribution network that will enable the SFPUC to directly provide electricity that is more cost-effective, cleaner, and more reliable.BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS USES BY ENTERPRISE. Uses of funds broken down into the SFPUC's enterprises. 38% Water 24% 2023-24 budget includes new funding to run the Westside Recycled Water plant, which will begin operations in late 2023. The plant will provide up to two million gallons per day of recycled water to Golden Gate Park, Lincoln Park Golf Course, and other landscaped areas for irrigation. Access and Affordability The SFPUC's new Water and Wastewater rate structure will begin in FY 2023-24. Wastewater rates will include a new stormwater charge that will more fairly bill customers based on their property's stormwater runoff and the resulting impact on the City's combined sewer system. The SFPUC is committed to ensuring rate fairness and affordability for its customers, and the projected utility rates meet the Department's approved affordability level of service goal that the average combined water and wastewater bill remain under 2.5 percent of Median Household Income. The department has also undertaken a significant effort to reduce its operating costs, including prioritizing and constraining its 10-Year Capital Plan, leading to over a billion dollars in savings. In addition, the department has been successful in applying for low-interest state and federal loans resulting in an estimated $1.4 billion in savings in contrast to issuing bonds in FY 2023-24.People and Communities One of the most visible and meaningful ways SFPUC will contribute to the recovery of the economy and restoring the vibrancy of San Francisco will be through its capital program, which will invest approximately $1.4 billion dollars in FY 2023-24 and $8.8 billion over the next 10 years. These investments will support local jobs and businesses while improving the City's essential utility infrastructure. SFPUC's largest investment in FY 2023-24 is in upgrading the Southeast Treatment Plant, located in the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, which was built in 1952 and represents 1940s technology and facilities operating well beyond their useful lives. These upgrades include the New Biosolids Digester Facilities, replacement of the headworks (where the flow enters the plant), structural and seismic retrofits, as well as odor control improvements, and architectural and landscape improvements to the perimeter that will benefit the local community. Nearby, the new Southeast Community Center at 1550 Evans Avenue recently opened for community use and enjoyment. The Center features a childcare center, nonprofit workspace, community meeting rooms and provides a wide range of workforce development and educational opportunities for Southeast San Francisco residents of all ages.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sfpublicworks.org 278 PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONClean Streets and Graffiti Removal The proposed budget includes increased funds for DPW's Operations Division to enhance street cleaning operations. This includes expanded deployment of cleaning crews to neighborhoods across the City to power wash sidewalks, remove litter and debris, and sweep gutters while the Department continues participation in daily joint operations with City departments in the Tenderloin. Along with fostering street and sidewalk cleanliness, The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $452.9 million for the Department of Public Works (DPW) is $1.9 million, or 0.4 percent, higher than the FY 2022-23 budgets of DPW and the Department of Sanitation and Streets (SAS) combined. This is primarily due increased funding for street cleaning operations and other core services offset by administrative cost reductions from the recombination of DPW and SAS. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $407.6 million is $45.2 million, or 10.0 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is primarily due to reductions in capital project funding. Proposition B In November 2022, 75 percent of San Francisco voters approved Proposition B, returning all components of the Department of Sanitation and Streets back within Public Works. This reversed the 2020 ballot measure (also labeled Proposition B) that created SAS by separating out DPW's Operations Division as a standalone department. The savings from reduced administrative costs will enable DPW to increase funding for more direct services, such as graffiti abatement, sidewalk steam cleaning, and street cleaning and repair, in coordination with the Department's engineering, architecture, building repair, and street tree care functions.

Launched in December 2022, this program relieves participating property owners and businesses of the financial burdens of removing tags from their buildings, and letting professional Public Works crews or City contractors wipe out graffiti. During its first three months, more than 400 property and business owners signed up for the program, with a turn-around time of less than a week for the reported tags to be removed. Sidewalk Vending Permits and Enforcement DPW's Bureau of Street-use and Mapping implemented the new Street Vending Permit program launched in September 2022, enabling legitimate street vendors to operate, while keeping streets and sidewalks accessible and free of hazards. Along with ensuring continued access to BART stations, Muni stops, shops, and restaurants, the program discourages the sale of stolen goods through enforcement by DPW inspectors. Since beginning the program, DPW has issued more than 120 low-cost or no-cost permits for vendors in the Mission, Downtown, Chinatown, the Haight, North Beach, and the Inner Richmond. Curb Ramps, Tree Planting and Street Resurfacing Programs The Department's programs, including curb ramps, tree planting, and street resurfacing, have developed prioritization criteria that incorporate geographic equity to extend improvements to all of San Francisco's neighborhoods. The curb ramp program, in coordination with the Mayor's Office on Disability, prioritizes locations most requested by people with disabilities; the tree planting program focuses on areas where there is lower tree canopy cover; the street resurfacing program is prioritized based on a specific street's regionally tracked Pavement Condition Index score. 050,000100,000150,000200,000 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014Number of RecordsPacker Truck Steamer - all Street Cleaning Fiscal YearANNUAL STREET CLEANING SERVICE ORDER VOLUME BY PROBLEM DESCRIPTION.

REC maintains more than 220 parks, playgrounds, and open spaces . These include Camp Mather, the Marina Yacht Harbor, six municipal golf courses, and other recreational facilities and urban forestry areas. For more information about this department's services, please visit sfrecpark.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $256.5 million for the Recreation and Parks Department is $15.2 million, or 6.3 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to funding of new park rangers, increased capital investments, and an increase in salaries and benefits. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $261.2 million is $4.7 million, or 1.8 percent, higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is due to increases in salaries and benefits. New Park Rangers The Mayor's proposed budget includes funding for an additional eight Park Rangers to staff the Park Ranger Unit. The Park Ranger Unit is responsible for providing law enforcement, safety, and environmental protection services in San Francisco's parks and open spaces, and will further the City's mission to provide safe and clean parks and open spaces for all San Franciscans. The additional funding expands capacity of the Park Ranger Unit to 101.2 positions in FY 2023-24 and to 103.5 in FY 17 percent from FY 2022-23 levels.Expanding Requity's Reach to Bolster Equity The Requity program brings free, engaging, and culturally relevant recreation programming to youth under 18 living in shelters, foster care, public housing, or housing developments assisted by the City through the Mayor's Office of Housing & Community Development (MOHCD). REC seeks to expand Requity's reach in vulnerable communities and enhance programming. In this proposed budget, $123,594 of Requity funding will be used for the Bayview Safety Swim and Splash program, which is a program of the India Basin Waterfront Park Initiative, and $124,000 will be used to fund a Recreation Coordinator for Margaret Hayward Clubhouse. Another $40,000 will fund the expansion of Junior Warriors for an additional 40 teams to accommodate high demand. Staffing to Support the Delivery of the 2020 Health and Recovery Bond The proposed budget adds four off-budget finance positions to support capital and planning's delivery of the 2020 Health and Recovery Bond. BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS286 RECREATION AND PARKSThis major initiative is an expansion of REC's roles and responsibilities in the accounting of large bond project work. Funded with bond revenue, these positions will lead capital project contract procurement and invoice processing work. Preparing for Mission Bay Parks REC is preparing for a transfer of Mission Bay Parks from the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII) on July 1, 2023. This proposed budget includes an additional 3.5 FTEs and funding for utilities and facilities maintenance.Equity Remains a Primary Focus of the Department REC will continue providing critical equity programming, such as Requity, Peace Parks, the Tennis Learning Center (TLC), and discounted Camp Mather fees. Peace Parks promote community wellness and violence prevention in vulnerable communities. TLC provides tutoring, tennis instruction, and other support services for 100 underserved elementary students annually. REC also provides discounts for eligible residents at Camp Mather and engages inner-city youth through the Teen Outdoor Experience program.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sf.gov/departments/ rent-board Expansion of Equity in Services and Programming As part of its ongoing commitment to racial equity, the Board continues to implement and regularly evaluate its comprehensive Racial Equity Action Plan initiatives. RNT is committed to an equitable and inclusive workplace and is hiring an analyst to coordinate its racial equity work. The Board will improve core service delivery by having broader race representation among its employees and actively working to ensure staff have the tools and resources to be effective. The Board continues to focus an equity lens on Housing Inventory implementation to collect concrete data to better inform the local housing landscape and to provide targeted Inventory and Fee-related outreach to small property owners in Chinese, Spanish, and Filipino. RNT is growing its Public Information Unit and reevaluating its core service priorities, grounding racial equity and shifting from its traditional model of services to landlords or tenants in the aggregate, which can hide problems and trends in vulnerable populations. The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $17.7 million for the Rent Arbitration Board is $1.4 million, or 8.8 percent, higher than FY 2022-23 budget. This is due to one-time costs from office space updates and increased benefits costs. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $14.7 million is $3.0 million, or 16.8 percent lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is primarily due to the one-time costs from the prior year and changes in salaries and benefits. Citywide Residential Housing Inventory Recent legislation requires owners of approximately 291,000 residential housing units to report to the Rent Board certain information regarding each unit's occupancies and vacancies. This information is now maintained in a Housing Inventory of all units in the City, and licenses are issued to owners so they may impose annual and/or banked rent increases. To manage this responsibility, RNT has created an Inventory and Fee Unit and collaborates with the SF311 Customer Service Center to serve residents' needs more quickly. BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS290 RENT ARBITRATION BOARDModernization and Improved Data Sharing RNT is undertaking a business process workflow modernization project to provide more efficient services to the public. During the COVID-19 pandemic, RNT implemented a new call center, and began accepting filings by email, conducting remote hearings, and using a contactless online platform for the public to make fee payments and request 55,000 fee exemptions. The Board continues to streamline and standardize its data-sharing practices with other City departments and increase its effectiveness by providing timely data and documents, which helps expedite permitting and decision-making processes.

In recent years, the Retirement System has partnered with the City's Deferred Compensation Plan to provide a more coordinated approach to employee outreach on the importance of taking advantage of retirement and savings programs offered by the City.

Operational Risk Management and Quality Assurance The Department is building a comprehensive operational risk management program to measure and report on operational risk issues related to calculating and paying out more than $1.7 billion in retirement benefits each year. The systematic review and audit of business processes used in calculating and paying benefits ensures the integrity and financial soundness of the SFERS pension trust. Support a Qualified and Diverse Workforce SFERS' Racial Equity Plan involves removing barriers to successful recruitment and retention of qualified department staff with diverse educational and life experience throughout the department. To develop and support a qualified and diverse workforce, SFERS is building out an internship program in both the Retirement Services Division and the Investment Division. Build Career Pathways The Department has had a long-standing challenge of recruiting and retaining staff, particularly in its retirement services division, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department is proposing a strategic restructuring of certain retirement operations and business services positions to remove recruitment and retention barriers and more closely align the required skills and experience for these positions to the long-term needs of the Department. $0$5$10$15$20$25$30$35$40 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017Value in $ Billions Fiscal YearPLAN NET POSITION AS OF JUNE 30, 2022 ($ BILLIONS).

The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $2.3 million for the Sheriff's Department of Accountability is $0.2 million, or 9.9 percent, lower than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to anticipated vacancies in the department as it becomes operational. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $2.2 million is $0.02 million, or 0.8 percent lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget due to slight changes in salaries and benefits. Creating the Sheriff's Department of Accountability In November 2020, voters passed Proposition D, a charter amendment that created the Sheriff's Department Oversight Board. (SDOB). In addition, the Sheriff's Department of Accountability (SDA) was created under SDOB to review and investigate complaints. After conducting and finalizing investigations SDA makes final recommendations for disciplinary action. The department is currently in the process of becoming operational and has very minimal staff. The Sheriff's Department Oversight Board (SDOB), which, aims to appoint a department head, referred to as the Inspector General, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24. The proposed budget for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24 includes all required costs that are outlined in Proposition D. Once the Department is operationalized, the Inspector General will determine any additional budget changes required to meet the needs of the community. The Board is actively engaged in identifying candidates and expects to hire for the position before the end of the 2023 calendar year. Once a candidate is chosen, the department head will lead in the hiring of other key roles within the Department to begin investigations. The Inspector General will set performance measures when appointed. Since 2019, the Department of Police Accountability (DPA) has performed all independent oversight investigative functions for the San Francisco Sheriff's Office (SFSO). The DPA provides this service for certain types of serious misconduct allegations pursuant to an agreement with the SFSO under different parameters than those specified by the SDA charter.BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS298 SHERIFF ACCOUNTABILITYORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE: SHERIFF ACCOUNTABILITY Chief of StaffInspector General Executive Secretary Administration & Finance Community Engagement Legal/Policy Investigations298 SHERIFF ACCOUNTABILITY SHERIFF ACCOUNTABILITY 299Department Total Budget Historical Comparison (Mayor's Proposed) Budget Year 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 Department Total Budget Historical Comparison SDA Sheriff's Department Office of Inspector General Sources Expenditure Recovery 40,000 40,000 40,000 General Fund 2,471,812 Net Operating Positions 10.20 6.87 (3.33) 6.33 (0.54) Uses - By Division Description SDA Inspector General 2,060,179 1,807,137 (17,036) Page 53 of 58TOTAL COMPARISON FUNDED POSITIONS2022-2023 ORIGINAL BUDGET2023-2024 PROPOSED BUDGETCHANGE FROM 2022-20232024-2025 PROPOSED BUDGETCHANGE FROM 2023-2024300 SHERIFF ACCOUNTABILITY300 SHERIFF ACCOUNTABILITY SHERIFF 301SHERIFF MISSION The San Francisco Sheriff's Office (The Office) provides for the safe, secure, and constitutional detention of persons arrested or under a court order; operates county jail facilities, including educational, vocational, and transitional programs; operates alternative sentencing for in-custody and out-of-custody community programs; provides law enforcement services for a number of City and County facilities and the surrounding area; provides bailiffs to ensure the security of all juvenile, adult civil and criminal courts; and executes criminal and civil warrants and court orders. For more information about this department's services, please visit sfsheriff.com The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $291.7 million for the Sheriff's Office (SHF) is $7.5 million, or 2.5 percent, lower than FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to salary reductions from position vacancies and a decrease in overtime. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $293.7 million is $2.0 million, or 0.7 percent higher than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This change is primarily due to increases in interdepartmental services and salaries and benefits. Meeting Existing Staffing Needs The Sheriff's Office has ongoing staffing challenges, resulting in a demand for overtime to meet mandated minimum staffing requirements and maintain safety and the provision of programming. The proposed budget includes funding to meet the overtime needs of the Sheriff's Office in FY 2023-24. As the Office improves its regular staffing levels, the need for overtime spending will decrease. The Office of the Sheriff is aggressively and actively recruiting to fill the numerous vacancies in its deputy sheriff positions as well as its professional staff. Community Programs The Office of the Sheriff is increasing its law enforcement presence in the community, expanding the field officer training program, and increasing staff in the warrant services unit, which searches for, arrests, and returns persons with criminal warrants to secure detention. The Office continues to support victims of crime by funding the Survivor Restoration Program and assisting mothers with minor children by providing housing and services at Cameo House. BUDGET ISSUES & DETAILS302 SHERIFFThe Office is revitalizing its in-custody therapeutic communities, including the Roads to Recovery and SISTERs programs following the pandemic. The Office is dedicated to building community by providing a robust visiting program including video visits, in-person visits, and parent-child contact visits. The department intends to improve the physical environment for the visiting family members and children as some of these programs are decades old. Recruitment and community outreach are vital in advancing public safety and public trust. However, the Office struggles with the representation of women in law enforcement. This has led to its participation in the 30X30 initiative, a nationwide campaign advancing the representation of women in law enforcement with a goal of 30 percent women by 2030. Improving Organizational Accountability and Modernizing Technology Digital devices, cloud-based software, and data- driven tools are changing the landscape of law enforcement. By utilizing technology to improve performance, the Office can operate more efficiently. The Mayor's proposed budget continues to support the replacement of the current jail management case system. The new system improves City and County operations, while minimizing legal and security risks and improves cross-agency data sharing, which improves public safety. STAFFING PROGRESS.

For more information about this department's services, please visit sfwarmemorial.org The proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 budget of $37.7 million for the War Memorial is $1.2 million, or 3.2 percent, higher than the FY 2022-23 budget. This is primarily due to increases in one- time capital funding. The FY 2024-25 proposed budget of $31.7 million is $6.0 million, or 16 percent, lower than the FY 2023-24 proposed budget. This is due to the expiration of one- time capital funding and increases in salaries and benefits. Restoring Vibrancy Through the Performing Arts San Francisco has one of the most diverse artistic communities in the nation. As a cornerstone of San Francisco's performing arts community, the War Memorial plays a pivotal role in invigorating the City's economy and allowing communities to reconnect and engage with one another. The War Memorial and its resident companies such as the Symphony, Ballet, and Opera, as well as hundreds of outside licensees, employ a significant workforce year-round. The arts presented here consistently draw thousands of residents and visitors to the Civic Center neighborhood, indirectly contributing to important business sectors such as restaurants and tourism.

The City has gained national recognition among investors in municipal debt obligations as a high-profile economic center of one of the country's largest metropolitan areas. Investor interest benefits the City in the form of lower interest rates and lower annual debt service expenditures compared to other California cities. The Office of Public Finance utilizes five principal types of municipal debt to finance long-term capital projects: general obligation (G.O.) bonds, lease revenue bonds, certificates of participation (COPs), special tax bonds, and tax increment revenue bonds. The City relies on the issuance of G.O. bonds to leverage property tax receipts for voter-approved capital expenditures for the acquisition, improvement, and/or construction of real property such as libraries, hospitals, parks, and cultural and educational facilities. The City utilizes lease revenue bonds and COPs to finance capital projects and acquisitions, some of which provide a direct revenue benefit or cost savings to the City. Debt service payments for lease revenue bonds and COPs may be paid from revenues of the related project or fees, taxes, or surcharges imposed on users of the project. The City utilizes its commercial paper COP program to provide interim financing for approved project costs in connection with the acquisition, improvement, renovation, and construction of real property and the acquisition of capital equipment and vehicles in anticipation of issuing long-term financings. The City has utilized Mello-Roos community facilities districts and special tax districts to assist in the financing of public benefits, infrastructure, and community facilities. The City has formed Infrastructure Financing Districts and Infrastructure and Revitalization Financing Districts to assist financing projects, such as affordable housing, waterfront improvements, public benefits, infrastructure, and community facilities. These districts facilitate improvements to real property, providing in connection with new developments in the City .MISSION The Office of Public Finance is housed within the Controller's Office and provides and manages low-cost debt financing for large-scale, long-term capital projects and improvements that produce social and economic benefit to the City and its citizens while balancing market and credit risk with appropriate benefits, mitigations, and controls. For more information about this office's services, please visitsf.gov/controllers-office-public-finance BACKGROUND324 BONDED DEBT & LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONSRATINGS The City's G.O. bond debt is rated Aaa by Moody's, AAA by Standard & Poor's, and AA+ by Fitch. These ratings represent the highest or second-highest scores possible for G.O. bonds. The City's Certificates of Participation (COPs) and Lease Revenue Bonds are rated Aa1/Aa2 by Moody's, AA+ by Standard & Poor's, and AA/AA+ by Fitch. These ratings are one or two levels below the City's G.O. bond ratings. The City has no legal obligation or authority to levy taxes for repayment of lease revenue debt. However, the City may appropriate monies from the General Fund to pay for rent associated with the use of facilities that have been financed from lease revenues only when the facilities provide beneficial use to San Franciscans. MOODY'S In March 2023, Moody's affirmed its Aaa rating for the City's General Obligation bond debt, recognizing the City's exceptionally strong financial position and the outperformance of economically sensitive revenues through the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Moody's latest rating report, the City's stable property tax base and capable financial management team should insulate its G.O. bond portfolio from economic headwinds, including a high office vacancy rate and population loss. In the same report, Moody's affirmed its Aa1/Aa2 rating for the City's Lease Revenue Bonds and COPs. STANDARD & POOR'S In March 2023, Standard & Poor's (S&P) affirmed its AAA rating for the City's G.O. bond debt, ascribing the action to San Francisco's extremely strong levels of sustained income and wealth through the COVID-19 pandemic. S&P notes that although the City boasts strong reserve balances and a steady growth in assessed value (AV), high downtown office vacancy rates present the risk of continued declines in commercial and business tax revenues. In the same report, S&P affirmed its AA+ rating for the City's Lease Revenue Bonds and COPs.FITCH RATINGS In March 2023, Fitch maintained the City's G.O. bond rating of AA+, citing its strong financial management capabilities and ample resources to help bolster the City's spending flexibility as revenue growth slows. In the same rating report, Fitch also affirmed its AA/AA+ rating on the City's Lease Revenue Bonds and COPs. DEBT PROFILE Pursuant to the City Charter, the City must have voter authorization to issue G.O. bonds and lease revenue bonds. In the case of G.O. bonds, authorization is required by a two-thirds majority vote. In the case of Lease Revenue Bonds, authorization is required by a simple majority vote to fund new money capital projects. The City also issues Commercial Paper and Certificates of Participation, which do not require voter authorization. There are additional long- term obligations issued by public agencies whose jurisdictions overlap the boundaries of the City in whole or in part. See overlapping debt obligations described below. Of the $4.3 billion in outstanding G.O. bonds and other long-term general fund backed obligations, only $58.2 million or 1.4 percent is variable rate debt. GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS Debt service on the City's G.O. bonds is repaid from taxes levied on all real and personal property within the City boundaries. In addition to a two-thirds majority voter threshold, the principal amount of bonds outstanding at any one time must not exceed three percent of the assessed value of all taxable real and personal property located within the boundaries of the City. As of April 15, 2023, the total amount of G.O. bonds authorized by the voters, but not yet issued, was $1.3 billion. Of the total principal amount of $4.7 billion of G.O. bonds originally issued from these authorizations, $2.9 billion remains outstanding. Table 1 lists the City's outstanding and unissued G.O. bonds by series and authorization.

Long-Term Obligations The City's Long-Term Obligations, shown in Table 2 , include lease revenue bonds and COPs. Pursuant to the Charter, lease revenue bonds must be approved by a simple majority of the voters. As shown in Table 2, as of June 30, 2023, the City will have roughly $1.4 billion in projected Long-Term Obligations outstanding. The City anticipates issuing approximately $400 million of COPs in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 for Affordable Housing and Community Development projects, Department of Public Health Facilities projects, and Critical Repairs, Recovery Stimulus, and Streets projects. The City estimates this number will increase to $1.8 billion by the end of FY 2023-24. The gross debt service payment for FY 2023-24 is estimated to be $134.7 million.In 1990, voters approved Proposition C, which amended the Charter to authorize the City to lease-purchase equipment through a nonprofit corporation without additional voter approval but with certain restrictions. The City and County of San Francisco Finance Corporation (the Corporation) was incorporated for that purpose. Proposition C provides that the outstanding aggregate principal amount of obligations with respect to lease financings may not exceed $20.0 million, with such amount increasing by five percent each fiscal year. As of July 1, 2022, the total authorized and unissued amount for such financings was $95.3 million. There are no current plans to issue additional debt under the Proposition C authorization. In 1994, voters approved Proposition B, which authorized the issuance of up to $60.0 million in lease revenue bonds for the acquisition and construction of a combined dispatch center TABLE 2: PROJECTED OUTSTANDING G.O.

To date, $45.9 million of Proposition B lease revenue bonds have been issued and there is approximately $14.0 million in remaining authorization. There are no current plans to issue additional debt under the Proposition B authorization. In March 2000, voters approved Proposition C, which extended a two and one-half cent per $100 in assessed valuation property tax set- aside for the benefit of the Recreation and Park Department (the Open Space Fund). Proposition C also authorized the issuance of lease revenue bonds or other forms of indebtedness payable from the Open Space Fund. The City issued $27.0 million and $42.4 million of such Open Space Fund lease revenue bonds in October 2006 and October 2007, respectively. The City issued refunding lease revenue bonds to refinance the remaining outstanding amounts of the Series 2006 and Series 2007 Open Space Fund lease revenue bonds in August 2018. In November 2007, voters approved Proposition D, which renewed a two and one-half cent per $100 in assessed valuation property tax set-aside for the benefit of the Library (the Library Preservation Fund) and authorized the City to issue lease revenue bonds or other types of debt to construct and improve library facilities. The City issued Library Preservation Fund lease revenue bonds in the amount of $34.3 million in March 2009 and refinanced these obligations with the issuance of refunding lease revenue bonds in August 2018. COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM In March 2009, the City approved the establishment of a not-to-exceed $150 million Lease Revenue Commercial Paper Certificates of Participation Program (the CP Program). Under the CP Program, Commercial Paper Notes (the CP Notes) are issued from time to time to pay approved project costs in connection with the acquisition, improvement, renovation, and construction of real property and the acquisition of capital equipment and vehicles in anticipation of long-term or other takeout financing to be issued when market conditions are favorable. Projects are eligible to access the CP Program once the Board and the Mayor have approved the project and the long- term, permanent financing for the project. In July 2013, the City approved an additional $100 million of commercial paper for a total authorized CP Program of $250 million. The City's CP Program is secured by two revolving credit facilities. The Series 1 and Series 2 CP notes are secured by a $150 million revolving credit facility issued by Wells Fargo Bank which expires in March 2026. The Series 3 CP notes are secured by a $100 million revolving credit facility issued by Bank of the West which expires in April 2026. As of April 15, 2023, the outstanding principal amount of CP Notes was $33.2 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.26 percent. The CP Program currently provides interim financing for the following projects: Hall of Justice Projects, HOPE SF, Housing Trust Fund Projects, the Homeless Services Center, the Laguna Honda Hospital Wings Improvement Project, Critical Repairs & Recovery Stimulus projects, and Police Vehicles projects. The CP program has previously financed other various projects including 49 South Van Ness, the Animal Care & Control Facility, and the Moscone Convention Center Expansion. OVERLAPPING DEBT OBLIGATIONS Overlapping debt obligations are long-term obligations that are often sold in the public credit markets by public agencies whose boundaries overlap the boundaries of the City in whole or in part. In many cases, overlapping debt obligations issued by a public agency are payable only from 328 BONDED DEBT & LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONSthe revenues of the public agency, such as sales tax receipts, property taxes, and special taxes generated within the City's boundaries. Overlapping debt obligations of the City have been issued by public agencies such as the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII), Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the Bayshore- Hester Assessment District, the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART), the San Francisco Community College District, and the San Francisco Unified School District. DEBT LIMIT The City's debt limit for outstanding G.O. bond principal is governed by Section 9.106 of the City's Charter and is subject to Article XIII of the State Constitution. Under the Charter, the City's outstanding G.O. bond principal is limited to three percent of the assessed value of all taxable real and personal property located within the jurisdiction of the City and County of San Francisco. As indicated in Table 3 , the City has a current G.O. bond limit of $9.9 billion, based upon the Controller's Certificate of Assessed Valuation released on August 8, 2022 (FY 2022-23 AV). As of April 15, 2023, the City has $2.9 billion of G.O. bonds outstanding, which results in a G.O. bond debt to assessed value ratio of 0.87 percent. Based on the FY 2022-23 AV, the City's remaining legal capacity for G.O. bond debt is $7.0 billion. The FY 2023-24 AV will be released in August 2023 and will likely result in modest growth in the City's G.O. bond debt capacity. The City has $1.3 billion in voter authorized and unissued G.O. bonds. The amount of authorized but unissued debt is not included in the debt limit calculation since the limit applies only to outstanding bonds. Principal on previously issued bonds is repaid on a continuous basis allowing for additional debt capacity despite continued authorization for the issuance of new debt. Furthermore, debt capacity will increase or decrease as the City's total assessed property value changes. CITIZENS' GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE In March 2002, San Francisco voters approved Proposition F, creating the Citizens' General Obligation Bond Oversight Committee (the Committee). The purpose of the Committee is to inform the public about the expenditure of G.O. bond proceeds. The Committee actively reviews and reports on the expenditure of taxpayers' money in accordance with the voter authorization. The Committee provides oversight for ensuring that (1) G.O. bond proceeds are expended only in accordance with the ballot measure, and (2) no G.O. bond funds are used for any administrative salaries or other general governmental operating expenses, unless specifically authorized in the ballot measure for such G.O. bonds.Assessed Valuation (as of 8/8/22) $329,109,287,967 Less Exemptions (578,793,600) Net Assessed Value (as of 8/8/22) $328,530,494,367 Legal Debt Capacity (3 percent of Assessed Valuation) $9,855,914,831 Outstanding G.O.

The Committee, which was initially convened on January 9, 2003, continuously reviews existing G.O. bond programs. The Committee issues reports on the results of its activities to the Board of Supervisors at least once a year . Since the Committee was convened in 2003, the voters have approved approximately $5.6 billion in G.O. Bonds to fund various bond programs such as Clean and Safe Neighborhood Parks Bonds, Earthquake Safety and Emergency Response Bonds, Road Repaving & Street Safety Bonds, San Francisco General Hospital Bonds, Transportation and Road Improvement Bonds, Affordable Housing Bonds, Public Health and Safety Bonds, Seawall, and Health and Recovery Bonds.ENTERPRISE DEPARTMENT PRINCIPAL OUTSTANDING AND DEBT SERVICE Certain Public Service Enterprise departments of the City and County of San Francisco have outstanding revenue bond indebtedness that does not require discretionary City funding for their support. The departments include the Airport Commission, Municipal Transportation Agency, Port Commission, and the Public Utilities Commission. These departments have issued revenue bonds to leverage operating revenues to finance capital projects and acquisitions, many of which provide a direct revenue benefit or cost savings to the public. Table 4 shows the total estimated FY 2023-24 principal outstanding and debt service payments due for these enterprise departments. As of July 1, 2023, the Public Service Enterprise Departments are expected to have approximately $15.2 billion principal outstanding, with $1.2 billion expected to be issued by the end of FY 2023-24. The FY 2023-24 budget provides for an annual debt service payment of $1.04 billion for Public Service Enterprise departments bonds.330 BONDED DEBT & LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS44 CAPITAL PROJECTS 331332 CAPITAL PROJECTSCAPITAL PROJECTS CAPITAL PROJECTS 333THE CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS onesanfrancisco.org Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2005-06, San Francisco centralized its capital planning process by enacting legislation that required the creation of a multi-year capital plan. As a result, while departments receive funds annually for capital projects, the City strategizes, prioritizes and plans for capital expenditures on a ten-year timeframe. This process is guided by the Ten-Year Capital Plan (the Plan). Every other year, the City Administrator submits the proposed Plan to the Mayor and Board of Supervisors (Board), as required under Section 3.20 of the Administrative Code. The Plan provides an assessment of the City's capital infrastructure needs and a financing plan for addressing those needs. The Plan is a coordinated citywide approach to long-term infrastructure planning covering the City's General Fund departments, as well as enterprise departments and external agencies. Under the authority of the City Administrator, the Office of Resilience and Capital Planning prepares the Plan and presents it to the Capital Planning Committee (CPC) for review. The Plan is then submitted to the Board by March 1 for approval no later than May 1 every odd-numbered year. Following the Plan's adoption, CPC proposes a rolling two-year capital budget for consideration by the Board during the regular budget process. The currently proposed FY 2024-33 Capital Plan was approved by the CPC on May 9. The capital budget was updated on the following timeline: JANUARY 20: Budget requests due from departments APRIL 24: Review of General Fund department budget scenarios MAY 22: Capital Planning Committee approval of General Fund department budget MAY 31: Citywide proposed budget, including capital budget, submitted to the Board of Supervisors About The Ten-Year Capital Plan The City's current Ten-Year Capital Plan recommends total investments over $41 billion between Fiscal Years 2023-24 and 2032-33. The proposed projects address capital needs related to eight service areas: Affordable Housing; Economic and Neighborhood Development; General Government; Health and Human Services; Infrastructure and Streets; Public Safety; Recreation, Culture and Education; and Transportation. Table 1 shows how the Plan recommends investment across these service areas. The most recently approved Plan reflects a renewed level of investment in the Pay-As-You-Go program, with increased General Fund investment at $2.2 billion from $1 billion in the previous capital plan adopted for FY 2022-31. The COVID-19 pandemic and its related impacts continue to have consequences on the City's funding capacity. 334 CAPITAL PROJECTSThe loss of revenue for capital projects is made up by Certificate of Participation (COP) investments. The Plan anticipates $527 million in Certificates of Participation (COPs), also known as General Fund debt, over the next 10 years. COPs are backed by a physical asset in the City's capital portfolio and repayments are appropriated each year out of the General Fund. While the overall COP program is $238 million lower than the previous Plan, it makes significant commitments in the early years to address reductions in the Pay-Go Program and support projects to promote economic stimulus and racial equity. In addition, the Plan proposes approximately $2.0 billion in General Obligation (G.O.) debt over the next decade, up from $1.25 billion in the previous capital plan. Due to a historic number of successful bond measures over the two- year interim period, the City will be able to issue $1.7 billion in G.O. bonds to address critical needs in earthquake safety and emergency response, affordable housing, public health, homelessness and open space. As a result, there is significantly reduced capacity in the G.O. Bond program looking forward. Despite this reduced capacity, the FY 2024-33 Capital Plan incorporates $310 million for Shelters and Public Health capital needs, and $200 million for Shelters and Affordable Housing in 2024. Capital Plan Funding Amounts (Funding in Millions) FY 2024-28 FY 2029-33 Plan Total Affordable and Neighborhood Development 2,682 2,056 4,738 General Government 92 219 311 Health and Human Services 485 406 891 Infrastructure and Streets 7,123 3,360 10,483 Public Safety 688 276 Funding principles from the Plan that help establish capital priorities for the City are to: Address legal or regulatory mandates. Protect life safety and minimize physical danger to those who work in and use City infrastructure and facilities. Enhance resilience and eliminate racial and social disparities so that all San Franciscans may thrive. Ensure asset preservation and sustainability, i.e. timely maintenance and renewal of existing infrastructure. Serve programmatic or planned needs, i.e. formal objectives of an adopted plan or action by the City's elected officials. Promote economic development with projects that are expected to increase revenue, improve government effectiveness, or reduce operating costs . Capital-Related Policies The City's Ten-Year Capital Plan is financially constrained, meaning that it lists funded as well as deferred projects that are selected based on fiscally responsible and transparent policies. The FY 2024-33 Capital Plan generally retains most policies and practices set in prior year plans, TABLE 1: FISCAL YEAR 2024-31 CAPITAL PLAN INVESTMENTS BY SERVICE AREACAPITAL PROJECTS 335including restrictions around debt issuance, in order to meet key objectives such as: Growing the Pay-As-You-Go program at a rate that allows the City to address its facilities backlog. Funding Street Resurfacing to maintain a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) in a state of good repair with a score of 75. Prioritizing the City's curb ramp program and barrier removal projects to improve accessibility for all. Prioritizing regulatory requirements, life safety concerns, and the maintenance of current assets in order to reduce the City's backlog of deferred capital projects. Keeping property tax rates at or below 2006 levels. Funding critical enhancements to cover unexpected capital needs and emergencies as well as projects that are not good candidates for debt financing. Operating Impacts of Capital Projects The vast majority of projects in the City's Capital Plan and Budget address the needs of existing assets and are not expected to substantially impact operating costs. For those projects where a substantial operational impact is expected, San Francisco Administrative Code Section 3.20 states, \"The capital expenditure plan shall include a summary of operating costs and impacts on city operations that are projected to result from capital investments recommended in the plan.\" This operations review includes expected changes in the cost and quality of city service delivery. Such operational planning is a foundational component of the pre-development planning for the City's large-scale capital projects, and is included in the Plan whenever possible. In practice, because projects are often described in the Plan so far in advance of their construction, and even before pre-planning is complete, operating impacts are typically not available in detail at the time of Plan publication. More often, operating impacts are presented to the Capital Planning Committee as project plans come into focus. Departments present future one-time and ongoing costs of their projects to the Capital Planning Committee as part of the funding approval process. The Capital Planning Committee considers recurring salary and benefits costs, other operating costs such as maintenance and any anticipated recurring revenues to understand the net operating impacts of major projects. Considerations for the costs of stand-alone facilities include ongoing costs like staffing and utilities, as well as one-time costs like furniture, fixtures, and equipment. The near-term impacts of major projects are reflected in the projected sources and uses of the City's Five-Year Financial Plan, issued every other year. In addition, renewal needs and condition assessments for all facilities and infrastructure are modeled before a project is funded. These models are updated annually as a part of the capital planning process. Eligible Capital Project Types Capital projects funded through the annual budget are considered part of the Plan's Pay- As-You-Go (Pay-Go) Program. Debt-financed projects are typically funded through supplemental appropriations and considered outside of the annual budgeting process. Projects funded through the Pay-As-You-Go Program fall into one of five general funding categories defined below: ADA Facility Transition Plan and ADA Right-of- Way: ADA Facility investments are barrier removal projects on public buildings. ADA Right-of-Way projects correspond to on-demand curb ramp work. These dedicated ADA projects represent a small fraction of the accessibility improvements the Plan funds, as capital projects frequently include accessibility upgrades that are not counted as separate line items.336 CAPITAL PROJECTSRoutine Maintenance: Projects that provide for the day-to-day maintenance of existing buildings and infrastructure, including labor costs. Unlike renewals and enhancements, these annual expenditures are often a mix of capital and operating expenses, and they can be used for minor renewals according to department needs. Street Resurfacing: This funding is used to maintain a citywide average PCI score of 75. Critical Enhancement: An investment that increases an asset's value or useful life and changes its use. Critical enhancement projects include emergency repairs and improvements that address growth or other priority capital needs that are not good candidates for debt financing due to size or timing. Facility and Right-of-Way Infrastructure Renewals: An investment that preserves or extends the useful life of existing facilities or infrastructure. The categories of spending captured in the Capital Budget mirror those of San Francisco's Ten-Year Capital Plan and enable the City to chart trends, measure capital spending in terms of best practices, and report against the City's targets for state of good repair spending. Historical Capital Accomplishments The City's first Ten-Year Capital Plan was adopted on June 20, 2006, and recommended $16 billion in total investments and $3 billion in General Fund investments through FY 2014-15. Since its adoption, nearly all of the high-priority projects identified in the first Plan have been accomplished while planned General Fund investments have surpassed $5 billion. General Obligation (G.O.) Bonds and Certificates of Participation Prior to 2008, San Francisco voters had not authorized any G.O. bonds since 2000, which contributed to the City's infrastructure maintenance backlog. Since 2008, voters have approved $5.9 billion in G.O. bonds for hospitals, clinics, parks, police stations, firefighting facilities, public safety operations, transportation, streets, shelter and affordable housing. Recent levels of investment are higher than at any other time in the City's history. New bonds are only issued as old ones are retired and/or the City's base of net assessed value grows. This policy has ensured the repayment of these obligations without raising property tax rates for San Francisco residents and businesses since 2006. COPs, which are repaid from the General Fund, are another financing method used to address infrastructure projects. COPs are reserved for projects with a revenue source, such as the Moscone Convention Center, or for critical improvements such as those at the War Memorial Veterans Building and the Animal Care and Control Facility. These issuances are limited to an amount that results in debt service that is no more than 3.25 percent of the discretionary General Fund budget. Pay-As-You-Go Capital Investments The annual General Fund investment in the Pay- As-You-Go Program will be $59 million in FY 2023-24 and $59 million in FY 2024-25. These funds go toward maintaining basic infrastructure and investing in the City's assets including facility renovations, street repaving, right-of-way renewals, ADA improvements, critical enhancements and regular maintenance. In the five years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the City had an average General Fund investment of $144 million annually, however in light of the shortfalls caused by COVID-19, the Capital Plan recommendation was reduced. These shortfalls are being addressed through the issuance of $60 million in FY 2023- 24 Certificates of Participation to address critical repairs and street repaving.CAPITAL PROJECTS 337Integration of Impact Fees In the early 2000s, several planning initiatives to transform former industrial areas into new neighborhoods in east San Francisco were partially funded by impact fees. Projects funded by these impact fees include pedestrian and streetscape enhancements, transportation improvements, new parks, library assets and childcare facilities. The impact fees are managed by the Interagency Planning Implementation Committee in collaboration with the Citizens' Advisory Committee for each plan area. Projected revenues have slowed due to the overall decline of the developer project pipeline. Streets Program In addition to providing a safer and smoother ride for users, streets with a higher PCI score last longer and are less expensive to maintain, which results in operating savings in future years. A block with a PCI score of 85-100 is in excellent condition and does not require any treatment. In 2011, the City's streets were at an average PCI score of 63 and declining quickly. Since then, the City has made streets funding a top priority and, with the help of voters, passed the Road Repaving and Streets Safety Bond, which provided funding to increase the City's overall PCI score to 67. Now at 74, San Francisco is continuing to improve its citywide average PCI score with large SB1 investments from the Pay-As-You-Go program, complemented by General Fund. This will save the City millions on future street repaving costs, save Muni on vehicle repair costs and reduce citizens' annual car maintenance costs. Considering financial constraints, the Plan's funding levels for streets will maintain the PCI at 74 during the 10-year cycle. Recent Major Projects Since 2020, the City has completed or broken ground on a number of major projects, including: Produced 2,600 new affordable housing units through 10 groundbreakings. Completed the City's Housing Element, centering on racial and social equity. Completed Fire Station 35, an innovative new floating station berthed at Pier 22 1/2, funded through ESER 2014. Completed the Animal Care and Control replacement animal shelter at 1419 Bryant Street. Opened the Embarcadero SAFE Navigation Center and expanded the Division Circle Navigation Center. Completed seismic retrofit and modernization of Maxine Hall and Castro Mission Health Centers, also funded by the 2016 Health and Safety G.O. Bond. Achieved a citywide PCI of 74. All districts have had at least one-third of their blocks resurfaced since 2009. Completed the Salesforce Transit Center, with ongoing work to form a mixed-use neighborhood surrounding the Transit Center. Completed the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project. Renovation of the Bayview Opera House for greater accessibility and community use. Moved police staff into the newly completed Forensic Serices Division. Opened the Central Subway, extending the T-line through SoMa, Union Square and Chinatown. Connected over 8,096 units with free broadband internet access over the last 5 years. Modernization of the City's 100+ year-old sewer system. Improvements to the City's Emergency Firefighting Water System. Designed, constructed, or upgraded thousands of curb ramps to comply with ADA standards.338 CAPITAL PROJECTSThe proposed FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 budget funds capital investment at $512 million for General Fund departments over the two-year period. The proposed budget includes funding the General Fund Capital Budget Pay-Go Program at $59 million per year in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25. Due to ongoing capital funding reductions post-COVID, in FY 2023-24 the budget also proposes $25.6 million for a Critical Repairs Program and $32.5 million for Street Repaving - funded through Certificates of Participation. Additional revenues for capital investments come from non-General Fund sources, state and federal grants, impact fees, and other locally generated revenues. These revenue sources total $271 million in FY 2023-24 and $65 million in FY 2024-25.Capital investment is critical for keeping the City's infrastructure, roads, parks, and public safety facilities in a state of good repair and maintaining the City's service delivery capabilities. Highlights from the FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 proposed Capital Budget include funding for: Street repaving, pothole repair, and sidewalks. Critical repairs to roofs, elevators, and HVAC systems across the City's facilities. On-going curb ramp improvements and barrier removals for improved accessibility citywide. Funding for essential parks infrastructure such as fields, courts, forestry, fencing, and erosion control.CAPITAL PROJECTS 339 338 CAPITAL PROJECTSProject Project Title Activity Title Fund Title2023-2024 Budget 2024-2025 Budget 10016949 Sci -

The City plans, funds, and coordinates IT projects through the Committee on Information Technology (COIT). COIT is responsible for advising the Mayor and Board of Supervisors (Board) on technology matters and setting overall technology direction for the City. Every other year, COIT publishes the City's Information and Communication Technology Plan (ICT Plan) to proactively plan, fund, and implement the City's technology efforts to align with the Mayor's goals on equity and government accountability. The ICT Plan for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 through FY 2027- 28 was proposed by COIT in the spring of 2023, and the full plan can be found on the COIT website at sf.gov/coit . INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY PLAN (ICT PLAN) The proposed Five-Year ICT Plan presents a vision of government services that are available and universally accessible in times of crisis and beyond. This vision reflects the increased importance of ensuring the accessibility and reliability of City services that are essential to our economic recovery. The Plan outlines a path to coordinate technology investments, improve city services, and improve the resilience of our most critical systems. The ICT plan identifies three strategic IT goals: Online and Accessible City Services Residents Can Use. Integrated City Operations that are Efficient and Cost-Effective. IT Infrastructure You Can Trust.352 IT PROJECTSFY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 Proposed ICT Budget COIT recommends strategic investments in technology projects citywide. The FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 Mayor's proposed budget provides $53.9 million in funding for 14 projects for the two years, including: City Telecom Modernization Phone systems across the City are relying on aging technology and require replacement. The City will convert more than 35,000 phones lines from more than 100 telephone systems to Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP). Digital Accessibility & Inclusion Support COIT adopted the citywide Digital Accessibility and Inclusion Policy to ensure city websites are accessible regardless of disability and across languages. This project will continue to provide secure web hosting on the growing SF.gov site. Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) Replacement The City's CAD system is a tool for tracking field personnel of the City's police, fire, sheriff and other public safety agencies. The current system was purchased in 2001 and is at end-of-life. Cut-over to the new system is planned to go live in 2023. Human Resources Modernization The Department of Human Resources (DHR) is continuing to modernize the employee and job candidate experience within the City by developing an employee onboarding tool and e-personnel filing system. This work builds on the City's new applicant tracking system that went live in 2021, and will improve the candidate experience by shortening time-to-hire. Additionally, DHR will begin developing a \"one-stop shop\" intranet to improve the accessibility of key resources for employees. This project will facilitate organization- wide communication, increase employee productivity, and improve team collaboration.JUSTIS Data Center of Excellence The City reached a significant milestone in the JUSTIS project, completely retiring the mainframe and launching a new modernized court case management system that will transform and streamline case management and improve access and services to judicial partners and the community at-large. The next phase of the JUSTIS hub will provide a data sharing and analysis platform for the courts and public safety agencies. Infrastructure Modernization Over the past four years, the City has invested in modernizing network and data center infrastructure. The proposed budget continues the Department of Technology's work by improving resilience in the City's data centers. This will allow for rapid recovery of critical city systems in the event of a failure, such as a power outage or a natural disaster. Public Safety and Public Service Radio Replacement The Public Safety and Public Service Radio Replacement Project will upgrade the citywide radio communications system used primarily by the City's public safety agencies. The new technology will support over 9,000 mobile and handheld radios, with 10 city departments and four outside agencies operating daily on the system. New Property Assessment and Tax System The Assessor, the Treasurer-Tax Collector, and the Controller are replacing the property tax system in order to better support document capture, reporting, storage maintenance, conversion migration services, and management. Jail Management System The Sheriff's Jail Management System is at end-of- life and requires replacement. A modern, supported system will allow the department to more efficiently manage operations and increase accountability by improving data sharing between Sheriff and partnering City agencies.IT PROJECTS 353SF Cloud Expansion The City uses four central data centers to support daily operations. The Department of Technology seeks to enhance the provisioning and functionality of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform- as-a-Service (PaaS) services for city departments. In the next year, the City will provide departments with advice and expertise in platforms to optimize business functions and disaster recovery, and consolidate procurement of cloud services to achieve economies of scale. Empty Homes Tax In November 2022, a ballot measure was passed to implement a new tax on vacant units. It is effective January 1, 2024. The tax is unique in that property owners are required to file information regarding the vacancy of their unit; these owners are not normally subject to filing a return or being assessed on this basis. The tax is assessed based on number of days vacant with exemptions related to building permits, construction, and other factors per the tax. The new technology will support the creation of a database that determines the filing universe, filer requirements, and timelines for the new tax. The system will be an online and accessible form for taxpayers to file and pay. It will also provide effective customer service, including targeted taxpayer outreach and education. Legislative Management System The Board of Supervisors are replacing the previous Legislative Management System. The new system will better support City boards, commissions and other task force throughout the legislative process. The new system will allow departments to automate legislative processes from submission to codification in the Municipal Code. In addition, the system will create an online public portal with a Heat Map for tracking legislative items. Another major function of the system deals with record retention as the system will serve as a records repository for preserving the last century of the City's legislative history and saving department reports and records associated with each file.354 IT PROJECTSFPO (PICK-UP FROM 2022)354 IT PROJECTS ADDITIONAL BUDGETARY RESOURCES355356 ADDITIONAL BUDGETARY RESOURCESADDITIONAL BUDGETARY RESOURCES 357The Mayor's proposed Fiscal Years (FY) 2023-24 and 2024-25 budget for the City and County of San Francisco (the City), published on June 1, is one of several financial documents that can be a resource to the public.
