New Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners Psychotherapist Linden Thoburn is now practicing Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, which she says is helping her clients \"become aware of how the body physically responds to anxiety, and memory of traumatic events.\" She was trained and certified in the technique by founder Pat Ogden, director of the Sensorimotor Psychotherapy Institute, www. sensorimotorpsychotherapy.org. This type of psychotherapy differs from many kinds of \"talk therapy\" because the work focuses on gaining awareness of how the body physically reacts when a person is telling her traumatic story, rather than delving deeply into talking about emotions. \"We are never still, even when we think we are. If you are telling me a story, your body is also telling me the story,\" she says. In a session with her clients, Linden pays attention to things like \"muscles contracting, breathing pattern changes, changes in vision or eye movement, and changes in the nervous system.\" However, her goal is to help them become \"aware of themselves.\" She has a range of exercises and approaches she can use with clients, when appropriate, depending on what happens in a session. However, she says her work \"really depends on the client. This therapy allows me to stay really fresh and do different things with people,\" something she really enjoys about it. Frequently, \"the body is going into a reenactment of what it did to help you survive the trauma as it was happening\" and a client is \"re-experiencing the memory of the trauma, as if it was happening in the present,\" Linden explains. Your neck might tense when you get into a car, even years after your bad accident, for example. \"A person might tell me about a time when a parent hit them, and they aren' t aware that their body has contracted into a frozen state. So their body is holding their memory for them, while they are talking.\" In addition, people experiencing certain ongoing physical problems or illnesses \"may be afraid of their body's responses,\" she adds. For example, \"some people with Parkinson's try to stop the body's contractions. They make them anxious and they want to have control over the body.\" According to Linden, her work is a \"Mindfulness practice,\" but unlike Mindfulness meditation, \"this is a somatic tracking Mindfulness. If you get really quiet you can feel your own tissues, you can feel the tide of your nervous system, and you can feel your heart. We are always contracting and expanding on both a cellular level and as a whole larger organism. Getting really mindful is the thing that lets people have direct experience of themselves,\" she says. She doesn't know when it will happen, but clients frequently \"feel a shift in themselves at some point,\" when they come to \"their own realizations\" about \"what the roots of their trauma are,\" she says. These shifts can mark moments when \"someone begins to integrate their nervous system so that memories that would fire and create a reenactment of the trauma become only memories. Their awareness frees their bodies to move naturally, so they don't have to experience trauma over and over again,\" according to Linden. Call Linden Thoburn at (734) 645-7013 or email lindenthoburn@yahoo.com Occupational Therapist Karen Jones is now in private practice, after leaving St. Joe's to pursue a more holistic path. Karen worked at St. Joe's for 10 years in physical medicine rehabilitation, as a lymphedema and pain specialist. Now in private practice, she offers CranioSacral Therapy, Lymphedema Therapy, and External Qi Healing. On top of the treatments she offers, Karen is also working on \"formulating some pain and anxiety related classes,\" and she considers herself to be a \"supplement advocate.\" She makes recommendations to clients in order to \"take the confusion out of nutrition, help people sort through misinformation, recognize how things react biochemically in the body, and where to start with supplements,\" she says. Karen says the various treatments she offers not only affect the physical body - helping with pain, injuries, or specific ailments like fibromyalgia, \"it is also about what the person is feeling psychologically.\" Many times, when someone has experienced a trauma, whether it be a physical attack, a car accident, or some other type of issue, they suffer from psychological pain along with physical pain. She has worked with people suffering from traumatic-brain injuries, amputations, and other serious conditions, and finds that disorders such as \"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and depression diminish along with their pain,\" in her sessions with people. She explains that she can sense many different types of changes or imbalances in the body through her hands. During External Qi Healing treatments, Karen uses her hands to \"feel for blockages and help the body's energy flow,\" which she says is related to the idea of Chi or life-force energy. \"The hands can become the tool to help the body heal,\" she says. For example, \"sometimes I feel temperature changes in the body or something is wrong in the tissues, they might be rock hard instead of soft and pliable,\" she explains.

Wilderness skills instructor and Transformational Breathing facilitator Frank Levey invited me to join him and his wife, middle school teacher Larissa Czuchnowsky, along with a friendly group of 7 to 12 year-olds, at their Blue Turtle Nature Awareness and Wilderness Camp, this past summer. Frank, who learned how to survive in the wilderness from famous naturalist Tom Brown Jr. and others, has also been a longtime student and teacher of \"various natural healing arts and meditation,\" he explains. He has found Transformational Breathing to be a \"deeply healing process, which powerfully integrates our body, mind, and spirit.\" He is now teaching people \"how to open restricted breathing patterns so your entire respiratory system is utilized.\" Frank facilitates both one-on-one and small group Transformational Breathing sessions by appointment, as well as drop-in sessions . Find out more at http://awakenedbreath.net . Call Frank Levey at (734) 657-8742 or email frank@awakenedbreath.net . When I visited Blue Turtle Nature Awareness and Wilderness Skills Camp, located on their one-acre homestead near Scarlett Middle School, Frank and Larissa were wrapping up one of their weeklong kids camps, which they offer each Spring and Summer. While I was there, the kids showed me some of their new skills, like how to safely start a campfire and how to make natural cordage. Larissa mixed up a traditional drink recipe that I tasted, while sitting in on Frank' s lesson about hunting and trapping food in a survival situation, and passing around handmade hooks and tools. Over the course of the week, the kids had done a lot of dif ferent wilderness awareness activities, craft projects, and other fun educational activities. Find out more about the camp's offerings for both kids and adults at www.blueturtlenaturecamp. com. Call them at (734) 975-4448.

She has been using another form of \"manual medicine,\" Shiatsu, for a couple of decades, and says that the knowledge about \"meridians and the channels of the body\" she has gained has caused her to become interested in adding acupuncture to her practice. LaRene practices medical acupuncture, which she says, \"works for pain management. That is the main set of conditions that I treat. It also treats the autonomic nervous system for relaxation and balancing the nervous system, which helps with anxiety and mood disorders.\" She starts a medical acupuncture session \"with a neuromuscular assessment, palpation, and Shiatsu work,\" before getting the needles out. In some cases, she will do acupressure, a similar technique that doesn' t The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 7 Continued on page 8 Kristi Davis of Creative Spirit Healing (See page 11)What 's New in the Community use needles. LaRene also does Acudetox acupuncture, which helps with \"addiction recoveries\" from substances as severe as heroin, as well as other things that affect the nervous system. Acudetox acupuncture employs small balls, or \"ear seeds\" that LaRene tapes to specific points on clients' ears, \"which people can use in between acupuncture treatments on the rest of the body.\" LaRene's practice is based in western-based naturopathy and clinical medicine, with a dash of Japanese Shiatsu bodywork thrown into the mix. She also uses herbs in her practice, drawing from western traditions. As a naturopathic doctor working in Michigan, she doesn't diagnose illness, but she will refer you to an M.D., if she sees any red flags. She encourages people to get referrals for her medical acupuncture treatments from their regular doctor because your insurance might cover it. Call LaRene Dell at (734) 945-5767 to schedule an appointment at her downtown office (117 North First) or her Ypsilanti home, once it is done being renovated. Art Therapist Susan Boyes is leading a new group, \"Women in Transition Creative Process Group,\" from her new studio and counseling office on Stadium Boulevard (2311 East Stadium Boulevard, Suite 216). Her new \"women's forum,\" like her individual and group sessions with clients, includes \"using art materials, creativity, and supportive dialogue\" in order to \"encourage exploration of your own personal mythology.\" You don't need any art experience or skills to work with Susan. She says that all you need is \"a willingness to explore who you are from an art experience perspective.\" Meet her at her new Center for Creative Growth office, which is equipped with its very own art studio that she uses with clients and groups.

The center \"provides a home to local groups for practice of movement and performance arts,\" according to owner Scott Berry. The center houses two studios - one large, one small - that groups and one-on-one instructors can rent by the hour. The exposed brick rooms feature hardwood maple floors, high ceilings, and a HI-FI sound system. People have been using the studios for a range of classes and uses, such as Tai Chi, dancing Salsa or Swing, and Yoga classes. Scott himself gives Yin Style Bagua martial arts lessons there.

Katherine doesn't trust this and goes to the Vidya Shakti Center in upstate Pennsylvania to investigate; her mother has been conned before. Katherine's visit is nothing she expected and her inquiry turns inward,\" according to Susan's synopsis of the story. In the book, the skeptical protagonist is met by more than she bargained for when she goes to the ashram. She not only finds a new understanding of spirituality, mysticism, and her mother, Katherine also meets a new love interest. Ultimately, \"the love story carries the drama through,\" says Susan, who thinks \"love stories are suspenseful. Is it going to work? Is it not going to work?\" Susan will sign copies of her novel at Crazy Wisdom, on October 20th at 7 p.m. Although the work is fiction, Susan drew inspiration for the book from experiences of spiritual awakening that she has had herself - she is a long time meditator who has spent time at ashrams and meditation centers in the U.S. and India. She incorporated stories of spiritual awakenings that have happened to people she knows, as well as \"things that are completely made up,\" into the story, she explains. \"I wanted to present information about meditation and mysticism in a very practical and grounded way that doesn't come across as out there. The book is not magical realism; rather, it presents spiritual experiences as something that really happen to people,\" she explains. Susan says she got the idea for the story all at once. By the end of a day, she had a basic story outline. However, that was six years ago. She spent a lot of time \"letting the characters take on a life of their own\" and changing the tense to first-person in order to \"get to know Katherine on a more personal level\" and \"give it the feel of a memoir.\" Visit Susan Morales online at http://susanscottmorales. com or read her annarbor.com meditation blogs.

Robert Lewanski first released an early version of his book, Perfect Eyesight: The Art of Improving Vision Naturally, in the late 90's, which he co-authored with his late friend, Robert Zuraw. Robert says that the final version of the book comes after 30 years of researching and practicing eye-healthy habits. \"It took me a long time to get everything I wanted in there, but I got it straightened out,\" he laughs. He describes the book as \"a whole program\" that explores \"holistic\" methods for keeping our eyes healthy. The book includes examples of specific eye exercises you can do, suggestions for an eye-healthy diet, an index covering supplements, and other information about natural and holistic approaches to managing our eye health. Lewanski says that Robert Zuraw's vision returned to normal, after finding himself legally blind in Vietnam during the era of Agent Orange poisoning, by using a mixture of natural cleansing techniques, eye exercises, and other holistic methods of healing. The book \"draws from everywhere, from the East to the West,\" according to Lewanski. \"There are a lot of natural healing methods that come from the East - like Chinese medicine and Ayurveda - and then we have things like naturopathic medicine here in the West,\" which all offer knowledge about eye health. One major point he makes is: \"If you keep the central organs clear, clean, and metabolizing properly, then the senses will work properly. The eyes relate back to the central energy of the organs -- especially the liver.\" The book also gives instructions for things like daily eye exercises that \"work the eye muscles\" and massage techniques that \"bring blood to your eyes,\" which can be preventative and healing. Find out more about Robert Lewanski at www.healthforcecenter.com. Call him at (248) 680-8688 or email healthforcecenter@sbcglobal.net Ordained Christian minister and woodworker Jim Stacey has published his book, Jesus Was Not a Christian, which was inspired by \"my own spiritual journey becoming disillusioned by theology.\" When Jim started studying the Aramaic language, he discovered what he considers huge discrepancies between \"the lessons Jesus was teaching,\" during his lifetime, and Christianity' s teachings through The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 8 Continued from page 7 Susan Morales, a meditation teacher, psychotherapist, spinning fitness instructor, blogger, and poet, has written her first novel, A Barroom View of Love the centuries. He was also doing a lot of \"inner work\" at the time and grappling with things he had been taught as a child, such as \"we are separate from god and that god will punish us. I couldn't find a way to feel right with that. It seemed like empty teaching and it wasn't bringing me any healing,\" he explains. On top of exploring things like early Gnostic texts and how Jesus' teachings have been \"edited\" over the course of Christian history, Jim also seeks to encourage people to \"find their own personal divine connection. I found that my connection to the divine is beyond spiritual belief systems,\" he says. Instead, he has concluded that Jesus was about \"love and compassion\" not \"punishment and authority.\" Jim and Marcia Maria are giving a series of talks -- Loving Transformation: Self Relationships and the Planet , from 7 to 9 p.m. at Crazy Wisdom, on September 28th, October 19th, and October 26th. The book takes a critical look at the history of Christianity. It presents texts that \"didn't make it into the Bible\" for a range of reasons, which Jim thinks usually have to do with authorities placing restrictions on human behavior to maintain control over populations of people. For example, he thinks the way people understand \"original sin\" today is a problem. \"Original sin wasn't even part of the church's teachings until the 4th century when St. Augustine officially introduced the idea,\" he says, giving an example of one discrepancy he found while researching his book. He also thinks women have been given a raw deal. His interpretation of the \"Book of Genesis,\" which describes the creation of the universe, presupposes that both male and female energy was present in the beginning. He points to language surrounding the idea that \"sacred wisdom is feminine\" and presents a new translation for the phrase; \"Let God make man in his image.\" Jim reads it as; \"Let us make people in our image.\" Another way he explores gender in the book is by taking a closer look at Mary Magdalene' s life, and stories about there being \"a grail bloodline\". He is working on writing a second book, which he doesn't have a title for yet, but the working title is Jesus Was Not a Christian: Part II . Find out more, and read lengthy excerpts, on the book's website, www.thedivineiswithinus.com .Dietary coach Judy Sauer self-published some of the baking recipes she has learned, since she \"discovered in quick succession that her son, her daughter , and she herself had multiple food allergies\" (wheat, dairy, soy, and corn), according to the announcement for her new cookbook, Footloose and Gluten-Free: Baking Hints and Recipes from a Multiple-Allergy Family . The book explains ways to \"accommodate for food allergies\" and includes Judy's recipes for things like bread, pizza, pancakes, muffins, cakes, other desserts, and other baked goods. As a dietary coach, she regularly does allergy consultations, bakes her own recipes, and shares information about the ingredients that she uses in her own kitchen to avoid her family' s allergies. Sometimes she even walks people through the grocery store to point out certain products to cook up at home. The book was a way to share her food knowledge with even more people. To order a copy of Judy Sauer's new cookbook, call her at (734) 761-8193 or email jdsFoodSolutions@ yahoo.com Local \"foodie\" Elaina Williams' new business, Free to Eat , and her new guidebook, both debut this fall. She has written Free to Eat, a Laypersons Guide to Eating in the 20th Century, a booklet \"written with a local and a positive perspective that encourages action and the fact that we can make a difference,\" she says. Elaina will sell the booklet through her new business and website, which will also sell other naturally-minded products. She hopes to circulate her guide to eating to other local \"foodies\" and \"like-minded\" businesses, in order to \"get a great grasp of the local community by the time I'm done. I'll know what is going on and where the needs are, and then I will be able to format my future business to meet those needs,\" she says. To start, Elaina is thinking of selling non-toxic beauty products, along with copies of her guidebook, on http://free2eat.net . \"Two more [booklets] are in the works,\" including a coloring book for kids and Free to Eat: Chard.

Upcoming Events The \"2010 What About You Walk,\" a walk-a-thon and charity expo, will raise money for 15 different non-profit charities by letting participants choose which organizations their pledge money will support. Two walk-a-thons, a BBQ lunch, a charity expo and special activities will happen at Gallup Park (3000 Fuller Road), on September 25th from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Event creator Christie Clipper, who provides life coaching and wellness services through her business Healthy Edge, www.healthedge-llc.com , got the idea for the event, last year. She was \"moved to help a broad range of charities to promote themselves,\" which collectively help \"the whole person,\" she says. Last year, Christie brought 7 charities together for a \"What About You Walk,\" but she soon learned about one of the biggest uncertainties you face hosting an outdoor event in the summertime - it rained all day and cleared up just as the event was ending. Hopefully this year's event will be sunnier. Walk participants choose where their pledge money goes. They can handpick charities from the organizations that are officially represented by the fundraiser, or select any other charitable organization they wish, as long as it has non-profit 501c3 status. \"I wanted to give people a chance to choose what's important to them. Maybe they have a personal connection with a particular charity or they benefitted from their services in the past,\" she explains.

A BBQ lunch provided by event sponsors Damon' s Grill of Ann Arbor will follow the walks. The event's charity expo will feature resource sharing tables giving out information about charitable organizations, and Christie has asked each participant to plan special activities and consider educational or interactive things they can do. Special activities that are already planned include a game tent with carnival-style games and face painting. Therapaws of Michigan, one of the charities the walk supports, will bring therapy dogs for you to meet who \"provide social, emotional, and physical benefits to some of the hundreds of residents and patients in Ann Arbor and surrounding communities.\" Composer and musician Ken Kozora will perform \"Soundscapes\" using a set of solar-powered instruments and P.A. system, which blend \"electronica, world, new age, classical, a touch of jazz and any other bizarre noise he deems musical,\" according to the event announcement. Christi was still working on securing a final lineup of charity expo participants when I spoke with her this summer. Check the event's website, www.whataboutyouwalk.com , for the most current information, a list of the charities, and registration. She had some great ideas for TBA activities when we sat down to chat. Participants can register online until September 22nd. After that you can still sign up in-person on event day. If you have questions or would like to volunteer, call Christie Clipper at (734) 751-7618 or email her at info@whataboutyouwalk.com The Lotus Center of Ann Arbor is hosting a collaborative event in celebration of Pain Awareness Month, \"Holistic Hope for People in Pain,\" which will feature a dozen holistic or natural-minded practitioners who work with people in pain, on September 19th, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Local psychotherapist Jody Kohn, the Michigan State Leader for the American Pain Foundation Action Network, organized the event. About a year ago, around the time she was appointed to the position, the American Pain Foundation had challenged members to celebrate September as \"National Pain Awareness Month.\" She didn't have enough time to do an event last year, but this year Jody has assembled a diverse group of pain experts, who will present short talks and demonstrations to people seeking options for pain relief. Each of the dozen practitioners is planning to present a brief talk on pain relief and management, and most of them are planning participatory demonstrations. For example, Nia movement instructor Robin Okun , of Mindful Movement , is likely to get a few folks dancing around. Jody, who will give a brief presentation on the American Pain Foundation and talk about psychologically-oriented therapies that help What 's New in the Community with pain management, is also going to volunteer as a demonstration subject during \"gentle\" chiropractor Kathleen Dvorak's demonstration of chiropractic work using an activator method. \"She doesn't crack you around. Instead, she uses a little tool called an activator, which looks a little like a mini-pogo stick,\" according to Jody, who is a client of Kathleen's. (See the profile of Kathleen Dvorak within the feature story on the Women Healers of Complete Chiropractic , on page __ of this issue.) Lotus Center co-owners Amy and Brodie Burris are donating the space to the event, and Brodie will give a talk about acupuncture and pain management. Janine Polley will demonstrate the benefits of gentile yoga and therapeutic breath work for pain relief at the event, and she is also offering a gentile yoga workshop for chronic pain at the Lotus Center earlier in the day, from 10 a.m. to 12 noon. Massage Therapist Kirsten Mowrey will present on the Trager \u00ae method, which blends massage and movement, Leilani O'Brien will cover breath and exercise, Libby Robinson will demonstrate Mindfulness meditation, Jewel Heart' s Kathleen Ivanoff will cover meditation practices, and Joe Kraut will present on Tai Chi for pain. Psychotherapist and life coach Felix Paulick will present on Eckhart Tolle's Power of Now. Dr. Diana Little, M.D. will give a talk covering the importance of correct diagnosis, and a staff person from Clark Pharmacy will talk about supplements and other natural remedies. Part of Jody's inspiration for the event is that \"so many people have chronic pain - according to the American Pain Foundation, around 26% have pain that lasts more than a day, which translates to 76.5 million people - and many people in pain sit around isolated all day in their homes. Just getting out of the house is so important,\" she says. \"What I want to show with this event is that there are so many ways to deal with pain other than going to the doctor and getting drugs,\" she explains. She hopes the event will give people in pain an opportunity to \"find out ways to help themselves\" in a \"fun, accepting and environment,\" Jody says.

New Practitioners and Businesses Jessica Snyder has returned to Ann Arbor, her hometown, from New Mexico, and she is working as an Ayurvedic Practitioner, Massage Therapist, and Ayurvedic Postpartum Doula through her new practice, Earth's Cradle Healing Arts. A recent 4-month trip to Nepal to study with an Ayurvedic physician specializing in OB/GYN was an inspiring experience for her. \"I assisted with many free Ayurvedic village health camps in remote areas of the Kathmandu Valley,\" Jessica reports. The experience inspired her to start a medicinal herb CSA (Community-Supported Agriculture growing project), upon returning home. She reports; \"The medicinal herb CSA is modeled after the fresh produce CSA concept - there will be a membership program - but it will provide locally grown medicinal herbs and herbal preparations - like teas and oils - rather than produce.\" She is growing Eastern, Ayurvedic, and Chinese herbs in a garden at the Tsogyelgar Dharma Center (7145 West Liberty Road), in a garden funded by Wishing Tree Gardens. What Jessica is doing - creating a medicinal herb CSA - is so wonderfully Ann Arborish, so perfect for the times we are living in, and such a valuable service to the community. Jessica Snyder's new business, Earth' s Cradle Healing Arts, is located at the Center for Sacred Living (210 Little Lake Dr., Suite 7). Find out more about her at www.earthscradle.com .

Beyond the \"intuitively guided work\" she does with her one-on-one clients and classes, she also trains other healers \"to work intuitively to address healing at the root cause of disease in the soul contracts, hereditary issues, childhood or past life, or wherever the deeper issue lies behind the symptoms a person is experiencing.\" Her program offers training in a wide range of spiritual healing modalities that teach healers how to listen to sources of spiritual guidance, and \"incorporate Qabalah, power animals, aura reading and healing, genetic healing, soul contract resolution, present and past life and inner child work, and much more,\" she says. Her Healer Development Program also offers \"The Healer 101\" training and Reiki Training at all levels.

Transpersonal Drama Therapist Kristi Davis is offering one-on-one sessions and group classes through her new business Creative Spirit Healing . According to her, drama therapy \"is a powerful tool for uncovering repressed and unconscious beliefs, memories, resentments, un-for giveness, symbols, thoughts, and emotions, which may be manifesting as mental, emotional and/or physical symptoms.\" Kristi is a former professional Radio City Rockette and musical theater actress. She points out how \"theatrical performances include a lot of elements, not just acting but art, costumes, background music, movement, and writing,\" which she incorporates into her work with clients and class participants, along with things like \"guided imagery visualizations\" that help people \"imagine a scene\" and cognitive-behavioral therapy psychological techniques. Some clients appreciate one-on-one work with Kristi, but she thinks there are benefits to doing drama therapy in a group. Groups can produce \"transformational theater\" performances that they develop together over time. \"In a group, people can play roles for each other and become part of the healing process. It's empowering for them to change their role,\" she thinks. On top of that, \"people feel the acceptance of others who witness their stories and trauma,\" which helps give them confidence to come to terms with their issues. Kristi has a workbook and related course, entitled Imagine Health: Harnessing the Healing Power of Illness , and she thinks, \"illness can actually be healing.\" \"We tend to look at illness as a bad thing, but it is not inherently bad. It is a messenger sending the red flags your body is giving you - survival messages,\" she says. Drama therapy can be used to \"externalize\" illness, as well as stress and trauma, by \"acting it out in order to be able to converse with it,\" she explains. Transpersonal psychology suggests that \"at our core, we are designed perfectly, but our experiences and beliefs cover it up,\" she says. Transpersonal therapies \"peel away\" beliefs and emotional reactions in order to make clients more aware that \"we are not our emotions. We are the witness to emotions that pass through us,\" she says. \"In drama therapy, we can also be anyone we want to be and choose the roles we want to play. Embodying this through real, visceral experiences creates new neural-networks in the brain,\" according to Kristi. Drama therapy also allows people to \"rehearse conversations they are fearing,\" and even \"reverse the roles,\" she explains. For example, someone who has suffered abuse might benefit from role-playing and \"feeling what is it like to be in the body of her or his abuser,\" she has observed. Forgiveness doesn't come easy - whether it's forgiving another person, god, or oneself, but she believes it is what brings \"the most healing, in the end.\" Visit Kristi Davis online, at www.creativespirithealing.com or call her at (734) 253-2650 for more information.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 1 1 Continued on page 12 Life Design ServicesLightWorks www.lightworks-enterprises.com www.integrativewellbeing.com 248-702-7064Deb Foggio Intuitive Life Path ConsultantEnterprises, LLC Counseling, Life Coaching, Readings, Systemic Constellations, Personal Development Training, Bach Flower Essences The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 12 Kate Boyd is a new Trauma Touch Therapist, Massage Therapist, Usui Reiki practitioner, and Reflexologist who opened her holistic business, Kate Boyd Therapy, this year. Beyond offering massage, Reiki, and Reflexology sessions, Kate offers a 10-week program in Trauma Touch Therapy, which \"allows people to work through traumas - like injury, abuse, being a witness to violent crimes - without being re-traumatized,\" she says. The modality seeks to bring \"more awareness to sensations in the body and how people perceive how trauma feels in their body , in the present moment, and then learn what it feels like to release it,\" according to Kate. She facilitates this by using a mixture of breathing work, visualization exercises, movement and dance, creative activities, and play, according to her. In addition, Kate can use hands-on techniques like massage with her Trauma Touch clients in order to release tension in their bodies and free up the body's energy flow. She also seeks to \"normalize touch\" for clients struggling with issues of abuse, in a safe environment. She thinks of herself as \"a compassionate witness for them as they journey inward to become aware of sensations - how trauma feels in the body,\" she says. Trauma Touch Therapy is a somatic approach to healing, which supposes, \"trauma is held in the cells, and anxiety can manifest itself physically. Tissues and the nervous system take it on,\" Kate says. Whereas, \"animals shake it off, humans tend to hold on to it,\" sometimes for a long time, she explains. \"It isn't necessary for the client to go into the details of their trauma and what happened to them in the past,\" she says. The more important thing is to pay attention to how the nervous system and body responds to certain \"triggers\" that relate to all five senses, she thinks. \"One person' s trauma can be very different from another's. The most important thing is the client's perception of what happened to them. It is their perception that causes nervous reactions, which causes tension to be held in the body.\" During her 10 week program, she does a variety of techniques, exercises, and activities with Trauma Touch clients. One of them is creative visualizations that \"let your body tell its own story,\" she explains. Rather than making up a story herself, What 's New in the Community Kate asks clients to \"check in with their bodies\" and describe what sensations feel like to them. \"Maybe I feel like I have bubbles in my stomach, which I can then imagine transforming into an effervescent spring, and then I might imagine myself swimming freely through water,\" for example, she says. The descriptive words people use to explain what they are sensing guide the directions the visualizations travel. Other techniques that \"let the body go and let it do its thing\" include activities that get you moving around, like dancing. Her office is near a park, so she frequently takes clients outdoors to \"play around, jump rope, climb trees, or play school ground games like hopscotch.\" Kate believes these kinds of activities help people \"be in the moment, be in their bodies, and enjoy simply pleasures.\" Kate Boyd' s office is located in the Parkway Center (2345 South Huron Parkway), on the 2nd floor.

She gets to sample the work of five talented and dedicated bodyworkers - Chiropractors Linda Berry and Kathleen Dvorak, Craniosacral and Polarity and Trager\u00ae Practitioner Kirsten Mowrey. And she learns how each woman found her way to satisfying work - work which makes a deep contribution to other people's lives. By Mary Runser Photography by Rachael Waring Linda Berry, chiropractor, and Ren\u00e9e Rutz, craniosacral and polarity therapist, started Complete Chiropractic and Bodywork Therapies of Ann Arbor (CCBT) in 1990 because they wanted to design a practice that would offer health and wholeness from more than just one angle. \"We had a desire to provide a more comprehensive and caring form of healthcare within the community,\" Linda said. Their partnership actually sprang from an exchange of body therapy techniques between them, with Linda offering chiropractic adjustments to Renee, and Renee offering in return her combination of craniosacral and polarity therapy. From that came not only a friendship between the two women but the birth of their vision for a holistic treatment center, with a sense of shared concern for clients' recovery to health and well-being, and an emphasis on the safety and comfort of each client who walks through the door. Over the years, the pair added other practitioners to the center . In addition to chiropractic care, CCBT currently offers several different types of energy therapy and bodywork, including: Reiki, craniosacral therapy, polarity therapy, somatic and trauma healing, Trager massage, and lymphatic drainage. Each therapy is performed by a trained and certified practitioner. Standing (left to right) Lisa Fox - Del Zoppo and Kirsten Mowrey. Seated (left to right) Linda Berry, Kathleen Dvorak and Ren\u00e9e Rutz Profiles of the 5 Women Healers of Complete Chiropractic and Bodywork TherapiesThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 15 CCBT has mission and value statements, to which all of the practitioners are committed. \"It is our goal to honor individuals on their path to discovering lasting health, vitality, and well-being,\" Renee said, \"and we accomplish that through our values, which are: integrity , compassion, empowerment, continuous learning, and partnership based on what's going on in the health of every person.\" All of the practitioners meet together twice a month to discuss the health and progress of their patients. CCBT is definitely less of a group practice and more of a community of healers, who work together to attain what is best for their patients. They also share new information and techniques with one another. \"It just makes it easier to refer my patient to Kirsten, or Kathleen, or to Lisa and Renee,\" Linda said. \"For example, because I know what Trager feels like, I can give the patient an idea if I think it will be helpful to them...It's actually something we do frequently.\" \"One of the things I am most proud about each of the practitioners here is their commitment to education,\" Linda went on. \"We not only continue our own education, but we also get a thorough training in the different techniques. So everyone is certified in the techniques that they offer, and stay current with any continuing education requirements to maintain those certifications.\" Despite all its success, there are challenges that CCBT will continue to face because of the slow economy. \"Our business has undergone significant change in the last 20 years.\" Linda said. \"There was a time when our schedules were filled for weeks in advance. I stopped taking new patients for myself for a few years, so that I could accommodate the needs of my current patients. But insurance policies and financial situations have forced many patients to look for practitioners who are in their insurance plans. There used to be many more plans that paid for massage therapy when referred by chiropractors. Now, it's mostly [only] teachers who have this inclusive coverage.\" Last year, chiropractors Linda and Kathleen became participating providers for Blue Cross Blue Shield. Many of their previous patients have returned and they are now getting consistent numbers of new patients. \"With this new change in our status, we see our schedules filling, but it also means we receive 20% less reimbursement from the insurance company. Thankfully, we also have a core group of referring practitioners within the community who recommend our services, such as Amy Saunders from Briarwood Internal Medicine, Miles Colwell from the Spine Clinic at the University of Michigan, Patrick Hoban and others from Probility Physical Therapy, and the Ann Arbor Veterans Medical Clinic.\" The business has undergone changes internally as well, but \"it is the hard work, integrity, and competence of the practitioners and all the staff that have made us who we are and kept us together as a group,\" Linda said, citing staff members current (Tonia Swinton, Rachel Brown, and Audra Pope) and past (Kathy Wiles, Laurie Fry, Robbie Sawitski, among many others). \"Tonia, Rachel, and Audra are valuable members of the team and help keep things running in the office as smoothly as possible. They are a part of the 'wholeness' of our office,\" Renee added. \"Even though they don't 'treat' our patients for specific conditions, their jobs in some ways are much harder. They help people feel safe, comfortable, and taken care of. They are a vital part of our ability to uphold our mission and values.\" Additional positive changes should be coming to CCBT since the passage of a state law at the end of 2009, which Linda says included a rider that redefines how chiropractic care can be administered in the state. Linda explained that, up until now, \"Michigan has had the most restrictive laws governing chiropractic practice...We were limited to treating and adjusting the spine only, even though chiropractors are trained and educated in the same manner as a primary physician. \"What this legislation means, for Kathleen Dvorak and myself, is that we can now diagnose, adjust, and treat any joint in the body . We can use ultrasound, electrical stimulation machines, and lasers for chronic pain. We can use heat and ice, and even massage therapy. Right now, the possibilities are so staggering that the Chiropractic Board is going to have to work at redefining who we are as chiropractors and what we can do!\" Having experienced treatments from each of the CCBT practitioners, the thing that stands out in my mind, beyond their expertise, is their shared desire to help me feel better. It really is a community effort and a conscious choice on the part of each of the practitioners and staff. I can honestly say that after experiencing all of these different healing modalities, I feel like an entirely new person, or that I have been completely overhauled. I wake up in the morning without the aches and pains that I had become accustomed to and had begun to believe were normal for my age. And as each practitioner has told me, this is the way I am supposed to feel every day! ### Read on to learn more about each of the five healers ~ All of the practitioners meet together twice a month to discuss the health and progress of their patients. CCBT is definitely less of a group practice and more of a community of healers, who work together to attain what is best for their patientsLinda Berry, chiropractor, and Ren\u00e9e Rutz, craniosacral and polarity therapist, started Complete Chiropractic and Bodywork Therapies of Ann Arbor because they wanted to design a practice that would offer health and wholeness from more than just one angle.Linda has studied many modalities or techniques to address the illness and wellness of the body and mind, and believes that touch is important, because information is conveyed without the need for words. \"Touch doesn't have to be intellectualized, it's direct. Sometimes, I think it's the greatest form of healing that any physician has. And there is some research that supports [the theory] that touch changes brain pathways, particularly in chronic pain. We aren't sure why it happens, but there is a definite sort of tactile shift with touch therapy.\" There is an emotional shift that occurs as well; the human body responds in positive ways to nurturing, healing touch. As a chiropractor, Linda is trained in applied kinesiology, BioSET technique, Cox flexion/distraction, sacro-occipital technique, and nutrition. \"I'm not sure it's the technique [that's important] as much as the relationship of the practitioner and patient, the power of touch and intention, and the desire for each person to re-connect with their own essential self,\" Linda stated. She sees her work as the synthesis of the tools and techniques she's learned over the years. \"A patient presents with a problem along with their own set of preferences, beliefs, fears, and strengths. I can reach into my tool box and choose an approach that will likely fit that person, where they are at that moment.\" Of course, there are times when a patient doesn't experience relief after treatment, which is frustrating. \"It's likely that a patient will not experience relief during the initial history and physical. I fix what I find and see what happens. I explain that we are beginning a journey to relief and better health. Several treatments, or a combination of approaches, may be needed before relief comes.\" Communication is a key component of treatment. If the changes or suggestions don't work, then other options can be explored. \"Sometimes,\" Linda said, \"knowing that a treatment creates an increase in symptoms can indicate that the body needs another approach, such as nutrition or energy work.\" One of the most challenging components of her work is the demand \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally \u2014 of being engaged all the time. \"It is a constant effort to stay present, to stay focused, and to be engaged with a patient, with their issues and concerns.\" And at the same time, Linda enjoys working with people to help them discover the mystery of their un-wellness. \"I love listening to a patient' s story and then helping them redefine how they work with, play in, and accept the realities of their unique body.\" In addition to her chiropractic work, Linda is also currently on the board of Think Local First , the Ann Arbor organization that promotes supporting local businesses, and has co-taught a workshop series called \"Spiritual Anatomy\" with local poet and energy healer Elizabeth Alberda. She is also active in teaching at the University of Michigan's Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program, and she's been involved in teaching activities for the Arthritis Foundation, as well as other organizations.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 16 Linda Berry, DC: Chiropractic \"The whole idea of using the brain and the mind to change the body had always fascinated me; how the mind and thoughts influence the body, and how the body influences not just thoughts, but society.\"\"[Chiropractors are] trained in exactly the same manner as a primary physician... It's very important for a chiropractor to know when a problem is actually something that they can treat chiropractically, versus when it's something that they need to refer to a primary physician.\"While sitting in the ambient-lit waiting room of Complete Chiropractic and Bodywork Therapies (CCBT), with lovely, melodic music playing in the background, I spoke with Dr. Linda Berry, a woman small in stature, with a large and tangibly comforting presence, about how she became a chiropractor. \"I left New York, after two years at State University of New York at Albany, with the sense that the world was pretty much open to me,\" Linda said. She didn't know in which direction to go with her education, because she hadn't lived long enough. She decided to travel cross-country with a friend and ended up in Texas. Texas was experiencing an economic boom at that time, especially in the gas and oil industry, so there were lots of entry-level jobs available that were fairly easy to get. Linda always knew that she wanted to work in medicine. \"I had a sense of wanting to touch people and put my hands on them in a healing sort of way.\" The first position she took in Texas, while completing her undergraduate degree in science, was in a hypnosis clinic. She worked with a renowned surgeon who was using hypnosis as the only anesthetic for procedures such as Cesarean sections and burn debridements. \"The work he was doing was incredible, and it was here that I really got turned onto the idea of mind-body and energetic medicine,\" Linda said. \"The whole idea of using the brain and the mind to change the body had always fascinated me; how the mind and thoughts influence the body, and how the body influences not just thoughts, but society. And so now I had a new tool. Something a little more spiritual that helped to make that connection between spirituality, intuition, the human body, and even altered states of consciousness.\" She tried out other areas in the medical field, including working in a psychiatrist's office and with social workers. Eventually, she found Texas Chiropractic College in Pasadena, Texas, became a patient, toured the college, and was completely impressed by the level of education and the professionalism of the students and faculty. Linda had had secondary experience with chiropractic, after a severe car accident left her mother with chronic headaches and neck pain associated with whiplash. \"Chiropractic was the only thing that gave her any relief,\" Linda stated. She later had personal experience with chiropractic after she suffered a trampoline accident at the age of 19, and was helped by the treatments she received. \"I just had this sense that I could give people immediate assistance and almost immediate relief with this particular work, so I signed up.\" Linda explained that the field of chiropractic really has it all. \"I was trained in exactly the same manner as a primary physician. My education included blood draws, EKGs, full physicals, breast exams, heart and lung exams, ears and eyes. We studied all about pathology and the disease process. We learned to read x-rays \u2014 I didn't learn to read CT scans and MRIs, but they teach those skills now. \"We did rotations in various fields and could learn about sports injuries and taping, in addition to learning all about spinal care and health. The reason we were trained in that manner was that it's very important for a chiropractor to know when a problem is actually something that they can treat chiropractically , versus when it's something that they need to refer to a primary physician.\" Linda came to Ann Arbor with her then-husband, Joe Sayers, after graduating from the chiropractic college in 1985. Upon arriving in Michigan, Linda worked with Ken Large, a chiropractor and applied kinesiology specialist. \"I really wanted to work with Dr. George Goodheart, a chiropractor who was the founder of applied kinesiology. Working with Ken was as close as I could get, since he worked in Dr. Goodheart's office three days a week.\" My initial session with Linda began with an exam and adjustment. From the paperwork and through our pre-exam conversation, she knew that I had sinus problems and allergies, and she was sure that she could help. She used the BioSET (Bioenergetic Sensitivity and Enzyme Therapy) method to test me for allergies. Linda explained that most allergies have their origin in something that we eat, and BioSET therapy could help pinpoint some of those foods. \"BioSET is a natural holistic healthcare system that is based on energetic medicine and meridian therapy, to prevent and resolve chronic health conditions.\" For the BioSET test, I held a vial of liquid that had the same energetic frequency as certain foods I ate, such as chicken, eggs, and onions. While holding the vial, Linda used applied kinesiology to test the muscle strength in my outstretched arm. If I had sensitivity to a certain substance, I was unable to prevent her from lightly pushing my arm from a raised to a lowered position. If the muscle test confirmed sensitivity, Linda performed desensitization. Desensitization is an acupressure technique that utilizes allergen frequencies and energetics to fully clear or reprogram an individual, via the nervous and meridian systems, to any aller gen or sensitivity. Afterward, I had to refrain from eating that particular food item for 25 hours to complete the desensitization. I told Linda in advance that this was the time of year when my aller gies and sinuses eased up and gave me a bit of a break, so it may not be a fair assessment. She was honest and told me that this type of testing doesn't work for everyone, but that we were likely to find some things that I had sensitivity to, if not a full-blown aller gy. And we did find some things to which I had a definite sensitivity. At the end of my first session with Linda, we made an agreement to extend our work together. When I returned, I had additional BioSET treatments, and I also received a chiropractic adjustment during each session. I did notice that with each visit, my back and neck were more responsive to treatment, and I stayed in alignment for longer periods of time. My favorite part was when she manually adjusted my neck, because the sense of relief was instantaneous, like releasing a held breath. And as for the allergies, I will have to wait until later in the year to know for sure if the desensitization holds, but I am hoping that it will. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 17 Linda believes that touch is important, because information is conveyed without the need for words. \"Touch doesn't have to be intellectualized, it's direct.

Celebrating 20 Years of Service LINDA BERR Y, D.C. KATHLEEN DVORAK, D.C. Therapy Lymph Drainage Trager\u00aeApproach 2020 HOGBACK RD, SUITE 7, ANN ARBOR, MI 48105 734.677.1900 www.ccbtherapies.comthe issue that they came in with, which might take fifteen more minutes. \"I try to respect people's time, but I also want to make sure I address the issue they came in with.\" Kathleen also finds it easier when clients discuss their reservations, disbelief, or uncertainties about chiropractic, rather than keeping those feelings to themselves. \"If they tell me their concerns upfront, we can talk about them and I can assuage their fears, which allows them to be more at ease so that some real work can be accomplished.\" If a client does not experience relief after treatment, Kathleen stresses it's important that they tell her. \"If I can ask questions and investigate the situation, there may be other techniques that I can use that will provide them with relief. There are so many healing modalities available, and once I begin investigating the situation through open dialogue, we're more likely to find the one that will help.\" With the prevailing attitude toward health and healthcare, most people do not consider going to a doctor until they are experiencing an inordinate amount of pain, or feel so badly that they cannot function normally, and then expect the doctor to perform a miracle. \"It doesn't work that way,\" Kathleen said. \"If you've been experiencing back pain for the last five years and you've just now decided to seek treatment, then one session is not going to solve the problem. It's going to take time, work, and effort on your part to change habits or nutrition, or even the way that you sleep.\" Kathleen feels that an attitude adjustment toward healthcare in this country is certainly long overdue, and the best tool for that is better health education. \"A friend once told me that I was a connector; that I like to connect people with people or information. And I guess that's true, because what I really do in my work is connect people with their health, facilitate the restoration of their function, and help to reduce pain and discomfort.\" Since she works in a holistic setting, she has the opportunity to connect people in other ways, too. When she does somatic release work, it gets into mental, emotional, and spiritual interfacing with the body, to facilitate the central nervous system to release what the body is holding onto. \"It's really about life connections. There's only twenty-four vertebrae in the body, and only so many muscles that I can adjust and work on within a year . It's the packaging, it's the story of each of my patients, which makes my work interesting and keeps me coming back day after day.\" One tool that Kathleen utilizes is the Activator. The Activator is a hand- held device, about the size of a travel-size hair dryer, which is specifically used for adjusting a joint. \"It uses the physics of high speed rather than high force, so you end up with the same results, through a different means. It's a very fast, gentle, and targeted adjustment.\" Kathleen does manual manipulation and adjustment as well, but tends to do a lot of work with the Activator. The Activator can be used on newborn infants on up to geriatrics and everyone in between. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 18 Kathleen Dvorak, DC: Chiropractic \"It's really about life connections.

It's the packaging, it's the story of each of my patients, which makes my work interesting and keeps me coming back day after day.\"\"Most people do not consider going to a doctor until they are experiencing an inordinate amount of pain... and then expect the doctor to perform a miracle. \"It doesn't work that way,\" Kathleen said. \"If you've been experiencing back pain for the last five years and you've just now decided to seek treatment, then one session is not going to solve the problem.\"Kathleen Dvorak was born and raised in Dearborn, Michigan. \"My paternal grandfather was a custom home builder in the Detroit area, and he built my folks a home in Dearborn before I was born. They lived there for fifty years, until just a few years back, when they moved to Ann Arbor.\" She is the oldest of three girls and the first grandchild on both sides of her family. All three of the daughters work in a helping profession: a teacher, a nurse, and a chiropractor. \"My maternal grandfather's mother was a midwife in Czechoslovakia. She had two small children and commuted from a tiny village to Vienna to study to become a midwife. She would stay in Vienna throughout the week and then commute back to the village for the weekend. I think that in the early 1900s, that was really quite a remarkable thing to do.\" It seems that working in helping professions runs in this family. Kathleen's true desire was to become an interior designer, but her parents wanted her to get a \"real\" degree, so she went into education instead. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in education from Eastern Michigan University in 1973, with an arts group major and a children's literature minor. \"So, [my degree was] highly unmarketable if you're not going to teach. In the early 1970s, teaching jobs were hard to get, and it took me a year to find a job. Then the school was closed down and I lost my job.\" She was married at the time, and they really liked the Ypsilanti/Ann Arbor area, so they bought a house and decided to stay. \"I got a position working with Holy Trinity Chapel on Eastern's campus, and worked with campus ministries for ten years. I received a lot of positive feedback that I was good at helping people to heal their lives. That just kind of broadened out to healing their bodies.\" As an adult, Kathleen has had severe issues with her sinuses. She found chiropractic on her own, because her family didn't \"believe\" in it. \"I will go on record to say that chiropractic is not a belief system, it is an actual science.\" Kathleen found a great deal of relief through chiropractic and, when it came time to choose a profession that would support her , she decided that she wanted to be a chiropractor. So, she went to Kansas City, Missouri, to attend the Cleveland Chiropractic College, and earned her Doctor of Chiropractic degree in 1989. Kathleen works full-time at Complete Chiropractic, but she also enjoys working on animals occasionally. \"Let me be clear, I don't do work on animals at Complete Chiropractic, because that is a 'people office.' But with the approval of a veterinarian, I can adjust animals. And it's fun! There are no insurance issues to deal with, the patients are appreciative and cooperative, and they usually don' t overdo and mess things up that you've fixed.\" She has worked with Dr. John Smith, DVM, of Petcare Animal Clinic on several occasions, and is currently brainstorming with the owner of Mantis Pet Supplies to set up a clinic within the store that will of fer chiropractic, energy work, nutrition, and some more holistic kinds of approaches for pets. When not working, Kathleen ushers for the University Music Society: \"It's not a paid job, but it gets me into a lot of concerts.\" And since she wanted to be a designer, any time a friend calls and asks her advice for a color scheme, she is certainly more than willing to help out. She loves to cook and entertain, and she enjoys spending as much time as possible on her deck. \"I consider it an additional room of my house, and I designed it myself.\" The biggest challenge for Kathleen in her work is the clock. She sometimes has difficulty finding the balance between performing fifteen minutes' worth of work in the amount of time that insurance will cover and actually helping a client resolve \"I do a lot of blending techniques; manual manipulation in combination with the Activator, but I also do a lot of soft tissue work along with Reiki energy work. Reiki can be done in combination with other methods, or it can be booked as a separate hour session. I also do craniosacral and trauma healing work, and I may well bring a few minutes of each of these modalities into an adjustment.\" My session with Kathleen was educational, as she showed me a chart of the human spine with a list of all the organs and systems that are directly affected by the spine. She asked me some general questions about my health and then some more pointed questions about my complaints. She also asked if I had ever had manual chiropractic adjustment, which I had, or an Activator adjustment, which I had not. Kathleen asked me to stand, and she began taking a visual inventory of what my body looked like in that position. From performing this visual test, she could tell that my hips were slightly out of balance, that I tend to lean to one side rather than actually standing straight, and that my head also tends to tilt to the right. Then Kathleen had me lay down on the table and began using the Activator to treat my neck and spine. There were some areas that took several tries with the Activator before going into the proper position. She had me sit up on the table as she treated my arms and shoulder areas as well. The Activator is not painful, though the treated areas will tend to be sore to the touch over the next day or two after treatment. And it is certainly a quicker type of adjustment than manual manipulation. When I left the office, my body actually felt much better aligned. I felt as though I stood straighter, and I noticed that I had less tightness, tension, and soreness in my back, shoulders, and neck for an extended period of time. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 19 \"I will go on record to say that chiropractic is not a belief system, it is an actual science.\" In the beginning, it was just space sharing, but with the addition of another chiropractor and massage therapist, they really began to integrate their practices. It took many years of work to reach the level of professionalism, cohesiveness, and care that they currently have. Agreeing on and developing a vision and mission for the practice and creating a safe working environment, in which each practitioner has a voice, has become the glue that has held them together for 20 years. For Renee, the two best things about her work are that \"I love that I can move, and that I have the privilege to be a part of people's lives in a way that hopefully helps makes their lives more joyful and easier. I am humbled everyday by the beauty and wisdom of our beings to integrate and deal with sometimes overwhelming life experiences. I am in awe of the human being's innate sense of health.\" In addition to her work with CCBT, Renee also teaches polarity therapy in Ann Arbor and throughout southeastern Michigan, and is co-owner of the Polarity Center. Renee explained, \"Polarity therapy was developed by Dr. Randolph Stone, who was both a chiropractor and an osteopath. Dr. Stone was also very interested in Ayurveda,\" an ancient Hindu science of health and medicine. \"Polarity therapy is a reflection of his process and synthesis of combining those two modalities with Ayurveda. He also believed that energy is the substance behind all things, and that you need to address the underpinning energy block, or energetic disease, if you really want the physical to hold and maintain itself and its health.\" There are people who do not believe in energy therapy or in the value of working with an individual's energy. The simple fact is that we all have energy and each person has their own way of sensing energy, and we do so all the time. \"Sometimes you have that feeling of looking over your shoulder or around you,\" Renee said. \"There's a way in which we are in relationship [with energy] all the time, and it's a 'felt' sense. It's just one of the ways our nervous system informs us of what's safe, what's not safe, what we're attracted to, and what we're repelled by. These are things that occur all the time, and are consistently informing us of where we are, how safe something is, but it's actually so 'under the radar' that we often don't realize it is happening. There is nothing big and mysterious about energy, we're in relationship to it all the time; it's just that once you learn how to work with it, your instruction puts you into a certain frame of reference and you become more of an observer of it.\" During my session with Renee, we first sat down and talked a little bit about what she was going to do. Since it was my first visit with her, she wanted to explain the process and put my mind at ease about what would happen. Then I lay supine on the table as she began to place her hands on me in a way that suggested she was testing the flow of energy in different places throughout my body. The massage technique was extremely gentle, rather than the technique commonly associated with The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 20 in which we are in relationship [with energy] all the time, and it's a 'felt' sense. It's just one of the ways our nervous system informs us of what's safe, what's not safe, what we're attracted to, and what we're repelled by.\"\"I realized that what I was doing in computer programming was not going to make me happy for the rest of my life... Programming was good money, and my father had done it for years, so it was the image of the American Dream that I had grown up with. I had to really work hard to rid myself of that idea.\"A native of Detroit, but raised in Warren, Ren\u00e9e Rutz moved to Ann Arbor after finishing her Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and math at Kalamazoo College in 1982 to study Aikido, a Japanese martial art. Her widowed mother eventually moved to Ann Arbor, too, so Ann Arbor has truly become her home. Several of Renee's family members suffered from chronic illnesses for which traditional medical approaches did not provide relief or restore health. \"The approaches used for treatment never fully felt complete to me. There seemed to always be something missing, or it seemed that the solutions didn't leave my family feeling whole.\" Renee's first job after college was as a software engineer for Ford, where she sat in front of a computer for eight hours a day. Over time, she became depressed, unhappy, and confused. \"A dear friend of mine gave me a gift certificate for a massage and, after just one session, I could feel my old self returning and realized the importance of movement in my being.\" For curiosity's sake, she continued getting massages and attending weekend workshops to learn about massage. At about the same time, Renee was reading the book What Color Is Your Parachute? By doing some of the exercises in the book, she realized that she was a \"kinesthetic learner,\" which means she learns best by moving, doing, and touching. Always active in sports and Aikido, it was no wonder that sitting and being stationary all day caused her to experience depression. \"I realized that what I was doing in computer programming was not going to make me happy for the rest of my life. I'm just glad that I learned this early in my career, so that I could train to do something different. Programming was good money, and my father had done it for years, so it was the image of the American Dream that I had grown up with. I had to really work hard to rid myself of that idea.\" Renee began experimenting with different types of body work, taking classes for different massage approaches. She found a woman who mentored her through her exploration, and eventually took the national exam to become a licensed massage therapist. Through exploring different massage techniques, Renee had polarity therapy from Karen Kerns, and became interested in it. \"It was through my work with polarity that I began to understand things that I was feeling in my own body that nobody else talked about. It's a really beautiful model that explains how energy moves through the body and what its purpose is for the body. And it can be combined with so many other forms of body work, with tremendous results.\" Through her work in Polarity, Renee was drawn into craniosacral therapy and eventually into somatic experiencing, which is trauma resolution work within the body. \"So, when I was learning this work, I really felt like I was in the process of integrating several different types of work. And I think that all of those things have really shaped who I am today.\" After Renee left Ford, she found another job in computers. \"Thankfully ,\" she said, \"the owners of the company had the foresight to fire me and encourage me to do body work instead.\" Her bosses knew Linda Berry, introduced Renee to her, helped her buy a massage table, and then became clients of Renee' s. Linda and Renee traded services, and over time began to talk about the ways in which their modalities complemented each other. \"We both agreed that there was no one single approach, but rather that we experienced health and wholeness from a variety of angles.\" Linda had just moved into a new space with extra room, while Renee was just beginning her practice, so they joined forces at a time when integrative care was still relatively young.deep-tissue massage. It was more like a gentle \"laying on of hands,\" with a focused intention directed at a certain area. Renee began her work around the stomach area, and then slid a hand underneath my back. After settling into the process of what she was doing, I allowed myself to relax by taking some deep breaths. The process or treatment was not at all painful; I just am not the type of person who relaxes easily, so it takes a conscious effort on my part to let go. After spending some time in the midsection area, she moved up to my head and shoulder area. She spent quite a bit of time here, so I must have had a lot of energy locked in that area. And again, it was just gentle \"laying on of hands\" rather than kneading the muscle tissue. Eventually she moved to my feet, where she said that I seemed to have the least amount of energy, and so she began working to move some of it in an effort to help ground me. I had to kind of giggle to myself at this, because another energy worker had told me the same thing some weeks earlier. Overall, when I left the session, I felt more relaxed and certainly more aware of my surroundings. I know that I am not the most observant of individuals, but things definitely caught my attention after this session. My body felt alive and vibrant, and I was more aware of the connection between different parts of my body and the way they interacted with the earth beneath it, through the simple act of walking \u2014 of my feet striking upon the ground, and the vibrations sent up through my body through that contact. These are things that I do not pay attention to on a daily basis but, on this day, I couldn't help but notice the way my body and my senses interacted with the world around me. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 21 I have the privilege to be a part of people's lives in a way that hopefully helps makes their lives more joyful and easier. I am humbled everyday by the beauty and wisdom of our beings to integrate and deal with sometimes overwhelming life experiences. The Five Healers of CCBT and Office Staff (left to right) Tonia Swinton, Kathleen Dvorak, Kirsten Mowrey, Linda Berry, Brown, Lisa Fox - Del Zoppo, Audra Pope, concerns place additional pressures on all of us, and these pressures can adversely affect our health. At the same time that many find a greater need for health care, they find themselves in the difficult situation of choosing to spend money on health care or other needs.\" While she has made a living in the field of massage since graduating from massage school, Lisa also took over the bookkeeping for her husband's electrical contracting business, to fill a need. When she isn't working, she can be found with her grandson or outside. \"Being avid gardeners, birders, hikers, and paddlers, my husband and I create balance in our lives by spending time outdoors connecting with nature. We have been volunteers with the local Friends of Wildlife organization for years, and we love to travel as time and money permit.\" When I went in for my session with Lisa, she asked me whether I would like to have Swedish or deep-tissue massage or lymph drainage therapy. I'd had a deep-tissue massage once, at least ten years ago. I remembered how wonderful and revitalized I'd felt afterward. I was feeling more connected to my physical self after recently having had sessions with Linda, Kathleen, and Renee at CCBT, and I wanted to experience that more fully, so I chose the deep-tissue massage. Lisa had me start by lying on my stomach, and she began to massage and work the muscles throughout my back, arms and legs. My body immediately began to relax and feel more open. It was at this point that I really began to realize how tense, tight, and stressed that my body really had become over the years. I seem to be the kind of person who carries all of that tenseness and tightness in the back and shoulder area. Then Lisa had me turn over onto my back, where she did massage work throughout my chest, arms and legs. Afterward, she also performed lymphatic drainage massage to help reduce the swelling and discomfort caused by the sinus pressure that I often experience. The LDT massage was very similar to the deep-tissue massage, minus the pressure, and oriented around the face, head, and neck. It was a very gentle and extremely relaxing technique. Throughout the rest of the day, I realized how relaxed my body felt. There was no tightness or stiffness across my neck, shoulders, or back, and there was no pain when I moved my head to one side or the other. I could move with ease, and could turn or bend without having to mentally remind myself to do so in a certain way, so as not to create pain somewhere in my back. In a similar way to the other CCBT treatments I experienced, I felt energized and revitalized; I felt like an entirely different person! ### The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 22 Lisa Fox-Del Zoppo, NCTMB, LLCC: Massage Therapy/Lymphatic Drainage \"Cancer patients often have lymph nodes removed, which results in the lymphatic system being compromised. \"[Lymph drainage massage] is very gentle and helps the body find new pathways to continue the lymphatic flow,\" Lisa said.Lisa Fox-Del Zoppo was born and raised in Ann Arbor with a sister and two brothers. Her parents divorced when she was young and both remarried. Included in her stepfamily are three elder sisters and a brother. Both sets of parents still reside in Ann Arbor. Lisa has one daughter, Alyssa, from her first marriage, and a grandson born last year. Three years ago she remarried, changing her name from Darrow to Fox-Del Zoppo, and joined a wonderful new family of in-laws, including four stepchildren. Although she did not grow up with alternative therapies as part of her regular health regimen, Lisa was drawn to them since her first experience with them. \"When my daughter was a baby, I had a co-worker who was attending massage school. Without any background in bodywork, I was fascinated by the things she would share with me. It continued to pull at me and in 1994, when my daughter went to kindergarten, I entered massage school at the Ann Arbor Institute of Massage Therapy.\" This was during a time when Lisa's life was changing and she was becoming more self-reliant, brought about by necessity and desire. \"When I got involved in massage therapy,\" Lisa said, \"I had a sense of connectedness and grounding, and it made sense. The more I studied, the more I could visualize and appreciate the down-to-earth benefits of the skills I learned.\" Lisa has been with Complete Chiropractic and Bodywork Therapies (CCBT) for 14 years and she loves that every day is different. \"There are always opportunities to learn from my clients and colleagues and to share my experience with them. I am inspired by the incredible way the body heals itself when obstacles are removed. By assisting people who are taking steps to improve their health, I am able to witness that transformation.\" Lisa works with people afflicted by acute and chronic conditions, as well as anyone seeking preventive health maintenance. Lisa primarily works with Swedish and deep-tissue massage, as well as lymph drainage therapy (LDT). She has continued to seek out training since she graduated from AAIMT in 1995. She is nationally certified in therapeutic massage and bodywork, has been certified by the Upledger Institute in LDT, and is a member of the American Massage Therapy Association. Lisa began her training for LDT with the Upledger Institute in 2001. This system included three levels of training followed by a certification course, which she completed in 2005. Since then, Lisa continues to take training in the field. LDT was developed by the French physician Bruno Chikly, MD, to help reduce edema (swelling) by stimulating the flow of lymph fluid. The LDT technique also aids in detoxification and regeneration of tissue, and provides deep relaxation. Cancer patients often have lymph nodes removed, which results in the lymphatic system being compromised. \"This work is very gentle and helps the body find new pathways to continue the lymphatic flow,\" Lisa said. \"I've also found it to be beneficial for pre- and post-surgical patients to stimulate the lymph flow in the area, and to reduce swelling and inflammation. For these same reasons, LDT is also helpful for the healing of injuries. And, I've found it extremely helpful for patients who suffer from sinus conditions.\" Most people have been affected by the current poor economic conditions these past few years, which have caused us to reassess our priorities. \"Economic The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 23 \"I am inspired by the incredible way the body heals itself when obstacles are removed.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 24 Kirsten Mowrey was raised in Michigan, with some formative experiences living in Australia and Europe as an exchange student. \"From a young age, I was always fascinated with other cultures, other ways of living. I still am, and I enjoy traveling whenever I can.\" This provides a context for her work, because we are all products of our backgrounds, and \"of the 'stew' of values, people, and experiences that we absorbed growing up. Sometimes that history may be in conflict with what we believe as adults, and part of healing is negotiating that conflict and resolving it,\" Kirsten said. Kirsten came to Ann Arbor to attend the University of Michigan and earned her bachelor's degree in English and German. She was drawn to the work she does from a desire to help others. In her early 20's, Kirsten worked for the UM Challenge Program, \"an outdoor education ropes course that works on team building and personal and group cohesion, by working through physical obstacles. I enjoyed the work, but felt the limitations of working only with groups. I wanted to work more directly with individuals, which led me to massage school.\" Kirsten attended the Florida School of Massage in Gainesville, because Florida offers state licensing for massage therapists (Michigan is supposed to begin licensure this year). From massage school, she went on to complete the St. John Neuromuscular Workshop series, then attended the Upledger Institute for craniosacral training, both also in Florida. For trauma healing training, Kirsten went to the Center for Well Being in Arkansas, and then took Trager training. Each of those trainings took two to three years to complete, with workshops held three to four times a year. \"Trager is primarily movement work and, while it's never really discussed, there is a component of energy to it as well,\" Kirsten explained. \"Trager was developed by Milton Trager, M.D., who began just using movement with his patients to see what could be different. He experimented with the work on his father, who was very ill, as well as with many WWII veterans who were his patients. The focus of Trager is on the joints and movement; what moves and what does not, and how does it move?\" From Kirsten's own first experience with Trager, she said that she felt not only relaxed, but incredibly mobile, and had a deepened sense of herself as fluid and able to move. \"Massage focuses primarily on tissue, while Trager focuses on joints and connective tissue, and on the potential and possibility for movement.\" For Kirsten, it added an entirely new dimension to her massage work, because \"now I cannot only ask the body to relax, but I can also ask it to move, to experience movement not as effort, but rather as an effortless, flowing experience. To move with natural grace and ease, while experiencing relaxation, is a more holistic and pleasantly aware experience of life.\" Trager is meant to be gentle, and the practitioner is to be in a meditative state to become attuned to what is happening with the client lying on the table. Kirsten believes that when the practitioner puts themselves into that meditative space, they begin to experience a different level of vibration that allows them to interact with a patient on their own level, so it becomes more of an exchange or give-and-take between the practitioner and the patient. \"When I am present with a client,\" Kirsten said, \"the most important piece is that he or she feels safe, and that will dictate the direction of the session. I often ask a client if she has an intention for her session, or something she wishes to experience. This also provides direction, and further opens the possibility for dialogue that can deepen awareness.\" It is this dialogue that helps Kirsten determine which approach (trauma healing, deep tissue massage, or Trager) she will use with her client. During a session, the movements are sometimes big, and sometimes small. \"It's really dependent upon the individual you are working with and what is possible for that person in a certain movement,\" Kirsten said. She might begin with a patient gently swinging an arm, and once the patient has done that for a while, to just stop and notice what feels different. \"This pause is important, because it re-engages the cognitive brain in noticing what is different. Is there more weight or is the temperature different? Does it feel like there is more volume or does it feel longer? And you can talk about these things in more clinical terms, such as extension and flexion, or you can talk about them in more sensory terms.\" \"When you're working with the body,\" Kirsten said, \"there are many layers, and you are working with the whole\u2014the physical, the emotional, the psychological, the spiritual.\" It's necessary to bring clarity to what is requested and to decide if it is appropriate for her scope of practice. Kirsten consistently listens to what the client is experiencing and then addresses the changing need. Perhaps the client arrived with one need, but that need changed, so she must move with where the body is going. \"I try to do what I can, refer as appropriate, and be present and compassionate in that moment.\" There is not yet a lot of clinical research behind the Trager Method, though a foundation for research has been started to find out how and why it works with certain body conditions. \"All the movement work does seem to change the tissue,\" Kirsten said, \"so that people who have experienced trauma don't feel as much discomfort. It also seems to work really well with patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.\" The greatest challenge Kirsten faces with her work is the general attitude toward health. \"In Western medicine, health is usually defined as 'not ill'. That really isn't the same as feeling vibrant, whole, and full of vitality; in other words, healthy.\" Cultural attitudes toward health are similar to attitudes about owning a car; if it runs fine, you don't have to pay attention to it until something happens. But cars require maintenance such as oil changes, new tires, and fluids that need to be checked. \"The same is true for the body,\" Kirsten said. \"Not in the mechanistic sense, but that our systems change regularly, and bodywork is a way to return our attention to what is changing within ourselves. My work is focused on helping the client feel more connected, more aware, more 'good'; to take them beyond being 'not in pain'.\" On the opposite side of that, what keeps her engaged in her work is the belief that she is helping to bring joy and healing into the world. Like the hummingbird from the book The Flight of the Hummingbird, \"doing what she can\" by carrying Kirsten Mowrey, NCTMB: Trager\u00ae Method \"In Western medicine, health is usually defined as 'not ill'. That really isn't the same as feeling vibrant, whole, and full of vitality; in other words, healthy.\" \"Massage focuses primarily on tissue, while Trager focuses on joints and connective tissue, and on the potential and possibility for movement.\" For Kirsten, it added an entirely new dimension to her massage work.droplets of water from the river and releasing them over the forest fire, so too Kirsten is doing what she can. \"I want my world to be healthy, loving and aware, and I am fortunate to be able to work toward that goal every day of my professional life.\" When I walked into her office, first Kirsten had me make some movements with my body, turning my head to one side and then the other, and bending forward from the waist. As I did these things, she observed how my body actually moved. When I lay down on the table, she began her work in much the same way as Renee did with her combination of Craniosacral and Polarity Therapy, just kind of reading the energy. As Kirsten began working with my body, I noticed that the Trager technique was somewhat more vigorous than the above-mentioned methods, but still very gentle. Starting at the head and shoulder area, she began a light touch technique and worked her way down my body to my feet. After this, Kirsten began the movement aspect of the treatment that, especially in the shoulder and arm area, was reminiscent of physical therapy work I had experienced both pre- and post-surgery for a shoulder injury. She performed gentle and passive joint movement of my shoulders and arms, and then again, moved down to my legs and feet. Much of the movement was natural and similar to everyday movements that we make without even thinking about it. But some of the movements were also very different, because my body doesn't move that way every day \u2014 so it was like an instant reminder: \"Oh yeah, that joint can move in that direction as well.\" When I left the session, I felt much more in tune with my physical body . I was more consciously aware of how my body moved, and how it felt as it did so. I was suddenly aware of the physicality of the ball rolling inside the joint of my hip as I walked, or how the ball of the humerus felt inside the joint of my shoulder as I lifted my arm to reach for a cup. I guess I was somewhat surprised by the fluidity and ease of those movements. Again, part of that is likely due to the fact that I take those kinds of things for granted, as I'm sure many of us do, and don' t really pay attention to them. It was also after this particular session that I began to notice an awareness of my body; I felt less pain and stiffness, primarily, but also an overall awakening to the sensations of my body and its ability to move. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 25 \"In Western medicine, health is usually defined as 'not ill'.

Having been nowhere near a sewing machine since my crooked attempt at a sweatshirt in seventh grade home economics, I was compelled to create a challenge for myself and work to meet it. In truth, I was looking for an incentive to finally learn to use the second-hand sewing machine I'd purchased off Craig's List last summer. My initial spark of interest in sewing came while researching Transition Ann Arbor for my Green Living column for the Crazy Wisdom Journal. A main ingredient in the Transition movement is \"re-skilling\"--the notion of reclaiming sustainable skills that are dying with our elders, skills that seem unnecessary in an industrialized world. The concept of re-skilling made me realize how detached we as a society have become to how things are made, and how our lack of knowledge perpetuates unchecked consumerism. In the spirit of gaining awareness, I set out to learn to sew. I was guided along on my apron sewing project by my good friend Mary Matias, whom actually retained the skills she learned in junior high home economics. Mary taught me how to follow the grain of the fabric, measure twice and cut once, and that there are few mistakes in sewing that can't be undone. Before I even learned how to thread the bobbin on my machine, I was in love. As I held the beautiful cotton fabric in my hands, folded its edges and carefully pierced it with a pin, something stirred inside me. This simple contact awakened something in me, and I could feel myself transforming as I began to realize the possibilities suddenly open to me. As I pieced together the apron I felt empowered by the countless ways I could put my new skill to use. The completion of a well- made (and well-received) apron inspired me to make a variety of Christmas presents for my family of eight. With only two weeks during a traditionally stressful season, I worked quickly with a creative fervor I have never experienced. It was during this time of inspiration that I began to contemplate the value of working with my hands, and the positive impact it had on my life in such a short period of time. In search of a greater understanding of how using our hands impacts our lives, I spoke with others who do handiwork. They all came to work with their hands for a variety of reasons: one out of tradition, one through necessity and the last compelled by a spiritual connection. But working with their hands has granted all of them the same thing; a greater connection to themselves. I knew right away that I wanted to speak with my boyfriend's grandmother, Connie Lorenson, after seeing the beautiful dress she made to wear to her granddaughter's wedding last fall. Connie learned to sew as a fifth grader at Marian Law Elementary in Detroit, and practiced the skill by making doll clothes. \"My mother and grandmother were excellent seamstresses. My mother gave me scraps of material to make doll clothes, which I sewed by hand until I was old enough to reach the tread on the Singer machine.\" Her greater love of knitting would come a bit later. \"I started as a knitter at age twelve...Crowley-Milner's department store, as prominent as J.L. Hudson's in the early 1940s, gave free knitting and crocheting lessons to children when they purchased the supplies from the store. I first made a scarf and then graduated to gloves, mittens and sweaters.\" These knitted items were only the beginning of what would become a lifelong hobby for Connie. \"After I was married my knitted pieces included sweaters for my children and later my grandchildren. I can't count the many socks, mittens, and slippers I've knitted for gifts through the years.\" She also sewed pajamas and shirts for her children growing up, and continues to sew tablecloths and napkins, but knitting is what is closest to her heart. \"As much as I appreciate the sewing experiences in my life, I have even more passion for knitting. The display of colorful skeins of yarn--in baskets or on shelves--stirs something in my soul.\" I was excited to hear about this passion Connie has for using her hands to knit, as it resonates with my own experience of discovering work that stirs something inside. It is clear that for Connie, a lot of love is in the process. \"Y ou can sew a piece faster then you can knit a piece. Perhaps that is why I feel a personal attachment to that knitted item my hands embraced stitch by stitch.\" After speaking with someone whose experience validates my own, I found someone who has an entirely different perspective on how working with his hands impacts his life. Paul Spater has spent the last two years restoring a house he purchased on my street in the fall of 2007. A retired bookseller and the owner of the acclaimed Books in General, Paul's only prior experience doing handiwork was when he decided to build the bookcases for his bookstore as a \"There are a lot of people looking for answers. They buy books and hope they're going to find it, but the answer is right here, that's what I think. The answer is right in your hands.\" ~ Paul Spater \"As much as I appreciate the sewing experiences in my life, I have even more passion for knitting. The display of colorful skeins of yarn--in baskets or on shelves--stirs something in my soul.\" ~ Connie Lorenson Knitted trivet by Connie LorensonThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 26 way to save money. Though Books in General has since closed, the hand-built cases were often admired and added a certain intention to his shop. Having a somewhat preconceived idea of the value of working with our hands, I was somewhat surprised in speaking with Paul, that he hadn't been moved to work on his house the way Connie or I have been to knit and sew . That's not to say that the work he does with his hands holds no value, only that for Paul, its value comes from how it connects him to the the community around him. Paul's decision to purchase the house was spur of the moment, so a lot of the work he's done is through necessity. But in working on the house, he has come to build a relationship with it, and members of his neighborhood. \"While working on the outside of the house, many people in the neighborhood have stopped to chat and express admiration for my efforts. These people have their own stories of working on their houses and the time and ef fort required.\" To Paul, this social connection is a valuable part of the work he's doing. \"To have interaction with people\u2014I think it's really important, but I think it's easier to engage in that if you're actually doing things...when you have something in common, something to talk about.\" Restoring an old house has also allowed Paul to see things with new eyes, and appreciate the work that is put into how things are made. \"I would walk around the neighborhood and see how professional painters handled certain tasks.\" His observations would then inform his own work, and Paul has received even more helpful advice, and compliments, from professional contractors who stop to talk as they walk by. Paul feels that having this chance to interact with others is what's missing in our world today. \"It provides you with a way of interacting, [of] finding out what people are doing. And to me, I think it's sort of the antithesis of the way we're headed\u2014sort of the Brave New World where people don't have interactions.\" For Paul, remedying this all starts with getting back to using our hands. \"There are a lot of people looking for answers. They buy books and hope they're going to find it, but the answer is right here, that's what I think. The answer is right in your hands.\" In speaking with Paul I realized he is moved by the relationships his work has helped create. I knew I had to speak with woodworker Will Balice after hiring him to build a counter top that ended up transforming my tiny kitchen into a place I wanted to be. It was evident in talking with Will that his relationship to his craft is of a very personal and spiritual nature. A lighthearted and charasmatic man, Will's eyes light up even more the moment he starts talking about wood. \"It starts with pure love. You see the piece of furniture in your mind, and you see the wood, and you see the grain and color. You see the tree the wood once was, and all you can think is: here is this precious, amazing, lovely bit of earth on my bench. What a miracle.\" Will's passion for woodworking has recently inspired him to follow his heart and develop an idea he's been contemplating for a while; he is now the proud owner of Haven Fine Carpentry, which specializes in collaborative efforts with other local artists to create beautiful spaces. Now deeply acquainted with wood, Will's interest was sparked on a job during his early years of carpentry work. \"We were framing an addition, and as I made another cut into a piece of lumber, a cloud of saw dust flew into my face. My eyes burned and my tongue tasted the tree that once was. It was then that I knew -- wood was in my blood, and from me, the wood could continue to live, that it would always be my friend.\" As a young boy, Will often took walks in the woods where he gained great reverence and admiration for trees, understanding that they were both his ancestors and his keepers. He continues to hold this reverence for the wood he works with today. \"Woodworking, and sharing such closeness with earth's beauty, The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 27 Will Balice Further Reading on the Value of Handiwork Check out these titles, all available at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore Made by Hand: Searching for Meaning in a Throwaway World by Mark Frauenfelder (Portfolio, 9781591843320, $25.95).

This is a fascinating book that explores the many benefits of knitting, including knitting as a form of meditation, creative expression, therapy and a way to connect generations. This book will resonate with anyone who does craft work, as Bernadette Murphy expertly articulates the reasons why handicraft is so fulfilling. \"It starts with pure love. You see the piece of furniture in your mind, and you see the wood, and you see the grain and color.

What a miracle.\" ~ Will Balice Continued on page 28The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 28 reminds me that nothing is dead in the sense of 'lifeless'. Wood is cut, dried, and then crafted into a new shape, it's finished with an oil or spray , and even after all that, the wood will still move, it still vibrates and still holds life within it...to hold a bit of un-dying nature in your hands, to know that you can feel the pulse of the earth within your palm, it has given me happiness that is never lonely .\" In speaking with Connie Lorenson, Paul Spater and Will Balice, it became clear to me that they view the work they do with their hands dif ferently. For Connie, making things with her hands is a way of life, a part of her identity she would feel lost without. The practical skills learned as a child have been gifts in her life that allow her to give to others. To Paul, the ability to work with his hands has been a means to an end, but a labor of love. And in the learning process, he's gained a valuable connection to the community around him. Will's work connects him to the very soul of his craft and to the earth itself. Through it he has gained an understanding of his relationship to life itself. Through my own experience I feel a connection to each of their stories. Out of a personal sense of necessity I taught myself a practical skill I've already used to give to others. And in the process, got in touch with a part of myself I could not reach any other way. Perhaps it is the connection we make with ourselves that makes all the other benefits possible. As Will Balice says, \"Life begins with what is in your heart, and manifests itself into what is in your hands. Listen to the beauty in your heart, and express it for others to enjoy .\" ###From Our Hearts to Our Hands Continued from page 27 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 29 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 30 Bill Zirinsky: Oran, you have said that Fair Food Network is working at the intersection of food systems sustainability and food equity. Please explain what you mean by that. Oran Hesterman: Fair Food Network is a national nonprofit dedicated to building a more just and sustainable food system. We work at the intersection of food systems, sustainability and equity to guarantee access to healthy, fresh and sustainably grown food, especially in underserved communities. We implement model programs and bring the right people together to generate ideas, share resources and promote policy changes that will repair our food system. We are faced with a broken food system that undermines the wellbeing of people, the environment and the economy. Our current food system leaves many communities without equitable access to healthy food. Neighborhoods dominated by fast food chains and convenience stores are prevalent in underserved communities nationwide. Diet-related illnesses such as diabetes and childhood obesity are reaching a crisis point, and disproportionately afflict low-income communities and communities of color. Current production, processing, and distribution systems have serious, negative impacts on workers and the environment. The people who pick, process, deliver and serve our food are underpaid, live in poor conditions and often work in hazardous environments. Many current farming methods are contaminating our air , soil, and water. Our food system needs a re-design and Fair Food Network is dedicated to working with others to bring about a food system that is more sustainable and equitable. Bill Zirinsky: You had previously been the Executive Director of the Fair Food Foundation. How was that structured differently from FFN, and what happened to it? Oran Hesterman: Fair Food Foundation was a private foundation fully funded by a family who wished to dedicate their wealth to a philanthropic or ganization with a mission to provide access to healthy, fresh food to historically excluded populations. They asked me to take the leadership of this new foundation because they understood my dedication to this same vision. For a year and a half I created the structure, systems, and hired a stellar staff to move this vision forward on a regional and national level. Unfortunately, this family lost their ability to continue funding the Fair Food Foundation when Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme was uncovered. Virtually overnight, just as we had really hit the ground running, we needed to close our doors. But the good news is that, shortly thereafter in 2009, I incorporated Fair Food Network as a nonprofit organization, and it is moving energetically forward with a similar vision and mission but with a nonprofit, public charity , organizational structure. BZ: You have had a long career in philanthropy, working as the Food and Society Programs Director at the Kellogg Foundation. Please tell us about your work with the Kellogg Foundation, and how that relates to the important work you're now doing with the Fair Food Network. Hesterman: I led the sustainable agricultural grant-making program at Kellogg Foundation for 17 years. In 1991, I helped Kellogg Foundation initiate the Integrated Farming Systems program that funded projects focused on local and sustainable farming practices and production systems. It became clear that to repair the broken food system we needed to change not just individual farms and individual consumers but to support change at the local and national levels through informing public policy to create systemic change. Over the years at Kellogg Foundation, I had the opportunity to help the Foundation invest over $200 million in projects and organizations nation-wide that have all been working to create a more sustainable food system in the U.S. These projects, organizations, and leaders have become the base of the Good Food Movement that we see taking root in so many communities and institutions. Can you tell us about the current programs of the Fair Food Network?Hesterman: Double Up Food Bucks is Fair Food Network's Double Value Bonus Token Project that provides incentives for families who receive food assistance benefits (SNAP, or Food Stamps) to buy healthier food by increasing their purchasing power for fresh fruits and vegetables. When Food Stamp customers shop at a farmer's market, the amount they spend is matched with Double Up Food Bucks bonus tokens to purchase any Michigan-grown fruit or vegetable. This concept, already piloted in Detroit and several other cities in the U.S., demonstrates that a small incentive can shift buying and eating habits and result in healthier outcomes for low-income families. Without such an incentive, tens of billions of public dollars allotted through food stamps are being spent on nutritionally inadequate foods. Double Up Food Bucks will also provide a badly needed boost to the local food economy by increasing demand for locally grown produce. All local growers can benefit \u2014 from traditional farmers, to urban gardeners, to locally owned small groceries, farmers' markets and farm stands. The Good Food Social Enterprise Laboratory is an education and training program for entrepreneurs in the nonprofit sector who want to become more adept at creating revenue-generating enterprises for their Questions for Oran Hesterman about the Good Food Revolution Oran Hesterman is the director of the Fair Food Network, based in Ann Arbor. He led the sustainable agricultural grant-making program at the Kellogg Foundation for 17 years, and is one of the nation's leaders in the sustainable food revolution which has spread like a prairie fire across the country in recent years. \"I'm writing a book about the need for the good food revolution and the heroes who are already developing this vision into a reality. It is time to create a food system that fosters healthy families, healthy communities, and a healthy environment. The Good Food Revolution lays out a vivid, concrete vision of how we can shape the food culture in our homes, communities, and in the public sphere.\" \"Being 'plate-centric' means that we relate to the food system primarily by what goes into and comes out of our refrigerators. We will need to move beyond the refrigerator, to engage as active citizens, and all of us take responsibility for our collective food system, in order for the system re-design to happen.\" Photo by Sarah Neeleyorganizations. We piloted this project last Winter with about 10 leaders and plan to expand the program this fall. Informing Public Policy is an important part of our programmatic structure at Fair Food Network. If we are going to build a truly sustainable food system for the future, we need to not only demonstrate good practices on the ground, we also need to have the community-based work inform future public policy. To that end, Fair Food Network has a presence in DC, working with policy makers at the US Department of Agriculture and on Capitol Hill. We are interested in helpting to inform the future Farm Bill around food assistance and nutrition policy so that it can better serve the nutritional needs of low-income families, while supporting local food economies and local farmers. Assisting foundations and funder collaboratives to make good investments in the area of sustainable food and agriculture is another focus of Fair Food Network. With our long experience of funding projects in this field, we are able to advise other funders about what projects make the most sense to invest in, given their strategic goals. You have emphasized that people with low income have the least access to healthy, organically grown foods. Please elaborate on that, and specifically tell us about the situation in southeastern Michigan, and in Detroit. Hesterman: There is a $1 billion food economy in Detroit. About $450 million - 45% is composed of food purchased with federal food assistance (food stamps). 60% of all redemptions are at liquor stores, convenience and corner stores, few of which carry any fresh fruits or vegetables. Detroit is the 11 th largest city in the US, and there is not a single major super market left in the entire city. While Detroit is a stark example of what USDA has termed a \"food desert\", this is the situation in virtually all underserved or historically-excluded communities across the country. Organizations similar to the Fair Food Network are sprouting forth around the country. Over the course of your years at Kellogg, you helped to build this network of food equity and sustainability organizations around the country. Please tell us more. Hesterman: As a decision-maker in the largest funding program in sustainable agriculture and food systems, I have funded (as I noted earlier) over $200 million of grants to well over one hundred organizations. I have also had the opportunity to review many hundreds of proposals from those individuals and their organizations who have shared with me their thinking and their most creative ideas about how we can improve the food system in our communities and beyond. Many of these organizations have become the leaders of the Good Food Movement, and this network is responsible for much of the work happening on this issue in communities around the country. I am drawing upon all this experience in my new position as President and CEO of Fair Food Network. For a few moments, take us back two and three decades. Take us back to when talking about our food system wasn't a very popular thing to be talking about. Hesterman: When I was a new professor in the Crop and Soil Science Department at Michigan State University in the mid-1980's, trying to have a serious conversation about organic farming or sustainable agriculture was not possible. There was no recognition of any problem with our food system. Only in the last 10-15 years has there been a new awareness that the food system is as broken as any of the other systems, such as our health care system or our education system. Now it is more acceptable to talk about the broken food systems. But when I started a new organization at The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 31 \"Only in the last 10-15 years has there been a new awareness that the food sys - tem is as broken as any of the other systems, such as our health care system or our education system.\" Continued on page 32 Photo courtesy of Fair Food Network At Eastern Market in Detroit The Fair Food Network's Double Up Food Bucks project provides incentives for families who receive food assistance benefits (SNAP, or Food Stamps) to buy healthier food by increasing their purchasing power for fresh fruits and vegetables. \"There is a $1 billion food economy in Detroit.

You've called our food system \"a runaway train\". Is it irretrievably broken, compromised, out of control? Hesterman: If you're like many Americans, you have spent much of your life treading the well-worn path between the kitchen and the supermarket without giving much thought to where the food you eat comes from. But if you look around, you will see a growing number of signs that our food system is reaching a crisis point. The system that was meant to bring us abundant food at low cost while maintaining rural economies is endangering what's most precious to us: our environment, our health, our soil and water, and our future. There is chemical runoff from agriculture in our waterways; soaring rates of diet-related illness in our inner-city communities; loss of prime farmland to urban and suburban sprawl; corporate concentration that delivers 80% of our meat from only four suppliers and 42% of all groceries from just three retailers. These are not problems that can be solved one by one. If we try to create a healthy food system by solving individual problems, we will likely create more unintended consequences. Instead, we need to view these as symptoms of a lar ger system that is broken and out of control, like a runaway train. There are many reasons for the current state of the food system, primary among them, decades of bad public policy. The good news is that many people, those I think of as the heroes of the new Good Food Revolution, have been working for a couple of decades to help us see how to bring this runaway train under control, and there are glimpses of this starting to happen. There is SO much interest in food, right now. Locally grown food. Organic food. Sustainable farming practices. Growing, buying, eating local. Why is the food system riding this wave of interest? Has the wave peaked? Hesterman: My sense is that it is still building. Signals are everywhere such as the change of leadership at USDA and the explosion of farmers markets and CSAs. My belief is that this movement has a lot more growing to do to bring about the change needed to repair this broken system Most of the wave we have seen building is still based on individual families and their relation to their refrigerator . As more of us make the transition from conscious consumer to engaged citizen, we will see policy change start to take place, which will be the real sign of systems change in the food system. On a more personal level, what has aroused people's interest so much? Is it diet-related illness, is it food safety, is it public policy, is it economics --- why are people caring so much now, about the food they eat?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 32 Hesterman: My direct experience says that people initially wake up because of some personal experience that is often health related either in their own personal life or the life of a loved one. For example, there is new research connecting the use of certain pesticides and increased incidence of ADHD in children. As parents of young children read this information, they are aware of the health impact on those we love of the food we eat, and they will be more mindful of the kinds of produce they choose for their children. Will you talk about staying \"plate-centric\"...and say more about our morphing from conscious consumers to engaged citizens? Hesterman: This building of conscious awareness among consumers is really important AND it is only one aspect of the wave we are experiencing. The transition from conscious consumer to engaged citizen is what will take this wave and cause it to create the kind of significant change that is needed for the system to get back on track. It is important for each of us to take personal responsibility for the food system we create in our homes and our families. Being \"plate-centric\" means that we relate to the food system primarily by what goes into and comes out of our refrigerators. We will need to move beyond the refrigerator, to engage as active citizens, and all of us take responsibility for our collective food system, in order for the system re-design to happen. You have said that childhood obesity \"isn't a problem we can solve\". Please elaborate. Hesterman: Childhood obesity is a symptom of the system similar to environmental pollution or the poor treatment of farm workers. Rather than solve problems one by one, it is far better to redesign the system. You are hoping that some of the Fair Food Network's on-the-ground projects will help inform public policy. How? Hesterman: Ultimately the best public policy is policy that is informed by direct experience in the communities. We will have a very sophisticated evaluation procedure for our Double Up Food Bucks that will analyze the effect of the program on the health of the consumers, the economic viability of the farmers' markets and the profits to the small farmers. In this way, we can have hard data to illustrate the effectiveness of this program and the need to expand it and other similar programs to underserved populations. As policy makers learn about this project, and others like it, they can understand how public policy could be shifted to support programs like this. Why do you call the Fair Food Network a 'network'?Hesterman: It truly is a network and a collaboration between farmers, producers, distributors, inner city food activists, consumers, farmers markets, and CSAs, the USDA, food coalitions, anti-poverty groups, academics, and all people who are interested in ensuring a healthy diet for Americans. I see FFN as an organization that brings people and ideas and resources together to benefit our community . You are writing a book. Why are you writing it, and what is it focused on? What will you cover in the book? Hesterman: I'm writing a book about the need for the good food revolution and the heroes who are already developing this vision into a reality. It is time to create a food system that fosters healthy families, healthy communities, and a healthy environment. The Good Food Revolution lays out a vivid, concrete vision of how we can shape the food culture in our homes, communities, and in the public sphere. My hope is that by writing about my experience with the Good Food Movement for close to 40 years, and by highlighting success being achieved in many small projects, I can help inspire others to action and help them connect with organizations and leaders across the country who are dedicating themselves to building a better food system for our children and grandchildren. If people want to know more, and engage on this subject, how do they contact you and the Fair Food Network? Hesterman: Please sign onto our website at www.fairfoodnetwork.org and you will receive periodic updates about our work.

In addition to being our Sustainable Health columnist, Judy Stone is also a board member of the Michigan Nutrition Association.) By Judy StoneThose of us living in southeastern Michigan are incredibly fortunate to have an enormous talent pool of alternative health practitioners from whom to draw. But a pending law in Lansing is poised to make it illegal for most holistic nutritionists to practice in the state, effectively gutting your freedom to choose who you go to for nutritional help. For those of you who value being able to choose to work with a holistic health counselor, a raw foods coach, a holistically trained, certified nutritionist, or any other variety of nutrition professional who is not a Registered Dietitian (RD), this is the story of why you are close to losing the right to make that choice. This is real, and it is imminent. In 2006, the legislature passed Public Act 333, a law requiring nutritionists and dietitians to be licensed. Regulatory laws are most often sought when one professional group wants to protect its economic turf and this case is no different. Since the 1980's, the American Dietetic Association (ADA), and its state chapters, have been lobbying state by state to enact laws that would legally insure them a close-to-monopoly in the field of nutrition. Unfortunately, in large part, they have been successful; 47 states, including Michigan, have laws, in many cases substantially restrictive ones, governing the field of nutrition. One of the most RD-friendly and restrictive laws in the country exists in neighboring Ohio, which is actively enforcing those restrictions through vigorous prosecution. Once this law passed, Governor Granholm took applications and appointed the Michigan Dietetics and Nutrition Board (MiDNB) to write the specifics of how the law is to be applied--who can call themselves by what title, and what a person has to do in order to qualify. Almost no one but the Michigan Dietetics Association, who lobbied for the law, knew it had passed. Also, Public Act 333 declares that only RD's are eligible to fill the 5 professional positions! Two very RD-friendly public members have the other two spots. The biased board composition, and why, four years after the law's passage, the rules are still being developed, is emblematic of the fight behind this law. With cozy financial relationships with corporate food and drug sponsors, and decades of functioning as organized trade groups, the state dietetic associations have had a relatively easy time getting favorable legislation passed under the radar. It has helped their cause that there is no single organization representing the range of professionals who employ nutrition counseling but are trained outside of traditional dietetics programs. Many go through credentialing bodies, which give titles such as Certified Clinical Nutritionist (CCN), Certified Nutrition Specialist (CNS), or Holistic Health Counselor (HHC), based on prescribed coursework, a comprehensive exam, or a combination of both. The upside of this alphabet soup of nutrition training is that the field of nutrition has grown tremendously in the last two decades providing a breadth and accessibility of training that meets the growing interest on the part of the public for more prevention, less medically-based treatment, and a desire for healthier food. We've reached a tipping point that has brought with it an acceptance of, and movement towards, the integration of therapeutic nutrition in health care. People in unprecedented numbers, fed up with 5-minute-here's-your-prescription doctor visits, are seeking nutrition as both prevention and treatment. The non-dietetics training programs have birthed the field of Complementary / Alternative Nutrition. To be sure the ADA has anxiously been watching this garden grow with great calculation as to how to reap the harvest. In their spring 2010 newsletter, the Michigan Dietetic Association president had this to say about the Michigan licensure law: \"The Licensure Committee is currently establishing the rules and regulations. MDA received some national insight on how we can best proceed to ensure that our scope of practice is not infringed upon by inadequately trained wannabes.\"(http://www.eatrightmich.org/mdaLink/pdf/Spring2010LINK%2Epdf Whoa! \"Our scope of practice\"? \"Inadequately trained wannabes\"? This insulting, arrogant, and frankly uneducated statement frames the licensing issue. Clearly dietitians see themselves as having ownership of the entire field of nutrition. But does the public? In fact, not. An ADA-commissioned nutrition trends survey of consumers, in 2008, indicated that despite efforts to position themselves as \" the nutrition experts\", 78% of respondents named both nutritionists and dietitians as credible sources of nutrition information. Also, consumers, by a margin of 3 to 1, perceive that nutritionists and dietitians are different. While the ADA would like to interpret this as evidence of top dog status, there is zero data to suggest that the public sees RD's as any more or less qualified than other nutrition professionals. In their own Journal of the American Dietetic Association (March 2005), an article titled \" A look at the educational preparation of the health-diagnosing and treating professions: Do dietitians measure up?\", the authors concluded: dieticians don't. \"Basic educational requirements for dietitians were developed almost 80 years ago and remain largely unchanged.\" The field of dietetics grew out of home economics in the early 1900's. Although, early on, it included rigorous science and was not, and is not, by any means, a flimsy education, the majority of dietetics training is aimed at preparing professionals for food service management and hospital-based dietetics. Over 40% of the RD certifying exam questions are related to food service management, government food programs, and food science. But the face of nutrition has changed, as have the needs and desires of the nutrition consumer. And dietetics education has not kept up. Even RD's who want holistic training have to go elsewhere for it. While dietetic associations were dissing supplements as unproven, touting the food pyramid, and funding themselves with money from Hershey's, Pepsi, Kellogg's, Mars, and ConAgra, the public went in search of a different kind of help. That segment of the population that coined the phrase ' you are what you eat', rejects symptom-based health care, and finds something flagrantly and seriously immoral in corporate controlled, nutrient-negative \"food\", is the same segment of the population that has spawned an entirely separate system of nutrition education, attracting thousands of practitioners who deliberately said, 'no thank you' to the dietetics model. The \"RD\" is likely the most recognized nutrition credential. The battle over the guts of the licensure law centers on whether that fact, along with purchased lobbying power, equates with being the standard by which all nutritionists, nutrition education, and credentialing options should be measured. To the Michigan Dietetic Association, and its parent ADA, the answer is yes. And they are hell-bent on using this licensure law to force themselves on the public. Currently, under the proposed rules, non-RD nutrition professionals of varying credentials will face requirements that will, in effect, put many out of business because of the heavy burden of time and money required to comply. While the rules aren't final yet, there clearly are not the votes on the board to win substantial change. Yet there is hope. The Michigan Nutrition Association, a coalition of multidisciplinary practitioners who use nutrition in their work, has formed, and it is actively fighting to protect nutrition in Michigan. MNA represents the interests of both professionals and consumers who will be affected by this drastic law. Several national organizations advocating free choice in health care have thrown their organizing support to the Michigan Nutrition Association and Michigan citizens. As the fight gets close to the wire, there are signs that public outcry is having an impact. After the Board passes its final set of rules, likely this November, the Michigan Department of Community Health, which will have to implement these rules, is required to hold a public hearing. Anyone can go, and speak, and any reasonable objection must go back to the board for reconsideration. One section of the law under scrutiny is this: \"The department, in consultation with the board, shall not promulgate rules under this section that diminish competition or exceed the minimum level of regulation necessary to protect the public.\" To those who favor holistic health and choice, these stipulations are far from being met. The proposed rules are excessive, far beyond what is needed to safeguard citizens, and would eliminate your right to choose from whom you seek nutrition help. By their own declaration, the clear intent of the rules is to protect the turf of the Michigan Dietetic Association. Those who want to protect nutrition in Michigan must speak up to push back against overly restrictive rules. I urge all Sustainable Health readers to visit the MNA website, www.michigannutritionassociation.org, to learn more about the proposed rules, how you might be affected, and what actions you can take. ### (Author's correction: In my last column, Thinning Facts, Thinning Bones , I incorrectly wrote the Vitamin D test as 1-25 (OH) Vitamin D.

(Karen and David Ufer are long-time, deeply rooted Ann Arbor yoga teachers. They are well-known and well-liked, and widely respected. They have both been teaching yoga since 1984, and were certified in 1993. Karen, 63, runs the Yoga Focus studio on Packard, and both of them teach classes there. David, 59, is also an owner (with his brother, Tom) of the Ufer Group, Inc., an insurance business. The Ufers are the parents of two grown sons: Ben, 32, and Evan, 29. Ben and his wife, Lara, live in Manhattan with their young son, David James. Ben works in banking. Evan and his bride-to-be, Rachel, live in Chicago, and Evan is in the graduate school of business at the University of Chicago. Karen was raised in a small town in Wisconsin. She moved to Ann Arbor (from Vermont) in 1974, and graduated from the U of M. David grew up in Ann Arbor, and then graduated from Indiana University in 1973, having majored in History and Religion. His father, Bob Ufer, was the much loved voice of Michigan football from 1946-1981. The Ufers were married 34 years ago in the backyard of the house they still live in -- a beautifully restored farm house on 100+ acres west of town. Their dog, Charlie, was the only one in their wedding party - he wore a white bow tie. The photographs that accompany this interview were taken at their home.)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 34 Interviewed by Bill Zirinsky Photography by Rachael Waring Bill Zirinsky : Karen, please tell us the story of your early yoga practice. Karen Ufer: I took my first yoga class at the Ann Arbor YMCA in 1975. A friend, Dale Simmerman, recommended yoga to help my lower back pain. The class helped almost immediately, but quite honestly, I then only practiced when my back hurt. Gradually, both the compelling method and philosophy as taught by Mr. Iyengar's teachers at the Y motivated me to practice. I remember being told by one of my teachers, Susie Vidrih, after showing up for my third class one week, to go home and practice. It was devastating, like being thrown out of the nest. It was also the beginning of a commitment. Bill Zirinsky : David, what is the story of your yoga practice back in the 1970's?David Ufer: As one of the first yoga teachers in Ann Arbor in the mid-1960's, Barbara Rose shared her love and understanding of the practice with friends and students at the Ann Arbor Y . When Barbara left town to join the newly formed Peace Corp, she asked Mary Palmer to carry on with the teaching. A gathering of students joined Mary and began practicing together. This group included Priscilla Neel, Barbara Linderman and soon thereafter, Susie Vidrih. On a recommendation from across her dining room table from the world-renowned violinist, Yehudi Menuhin, who was in town to perform at Hill Auditorium, Mary, soon thereafter, flew to India to study with Mr. Menuhin's yoga teacher. Upon her return, she persuaded the Y to invite this relatively unknown 50-year-old from Pune, India by the name of BKS Iyengar, to come to Ann Arbor. These 1973 Ann Arbor's Leading Yoga Couple Talk about Parenting and Marriage, Graceful Aging, and Transformation The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Karen and David Ufer on the Gifts of a Lifelong Practice of YogaKaren Ufer: Our sons, now grown, never knew a time when we were not involved in a home yoga practice. I do remember when their friends came over, we were under strict orders to not wear our yoga shorts or stand on our head. Life never stops, so sometimes that meant helping quiz our kids on spelling while doing standing poses. Perhaps this was early multi-tasking. BZ: Can you remember back to stories or anecdotes that reflect on the ways in which your yoga practices were interwoven with your parenting? Karen Ufer: The practice of yoga teaches the development and art of giving attention. That simple definition is the first understanding I had of yoga and it stands the test of time. Parenting also requires constant attention, being present. Our kids must have recognized something about attention, too. I remember a day when I was particularly crabby and one of our sons asked if I had done my yoga practice yet! More importantly, I think they saw the value of discipline and commitment by example and not by imposition. David Ufer: Could the whole Star Wars Saga not be included? It had such appeal as a religious-myth story. Luke Skywalker was on a lifelong quest for personal meaning, his search for a family. He moves into a new reality, which is an understanding of the Force as some concept of good. In the process he finds a new family. At its heart it is a tale of conversion and redemption. George Lucas's group put together a story that speaks to the human thirst for meaning and connection, human connection. The root of the term yoga, in Sanskrit, is yuj, to join, connect, to unite. Whether it's from Carl Jung or George Lucas or BKS Iyengar, the observation that one can never understand the true nature of light, or grace or love until one has taken a good look at the darkness is spot on. The practice of both parenting and yoga, if we are paying attention, reveal to us our own \"black holes\".classes at the Ann Arbor Y would become the first to be taught by Mr. Iyengar in the United States. In 1972, I was a hippie playing water polo on the Indiana University team, when a leg injury ended my athletic career. After college, I returned to Ann Arbor to attend business school, coaching the Y swim team on the side. It was now a few years after the accident, and it was becoming evident to me that I needed to do something about my leg, as a dull ache in my leg and hip never seemed to subside. Physical pain is a good motivator. With encouragement from a dear friend and co-worker at the Y , primarily to rehab my leg, I enrolled in a beginning yoga session. I began studying with Priscilla and Susie and also Mary and Barbara, and when Mr. Iyengar returned again to Ann Arbor to teach, I took my first class with him and witnessed, first hand, this man's genius. In the basement of the old VFW, below Seva on Liberty St., old peanut shells on the floor and stale beer smells wafting from the bar, my life changed. In returning to my hometown in 1973, little did I know I would be landing pretty much on the ground floor of what is now a world wide yoga movement. BZ: When did each of you begin to teach? Karen Ufer: I applied for the teacher apprenticeship program at the Ann Arbor Y in the early 1980's. There was no formal certification program in those days. We were required to take a class, observe a class, and assist in a class for 2-3 years with a senior teacher. My first teaching experience was to be the substitute for my teachers when they went away. You can imagine how thrilled folks were to see the apprentice in the front of the room. I started Yoga Focus in 1995, but taught first at the Ann Arbor and Jackson Y's as well as the Ann Arbor and Saline Recreation Departments. David Ufer: After eight years as a student in their classes, I began to apprentice with these same teachers at the Y , observing and assisting. With Susie's encouragement, I conjured up the courage and confidence to share my practice in front of a group. In 1984, I taught for the first time for the Parks and Recreation Community Program at Bach School, and soon thereafter began to also teach for the Y . In 1994, when Karen established her studio, Yoga Focus, with Ada Cowan, I was pleased to be asked to also join her teaching staff. BZ: Your boys are now adults. How did your practice of yoga work around your parenting when the boys were young? David Ufer: Their mom and I probably embarrassed them from time to time when one of their friends would come over, and Karen or I was in head balance. We were together at the Y Yoga Camp Al-Gon-Quian, on the shores of Burt Lake in Northern Michigan, for a short time each summer --for ten years -- when Ben and Evan were quite young. I heard Fred Rogers say shortly before his death, \"Our culture values information over wonder and activity over silence.\" Anyone who has experienced the August Northern lights over Burt Lake, or a walk through the Pines to bubbling brook, knows about wonder and silence. Yoga and parenting both, from time to time, value wonder and silence. Practicing yoga postures is a matter of hearing - the ear - must listen to the body to know if the body is ready to go further. Is this not also a valuable practice as a parent? The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 35 Continued on page 36 There is no prescription for graceful aging. I hope to keep practicing (yoga) in some way until the day I die. Someone once told me just think how easy the poses will be when we drop the physical body! Maybe that is heaven. --- Karen Ufer BZ: And, more generally, any thoughts about couples practicing yoga together? David Ufer: I say practice yoga. Together, alone, 95 degrees temp, or 5 degrees temp, early, late, for richer or poorer, practice yoga. --- David UferBoth of our sons are good athletes. I hope the many hands-on leg stretches and hip openers, before and after track events and tennis matches, are as fond memories for them as they are for me. BZ: What might you like to share with us about your yoga practices in the next phase of your lives -- in the 80's and 90's? Karen Ufer: When you are not a kid in your 20's and 30's, the study of yoga moves beyond the physical, the muscular. The technique is important but is not the end itself. The first time I went to India, I realized that I could not possibly absorb it all. The sheer expansiveness of the subject was beyond the grasp. Strangely enough that was a relief. To have a lifetime to study and never run out of discovery! The inside joke in yoga is that the stiffest muscle in the body is the brain. We all get that one. David Ufer: Being a student in daily classes taught each day by Mr. Iyengar at his home yoga institute in Pune, India in the 80's and then with his daughter, Geeta Iyengar, in the 90's, are memories I cherish. Although we did not attend intensives together because of parenting responsibilities, Karen and I took turns. Through these years we both had the privilege of learning at a site that carries Mr. Iyengar's wife's name: The Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute . Ann Arbor's Mary Louise Dunn, whose teaching lit up the last quarter century for so many in the US and around the world, continues to inspire after her passing. Manouso Manos and Lois Steinberg, who began to teach workshops here in the 80's and 90's, are remarkable senior teachers in the Iyengar tradition, and they have continued to return to teach here in Ann Arbor each year. BZ: You two are, arguably, Ann Arbor's leading \"yoga couple\"\u2014that is, you both teach yoga, you teach at the same studio which Karen founded, and you've been married for a very decent interval. How has yoga affected your relationship? You, first, David. And then Karen. David Ufer: I don't know. I say that with a smile because in the 34 years we have been together there has never been a time when yoga was not in our lives. We didn't meet in a yoga class, but we well could have as we both began as students about the same time. When asked why he practices the yoga asanas or postures, B.K.S. Iyengar once answered, \"Because of how I feel after my practice.\" This rings true to me and to experience that feeling with someone whom you love is a pure joy. Karen made a business decision in 1994 to open her own yoga studio. At the time she set up her own business plan and has adhered to that plan quite successfully. As a person who has participated in the business community for over 35 years, and has seen many locally owned business come and go, I respect what she has done. Karen Ufer: Marriage and yoga is perhaps the most interesting and the most elusive. We rarely practice together and yet the practice is pervasive in our conversation. Not the conversation about technique, that can always be learned, but more about daily observations: learning from mistakes, opportunities missed or taken, a new thoughtfulness, a stiff brain response. There is a continual balancing act for each of us between distraction and consciousness. By definition, habit is not conscious practice. Marriage is a daily practice of being conscious. Anyone can do a vacation well. BZ: And, more generally, any thoughts about couples practicing yoga together? Marriage is a daily practice of being conscious. Anyone can do a vacation well. --- Karen UferThe Crazy Wisdom Interview with Karen and David Ufer on the Lifelong Practice of YogaThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 36 Continued from page 35 We learn to stretch the arms and legs in practicing yoga, to twist, bend and invert the body and to breathe more fully, all of which benefit the bones, muscles, nerves and glands. Every bit as important, if not more so, is the benefit of practice to the mind. We challenge the mind, so often dwelling in the past or anticipating the future, to focus on the present. --- David UferDavid Ufer: I say practice yoga. Together, alone, 95 degrees temp, or 5 degrees temp, early, late, for richer or poorer, practice yoga. Karen Ufer: I am enormously grateful we both study and practice yoga. It gives our marriage a strong, common bond I could not do without. To be honest, a daily practice of anything together creates bonds of understanding. Yoga is not the answer for everyone. I also believe that one partner can support and appreciate the practice of yoga by the other. BZ: When in the day do you each practice yoga?Karen Ufer: I practice in the mornings when I do not teach. In the afternoons I do inversions. Many days I practice both times. Continuous time away from teaching is wonderful because then I am practicing and learning for myself. I can check in and decide what I need and not what I have to do. But time has to be put into the practice to have options: what to do for stif f hips, what for fatigue, what for a sore back. There are no guarantees. Just because you practice does not translate to a long life. It would be wrong practice to allow yoga to make you feel invulnerable or inhumane. I regularly talk to one of my first teachers, Susie Vidrih, who in each conversation is still teaching the art of practicing life at 80 years old. David Ufer: I practice early morning before my workday, and depending upon my teaching schedule will practice again either midday or in the early evening. BZ: I'm in my 50's and finding my body stiffening and my joints becoming less fluid and cushy. Have you both been able to escape those particular ravages of aging? And with respect to other long-time practitioners that you know, does it appear that a lifetime yoga practice gives you a \"get out of jail free\" pass when it comes to the physical wear-and-tear of aging? Karen Ufer: I recognize lots of changes as I age. We all do. Yoga can not stop the aging process but it gives us both tools and hope. Strong legs go a long way in coping with age but so does attitude. Yoga is not a quick fix in the sense of being a fad or a drug. There is no prescription for graceful aging. I hope to keep practicing in some way until the day I die. Someone once told me just think how easy the poses will be when we drop the physical body! Maybe that is heaven. David Ufer: Maxine Tobias, an experienced teacher of yoga for many years in London, and author of Stretch and Relax , told me years ago that she sent her preliminary manuscript to Mr. Iyengar to edit. One of her opening comments in her first chapter was that \"stretching is natural.\" Mr . Iyengar returned her manuscript with a red circle, indicating in the mar gin, \"Ms. Tobias, to contract is natural; we must learn how to stretch.\" I have been asked, through the years, to teach classes for teams of young athletes and for groups who share a specific activity such as running. Those are fine and good but I must say I continue having the most fun sharing my practice as a teacher with a group consisting of 30-year-olds on mats next to 80-year-olds on a mat next to 18-year-olds on a mat next to 50-year-olds. Those yoga students in their later years continue to inspire. They are my heroes. The body does stiffen, the joints do become less fluid, for most that are fortunate to live long lives. Perhaps it is true when some say , \"Yoga just may be able to cure what we cannot endure and help us to endure what we cannot cure.\" That said, after all these years, I still love monopoly. BZ: David, I remember a conversation we had in which you discussed the way in which yoga has increased your flexibility, not just in the physical sense, but in the interpersonal and emotional realms. Please elaborate on that for us? David Ufer: I do sometimes wonder how these hips could still be this stiff after years of practice. Then I think how these same hips might feel if I had NOT been practicing and I am somehow, perhaps oddly, grateful for the level of stiffness that is there now. Some are mistaken in believing that a strong flexible spine is a prerequisite to the practice of yoga when in fact, a strong flexible spine is the result of the practice. We learn to stretch the arms and legs in practicing yoga, to twist, bend and invert the body and to breathe more fully, all of which benefit the bones, muscles, nerves and glands. Every bit as important, if not more so, is the benefit of practice to the mind. We challenge the mind, so often dwelling in the past or anticipating the future, to focus on the present.

David Ufer: Both of my parents, independent of one another, which is how they lived the majority of their adult life, briefly involved themselves in the practice of yoga. Unfortunately, both of them were living with serious health issues when they first put their toes in. To this day, I don't think I have seen a more colorful outfit in a yoga class than my father's well worn madras pants that he wore to a class at the Y one spring evening in the late 1970's. Those were his favorites, and I think he truly felt they might just, somehow, help those tight hamstrings of his in supta padangustasana. My mother embraced the practice of restorative poses in the years just before her passing from cancer in the late 1980's. She was a student in classes for a couple of years. Karen's love and attention, hands on, assisting my mother with the poses that brought some relief to her in those last months of her life, are etched in my memory. BZ: And over these decades, did you sometimes have to create a \"bridge\" of understanding between your father's world of football and the decidedly less mainstream yoga world? Any anecdotes? David Ufer: Anyone, over time, who continues in a practice comes to understand in his or her mind and heart, if sincere, that discipline is not the enemy of enthusiasm. I met Mr. Iyengar for the first time picking him up at Detroit Metro Airport as he was arriving here from India. I was 25 years old and alone in the car with him returning to Ann Arbor. I asked him, as I remember back, some pretty lame questions, but I did manage one that engaged him, got his eyebrows dancing. I asked him if he had attained perfection in his practice of yoga. He answered me that perfection was not attainable, that perfection was not the goal. His practice however , he said, was leading him to an ever clearer understanding. At least that is how I remembered it years later when a friend shared a quotation attributed to the legendary Green Bay Packer Coach Vince Lombardi that read, \"Perfection is not attainable but in chasing it you may catch excellence.\" Is there a need to create a bridge? Before his return to India later that month, Mr. Iyengar signed for me a copy of his book Light on Yoga. I did not expect what he had to say to me. He wrote, \"David, life is a struggle so struggle in the practice of yoga.\" I knew from the beginning, when we first met and I was his student, that I was in the presence of someone who possessed a truly rare gift. Here was a man who was not only passionate about the subject of yoga but who lived yoga. And he had the unique ability to kindle the flame in others. In my father's world of football, two of the greatest collegiate football coaches of all time, Fritz Crisler, the head coach at U of M when my father began broadcasting in the late 1940's, and Bo Schembechler, who coached the U of M team the last 12 years of my father's life, both possessed that same gift. My father loved the contest and Fritz and Bo epitomized what my concentration on what is before us now, this moment, is a practice of mindfulness. This focus is not easy when change is such a constant in life. And with change so difficult for most of us, the ability to transform ourselves may be viewed as simply another definition of flexibility. So even if our hips are still tight, our flexibility, that is our ability to embrace or at least resist change less, may be improving. Yoga is a tool for transformation on so many levels. Let me share one of Mr. Iyengar's many eloquent aphorisms -- \"extension brings space, space brings freedom, freedom allows for precision, precision is truth and truth is God.\" His words suggest yoga as spiritual practice in physical form. So what may start out as an external practice may become, with time, an internal exploration. We may find this journey brings about change in how we treat and respond to ourselves and to those around us. BZ: Karen, what are the gifts for you at this point? Karen Ufer: At this point in my life, I feel more appreciative. I read that one definition of happiness is the ability to feel gratitude. Think about the last time you felt pure gratitude and it translates as contentment. Conversely, we all feel distractions and negativity. Those can become the pattern of our responses. That pattern creates a physical and emotional imprint. The practice of yoga can transform. What a relief there is something more out there than our desk. Understand we need our desk but do we not all want something more? BZ: Karen, how has your yoga practice challenged you the most? Karen Ufer: The challenges of yoga are many. Bur first and foremost there is the aspect of will. Each practice calls upon the will. To say another way, can the determination be found to continue to practice, to do the pose again, to be challenged by a difficult pose? Mr. Iyengar has said that when we practice we should be humble, playful and bold. What a dynamic combination! Perhaps one day there is no boldness or the practice is not humble or playful. So your determination and will makes the shift to experience an ethical and balanced practice. BZ: David, the Ufer family is a well-known Ann Arbor family, to say the least. Thirty-five years ago, yoga was somewhat more \"far out\" than it is today. Did your parents appreciate your \"second career\" as a yoga practitioner and teacher? The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 38 I am enormously grateful we both study and practice yoga. It gives our marriage a strong, common bond I could not do without. To be honest, a daily practice of anything together creates bonds of understanding. --- Karen UferThe Crazy Wisdom Interview with Karen and David Ufer on the Lifelong Practice of Yoga Continued from page 37 The inside joke in yoga is that the stiffest muscle in the body is the brain. We all get that one. --- Karen Uferfather valued: strict adherence to practice and discipline, an unabashed love of the game. Don Canham, his good friend and Michigan Track teammate, said about my father at his passing, \"Bob was fortunate, he had something in life that completely captivated him, which he was totally passionate about.\" If there is a writer, composer, yogi, musician, football player or coach who has not struggled, there is a soul lacking in passion. The bridge of understanding, in my eyes, never had to be created. It was already there. BZ: You and your brother own a well-established insurance company in town. How has your yoga practice made you a better businessperson? David Ufer: I don't know. Through all the years I have been in business with my brother, which is now over 30 years, I've been practicing yoga. Sometimes I don't know how we have remained together all these years but we have. I'm very thankful and grateful for that. Jim Weir, for years a loving husband, father, and grandfather who was also an avid tennis enthusiast here in town, when asked what he did for a living, would respond with a smile, \"I sell a little real estate between tennis matches.\" I've borrowed Jim's line with slight variation but I imagine, a similar smile, many times. BZ: Karen and David, what are you most relishing about life these days? Karen Ufer: The relish of life seems to be more rewarding the relishes. What a great job we all have to be life long learners. I am a better person, a better partner, a better mother and a better friend when I continue to learn. We all make mistakes. What happens next after that matters. My first teacher, Mary Palmer, was famous for saying, \"Carry on dear.\" Think of all that means, especially the 'dear' part. David Ufer: Good health. Beginning and ending most everyday with my closest friend. Witnessing both of our grown sons falling in love with dear people and embarking on the next chapter in their lives. Being a grandfather. My friends. BZ: Karen and David, let me ask you about the seasons. What do you most look forward to about spring and summer in Ann Arbor? David Ufer: Living in this region with seasons, I look forward in Spring to the color green. Walking on firm ground, hearing the songbirds with no ice or snow to navigate. Getting my bicycle out of the garage for the first time with the pavement dry, just as I did back in third grade on Granger. Walking out of the Michigan Theatre at night after seeing a great film and not freezing. Swimming in the pond and in Lake Michigan. Karen Ufer: Spring and summer in the Midwest is all about green. I read somewhere about how hard it is to live out West and give up the color green. We have lived in the country outside Ann Arbor for almost 35 years. The small changes in season, like when the goldfinch turns gold, are observed every year like small celebrations. We both grew up in the Midwest so the landscape of meadow, woodland and pond is very comforting. BZ: Karen, what do you look forward to about fall in Ann Arbor? Karen Ufer: I love the change of seasons. We in the Midwest often have at least two seasons in a day. However, that does not seem to prepare us to like change in general. In fact, most of us resist change. Many philosophies say, in one way or another, that the only constant is change. Since this interview is about yoga, Mr. Iyengar talks about yoga being in this moment and then in the next. The challenge of being present by definition requires not living in yesterday or tomorrow. Asana is the actual physical pose. Yoga is the ability to live in the commotion of change. That may be the hardest pose of all. BZ: David and Karen, you are always reading interesting books. Would either of you like to tell us about a few books you've loved in the past couple of years. Karen Ufer: David and I often read the same book. Once we did the unforgivable and tore The Mists of Avalon in half to be able to continue reading it at the same time. I love historical fiction and biographies. Just now I am reading Abigail and John (Adams), Portrait of a Marriage by Edith Gelles. My favorite book in the last year was The Elegance of the Hedgehog by Muriel Barbery. David Ufer: Edgar Sawtelle , and John Knowles' A Separate Peace are the last three books I've read. In regard to the past couple of years, among others, I have particularly enjoyed Ann Arbor's own authors: Nicolas Delbanco's Old Scores and Spring and Fall , Charles Baxter's' Feast of Love and Elizabeth Kostova's The Historian. BZ: Anything else either of you would like to add? Karen Ufer: I want to acknowledge the gratitude I feel to my first teachers: Mary Palmer, Priscilla Neel, Susie Vidrih and Barbara Linderman. They, and especially Mary, did some serious arm twisting and convinced the Ann Arbor Y to sponsor Mr. Iyengar to teach at the Y . Can you imagine this -- a Hindu, Indian man in shorts, teaching yoga at a local YMCA in the Midwest when yoga was barely known? We actually stood on our heads in the diag to promote his visit! Those early teachers recognized the brilliance of his teaching and this system. The rest of us were the lucky tag-a-longs. Those early teachers practiced diligently, studied in India, and brought the teachings back. Further, we are indebted to our current teachers, Manouso Manos and Lois Steinberg. None of the above would have been possible without the lifelong practice and dedication of Yogacharya Sri B.K.S. Iyengar. He developed the brilliant use of props to help us learn the poses with our bodies, and continues to show us and ask us to practice with our hearts. Whether it's from Carl Jung or George Lucas or B.K.S. Iyengar, the observation that one can never understand the true nature of light, or grace or love until one has taken a good look at the darkness is spot on. The practice of both parenting and yoga, if we are paying attention, reveal to us our own \"black holes\". --- David Ufer Continued on page 40Yoga and parenting both, from time to time, value wonder and silence. --- David UferThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 39The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 40 The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Karen and David Ufer on the Lifelong Practice of Yoga Continued from page 39 In returning to my hometown in 1973, little did I know I would be landing pretty much on the ground floor of what is now a world wide yoga movement. --- David Ufer Our sons, now grown, never knew a time when we were not involved in a home yoga practice. I do remember when their friends came over, we were under strict orders to not wear our yoga shorts or stand on our head. ---- Karen Ufer David Ufer: Karen and I will receive letters, yes, hand-written with beautiful penmanship, from our first yoga teacher, periodically, in the mail. Ever the teacher, now in her 80's, Susie Vidrih lives on the West Coast with her husband, Bill. She continues to share. Her most recent, sent some weeks ago, went something like this, \"Tell everyone that if they are looking for the meaning of life or truth, they will not find it. Yoga has to be for the joy of the moment. The only truth you know is yourself and you will find yourself, you will meet yourself in your practice of yoga.

Fox Dedicated to Peg The Goddess is a whispering, calming presence. When she awakens, her spirit rises in the mists to greet the morning sun. Bringing forth the energy, that ripples and vibrates across the surface of glass. She is greeted by the dragonfly, wind dancing and the rhythmic strides of the water gliders. The bass rise up to kiss her, as they break the surface. We can hear her when the loons call, as they glide across the water. Experience her regal presence as the heron stands motionless at the Point. We feel her gently touch and hold us as we float in her embrace. Connecting our heartbeats in this womb of grace. Wise ones hear her calling, beckoning for our return. Those who know her, feel the tug within their hearts, and remember her voice. The Goddess gives this gift of Love, as our inheritance. She ignites our inner flame, in the passionate and magical moments we share together, in the sacred space of Heart Lake.POETRYCorporate Headquarters By Tom Staicar On the top floor the CEO and other suits - the brains - produce giant thoughts.

It is my job to measure the length of each across the floor of hours, to witness the unraveling of your body life. You pull against the strictures. It's hard. I draw a dragon for you to chase, and irises for myself, to forget. My work in this life is endless. My work in this life is trembling and wavering and vacillating, and shielding the inner from the outer. It's too big to fit into one sentence. It's too small to quantify. I take no chances.To submit poetry, contact Sarah at sarah@crazywisdom.net The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 42 By Barbara Brodsky Many of you have been following my stories of my visits to the Casa of John of God in Brazil. I've written of the gift of these journeys, of a very gradual return of hearing after 38 years of deafness, and the return of vision after a serious accident in 2004. In January and February of 2010 I visited the Casa again and am still absorbing and integrating the experiences. Sometimes big events look big, as in hearing thunder or hearing Amazing Grace, stories that I told in previous essays for the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal. Sometimes it's not until one looks back that one sees the enormity of the gifts given. These experiences help me to better understand the meaning of healing. Let me start at the beginning. I came to the Casa this year with several intentions beyond the usual request of help for my hearing and right eye. For over a year I had had severe shoulder pain; medical tests showed advanced osteoarthritis in both shoulders. I had severely limited range of motion of the arms, pain when I moved them, and worse, pain even when they were still. There was nerve pain shooting down both arms, which was challenging in the daytime and impossible at night. I had not slept well in over 6 months; throbbing sensations kept me awake most of the night. There was no comfortable sleep position that didn't lead to strong pain in a few minutes. In late September at Omega Institute, the Entity working through John of God was able to alleviate some pain but said I needed to come back to Brazil for him to do deeper healing of the shoulders. Another intention: I was still looking for the right way to bring my new book out into the world. I came to the Entity on my first day at the Casa with all of these intentions. As usual, he didn't even wait to hear what I was asking, just said \"Surgery,\" and dismissed me. About the book, he just nodded and said, \"It is done.\" The doubting mind immediately jumped to the thought, \"He doesn't care about me.\" How long have I carried that old baggage, believing myself in some way to be lesser than others, wrong in some way, unloved or unlovable? Such thought arises very seldom now, and when it does I know it as old conditioning, but it still does come and still has power to cause pain. What most needed to be healed then was not the deafness, eye or shoulders, but this old myth that still had roots and arose with conditions. That first week flew by. For two days after surgery I slept an exhausted sleep, not just recovering from surgery but from months of sleep deprivation, for (miraculously) I could sleep with no pain. The third day, I awakened enough to check my email and found a letter from a wonderful publisher in California who expressed strong interest in my book. By the end of the week this interest had deepened into a commitment; he wanted to publish it. How can one keep the myth going, of \"I am not seen or heard?\" with these responses? And yet the roots were still not fully resolved. The day before the surgery review, I met with Heather, my friend and translator. The pain was so much less, but I told her there was still no motion possible in the shoulders. Held still, they were pain free, but movement was agonizing. She said to show the Entity the limited motion that I demonstrated for her , and I returned to my pousada for lunch. Midway through lunch, I started to feel light-headed and very sleepy, so I went to my room, lay on the bed and immediately fell into a deep sleep. I dreamed I was having surgery. I next opened my eyes three hours later. It felt like coming out of general anesthetic; it took me an hour to get myself into an awake state, as that drugged sleep kept pulling me back. When I finally was able to move, I walked out of my room to sit on a chair in the garden. When I reached for the chair, my arm moved freely, without pain. I started to move both arms and was immediately cautioned by spirit to be very gentle; no big movements for a week; they must heal; there are stitches. I sat, filled with wonder, which would increase in a few minutes when I realized that for the first time since the retinal vein tore in 2004, I could see color with the right eye rather than just shades of grey. I just sat for half an hour, feeling loved and expressing gratitude. I was busy these next two weeks with my group, the 12 people for whom I was serving as a guide, and did not see the Entity personally except for passing through the lines for surgery review and taking my group members to him. When I wasn't busy with my group, at the Entity's request, I sat in his Current (meditation) Room, but my meditations were shallow and it felt like nothing was happening. Then those 2 weeks ended, part of the group left, and I was no longer official guide for those who remained. It was time for me to pass by the Entity again, and I pondered what to ask him. Here is the ironic part; despite the enormous gifts of those first 3 weeks, I still felt like I must be doing something wrong. Around me, I saw profound healing and heard stories from people about their healing cancer , MS, and other ailments including deafness. Why could I not hear? Why did nothing new happen this year with my ears? I had the wisdom to see the grasping and fear, and not get totally caught in it, but it was there. Finally I decided to ask him, \"What I can I do to support healing of the hearing?\" It sounds like an innocent and upbeat question, but at some level I was still asking, \"What am I doing wrong? Tell me so I can fix it.\" The incorporated Entity that morning, Jose Penteado, truly saw where I was and had the perfect response. He said, \"Love supports healing.\" He was holding a small flower, placed it into my palm, gently closed my fingers around it and continued, \"Here is my love. Now sit in my Current.\" I spent the next 10 days reflecting on his message, as I sat many hours in Current and meditated in the garden. I do believe I'm a loving person, able to love others, to treat myself with love and to receive love from others. Yet as I watched the arising thoughts and my response to them, I saw myriad ways in which I was less than loving to myself. Especially, I saw that when a thought arose of, \"What am I doing wrong,\" I immediately condemned myself with a follow-up thought, \"I should be beyond that kind of thinking by now.\" I was amazed at how many judgments and \"shoulds\" I saw. Yet the myth persisted. If I just did something right, I would hear. If he would just put his hands on my ears, surely he could bring hearing. I could imagine it happening! \"Why is he ignoring me? What am I doing wrong?\" Then one day I was standing in the Main Hall before the day started when the incorporated Entity came out on the stage. As he faced the assembled hundreds of people, he looked directly at me, then walked right toward me, stopped inches away, looked into me for a long time with a deeply penetrating look, then stepped back one step and put his hands on the head of the woman standing next to me. With his hands on her head, he continued to look at me. It was clear he was aware of my thoughts and was challenging me to release them. Twice in one day, the Entity walked up to where I was sitting in the front row of his Current. My eyes were closed but I could feel his energy approach. The first time he put his hand on the head of the woman sitting next to me, then moved her to a big chair right next to his seat. Another time, he called a different woman sitting next to me, to come from the Current, up to talk with him, and asked her to stay another week so he could do more work with her. Each time, the same old habits arose. \"I am invisible; unloved; imperfect.\" Each time they were noted with mindfulness, and I was able to skillfully note the tension and not build further stories, but these thoughts still came. And judgment of them came. It was a painful 2 weeks. Finally it was my last day, and I would pass through the line again. The logical mind did feel gratitude. By now, with his blessing, I was swimming and able to move the arms fully and with no pain. I slept soundly. I saw in color again. I had a perfect book contract for Cosmic Healing, my book about this healing journey. Balance was improved. I had been riding a bike with increasing ease and balance for 5 weeks. I was walking with greater ease. As I had pondered the book, I was very aware of the responsibility to bring this book fourth without a lot of ego, but from a very clear space. I had been told by spirit for years, \"The book will be published when you are ready.\" In other words, I would not be given the opportunity for this next step until I was ready not to have ego grab hold of it. If the opportunity was now here, then I was ready; and that felt true. Yet the question still came. Thousands may read this book; I will travel and give talks with it. Already I had an invitation to speak in California, to share some of the book's teachings with a large audience. Can these words come from a place of emptiness and love? So I asked the Entity what seemed at first to be another clear and innocent question; \"Please help me to do my teaching and work with the book with humility , wisdom and love.\" Again the Entity, this time Dr. Valdivino with whom I have worked intensively though these years, saw right through my question and into my fears and doubts. Am I \"good enough\" to do this well? He gave me an exquisitely tender smile, and the kind of look a parent might give a beloved child, of \"You still don't get it. . . . Please try now. . . .\" He took my hand, and said very clearly, enunciating each word so I could lip-read it, \"I love you very much,\" and he placed two radiant roses in my hand. \"Sit in my Current.\" I sat and the tears came. There was such a deep level of healing, and with each tear shed, a profound release of old beliefs. Are these beliefs completely eradicated? Probably not. Hopefully the next time they emerge I can remember, smell those roses and feel spirit's love, release the thought faster, and rest in Truth. We are loved. We are home. There is nothing to fear. ### (Cosmic Healing; A Spiritual Journey with Aaron and John of God, by Barbara Brodsky, published by North Atlantic Books, will be released in March of 2011.

Before that I hadn't paid much attention. I thought they only worked with Men Who Were Brilliant Poets, since this was the only context in which I'd heard of them (forgive my ignorance), which was not exactly an image I had of myself. Then something woke me up - probably the Muse herself, since the first trinity of these Nine Maidens Magic is the Muse of Awakening. I now realize they were in my life always and it is to them that I am indebted for so much pleasure. So who are the Muse? The Maidens of the Flame, Source of all Inspiration, Passion's Progenitors and Playmates (that last one came from them - they often like to interject when I'm writing, and with quite a bit of sylph sparkle thrown in for good measure.) They are a Unity, since they can never be separated - where does one flame end and another begin? - yet within this Unity we call the Muse there are nine distinct energies that can be constellated around the names they were given by the borne a multiplicity of names for they are universal, and known to the hearts of many. In the absence of a classical education (or even with one), you are unlikely to call this energy that accompanies some of your most inspired moments 'Calliope' or 'Polyhymnia.' Instead we may give this feeling-sense a name of intimacy, probably of mutual choosing. One of my favorite ways to access the Muse is through Bride, Brighid, the 'Mary of the Gaels', whom the Greeks called Mnemosyne, Mother of the Muse. She holds the Gates of Memory - for we have to free the Muse from the pasts and futures we have imposed upon them to really get to know them. Mnemosyne teaches me to listen and hear with my heart, lets me touch Cosmic Memory, and then I hear their Siren-sweet song - for it is irresistible. Thank goodness for that, for the Muse initiate and effect transformation that takes us to transcendent states we cannot imagine this side of the transformation. Right now I am deeply engaged with the one who has been called Euterpe, who invites us to the distillation of Music, of What Really Matters. She can be the most misunderstood of the Muse when we project compliance and silence onto the feminine, and women in general. She opens the door to challenge, not of domination, but of invitation - the invitation to release outmoded yet still cherished misunderstandings of our past and our future, and move into the high delight of Truth. When we refuse to engage, we hear her music as discord, as noise -the noise of battle; when we allow ourselves to open our hearts to her invitation, we find the music that lies at the heart of challenge, the complexity of the harmony that our impure understandings hide from us. So often it is our refusal to engage the music that keeps us in judgment and fear of Newness, keeps us choosing to see as faulty and flawed what we do not understand of the new that is being birthed. Too often we give our fealty to the past. The invitation of the Muse, the challenge of Euterpe, is not for the faint-hearted, though we all are made of the metal that can be forged into the instrument that is perfectly tuned to our Soul Song. The Muse are superior smith-workers - metal smiths, silver and gold smiths, wordsmiths - alchemists of Joy. Whatever your current relationship to the Muse might be, you are invited to claim deeper, richer, more conscious intimacy with them. Let the Muse take each of us through the fires of Awakening, Transformation, and Purification to create and reveal a more brilliant, brighter, stronger self - a transcendent Self. Accept the Invitation. ###Musings... Let the Muse take each of us through the fires of Awakening, Transformation, and Purification...

Often misunderstood, witchcraft is an earth-based belief respecting natural and personal cycles, as well as individual responsibility. ABC Book of Shadows introduces children of all ages to the magick and mysteries of ancient wisdom. Although not newly published, this book stands out for its unusual content and wonderful expression of pagan tradition. Written for young ones, it's also entirely appropriate for older children for its short but informative explanations. This book is lovely! $9.00, Itty Bitty Witch Works Oh, What a Busy Day by Gyo Fujikawa Originally published in 1976 and recently re-released, Oh, What a Busy Day is a delightful oversized hardcover describing an incredibly lengthy, busy day! From lemonade stands to hide and seek, quacking ducks to gooey mud puddles, picnics to sunsets, it's everything a young child will recognize. Maybe it's because I was young when this book first came out and the illustrations look so familiar, but I love the simple, warm quality of this book as well as the sweet illustrations of children and animals. There's a lot for young children to see. Be sure to leave plenty of time before bed to make it through all the poems and verses! $9.95, Sterling The Night Fairy by Laura Amy Schlitz, Newbery Medal WinnerI brought this book home for my eleven year old daughter, and she read right through it, loving it all the way. It's the story of a fairy who loses her wings and is no longer able to fly. Flory finds that the world is a big, dangerous place, but she is fierce and willing to survive.

Emmy award-winning, the cd sounds like a play performance with its varied cast and music. I played it for my four year old son, who liked it because of the little prince's little voice. But I think it's perhaps for older children and adults, as is the book, because of its themes of loss, journeying, and realization. $15.99 BACK TO SCHOOL INSPIRATION: Vegan Lunch Box Around the World: 125 Easy, International Lunches Kids and Grown-ups Will Love! by Jennifer McCann What's for lunch? Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and much more! With this book, it's easy to enjoy all your favorite international and American dishes, free of meat, eggs, and dairy products.

The program is aimed at bringing music back to families, through interactive play designed to engage and delight children and adults alike. Robinson, who brought this internationally known music program to the Ann Arbor area, says every child can achieve basic music competence, which Music Together defines as singing in tune and tapping in rhythm. \"You don't have to be an Olympic swimmer to have fun swimming,\" she notes. In the same way, children can enjoy hearing and moving to music and singing or playing along, without having to feel they need to be evaluated on their level of skill. She stresses Music Together is not performance based, but a fun program of both unstructured and guided activities designed to let each child participate at their own pace and on their own level. \"Children look to their parents to see how to behave in this situation,\" says Robinson. Adult involvement with the music is important. For parents who might be a bit shy to tap their fingers, sway to the music, dance, or play a kazoo, Robinson reminds them that skill is not at all a factor. \"Adults are modeling the behavior\" for the children, she says. \"That is how their children learn. Some children will watch for a long time, even months; some will be more active in class. It does not matter , because each child is processing according to her individual way.\" Robinson says participating in making music in this kind of group setting can increase social skills. It can also provide bonding for parent and child, and provide a bridge to more formal music training in school or private lessons. \"And they love it!\" she adds. Classes are for mixed ages, from birth through age five, which leads to the question: How does a three-month-old respond to a conga beat? \"You will see his arms and legs get going,\" says Robinson, \"or he will shake the instruments, instead of chewing on them.\" Parents can engage the littlest ones with tummy rubbing or swaying to the beat, among other strategies. \"Even with singing, you can listen to an infant's tonality or phrasing when he vocalizes,\" says Robinson. That cooing and vocalizing can tell much about a child's mood and response to what is happening in his environment. Robinson stresses music, in general, is good for what ails us, too. In her blog on her website, Robinson posts a link to a Dana Foundation article on the use of music therapy for treating brain injury. \"Music activates more parts of the brain than any other activity,\" say researchers Michael Thaut, professor of music and a professor of neuroscience at Colorado State University, and Gerald McIntosh, medical director for the Center for Biomedical Research in Music at Colorado State University . New technologies help scientists look at our brain's response to music, and the findings are amazing. The application of this research has already begun in physical therapy , for instance, where therapists might ask patients to walk or move limbs in time to a rhythmical beat. The music helps establish parameters within which the patient can work, making it easier to move smoothly and with less effort. Music can also help those with language and cognitive issues. Robinson came to Ann Arbor two years ago from New York City, where she received her Music Together training and had been teaching the program for eight years. She also was a musical theater actress, performing on Broadway and around the world, and fronted her own country-rock-pop band, for which she wrote songs and played acoustic guitar. Robinson earned a BFA from U of M in musical theater, including two years as a music major, where she learned all the theory basics. The Music Together program originated in 1986 when Ken Guilmartin and Lili Levinowitz began collaborating on music education materials and classroom techniques. Both had extensive backgrounds in music and theory. Guilmartin, a graduate of Swarthmore, studied composition and pedagogy at the Manhattan School of Music and earned a certificate in Dalcroze Eurhythmics. Levinowitz was a Ph.D. candidate at Temple University doing innovative research focused on tonal and rhythm development in young children. She is now a professor of music education at Rowan University and director of research at Center for Music and Young Children, which Guilmartin founded and directs. The program they developed now serves over 2,000 communities in 25 countries.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 47 Leo Robertson paints the town-- well, one part of it! Why did Leo Robertson, a junior at Ann Arbor's Skyline High School, spend a month of his summer out on the sidewalk in the hot sun on Washington Street? He had a mission: redesigning and painting the fa\u00e7ade of Ann Arbor's teen center, The Neutral Zone. The fa\u00e7ade makeover is Robertson's original design, done in a modified Art Deco style. The building had been a fairly quiet, earth-toned neo-Gothic former warehouse, the front made of old brick and timber. No longer is it modestly self-effacing. Now you can't help but notice the electric blue and shocking pink anchor stones as you pass by, or the deep green steps leading into the building, just down the street from Amadeus and across from the Bank of Ann Arbor, at 301 E. Washington. \"Leo is an exceptional young person,\" says John Weiss, Neutral Zone's executive director. \"Teens here are encouraged to take initiative and take ownership of the space where they hang out.\" So when the idea came up to paint murals on the back of the building, Robertson's interest was piqued. He had an idea \u2014 instead of murals behind the Zone, he wanted to paint the front of the building. \"Leo put together an elaborate proposal,\" says Weiss. \"He had color samples of different paints and schematics. I was very impressed with the deliberate thought he put into the project.\" And so were others Weiss consulted with Robertson's proposal in hand, including other teens and two adults on the Center's Board of Directors. He also conferred with a lawyer who works with the group, who determined there was no historic designation precluding altering the building fa\u00e7ade in the manner proposed. Robertson, who has been a member of the Visual Arts Council at Neutral Zone for two years, has painted murals before\u2014 two, in fact, for the Ann Arbor Open School. The popular duo has been telling stories at their concerts for years. (Their original story, \"The Rooster,\" also appears in this collection.) So, in 2008, the brothers decided to begin collecting some of their best-loved tales. The result is a project that includes traditional stories such as \"The Bremen Musicians,\" and original pieces such as \"Perfect Pitch,\" on which San's daughter, Emily, now in high school, plays beautiful violin to accompany the plot line. \"These tales are not only wonderful to listen to, but in one way or another are consistent with our core values,\" says San. Each story imparts something that all can learn. In fact, San often is asked to name his favorite song, to which he replies, \"I won't sing a song I don't like. They are all my favorites! It is the same with the stories.\" One very lovely and tender piece is \"The Two Brothers,\" which is reminiscent in some ways of O. Henry's classic tale \"Gift of the Magi,\" in its theme of sacrifice for others, blended with a bit of irony. In the song that accompanies the story, San and Laz quote some Hebrew, which San translates in the singing version as, \"How good it is and lovely, for people to live as one.\" Another wonderful tale is \"The Crowded House,\" wherein both the main character and the audience come to understand at the same time the brilliance of the local rabbi, who gives advice throughout. The original Yiddish tale involved a man having difficulty living near his noisy animals, for which problem he seeks out the wisdom of his rabbi. San changed the premise to use musicians, not animals, and the influx of more and more music creates \"a musical madhouse\" involving everyone from a piano-playing friend to a gathering of townspeople as audience. Crowded, indeed. Many Crazy Wisdom readers likely already know that the Slomovits brothers have been writing music and performing together many years \u2014 in fact, since 1973, when they first came to Ann Arbor. Born in Hungary, and having lived in Israel for three years before moving to the U.S., the two come from a musical home. They are accomplished on many traditional instruments like violin and piano, and less common instruments such as the bones and the bodhran, an Irish frame drum. Their list of honors and awards is impressive and include awards from Parent' s Choice Magazine and the American Library Association. One upcoming opportunity to experience their humor and excellent musicianship is at the Annual Thanksgiving Benefit Concert that Gemini performs in support of the University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital. The Holden Newborn Intensive Care Unit is where San's daughter, Emily, was born and cared for 16 years ago. She will be joining her uncle Laz and dad San on violin and vocals for that performance. Aron Kaufman will also join the duo, playing percussion, and Brian Brill will play piano. This year's concert will be at The Ark on Sunday, November 28, at 1 p.m. Stories will abound. It is well worth a visit to the Gemini website at geminichildrensmusic.com to explore further. The CD is available locally at Nicola's Books or through the Gemini website.

Continued on page 48 Sandor and Laszlo Slomovits of Gemini\"One of my murals was painted over in anticipation of a movie shoot that never materialized,\" said Robertson. He still feels a bit unhappy about its loss. But you can still see the other one at the school, on the wall by the office. In addition, Robertson has worked on set design for productions at Skyline High. Asked about his preference for murals over painting on canvas, Robertson said it is easier to create detail with a two-inch wall brush than with a small standard brush, as one would use on canvas. After high school, Robertson plans to put his repertoire of building and artistic skills to work. He plans to study architecture, not only to learn design, but also to participate in the manufacture of eco-friendly building materials and in the construction of projects. He already has learned something about interior design and landscaping, and he can do brick laying, small projects in wood frame construction and painting. Tilework, he says, is next. \"I plan to teach myself,\" he smiles. Robertson admires the work of artists such as Salvador Dali and Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas. He is fond of Art Nouveau styles, which shows in his choice of colors and design for the Neutral Zone project. The color choices are reminiscent of those used in painting Victorian homes: bright, light colors that draw attention to architectural details. Joining Robertson on the fa\u00e7ade project were Neutral Zone Art Director Trevor Stone and Carlos Vasquez, a longtime friend of Robertson's and a fellow Skyline student. Paint used for the project was the low-VOC, latex base, self-priming and sealing kind, donated by Anderson Paint Company. Robertson received professional advice from John Crawford of G &Q Painting, who has worked with Neutral Zone on a number of previous projects. Crawford helped secure supplies and offered his opinion on the art and science of painting a building exterior. The Neutral Zone, established in 1998 by teens for teens, is dedicated to \"personal growth through artistic expression, community leadership and the exchange of ideas,\" as expressed on their website. They offer programs in the visual arts, music, literary arts and leadership, and are known for performance poetry, all-area teen art shows, and their newly remodeled, student-run recording studio. Teens can learn about everything from how to write a good college admissions essay, to DJ-ing for fun or profit, to screen-printing t-shirts and banners, to the best cadence to present a piece of poetry to an audience. Their website is www.neutral-zone. org and the phone number is 734-214- 9995.Community High's Scholarship winner is a younger- than-usual novelist Nadeem Persico-Shammas is the kind of recent high school graduate who likes to dabble with computers and play video games. He's read and enjoyed all the Harry Potter books, and likes a variety of music from alternative rock to classic, electronic, and metal. Sound like a fairly typical 18-year-old? Maybe not so much. He's also the kind of person who, in the fifth grade, set himself the task of writing a novel. He wrote 40 pages of a fantasy story about time travel and evil emperors and then stopped, but the experience was enough to convince him that he liked writing and that it might be his fort\u00e9. Winner of this year's Suzanne Ruth Springer Scholarship Award for creative writers at Ann Arbor's Community High School, Persico-Shammas received a $1000 honorarium toward his college education. That fifth-grade writing practice proved helpful. \"I still think it was a big job for a young kid,\" he says. He hasn't tried to finish the work, but he is still amazed that he attempted it. \"I enjoy writing,\" he says. Persico-Shammas was chosen from among his peers by the Community High school English Chairperson Judith DeWoskin, in conjunction with other English faculty. The scholarship, named in honor of the mother of local businessman David Ufer of Ufer Insurance and Yoga Focus, was established in 2003. Ufer explained that the intent was \"not to impose another academic requirement on an already jam-packed senior year,\" but to honor excellent writing. Students do not compete for the award in the traditional sense. It' s very important that the student chosen is not only a great writer, but one who possesses love of the written word and who encourages that love in the community around him or her . Past recipients include Eva Miller, 2007; Noam Samuel, 2008; and Lisa Raymond, 2009. Nowadays, Persico-Shammas writes about concepts. \"I write experimental prose,\" he says. \"I'd like to think it doesn't fall into one particular genre.\" As for favorite authors, heavyweights top his list, including Kurt V onnegut, Jr., Jorge Luis Borges, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Although he hasn't yet chosen a major at U of M, where he will be an entering freshman in the fall, Persico-Shammas definitely has creative writing classes on the agenda. He adds, \"I might do something with computer science or film, which is another kind of storytelling. I'd like to learn film making.\" Suzanne Ruth Springer, for whom the scholarship is named, loved Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost. Springer attended Ann Arbor High School, where she was Senior Class Officer. \"She was certainly an important reason why I love to read,\" said Ufer. Throughout his childhood, Ufer was offered opportunities to extend his familiarity Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from 47 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 48 Children performing at Nightfire Performance Theatre Halloween performance at Nightfire Performance TheatreMixed Age Class Birth-5 ph/fax 734-741-1510 Baby and You A Special Class for Infants and the Grown-Ups Who Love Them...

In her work with children and young adults, Guenther takes discouraged learners and helps them find positive, personally-tailored means of addressing learning challenges. She helps kids learn how smart they are and guides them to confidence in matters academic. An engineer by training, Guenther's job at one point was to observe natural systems to see how they work, in order to then find ways to use those natural processes to help solve engineering dilemmas. After deciding to home-school her children and studying the work of various learning theorists, Guenther developed a system for assessing and addressing the learning processes of children. Each child is an educational world unto herself, Guenther observed. She also observed that many educational programs assume all children learn the same way . Hence, Playful Wisdom was born, as an alternative to that approach. Clients come in for an initial assessment, wherein Guenther observes and gently works to reveal the individual learning process of a student. She discovers whether or not one doodles when listening to new material, if one likes to listen to music when he studies, or hums while working, or if one lets ideas percolate awhile before writing, among other things. These and many other unique learning habits can be understood and then applied in positive ways, so that they can help students feel more comfortable as learners. Students meet with Guenther for six or seven sessions following the initial two-hour consultation. She shows clients tools they can use to let their learning process work for them. Clients have ranged in age from six to 39. With younger students, Guenther involves parents in the process, both as reassuring presence and as in integral part of the educational process. Her work also includes communications counseling for couples or those interested in learning how they process information and ideas, and how they can interact with others to communicate those ideas. Guenther can be contacted at 517-795-6026 or info@playfulwisdom.com . ###with books and authors, from an invitation to see Robert Frost when the poet came to speak in Ann Arbor (Ufer was a third-grade student who declined the offer, much to his later regret) to opportunities to use the bookmobile when it came through his neighborhood. Springer taught at the Children's Play School on Forrest, begun by Mar garet Grace Dow Towsley, where she worked with young children. Ufer chose Community High as the location for this honorarium in part because \"Community is the kind of school I could envision my mother attending, if it had existed in the 30' s and 40's.\" Other schools already had scholarships of a similar nature in place, he added. To extend awareness of the Suzanne Ruth Springer award, and to further honor the recipients, Ufer is planning a website with a sampling of material from this year 's and past Springer Scholarship winners. Look for the site in the months to come at srsscholarship.org. Mayan Womb Massage technique aids fertility and more The Naturopathic School of Ann Arbor will be offering a 16-contact-hour course in Mayan Abdominal Massage Training, Level One Self-Care training in techniques that can support conception, fertility and childbirth, aid in digestion and support men's prostate health, among other things. The three-class series will be offered November 5, 2010 from 6 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. and November 6 and 7 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Registration is $350.00, with a deposit of $200.00 due by September 30. The course will be taught by instructor Jen O'Hagen of New Jersey , an affiliate of the Arvigo Institute. O'Hagen will apply techniques developed by Dr. Rosita Arvigo in conjunction with Don Elijiio Panti, a renowned Mayan shaman of Belize, with whom Dr. Arvigo studied for a 10 years. Don Elijiio believed a woman's center is her uterus, and to maintain good health it should remain in balance. In conjunction with the class, private, one-on-one, half-hour sessions will be of fered to interested persons.Mary Light, founder and director of the Gaia School of Herbal Medicine and the Naturopathic School of Ann Arbor, suggests that this course will be helpful to a range of midwives, massage practitioners, nurses, and women and men interested in abdominal massage and its benefits. Students will learn structural work to reposition a prolapsed, tilted or fallen uterus. This technique also supports the prevention and treatment of benign prostate enlargement and digestive problems. \"The goal,\" says Light, \"is to give women and men access to techniques they can use to support their own health care and its processes.\" She notes, \"It is empowering information and practice.\" Fertility is, of course, a sensitive subject. Many women who desire pregnancy are not able to achieve it, for a variety of reasons. This class will not address any medical reasons for fertility issues. In addition, newly pregnant women (up to 19 weeks); those with active abdominal cancer, infection, or hernia; women in active menstruation; or those using an IUD for contraception are not recommended for the course. For more information about the class and about the Mayan Womb Technique, please contact Mary Light at 734-769-7794 or visit her website at gaiaherbalstudies.net. Nightfire teaches dance improvisation-exploration for Halloween Just in time for Halloween, Nightfire, a performance theater and dance troupe in Ann Arbor, will offer workshops and a dance party for families and children in late October. Bring your mask, if you like, and wear clothing in which you can move freely as you learn about cats, their history and nature. Purr , prowl and play! Workshops will include instruction and improvisation utilizing a mix of World Music and various approaches to movement, including dance forms from the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Nagler has been working with children since 2000, and she has a long history of involvement with dance. She notes that Nighfire's emphasis on creativity and collaboration helps children explore avenues of performance and theater that they might not obtain in other settings. \"As a result,\" she says, \"children often come away with renewed confidence,\" which serves them in school drama activities or ignites their interest in more traditional dance instruction. In fact, the name of the group comes from a place of imagination, says Nagler , where a community might gather around a fire to tell stories or celebrate. Nightfire courses often explore environmental or mythic themes, and Nagler offers courses throughout the year. A sliding fee scale is applied; prices for the two events will range from $5 to $12. The location and exact dates for the workshops can be obtained from Irena Nagler at 734-996-1772 or birena@umich.edu or on the Nightfire website at www.twofeather.com/ nightfire.Each child is an educational world unto herself...

It's true. I challenge you to spend an hour outside on a sunny Saturday morning at one of his children's concerts, and come to a different conclusion. More so, I challenge you to spend one hour at his show and not be moved to turn into a tree and sway along to the breeze of his music. Like an invigorating hike through the woods, Joe Reilly's music reminds us of the magnitude of life that goes on around us and our deep and unending connection to it. From the life cycle of a tomato to the family life of a mosquito, his lyrics celebrate the intricacies of our natural world and teach us the responsibility we have in protecting it. Couple his thoughtful lyrics with catchy tunes, and it's easy to see how the environmental messages in this young man's music can inspire children young and old to be more mindful of their impact on our living planet. And to actively improve the ways we choose to live upon it. The song \"Little Tomato\" from Joe's recent album, Touch the Earth , is a perfect example of how he inspires us to take a closer look at the world we are so deeply connected to, and honor our relationships to it. This particular song, which Joe dedicates to \"all the tomatoes--in gardens, in soups, salads, and sauces,\" is a celebration of the relationship we share with the food we eat. In it, he sings to the tomato in his bean stew and thanks it, along with the gardener, the harvester, the soil and sunshine for allowing the tomato's energy to flow into him. As if this isn't enough to make us more grateful for our food, the tomato responds with his own feelings, giving us a deeper understanding: Singing Peace into the World: The Mindful Music of Joe Reilly \"I have always been called to connect with kids and youth and to share with them my talents and interests. I believe that, just as music is a continuation of my parent's talents and gifts, so is education.\" AThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 51 \"...sittin' in your bean stew you might think I'm depressed but I'm quite content to become part of you, your thoughts and your body it's like one big energy exchange party. And what you ask, started all of this? It was the sun and photosynthesis.\" These smart lyrics, the inflection in Joe's voice, and the rhythm of his guitar generate feelings of joy and gratitude that result in a powerful sense of enlightenment. This is the stuff Joe Reilly's music is made of\u2014this is how his music transforms us. In his early thirties, Joe's long dark hair, olive skin and brown doe-like eyes bespeak his Cherokee heritage. Soft spoken with a kind smile, he radiates a sense of peace that draws you towards him. Joe has been working with kids as an environmental educator at the Leslie Science Center for the last six years, but his work with children began long ago, as did his music. **** Joe Reilly was raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and grew up surrounded by music. Both of his parents are singers and play guitar and his dad also plays the upright bass. Joe's parents played contemporary Catholic folk music at church services. \"Music was always a part of our household. I didn't really appreciate it as much as a kid growing up...but realized later that it was a gift being passed along-- even if I wasn't conscious of it.\" Music wasn't the only gift passed down to Joe. \"I have always been called to connect with kids and youth and to share with them my talents and interests. I believe that, just as music is a continuation of my parent's talents and gifts, so is education. My mom is a teacher and her mother was a teacher as well.\" He first began working with kids in high school when he started volunteering at the Kalamazoo Nature Center. This experience sparked an interest in Joe that has inspired him to work with kids in a variety of ways. \"As my passion for [working with kids] grew I continued as an environmental educator, youth prevention specialist, and mentor through college and beyond. I have worked with the youth alcohol, tobacco, and other prevention programs at American Indian Health and Family Services in Detroit since I was a college student\u2014for about twelve years now\u2014in addition to working at the Leslie Science Center.\" It was during his summers at the Kalamazoo Nature Center that Joe came to love and understand nature, but his concerns about the environment started when he was much younger. \"Even when I was in elementary school, I became very concerned about environmental issues like the ozone layer, pollution and other large issues of human impact. Then, when I was in high school, being at the nature center opened me up to the real ecology of the world around me\u2014recognizing how beautiful and wonderful it is, and what a gift it is.\" High school was also the time when Joe began to explore his native roots. Part Irish and part Cherokee, Joe's family didn't have a direct connection to the native community, but an Indian education program in the schools allowed him to explore it. In his own exploration of his roots Joe began attending pow-wows, where he was introduced to drumming, but only as a listener. Later, when he moved to Ann Arbor to attend the University of Michigan, he became actively involved in it. \"When I came here to college at U of M, I was really introduced to the drum. There was a group of students and community members and they sang at a reception for incoming Native students and I was really inspired by that.\" Joe asked if he could join the group and soon was attending practices and drumming along. Playing with the group and building a relationship with drumming taught him a great deal about music. \"It taught me a lot about opening up my voice and really putting my voice out to share it. It taught me about having a role as a singer\u2014a role that is greater than just myself as an individual\u2014one that serves something in the community...It taught me to take it seriously. There's a responsibility to being a singer.\" He began to understand its role in an even deeper sense. \"[Music is] also a part of ceremony. Music can be prayer and music can be healing. It can be part of a spiritual expression, which is a continuation of what my parents taught me.\" Joe graduated from the University of Michigan in the summer of 2000 with a degree in Environmental Justice and began working on his first album, Mothers & Daughters, which came out in the spring of 2001. The fall and winter after college, he also worked two jobs to save up money for what he refers to as his \"Greyhound Bus Tour\" which he embarked on in the summer of 2001. For $500, Joe purchased a sixty-day Greyhound AmeriPass that would allow to him travel anywhere in the country. Having no scheduled shows, he visited places he had friends he could stay with: New York City, Washington D.C., Texas, San Diego, San Francisco, British Columbia, Seattle and Chicago. He spent about a week at each location, and while there, he played in parks, on street corners and at open mics. \"It was basically a dare to myself to see if I can do this and also, I think, kind of asking the universe for help, too. Saying, 'Hey, this is \"Even when I was in elementary school, I became very concerned about environmental issues like the ozone layer, pollution and other large issues of human impact. Then, when I was in high school, being at the nature center opened me up to the real ecology of the world around me\u2014recognizing how beautiful and wonderful it is, and what a gift it is.\" Like an invigorating hike through the woods, Joe Reilly's music reminds us of the magnitude of life that goes on around us and our deep and unending connection to it. Continued on page 52At Leslie Science and Nature Center, kids are prepped before recording their parts on songs to appear on Joe's upcoming album Let's Go Outside. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 52 what I'm going to put out, how is it going to fit in? Is there support for this?'\" Joe's Greyhound Bus Tour gave him a better sense of what music is about. \"It was a huge experience and I learned a lot as I went around. I learned that doing music is about relationships. That was the real value [of the trip]. The friends I stayed with and times with them and their support and help and encouragement--that's really what it's about. In music there can be this tendency to feel like 'I need to be noticed, I need to be recognized, I need to have some kind of fame...'There's a real hollowness to that, a real emptiness. The real richness is in the relationships with people.\" Shortly upon returning home from his tour, the tragedy of September 11th happened, and it changed Joe's outlook on life. \"[9/11] really was a big opening moment for everybody. But the way I experienced it was feeling very vulnerable and really knowing in my heart that this was a moment in our history where we need to remain open to compassion and understanding and peace. But I was so discouraged then when our country took the other way, which was vengeance, war, consumerism...and more violence in response to the terrible violence that had happened. That is Teenager Ryan Shea on Joe Reilly (Fifteen-year-old Ryan Shea plays guitar on some songs on Joe Reilly' s upcoming album, Let's Go Outside. This fall he will be a junior at Community High School and plans to pursue an education in music technology, law or musicology upon graduation.) Rachel Pastiva: How long have you known Joe Reilly? When, and under what circumstances, did you meet? Ryan Shea: I have been a regular at the Leslie Science and Nature Center since I was five, so I met Joe when he started working as a camp counselor there (maybe 4 or 5 years ago). Rachel Pastiva: Do you remember what you thought of his music the first time you heard him perform? Ryan Shea: I had actually heard him perform before he worked at Leslie, with a group called the Longhairz Collective. I enjoyed his music with that group so much that I still listen to the old CDs occasionally . RP: In what ways has his music changed your perspective on nature and the environment? Ryan Shea: One of my favorite aspects of his music is that there is a lot of input from kids in many of his songs. Often, at Leslie, he will take a group of kids and write a song with them. This makes them (and made me when I was that age) look more closely into a certain aspect of nature (the topic of the specific song they are writing) and explore it more in depth. RP: Has Joe's music inspired you to change the way you live at all?Ryan Shea: I'm sure it has, subconsciously, over the years. It is very infectious music, and it promotes a positive message, so the ideas are pretty firmly engrained in the young minds that enjoy it. RP: Joe mentioned that you play guitar on some songs on his upcoming album. How long have you been playing guitar? Has his music inspired you in any way to make music yourself? Ryan Shea: I have been playing guitar for five years. His music has shown me that you can use music to help others improve their lives. Many of his songs are aimed at reinforcing good, healthy habits and I aim to incorporate some of this style into my own music. RP: What was it like to play music with Joe?Ryan Shea: It's always a joy to play with Joe. His style is simple but infectious, and lots of fun to play. RP: How would you describe Joe and his music to someone who doesn't know him? Ryan Shea: Singer-songwriter folk-rock with a positive message. ###Singing Peace into the World: The Mindful Music of Joe Reilly Continued from page 51 \"[Meditation] gives me an anchor in love and compassion rather than anger or despair. This peace is also the source of my music, and I love to share that with others in a way that can communicate some of that loving energy.\" You're welcome here!

This is for you... Well, hello, little tomato, can you tell me all the secrets of this life that you know? In what type of environment did you grow, have you ever seen the city streets of Bordeaux? Hello, little tomato, I'm happy to have you as part of my bean stew Again let me ask you do you remember last September growing together with the cucumber in the fall slumber, sometimes I wonder if it felt a little edgy to be a young veggie before the harvest time Well I started out as just a seed, and when I germinated I was just a weed I grew up strong, my branches creeped along, I always hoped that someday I'd be in a song but alas! I know I've digressed, sittin' in your stew you might think I'm depressed but I'm quite content and will not prevent you from eating me, no I'm so happy to become part of you, your thoughts and your body it's like one big energy exchange party and what you ask, started all of this, it was the sun and photosynthesis I'm a producer, you're a consumer, I'll say it again I was fed by the rain and received the most from the compost, decomposing matter helped me grow fatter more red and juicy now won't you excuse me it's time for you to stop talking and consume me Well thank you, little tomato, there's so many more things that I can say oh but it's enough to say I'm grateful for all the stuff that you're made of the water, the soil and the sunshine, the gardener who staked out your vine the harvester who picked you at the right time I even have to acknowledge the energy divine that is in you and flows fr om you to me I will do my very best to live and to be worthy of your time and your energy I will eat you happily, mindfully come rest for a while with me in my belly then return to the earth for another rebirth I'll see you again my vegetable friend, I'll see you again my little veggie friend, I'll see you again... ### when I started to be more conscious. My work in the world, be it music or whatever , needs to be aligned with peace somehow.\" In response to his feelings about September 11 th, Joe picked up a book by Thich Nhat Hanh called Being Peace , which was his first introduction to Buddhist teachings and the work of Thich Nhat Hanh. Joe was transformed by the concept of looking within to find the peace we want to see in the world. \"That planted a seed for me, which has taken a long time to cultivate: how do I find peace in myself?\" Joe began meditating and continued studying Buddhism and the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh. \"The practice of mindfulness and meditation has given me such growth and such fertile soil for my music and spirit to grow in.\" Since his introduction to Thich Nhat Hanh, Joe has visited Plum Village three times, the Buddhist monastery and meditation center in Southern France, and home of Thich Nhat Hanh. He visits Plum Village in January when it is more of a monastic retreat, which allows him more space and time to write. \"Every time I go to Plum Village, I write many songs. That's a combination of all the conditions there...the support of the community, the Sangha, is really strong. The teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh are very heart opening and inspiring, and then the space and time to write. I bring a journal and fill it up. All those things together have made it a really wonderful way for me to not only just write songs, but for me to have a solid spiritual foundation for my music. It's like the soil; I really think that's true. And every time I go, my roots grow a little deeper in it and I can reach a little more into the world by just doing the work.\" Joe found that his spiritual work reaches the space inside him where his music also lives. \"[Meditation] gives me an anchor in love and compassion rather than anger or despair. This peace is also the source of my music, and I love to share that with others in a way that can communicate some of that loving energy.\" Joe's music is clearly infused with the intention of mindfulness, which he credits to his life experiences. \"Somehow it's all connected. The Greyhound Tour, September 11th and then reading the book by Thich Nhat Hanh. It's all part of the same path of trying to sing peace into the world.\" **** Like his meditation practice, working with kids has taught Joe some valuable lessons that he can apply outside of his work with them. \"Kids have taught me the importance of play\u2014of doing things just for fun and not necessarily trying to get something out of it...they've taught me about honesty too. It's better to be honest about where I'm at then to try to put on a front or a mask. I think as a performer that can be an easy thing to fall into: 'Okay, I have to be like this...' But I think with kids they help give me that because they are [honest]. If they're not into it their response is going to show you. It's not a personal attack, it's just the honest truth.\" Watching Joe perform kids' shows, it's evident that he's embraced the lessons that he's learned from working with them. He relates to them easily and encourages their participation through direct communication with audience members and lots of movement during songs. \"What I love about working with kids [is] they help me get out of my own self. I can start to imagine what it's like to be them---How do I connect with them? Well, let me imagine what it's like to be them. Let me put myself in their shoes. Let me recognize their selves within me. And then ultimately that's what the music has to become. It has to become this way to transcend our separateness. It's a way to connect.\" Today, Joe Reilly has no reason to play his music on random street corners across the country. He put himself out there and asked the universe if there is support for what he does, and the universe Continued on page 54\"[Drumming] taught me a lot about opening up my voice and really putting my voice out to share it. It taught me about having a role as a singer\u2014a role that is greater than just myself as an individual\u2014one that serves something in the community.\"Sitting on the rock wall under the walnut tree featured in the \"LSNC Summer Camp Song\" on Joe Reilly's upcoming album, Joe and the kids make deer ears for the camera. From left: Lily Gray Wright, Grace Thomas, Olivia Lyle, Maya Carmen Kelman Wolfkostin \"The practice of mindfulness and meditation has given me such gr owth and such fertile soil for my music and spirit to grow in.\"responded with a resounding \"YES!\" In 2007, Joe released his first children's album, Children of the Earth, and he is currently working on his second. He also has four albums geared towards an adult audience, but he's come to understand that the separation is unnecessary. \"Over the past few years I have realized more of an ability to share music with people of all ages, and have appreciated that versatility , rather than limiting myself to being only a children's singer or only a singer songwriter for an adult audience.\" This past spring Joe completed his third West Coast tour and does shows year-round all over southern Michigan at a variety of venues, including community centers, schools and churches. It turns out Ann Arbor isn't the only place lucky enough to have Joe Reilly. And that's a good thing. His messages of love, compassion and mindfulness transcend all boundaries and are important lessons for us all. Just as drawing our awareness to them can change the trees, water, and soil, we can be changed by the words of his songs. We can choose how we live upon the earth. We can also stop sometimes to sway in the breeze with the tree branches to remind ourselves that we are all one. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 54 How Kids Feel about Joe Reilly's Music (On a beautiful and hot July Saturday this past summer, Joe Reilly invited kids to the Leslie Science and Nature Center to help record songs for his upcoming album, Let's Go Outside. I had the great pleasure of watching the recording process and got a chance to speak with some of the kids after the recording session to find out how they feel about Joe' s music.) Rachel Pastiva: What is your favorite Joe Reilly song?Carmen Quinn (age 8): The Leslie Nature Center song because they sing all funny. Olivia Lyle (age 8): Summer Camp song because it's really good. Grace Thomas (age 7): Summer Camp song because it's fun. Maya Baum Ferrise (age 6) : Amphibian song because it's the danciest. Hayley Marchand (age 6): At the rock wall under the walnut tree song. It just has a lot of my attention and I want to sing along with it. Kristen Umbriac (age 8) : The Summer Camp song because the hand motions are really fun to do.Jasmine Lowenstein (age 6): I like them all.Rachel Pastiva: What makes Joe Reilly's music so much fun?Gabi Teodoru (age 8): He always sings about nature and his songs are so easy to memorize because the chorus is really often. Olivia Lyle: Because the music is not all played in one beat.Anya Dembitskaya (age 9): It's kids songs but adults can listen to it too.

Gabi Teodoru: I want to go to summer camp because I never did it before and I want to do more of the performances. Olivia Lyle: About nature in an outside way. Anya Dembitskaya : That you should respect nature no matter how much it annoys you. But I'm kind of against the Mosquito song where Joe says you're supposed to NOT kill mosquitoes and you're supposed to let them sit there and drink your blood. Kristen Umbriac : It really matters if you litter and don't do bad things to the earth.Lily Gray Wright (age 6): To respect nature.Maya Baum Ferrise : I've learned more about nature like what things are called, like what amphibians are.Hayley Marchand: Respect nature. Instead of throwing away your paper you can recycle it so you can use that and you can save more trees. Samantha Marchand (age 8): To play outside more instead of staying inside. RP: Has Joe Reilly's music changed the way you live? Kristen Umbriac : I like to use recycled things to make toys.Olivia Lyle: To not throw compost away, put it in your compost can instead. RP: How would you describe Joe Reilly's music to someone who hasn't heard it before, so that they would want to listen to it? Gabi Teodoru: You should listen to it because it's all about nature and it makes you feel confident in yourself and it's really easy to memorize and you can get it stuck in your head easily. Carmen Quinn: It's really cool and really fun and you should try it. Maya Baum Ferrise : It's dancing music. Come on, let's go listen to it!Hayley Marchand: His music is really good and he's really good at it. Anya Dembitskaya: It's just really good and it can be good for anybody. It doesn't matter how old you are. Kristen Umbriac : It's fun and lively. Jasmine Lowenstein: It's about the Earth and plants and animals and trees.

Be on the look out for it at Crazy Wisdom!) ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 55 Olivia Lyle Hayley Marchand Lily Gray Wright The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 56 Bill Zirinsky: As you look back on it now, what interests in your childhood foretold your becoming a martial arts instructor? Rob Byas: Funny enough, I've always known. My older sisters tell everyone to this day that I announced it at the sagely age of 7. I used to watch Saturday karate movie marathons on television. My friends and I would immediately proceed outside where we would reenact the fight scenes and battles. (Laughs) Boy, were those epic! I used to read all the ninja books and magazines from the 80's ninja boom. I saved one year's allowance to purchase an \"authentic\" ninja uniform when I was 10. I practiced postures from books religiously, and taught myself how to cartwheel, summersault, and back flip. I climbed up and over everything I could find. Bill Zirinsky: Tell us about your path to opening up the Ann Arbor College of Martial Arts. Rob Byas: I began training 17 years ago. In 1999, I opened a video game store in Hamtramck as a way to help kids stay off of the streets, and provide them a safe, uplifting environment. I built a training gym in the store. Neighborhood kids watched me train and enthusiastically asked questions. I began instructing a few of them. One student was accepted to U of M and wanted to continue training. I regularly commuted to Ann Arbor to teach at another facility, so I agreed to come on Sundays to work with him. We grew to become the largest martial arts organization on the campus. Several senior students graduated college and petitioned me to open a commercial school with them. BZ: How long has the Ann Arbor College of Martial Arts been in business, and how is it going? And tell us a bit about your partners, as well. Rob Byas: Almost two years and we're exploding! Ann Arbor has been waiting a long time for a martial arts school that actually teaches self defense. I have three partners, one of whom runs the daily operations of the school with me. BZ: I believe you mentioned to me that Ninpo Taijutsu was the form of martial arts practiced at the Ann Arbor College. Please tell us about this form of martial arts. Rob Byas: You are correct. The art originated in Japan and has a 900 year legacy of battle tested philosophies and techniques of self protection. It encompasses both Samurai and Ninja disciplines. Comprehensive in nature, it covers all aspects of self defense -- armed, unarmed, multiple attackers, stand up defense, ground defense, and psychological. The focus is on efficient, effective, intelligent, and practical methods of self protection and life skills. We practice and teach Godai Goshin Taijutsu, a contemporary system of self protection based on these time tested methods. BZ: You mentioned that your form is the parent martial art for a lot of other Japanese martial arts. Can you tell us a bit about that? Rob Byas: Over the last two centuries, the Samurai and Ninja warrior arts were segmented into specialties. However, they all have common sources. Aikido for example, is derived from Aikijutsu, which comes from Jutaijutsu; a core component of Ninpo Taijutsu. Likewise, Judo is from Jujutsu, also from Jutaijutsu. What hopes or concerns bring parents to your martial arts studio...what are they seeking for their kids? Rob Byas: Parents want practical martial art for their kids that will not advocate violence and aggression, yet prepares them to appropriately address assault scenarios. Some enroll their kids to develop focus, discipline, confidence, respect and physical fitness, academic tutoring, and exposure to outstanding role models that provide 'Living Examples'. Tell us a bit about the philosophical underpinnings of your approach to martial arts. Rob Byas: We use a model called \"Godai\" which means \"5 great elements\". The elements are Earth, Water, Fire, Wind and V oid. They are representations of mental and physical states of being. Form without function is fatally flawed, so we practice responses to assault scenarios as opposed to punching and kicking at the air for points or trophies. We advocate escape and evasion as the best solution with practical, direct, effective physical defense when necessary. One won't always be the biggest, fastest or strongest in a fight. Consequently, superior athleticism is not the basis of our techniques. We utilize distancing, timing, bone alignment and an attacker's momentum to our advantage to escape harm. You said to me that \"self defense begins with defense against self.\" Please explain.Rob Byas: Over time we develop habits that make us vulnerable to dangers in various guises. If we fail to practice moderation for example, we develop health issues, financial troubles, chaotic relationships, etc. By diminishing the frequency and presence of negative habits in our lives, we are in fact practicing self defense. Tell us about the role of self defense vis-\u00e0-vis the sport/competition aspects and the self improvement aspects of martial arts? Rob Byas: Martial Arts exist for the purpose of self defense, first and foremost. By default and design, self improvement dovetails into this imperative. Sport and Questions for Rob Byas about the Ann Arbor College of Martial Arts, and Teaching Self Defense to Kids Rob Byas of the Ann Arbor College of Martial Arts, located on South Industrial. Rob and his partners started the Ann Arbor College two years ago, and he says that business is exploding.

We conversely strive to diminish what's lacking, dangerous or destructive within kids. We set them on paths of positive growth and success. Photos by Rachael WaringJapanese and is often thought to mean teacher but actually means, \"One who comes before\". Neither is to be self titled, they are bestowed by students to those deemed worthy. My students have chosen to call me Sensei, as I am travelling the path to self mastery ahead of them. In this way, we are living examples to all those that come after us. You mentioned to me that \"we really suggest finding joy in everything we do as a sustainable fuel to get through it.\" Can you elaborate on the essence of that, as a closing thought? Rob Byas: If one can find some measure of joy in every task, no matter how much one may dislike it, one can endure and persevere to its completion. The \"Nin\" in Ninpo Taijutsu means \"To endure and persevere\". ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 57 competition should always be tertiary to the other two. Unfortunately, many sports centered martial arts schools purport themselves as self defense focused, and it is both a deception and a disservice to their students and clients that come to learn self defense. There are no rules of engagement when your life, health and safety are in jeopardy; you do what you must to make it home safely. I wish more consumers were educated on the differences, and that more school owners were forthcoming about the true nature of their programs. How does your martial arts program help kids in \"tempering or mastering oneself,\" to use your words? Rob Byas: This relates back to \"self defense begins with defense against self.\" We identify and cultivate areas of proficiency and potential. We conversely strive to diminish what's lacking, dangerous or destructive within kids. We set them on paths of positive growth and success. You said to me that kids in martial arts programs are \"investing in their future.\" What are the social, academic, and developmental advantages that a kid in your program may receive? What's unique about your children-specific programming? Rob Byas: Our kids benefit from a culturally diverse family oriented environment, a highly educated and motivating staff willing to serve as academic tutors, mentors and life coaches, and a home away from home. We are unique in that we can bridge the gap between parental authorities and youthful peers, in a positive, productive and functional way. We \"get\" young people. How does your program evolve as kids get older? Rob Byas: As children mature, we build on their motor and cognitive abilities. For example, the hand/eye coordination games played in our Tigers' program are the basis of evasion skills in our Dragons' program. The evasion skills of the Dragons coupled with vocalization drills form the foundation of our anti-bullying/anti-predator lessons of the Juniors' curriculum. How old are your own children, and have they trained in the martial arts? Rob Byas: I have two children. My daughter is 18 and in college. My son is 15 and attends Skyline High. Both train with me. You said to me that martial arts instructors are 'living examples'...and they must hold themselves to a high standard. Please explain the words 'sifu' and 'sensei'. Rob Byas: \"Sifu\" is Chinese and means both teacher and honorary father. \"Sensei\" is \"Our kids benefit from a culturally diverse family oriented environ- ment, a highly educated and motivating staff willing to serve as aca- demic tutors, mentors and life coaches, and a home away from home.\" \"One won't always be the biggest, fastest or strongest in a fight. Consequently, superior athleticism is not the basis of our techniques. We utilize distancing, timing, bone alignment and an attacker's momentum to our advantage to escape harm.\" Ross Winkler (left) and Rob Byas (right) are partners in running the daily operations of the Ann Arbor College of Martial Arts.Tea with the Fairies at Crazy Wisdom Tea Room Oct. 21 and Dec. 9; 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. seatings Children and their families are welcome for tea and petits fours served by real-life fairies!

Totten Imagine that you are a school-age child. Now, imagine being able to spend every recess and lunch hour splashing about a rain garden or hopping between tree stump stepping-stones. Think of yourself lolling among the squash, kale and berries of generous garden spaces, or playing hide-and-seek among the wheat grass. That's the vision of a captivating new play space for pre-kindergarten through eighth- grade students in the final planning stages at the Lower Campus of Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor. The design, by Shannan Gibb-Randall of InSite Design, has reached its end phase of development, with a grant from the James A. and Faith Knight Foundation enabling completion of the Master Plan. The school is now beginning fundraising, after which will follow solicitation of construction bids. Work on the grounds will be done in steps, as funding becomes available. Katrina Klaphake, Development Director at RSSAA, says that a natural playground concept is in keeping with the emphasis on creative, open-ended play that the Waldorf curriculum supports and the Waldorf pedagogy advocates. She notes that when the school began to contemplate improvements to its grounds over a year ago, they looked at \"transforming the play space so that it could more fully encourage creative problem-solving and appropriate risk-taking.\" The goal is to honor the environment while simultaneously honoring each child's real need for less structured play. Some of the planned changes include reshaping the landscape into gentle slopes and curves and removing many existing standard play structures. Those will be replaced with more open-ended pieces, such as wooden horses and stepping-stones. A rain garden will help drain water away from blacktop areas and direct spillage from the roof into a natural stream, trickling into an existing drain. It will also give children a place for water play. Some natural fences will be put in place to discourage grazing deer. Additionally, the existing garden's size will be expanded to further use it as a teaching tool. Currently, second-grade students plant seeds in spring, tending them to sprout, later to return as third-graders who weed and harvest the crops for use in the annual Thanksgiving feast. Celia Larsen, school gardener and instructor , has fashioned a welcoming space in the garden's center, behind a curvaceous wood plank fence, where stands a larger-than-life garden matron statue. The matron is made of sticks and wood, sporting a ceramic head. Her generous hands, on corn-stalk arms, spread wide to gather the gardens together. It provides a lovely spot to sit and talk, or to invent games. What advantage could all this beauty create in the mind, heart and soul of a seventh- grade student contemplating math or Renaissance history? What is its benefit for the third-grade student learning to build structures? Steiner himself said, \"Before we think, before we so much as begin to set our thinking in motion, it is essential we experience the condition of wonder.\" The Waldorf curriculum honors the interest Innovative Natural Playground is in the Works and engagement of children with activities that lead to enthusiasm and awakening. Natural play areas will encourage in the students a love of the world they live in. Renovating the outdoor space at Steiner is not a matter of simply making it more conducive to teaching academics by immersion, such as biology, but also it places an emphasis on letting children explore the outdoor environment and make it their own. They can look to the skies and watch the clouds and weather, see the movements of the birds and sun; they can dance among the flowers and be present as the seasons bring change. In this natural setting, via imaginative play, aspects of the good, the beautiful and the true can be developed. Through the hands, into the heart and mind, is nature and its wonders perceived. Then, each child can bring that wonder and inquisitiveness into the classroom. ###The school looked at \"transforming the play space so that it could more fully encourage creative problem-solving and appropriate risk-taking.\" The goal is to honor the environment while simultaneously honoring each child's real need for less structured play.

She received both a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology and a Master's degree in Education from DePaul University. Annie created her own spiritual support practice in 2005 called Dancin' in the Light, and writes a regular Family Consciousness column in Evolving Your Spirit magazine. She lives in Wilmette, Illinois with her husband and three children.) Rachel Pastiva: Your website, http://www.annieburnside.com/, describes you as a \"parent, educator, author and professional soul nurturer.\" What is a \"soul nurturer\" and how long have you been one? Annie Burnside: Officially, I have been a soul nurturer for five years. I created this career as it has always been the most natural aspect of who I am. A soul nurturer helps others awaken to their own truth in all aspects of life by providing the tools and encouragement to look more closely at their inner world. She assists others in viewing their life from an expanded perspective by helping them to remember their divine, creative, intuitive, eternal nature and how to integrate this knowing into their life choices. A soul nurturer's primary role is to inspire others to listen to the voice of their own soul so that direct divine connection can become fully accessible within daily reality. Your book, Soul to Soul Parenting: A Guide to Raising a Spiritually Conscious Family, aims at showing parents how to infuse spiritual awareness into everyday life. What are a couple of ways the book suggests doing this? Annie Burnside: We hold a weekly family discussion, utilize role-play, and use visual cues around our home as three daily means to integrate a spiritual practice into our lives. Once life-affirming themes such as self-love, authenticity, and oneness have been introduced, then they can be woven into all aspects of life\u2014friendships, disappointments, decisions\u2014to offer an expanded perspective in everyday life. How has your own family been changed by practicing the concepts outlined in your book? Annie Burnside: Our family has become more conscious in all areas\u2014 meaning greater responsibility and accountability for each and every choice due to the deeper understanding that we are shaping our own reality through our thoughts, words, deeds, priorities, beliefs, focus, and especially our state of being. There exists a higher degree of self-love, joy and freedom to live true within our family and the world at large now, and the capacity to dissect life experiences to uncover the underlying meaning that may at times not be readily apparent. Are there any challenges that are common among families working to infuse a more spiritual outlook in their lives? If so, what is your advice in facing these challenges? Annie Burnside: Gone are the days for most where spiritual contemplation takes place in solitude on a mountaintop. We are a modern family leading a very busy life. As you understand the importance of allowing each individual family member to live authentically and follow his or her passions, a great deal of balance is needed within the family requiring daily reminders and discussions. Also, the more transparent you become, the more you bump up against one another, because emotions are no longer stuffed down or denied or saved for later. So a conscious family is definitely not about peace at all costs, but rather utilizes the safety of the family to process all kinds of emotions as they come up so that individuals do not acquire \"psychic debris\" that will eventually have to be dealt with... What can people expect to take away from your book event at Crazy Wisdom on Sunday, September 26th? Annie Burnside: My hope is that parents will walk away both inspired, and with some specific tools that resonate, to begin living more consciously as spirit-embodied global citizens on a daily basis within their own home, side by side and soul to soul with their children. ### (For more information, visit www.annieburnside.com or email annie@annieburnside.com.

Annie writes regularly for AnnArbor.com. She also is the past Editor of A Different Path , a publication for the families of special needs children in Washtenaw County. Annie is grateful to live in Ann Arbor with her husband and three teenage sons.) Rachel Pastiva: Your book, You'll Thank Me Later: A Guide to Nurturing Gratitude in Our Children (and Why That Matters), is a guide for parents on how to instill gratitude in their children. How does gratitude change a child's outlook? Annie Zirkel: Gratitude is, quite frankly, one of the critical elements for a child to have in order to develop into a more connected, responsible, resilient and happier grown-up. Noticing what you have and remembering the positives of your life help you savor your good experiences and bounce back better from life's challenges. Children who practice gratitude show more of this life satisfaction and resilience and even, according to a study by Robert Emmons, et al, like school and their families more. On the back of your book you suggest that children experience a sense of entitlement in our fast paced world. What do you attribute this attitude to, and how do you suggest parents help their child overcome it? Annie Zirkel: Entitlement is about believing that you deserve something even when you haven't done anything to earn it. Parents feed entitlement by giving too much (stuff and of ourselves) and asking too little of our children. When it comes to appreciation, getting something for nothing is about the hardest thing to notice and be grateful for. Add to this our societal consumerism messages which encourage you to be unsatisfied with what you have, and the speed with which our worlds are moving, and it creates the perfect storm for ingratitude. The practice of gratitude is a reflective process which means you need the right messages and enough time to notice. Parents can help children avoid entitlement by doing less, and instead having their children participate in earning the material items and privileges that they want. Through chores, working for life's rewards, and behaving in positive ways children can reap the benefits of their participation. And in doing so, hopefully feel more connected and appreciative of the end results. In your book there is a chapter on relationship challenges to teaching your child gratitude. What is the most common relationship obstacle parents face in nurturing gratitude in their children? Annie Zirkel: Probably the most common relationship obstacle for parents trying to nurture gratitude is pushing too hard and expecting gratitude too fast. Whether with too much shame and impatience or because of a lack of empathy for the big feelings of 'small' disappointments, parents can struggle to get this just right. Watching the 'shame factor' and allowing some time to process a disappointment before we ask them to 'get over it' and remember all that is positive can actually help children get to gratitude faster and in a more genuine way. What can people expect to learn from your book event at Crazy Wisdom in November? Annie Zirkel: I hope that those who attend walk away with a refreshed sense of appreciation for the many facets and benefits of gratitude. And that they find ideas on how to instill this important trait into their children's repertoire of life skills so that their kids really can ~ thank them later. ### (Annie Zirkel' s writings can be found on her website, anniezirkel.com , under the tagline, The Writer Side of Annie.

I still have everything on the out - side (still working as a physician), but now I feel peace and love inside of me. I do not live in constant fear and worry and anxiety. I went through the great initiations of baptism and il - lumination and was brought into self-realization by my teachers, Mother Clare Watts and Father Peter Bowes. I now can actually see God, literally, and have a real, personal and intimate relationship with God, much sweeter and deeper than anything I could ever before imagine. I am filled with gratitude that God heard my prayer and accepted me back, as torn and tarnished as I was. I now live at the Center of Light in Ann Arbor, which opened in June. I teach classes and guide others into their relationship with God, in the same way that I was taught by my teachers. It is possible. I did it. This is exactly what mysticism is: knowing through one's experience. I would not have been able to say six years ago that I wanted to be a mystic, let alone a Christian mystic. I was not that sophisticated. I did know that I really wanted to know God and know real love. My prayer is for each one of us on this planet to come into this real relationship with God, to find complete inner peace, and to know what it is to love and be loved. Blessings to all. ###(For more information, visit annarbor.centersoflight.org or email revlela@centersoflight.org)By Rev. Lela IdunaPhotos by Rachael Waring People often look at me and ask, \"How did you get into Christian Mysticism?\" I can understand that ques - tion. As someone born a Muslim in Pakistan, raised in the Middle East, and working in the United States as an emergency room physician, what have I got to do with Christian Mysticism? I first muse inwardly at God's mercy and grace that drew me to this path and then share my story. About six years ago, I was at the lowest point in my life. My life felt empty. On the outside, everything was perfect: a beautiful house on the Long Island Sound, an awesome job and lavish vacations. To an outsider, I had the perfect dream life. But inside, I was one big, dark, empty hole. I was sad, lonely and depressed. I knew that my boyfriend and my family did not know me or see me. They saw my physical body and my money. Something in my life was dreadfully wrong and I knew that I needed God. I knew that some special people could hear God and see God, and God talked to them. I was mad at God that I did not have that special privilege. I also felt shame and guilt, and that I was unworthy of that privilege. Nevertheless, one day I wrote a letter to God say - ing that I was done looking for love on my own, that I gave all control over to God and I asked that God bring back love into my life, and that I didn't care what it looked like. Did you know that God reads mail? Very soon after that, I was given a book by one of the resident doctors whom I was training, who is a priest with the Centers of Light, a Christian mystical order. The book was called Giving Birth to God, written by Mother Clare Watts. I read that book and was blown away. Mother Clare told the story of her life's journey of coming into relation - ship with God, and it really spoke to my heart and my soul. I knew that I so badly wanted what she had - a relationship with God. I never in my wildest dreams would have thought that I would meet Mother Clare, be taught by her, or be trained and initiated by her into a relationship with God, but clearly God had that all worked out. I ini - tially started working with the local priest at the nearby Center of Light in New Haven, Connecticut, learning to meditate and pray, learning about light and soul. I was given exercises that helped my concentration and devo - tion. I was given counseling to help work through the pain, anger, and sorrow in my life. I started to learn to connect to Jesus and Mary and, through their love, forgive people who had hurt me and, more importantly, to forgive myself and accept love. For the first time in my life, I felt like someone really cared about me, knew me and loved me for who I was - and not because I was a rich doctor. Mother Clare invited me to move to Boston so I could get intensive live-in training at the novice house, a modern-day novitiate program. I promptly accepted that offer. The training was free and I paid my room and board. A year later, I was ordained a minister-deacon and then a priest and was asked to move to Lansing, Michigan to start a center and train others. \"As someone born a Muslim in Pakistan, raised in the Middle East, and working in the United States as an emergency room physician, what have I got to do with Christian Mysticism?\" \"I would not have been able to say six years ago that I wanted to be a mystic, let alone a Christian mystic. I was not that sophisticated. I did know that I really wanted to know God and know real love.\"\"Something in my life was dreadfully wrong and I knew that I needed God. I knew that some special people could hear God and see God, and God talked to them.\"Rev. Lela Iduna is the director of the Center of Light in Ann Arbor.

By Master Wasentha Young, Director The land holds sacred messages that are transmit - ted through plants, animals, livelihood, people and community. It also reflects how we experi - ence our well-being and personal growth. True to the notion that what we need to be healthy is usually within our grasp or in our immediate environment, the Peaceful Dragon School of Tai Chi Ch'uan and Chi Kung has been a part of the Ann Arbor community for 20 years. Focused on health and well-being, the Peaceful Dragon School offers a comprehensive program in the healing arts of tai chi, chi kung (also spelled qi gong), and meditation. The Peaceful Dragon School is located in the basement of an unassuming office building but, upon entering, its safe atmosphere and peaceful, open-minded environment is palpable. Those seeking complementary health-promoting art forms and other self-care practices will find the teachers have an air of presence and calm and use a variety of learning styles, including humor. I began my study of tai chi in 1968 at Grandmas - ter William C.C. Chen's school in New York. Grandmaster Chen initiated his tai chi studies in Taiwan dur - ing 1949 as a live-in understudy of Profes-sor Cheng Man-ching. Professor was a stu-dent of Yang Chang-fu. The Yang style is the lineage that I brought with me when I arrived in Ann Arbor in 1988 and opened my school in 1990. Often I am asked, \"Why Ann Arbor?\" Ann Arbor has been a wonderful place for me to grow \u2014 not only as a human be - ing, but as an instruc - tor as well. When I left New York City, where I grew up and was trained in tai chi, I was in my early 20's. In Taos, NM, I lived for six months without electricity, running water, or locks on the front door (I had four in NY). I learned to cook on a wood-burning stove, surviving on the bare minimum \u2014 seri - ous culture shock! It was just the elements, open sky, and myself. My mind was plagued with the internal and external \"chatter\" that I brought with me from NY . William LeSassier (1948-2003), owner of the Christos School of Natural Health and Healing, where I taught in Taos, told me that a good mid - point between the cultures of NY and Taos would be Boulder, CO. When winter came to Taos and people started to talk about chain-sawing wood, I headed for Boulder and Trungpa Rinpoche's Bud-dhist community and school, the Naropa Institute. Taos had been about finding myself and Boulder became the place I began to know myself, teaching small classes and studying my mind through the teachings of Trungpa. Trungpa also invited some of the Profes - sor's first American disciples to come to Naropa to teach tai chi, so my learning of tai chi contin - ued. I delved deeper into Taoist philosophy through my study with Ga Fu Feng, an eminent teacher and translator of the Tao Te Ching. In about 1982 I returned to NM, this time settling in Santa Fe. There, the lessons of creativity in living and art took shape. I learned how to bring nature, presence of mind, and tai chi as a health art form together in my teaching. So, why bring the Peaceful Dragon School from Santa Fe to Ann Arbor? An acquaintance (now friend) of mine named Gae Winn, an Ann Arbor pagan, told me that Ann Arbor could use a female tai chi instructor. I was having trouble surviving in Santa Fe because of the economic gap between those who were financially well off and those who Celebrating the Peaceful Dragon School's 20 Years in Ann Arbor Master Wasentha Young, Director of the Peaceful Dragon School of Tai Chi Ch'uan and Chi Kung \"It has been 20 years of growing here. Having a stable place to build an atmosphere that mirrors the intent of peace and calm has attracted many people. During this time, the school has touched well over a thousand lives.\" were not; so I figured, why not try living in Ann Arbor? In 1994, I went to Berkeley, CA to study at the Institute of Acupres- sure for a couple of years. The school car - ried on in my absence, subletting by the hour in the former Dance Gallery Studio (now site of the current YMCA), with the as-sistance of Jim Carey, Norman Cox, and Beth Wiggert. When I returned to Ann Arbor, the Peaceful Dragon moved to Pauline Blvd. near Stadium, sharing space with a hard-style martial arts teacher. About a year later, it became solely the Peaceful Dragon School, and it has remained in the same location since then. It has been 20 years of growing here. Hav-ing a stable place to build an atmosphere that mirrors the intent of peace and calm has attracted many people. During this time, the school has touched well over a thousand lives. Considering the size of the Ann Arbor community, this is substantial. Many of the school's patrons have been individual Ann Ar - borites, but the school has also served the Univer - sity of Michigan and small businesses alike. To date, Ann Arbor has afforded me the opportu - nity to grow in love and in the art of consciously Students and Teachers of the Peaceful Dragon School grouped around Master Wasentha Young. \"I am committed to holding fast in providing Ann Arbor with this haven. We are still here, downstairs in the place I call the 'sacred cave,' and we plan to celebrate.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2010 Page 74giving to the health of the community in which I live. I honor and am grateful for what the land and the nature of life around me have given. Here I have learned how to love all of who I have become. Sharing that notion \u2014 of loving oneself deeply \u2014 with others jour - neying on the path toward becoming divine creatures is an honor. Some years are better financially than others. Because of the current economic situation, today we are hanging on by the Dragon's nails. The school does not make much of a profit these days; if I am lucky , it makes $500 in a month. Nonetheless, I am committed to holding fast in providing Ann Arbor with this haven. We are still here, down - stairs in the place I call the \"sacred cave,\" and we plan to celebrate. On September 25, the Peaceful Dragon School will be observing its 20th year in Ann Arbor. Grandmaster Chen is coming to teach a seminar open to all styles of tai chi practitioners, followed by a celebration at Rudolf Steiner High School, and a dinner at Gourmet Gardens.

She has written over 100 articles and book chapters on smoking, and also contributed to the 2001 Surgeon General' s Report on Women and Smoking. Cynthia has two grown daughters and two grandchildren, and lives in Ann Arbor with her husband and two cats.) Rachel Pastiva: Your website, www.lifeaftercigarettes.com, mentions that you served as the director of the Nicotine Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan from 1985 until your retirement last year. What attracted you to research this particular field? Cynthia Pomerleau: Long before I became involved in research on smoking, I had an interest in women's issues. I wrote my doctoral dissertation on autobiographies of English women in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and later served as director of an Oral History Project on Women Physicians, based in the Library of the Medical College of Pennsylvania (MCP was historically a women's institution that had recently begun accepting men). This project resulted in a book entitled In Her Own Words, which remained in print for many years and can still be readily obtained. In the early 1980's, I entered a master's program in psychology and began working in my husband's laboratory. He was a psychologist doing research on addiction and regarded smoking as an ideal model for laboratory research because it is legal, has a short addiction cycle (around 30 minutes in highly dependent smokers), and doesn't cause behavioral disruption such that it would be unsafe for participants to drive home after ingesting their drug of choice. At that time he was studying only men because their behavior was not \"complicated\" by cycling hormones. Studying women smokers was my contribution to the laboratory, and of course we had to start by studying the impact of the menstrual cycle on smoking. We then went on to study the effect of weight concerns and of various psychiatric disorders upon smoking and quitting. Studying women' s smoking turned out to be a wonderful career choice for me because the topic is both critically important to public health and fascinating in its own right. Rachel Pastiva: It's interesting that your book, Life After Cigarettes: Why Women Smoke AND How to Quit, Look Great, and Manage Your Weight is geared specifically towards women. Do women face stressors that make them more susceptible to smoking than men? Cynthia Pomerleau: Since the smoking rate in men and women is currently very similar -around 20% - it is probably not the case that women are more susceptible to smoking then men, although there is a fair amount of evidence that women find it a little harder to quit than men. In response to your implied question about my book being \"geared specifically towards women,\" however, the important thing to note is that factors that influence women to initiate and continue smoking differ from those that influence men, especially with respect to weight concerns and depression. Taking those special considerations into account and tailoring our prevention and intervention efforts to the special needs of women will increase our ability to help women become and remain smokefree. The subtitle of your book suggests that appearance and weight concerns are key issues for women who are trying to quit smoking. Can you elaborate on how these issues undermine their ability to quit? Cynthia Pomerleau: Nicotine suppresses appetite and revs up metabolism, with the result that smokers typically weigh around ten pounds less than people who have never smoked. For some women - for example, women who \"use\" nicotine to manage a tendency towards binge-eating - the differential may be even greater. Most women have some degree of concern about or dissatisfaction with their body weight; for many women smokers, this concern is so intense that they will not even consider quitting smoking, or they will not make it beyond the first few days of abstinence as the needle on the scale begins to creep up. Many so-called experts, mostly male, have a hard time relating to these concerns and either actively or implicitly \"dis\" women for putting them above concerns about health (as though men didn't take unnecessary risks with their health!). My book, by contrast, makes clear that there is nothing wrong with wanting to be the most attractive \"you\" you can be, and to have the sense of well-being that goes with looking and feeling good. The problem is, smoking also has many negative effects on appearance as well as on health. My book's message is that there are far better ways to take charge of weight and appearance.Spotlight on Cynthia Pomerleau, Author of Life after Cigarettes: Why Women Smoke AND How to Quit, Look Great and Manage Your Weight Author Cynthia Pomerleau will be giving a talk about her new book, at the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room on Thursday, October 7th at 7pm.

What unique tools does your book offer women to help them quit for good? Cynthia Pomerleau: I have never seen Life After Cigarettes as a quit-smoking book per se. (As you say, there are already lots of them, and though many are of questionable value or based on unsubstantiated methods, a few of them are pretty good.) You will notice that my book does not contain self-tests for smoking typology or step-by-step behavioral prescriptions for the reader to follow. It also does not try to scare the reader into quitting by telling her upfront about all the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking. In my original manuscript, in fact, information on quitting smoking was relegated to an Appendix, since I wanted to be sure the book would also appeal to former smokers who had already quit but hoped to go back and \"get it right\" with respect to weight and depression. When my publisher insisted that the subtitle include the words \"how to quit,\" however, I decided that truth-in-advertising required me to add a chapter providing comprehensive, up-to-date information about approved behavioral and pharmacological interventions for smoking. I think this turned out to be a good addition to the book and hope anyone seeking guidance on how to quit smoking will find it helpful. But the unique contribution of my book is its focus on problems that often deter women from even trying to quit -- in particular, concerns about weight and abstinence-emergent depression: Life After Cigarettes provides motivation to quit and stay quit based on realistic observations about the likelihood of weight gain, encouragement to accept a modest weight gain, and evidence-based information on how to avoid lar ge weight gain. The emphasis, for both quitting smoking and managing weight, is on finding the way that is right for the reader, the one she can and will carry out. Smoking is more common among people with a tendency towards depression, possibly because of nicotine's antidepressant effects, and these people are particularly susceptible to experiencing depressed mood as a withdrawal symptom when they quit smoking. Because depression is around twice as common among women as it is among men, this aspect of smoking and quitting is particularly relevant to women. My book includes suggestions for coping with depressed mood after quitting and, in severe cases, encouragement to seek professional help. What can women expect to learn from your book event at Crazy Wisdom on Thursday, October 7th? Cynthia Pomerleau: Please note that my presentation will be framed to appeal to people with a general interest in women's issues, not just smokers. Topics to be covered include: How has the tobacco industry attempted to encourage women to initiate and maintain smoking, both in the US and globally? How does nicotine act on the body and why are its effects particularly relevant to the needs and concerns of many women? Is weight gain upon quitting smoking inevitable, and how can it be managed? What is the connection between smoking and depression? How can a woman smoker become not just someone who no longer smokes cigarettes, but one who has actively embraced her nonsmoking status and feels good about herself and her world? ### ( Cynthia Pomerleau lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Rachel Pastiva: On your website, www.thespiritedlife.com, it mentions that you picked up your first Tarot deck in 1998, and began reading for clients in 2000. What did you discover in using the Tarot that inspired you to make it a part of your practice? Paul Quinn: I felt a deep rapport with the cards. Here were pictures with great vitality that symbolized the truths of the world's mystical traditions, which have always intrigued and guided me. The Tarot also presented a wonderful way to explore archetypal psychology, which has helped me to understand myself and the world symbolically and therefore more objectively. Psychic and author Sonia Choquette is quoted as saying \"Paul doesn't teach the Tarot, he teaches you how to channel the Tarot.\" Do people have to have known psychic abilities to use Tarot effectively? Paul Quinn: A person doesn't have to identify as \"psychic\" to read the cards. But I think the most skillful -- and happiest -- card readers tend to be good listeners, thoughtful students of life, and attracted to symbols and dreams. We have to be intimate with our inner life in order to understand the messages of the cards; that's a psychic process, though not necessarily one practiced by psychics. How do you describe Tarot to people who may have misperceptions about it, or are not familiar with it? Paul Quinn: I tell them the Tarot is like having their own portable life coach, an ally that can help them identify opportunities, navigate the rough spots, and see themselves and others with greater compassion and possibility . A lifelong intuitive tool to access unconscious wisdom. What can people expect from your book event and workshop at Crazy Wisdom on Sunday, October 17th? Author Paul Quinn will be at Crazy Wisdom on Sunday, October 17th. He loves working with Tarot cards. They are \"pictures with great vitality that symbolize the truths of the world's great mystical traditions.\"Spotlight on Paul Quinn, Author of Tarot for Life: Reading the Cards for Everyday Guidance and Growth Paul Quinn: I'm going to share some stories from the book, and have audience members pull cards from my Tarot deck. We'll discuss only those cards pulled by the audience. In the workshop which follows, I'm going to teach a few of my favorite spreads and lead participants in exercises designed to help them feel the cards, going beyond the intellect. Beginners as well as more experienced readers will benefit. Please join us! ### (Paul Quinn can be reached at paulquinn@thespiritedlife.com.
