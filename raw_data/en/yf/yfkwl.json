Researchers from the University of Melbourne, Australia, studied 26 pairs of twins or siblings, where one had received long-term treatment for a condition requiring antiepileptic medication (median 19 years) and the other had not. The study found that, at baseline and follow-up, users of antiepileptic medication had more body sway and poorer static balance than non-users. Over a median of three years, the patients also had a significantly greater annual deterioration in sway than their twin and sibling controls. The researchers, writing in the November issue of Epilepsia [[1]](#fn_1) , say that antiepileptic therapy may therefore progressively impair balance mechanisms, although further studies are required to exclude confounding factors.
