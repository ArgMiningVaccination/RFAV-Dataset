Crystal Sound Therapy can be a deeply relaxing, transformational and profound healing experience. Althought its roots stem from ancient ancestral healing practices, modern science is beginning to re-discover the effects in which harmonic frequencies produced by specialist instruments, tones and crystals, can benefit the human body both physically, mentally and spiritually. The level of benefit through sound healing depends on the individual, however, scientific studies and client testmonies have reported that sound healing may be beneficial in aiding those who suffer with chronic pain, particularly muscle and joint pain, [Fibromyalgia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325896/), ME, [Parkinsons Disease,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33904475/) [tissue healing and blood flow issues, ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17261985/)arthritis, insomnia, anxiety and stress related conditions, inflammation, tinnitus, depression and many other mental and physical health issues. The Significance of Intention Through experimentation and practice, Jonathan Goldman, one of the worlds leading authorities on sound healing, discovered that the power of thought plays a vital role in the healing process and so it is with every sound healing session, clients are encouraged to set a healing intention for themselves. It promotes the clearing of blocks in the Body-Mind circuitry, allowing the natural energies to flow within us and thus, sound and intention come together, to create a natural, focused healing space. What to Expect During a Sound Therapy Session An initial consultation will take place before the treatment. You will remain fully clothed and normally be asked to lie on a therapy table or to be seated. Once you are comortable, Jonathan will then commence the therapy utilising a fusion of sacred practices from diverse ancient cultures, such as Tibet, India, China and North America, gently helping you to enter a deep trance or 'Theta' state of healing using the following: Specialist Sound Instruments Ranging From - - Planetary attuned gongs - Crystal and Tibetan singing bowls - Crystal and metal tuning forks - Crystal bells and pyramid - Native American drum and rattle - Binaural Beats and other entrainment frequencies - Low Frequency therapy bed - Vocal toning Energy Flow Each session will involve cleansing the body's energy field with aromatic essences such as the sacred wood smoke of sustainably sourced Palo Santo along with aura sprays derived from plant essences and essential oils to promote positive mood enhancement and to provide an overall pleasurable experience. Crystals Specifically chosen crystals which work in harmony with the client are also placed on the Chakras and around the body to induce good energy flow and to clear any detrimental energy blockages. The Power of Silence After Jonathan completes his direct work you are held within a period of silence for a time of consolidation. This encourages the healing to continue after the treatment. After Your Treatment You may feel deeply relaxed and you may experience some unfamiliar sensations due to the natural re-balancing process as a result of the treatment. Just one session may bring about powerful results, with immediate shifts in awareness and physicality. Studies have shown that sound therapy can result in profound changes involving mental, emotional and physical issues. These effects can vary with each individual and each session. If you feel tired or lack concentration, this will soon pass. We always advise to drink plenty of water and to avoid alcohol or other stimulants for at least 24 hours.
