Why is gov ernment action or intervention necessary? Effective vaccines are likely to be among the best ways to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and minimis e its harmful effects on the nation's health and econ omy. The Government needs to ensure that appropriat e processes and measures are in place to ensure that a vaccine can be brought to market as soon as possi ble, and can be deployed as quickly as possible, to ensu re that direct impacts of COVID-19 on mortality and morbidity, as well as indirect impacts on health, s ociety and the economy are minimised as far as poss ible. What are the policy objectives of the action or int ervention and the intended effects? The overarching policy objective is to enable the d eployment of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine at the pace and scale required, if and when a COVID-19 vac cine becomes available. The policy aims to help achieve this by amending the Human Medicines Regula tions (HMRs) to help ensure that an effective vacci ne can come to market and can be deployed as safely an d quickly as possible. The legislation additionally enables other measures but this assessment focuses on its primary purpose of supporting delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. What policy options have been considered, including any alternatives to regulation? Please justify pre ferred option (further details in Evidence Base) Several barriers to safe and rapid deployment have been identified, including: Ambiguity around whether conditions can be attache d to the temporary authorisation of the supply of an unlicensed medicine under regulation 174 and how any breaches to these conditions would be handled, and therefore the strength of the supply c hain and enforcement could be compromised Insufficient existing workforce to deliver a COVID -19 vaccine at pace on a population wide scale A prohibition on promoting, via advertisements of an unlicensed medicine to healthcare professionals and the public Potential delays in moving around a vaccine betwee n premises due to wholesale license requirements. All of these would be clarified or facilitated by a mending the HMRs. No alternative measures have been considered. Will the policy be reviewed? It will be reviewed. If applicable, set review date: Within a year of first use. Does implementation go beyond minimum EU requiremen ts? Yes / No / N/A Is this measure likely to impact on international t rade and investment? No Are any of these organisations in scope? Micro Yes/No Small Yes/No Medium Yes/No Large Yes/No What is the CO 2 equivalent change in greenhouse gas emissions?

We assume no addition al vaccine administration costs, as the same number of vaccines are delivered. Other key non-monetised costs by 'main affected gro ups' There may be additional costs from recruiting the e xpanded workforce, but due to uncertainties about c urrent capacity it has not been possible to quantify these . There may also be additional costs associated wit h a communications campaign and costs from coordinating wholesale redeployment. However, given uncertainties around deployment in practice, it has not been possible to monetise these. We anticipate no additional costs in relation to conditions or immun ity.

If an ex panded workforce can deliver a COVID-19 vaccine more quick ly and the vaccine provides immunity for a year, th ere may be between 240 and 900 averted deaths and betwe en 45 and 170 saved morbidity QALYs, under a low incidence scenario. These ranges reflect uncertaint y in how much sooner these regulations might enable a vaccine to be administered. The analysis assumes a specific scenario where mitigations were put in pla ce, and not all health impacts have been quantified; in an unmitigated scenario where no lockdown measures were introduced, lost mortality and morbidity QALYs would be much higher. Other key non-monetised benefits by 'main affected groups' Clarifying conditions and immunity to civil liabili ty will bring clarity to the supply chain. There ma y be indirect benefits to the health and social care system, wide r society and the economy if the vaccine helps the UK to return to something close to pre-pandemic life. Key assumptions/sensitivities/risks Discount rate (%) 1.5 We assume an effective, safe COVID-19 vaccine is id entified in the time window to benefit from these amendments. We assume this will be available to at- risk adults in the UK, in line with JCVI interim gu idance, and there will be an uptake rate of 75%. We assume the vaccine will either provide immunity or reduce disease severity, to the extent that it will reduce COVID-19 to low levels or reduce the consequences of infection in high risk patients in the UK, allowing something close to pre-pandemic life to return. We assume a steady rate of COVID-19 related infections, hospi talisations and deaths, in line with an average wee kly rate under a low incidence scenario produced by SPI-M. B enefits only apply to a specific scenario where a) there is an effective vaccine and b) it is able to be dep loyed more quickly as a result of the amendments. D ue to uncertainties about necessary frequency of vaccinat ion, we assume protection lasts for 1 year and only consider costs and benefits for this period. The ab ility to grant temporary authorisation for unlicens ed vaccines already exists and is not considered to ch ange as a result of the proposed amendments to the HMRs. A vaccine will only be temporarily authorised if the licensing authority is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the safety, qual ity and efficacy of the vaccine. There may be some risks to public perceptions with any temporary authorisat ion (with or without these amendments). 4 BUSINESS ASSESSMENT (Option 2) Direct impact on business (Equivalent Annual) \u00a3m: Score for Business Impact Target (qualifying provisions only) \u00a3m: Costs: Benefits: Net: 5 Evidence Base 1. Problem under consideration and rationale for inter vention In responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK Gove rnment is working to a scientifically-led, step-by-step action plan for tackling the pandemic - taking the right measures at the right time. Effective COVID-19 vaccines will be among the best w ay to deal with the pandemic and minimise its harmful effects on the nation's health and economy. Any vaccine must first go through the usual rigorou s testing and development process and be shown to meet the expected high standards of safety , quality and efficacy before it can be deployed. The independent Joint Committee on Vaccin ation and Immunisation (JCVI) will advise the UK government on which COVID-19 vaccine/ s the UK should use, and on the priority groups to receive the vaccine based on the best ava ilable clinical, modelling and epidemiological data. This will depend on the prope rties of the vaccine, those most at need (including health and care workers) and the particu lar medical circumstances of individuals. In time, and depending on the characteristics of the v accine available, it may be possible for JCVI to opine on whole or 'most of' population use to re duce transmission. The preferred route to enable deployment of a new v accine for COVID-19 is through the usual marketing authorisation (product licensing) process . If a suitable COVID-19 vaccine candidate, with strong supporting evidence of safety, quality and efficacy, becomes available, our preferred option will be to seek to license that vaccine thro ugh the usual route. Until the end of December 2020, EU legislation requires biotechnological medi cines (which would include candidate COVID-19 vaccines) to be authorised via the Europea n Medicines Agency, and a marketing authorisation granted by them would automatically b e valid in the UK. From January 2021, the UK's licensing authority will have new powers to li cense all medicines, including vaccines. Licensing involves an expert review of all trial da ta by the UK Government or the European regulator, checking that the trials show the produc t meets efficacy and safety levels, and ensuring that the product's advantages outweigh the disadvantages. 1 Licensing can typically take weeks or months. 2 However, under regulation 174 of the Human Medicine s Regulations (HMRs) 2012, the requirement for authorisation \"does not apply where the sale or supply of a medicinal product is authorised by the licensing authority on a temporar y basis in response to the suspected or confirmed spread of pathogenic agents, toxins, chem ical agents, or nuclear radiation which may cause harm to human beings\". If there is a compelli ng case, on public health grounds, for using a vaccine before it is given a product licence, giv en the nature of the threat we face, the JCVI may take the very unusual step of advising the UK g overnment to use a tested, but currently unlicensed vaccine against COVID-19. The Government needs to make sure that the right legislative measures are in place to ensure that a vaccine (including a temporarily authorised product) can be deployed safely, at pace and at sca le if needed. Several obstacles to rapid deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine have been identified, such as uncertainties about the legal requirements on organ isations in the supply chain, the demand on the current NHS workforce and the ability to expand the eligible vaccinator workforce, a prohibition of the promotion of unlicensed vaccines and requirements related to wholesale dealing of vaccines. These could all be addressed b y amending the HMRs; the changes are proposed with the view to supporting the rapid and effective rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine and 1 University of Oxford, 2018.

It is important to note that under the existing HMR s there is already provision to grant the temporary authorisation of an unlicensed medicine, including vaccines, if the product is proven to be safe and effective, and if it is in the best interests of public health. This impact assessment does not assess the costs and benefits of using a t emporarily authorised vaccine itself; this is not the topic of the proposed legislative amendment s, because this is already enabled under the HMRs. Indeed, it is not a foregone conclusion that a temporarily authorised vaccine would be used; as noted above, the preferred route for deplo yment is through normal licensing processes. The MHRA have confirmed that in either c ase, they would undertake a comparable assessment of evidence before approval for use. The refore, this impact assessment focuses solely on the proposed amendments to the HMRs to fa cilitate the deployment of a vaccine (which could be temporarily authorised) if it becom es available - the amendments are described in Section 3. 2. Rationale and evidence to justify the level of anal ysis used in the IA The current IA appraises the costs, benefits and ri sks associated with amending the HMRs in order to enable a COVID-19 vaccine to be deployed safely, at pace a nd at scale. It only considers the proposed changes to the UK regulatory framework for human medicines. In most cases, decisions of detail regarding deployment wil l be taken by the NHS in each of the four nations of the UK, as they decide the best way to r oll out any COVID-19 vaccination programme in each nation - as they do for their national flu vaccination programmes, and would do for any future national distribution campaign for treatment s for a pandemic disease. Therefore, these amendments contain broad powers to support the deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine, but the detail of the subsequent policies and programmes is yet to be determined. At present, there is considerable uncertainty about wh at a COVID-19 vaccine might look like, in terms of who it might be suitable for, how it shoul d be administered (including cold chain requirements during deployment), its availability, the kind of protection it will provide (disease modifying or sterilising immunity), and how long it will provide protection for. As a result, many of the details relating to how th e HMRs Amendments will be operationalised in practice are uncertain. Therefore, where possibl e we have quantified the costs and benefits of the proposed amendments, but largely this has no t been possible due to a lack of evidence and certainty about the situation in the future. In these cases, we have qualitatively discussed the potential impacts of the amendments. The current legislative framework for the licensing , promotion and delivery of vaccines is designed for routine vaccinations which are deliver ed on a regular basis to specific groups of the population. For example, seasonal flu vaccinati on which is offered to specific at-risk groups on an annual basis and childhood immunisation given to all children at different ages. The novel nature of the coronavirus which causes COVID- 19, the lack of immunity within the population (estimated >90% susceptible at present) and the high economic and social costs which have resulted from the pandemic require a mor e rapidly delivered and potentially more wide scale vaccination programme, if an effective v accine or vaccines are found. It is important to note that this is an exceptional policy, which involves the investigation of costs and benefits related to legislative changes to enab le more rapid vaccine deployment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not investigate t he costs and benefits of a vaccine itself. 7 3. Description of options considered Several issues have been identified that would inhi bit the policy aim of enabling the deployment of a safe and effective COVID vaccine at pace and s cale; these include: Temporary authorisations and immunity: Currently there is ambiguity around how any breaches to the conditions set under temporary auth orisations of a vaccine would be handled (and whether or not they can be set by the licencing authority in the first place) and therefore the strength of the supply chain and any enforcement could be compromised by uncertainty about the nature of the obligations that participants in the supply chain are under. Workforce: With the existing workforce, a COVID-19 vaccine pro gramme would be undeliverable at pace on a population wide scale, t herefore severely hampering the Government's response to coronavirus. In particular , healthcare workers (who are prioritised for the COVID-19 vaccine in interim JCV I guidance), are usually immunised via occupational health (OH) schemes; if the workforce that administers vaccines under an OH scheme is not expanded, there will be delays in vaccinating healthcare workers. Promotion: At present there is a prohibition on promoting via an advertisement an unlicensed medicine to healthcare professionals and the public. The UK Government is proposing that this prohibition is disapplied to al low advertising of any temporarily authorised products under regulation 174, including a COVID-19 vaccine. Without the regulation, an unlicensed, but temporarily authoris ed, vaccine could not be promoted as part of normal business advertising arrangements wi thin the four nations; this could have implications for the take-up of the vaccine which i s essential for life to return to normal as much as possible. Wholesale dealing: Currently, if a COVID-19 vaccine was available ther e would be delays in moving around a vaccine between premises at the very end of the supply chain as it is of the case that the providers in qu estion (such as GP practices and community pharmacies) do not have wholesale licence s. As circumstances currently stand, the solution would be to return any excess v accines in one organisation to the wholesale supplier who would then dispatch them to the organization with too few vaccines. This is time consuming and inefficient an d could lead to delays in getting the vaccine to the public. For some vaccines, it is unl ikely that 'return to supplier' would be possible due to very stringent cold chain requireme nts. The Government has consulted on amending the Human Medicines Regulations to resolve these issues and enable rapid deployment of a safe and effective vaccine at pace and scale, with the following amendments: 1. In the interests of patient safety and providing clarity to the supply chain, the HMRs would be amended to clarify our approach to a pre-e xisting provision (regulation 174) that enables the licensing authority to temporarily auth orise the supply of an unlicensed medicinal product for use in response to various pu blic health emergencies, including a pandemic. The Government proposes to clarify that s et conditions can be placed on the temporary authorisation of an unlicensed vaccine. T hat will allow the licensing authority to attach conditions to ensure product safety, qual ity and efficacy. 2. Extend the immunity from civil liability for reg ulation 174 sales or supplies for some specific public health purposes so that it applies not just to manufacturers and registered health care professionals but also to the company p lacing an unlicensed medicine such as a vaccine on the market and the additional vacci nators for COVID-19 and flu who are not registered health care professionals, and to cl arify the consequences on immunity, should there be a breach of the conditions imposed. 8 3. Ensure that the UK has the available workforce t o administer the COVID-19 vaccine and influenza vaccine. 4. Ensure that vaccines and treatments used for spe cific public health purposes, such as a COVID-19 vaccine, can be promoted via advertisement s, if necessary, to support national vaccination or treatment campaigns. 5. Make short-term provisions for wholesale dealing of COVID-19 and flu vaccines, and treatments for pandemic diseases, in the case that the vaccine/treatment needs to be moved under NHS authorised arrangements between pre mises at the end of the supply chain by NHS bodies and providers that do not hold wholesale dealer's licences (the armed services will also be covered by these arrang ements but an assessment of their costs has not been made). The decision to temporarily authorise a COVID-19 va ccine is separate to the proposed amendments to the HMRs. The amendments related to c onditions, immunity and promotion are not proposed to make it more likely that a temporar ily authorised COVID-19 vaccine will be used; instead, they aim to clarify or facilitate th e process if a temporarily authorised vaccine is used. 4. Policy objective The overarching policy objective is to enable the d eployment of a safe and effective COVID vaccine at pace and scale. 5. Overview of proposed HMRs Amendments Five amendments to the HMRs have been proposed, usi ng a Statutory Instrument (SI). Each of these contribute to a central policy aim of enablin g the deployment of a safe and effective COVID vaccine at pace and scale: 1. Temporary authorisations 2. Civil liability and immunity 3. Proposed expansion to the workforce 4. Pandemic treatment promotions 5. Make provision for wholesale dealing of vaccines . In practice these amendments are likely to interact ; however, for simplicity the following sections discuss each amendment separately, considering the proposed amendment's costs, benefits, risks and wider impacts. There is also discussion o f potential interdependencies where possible and appropriate. It is important to note throughout that the propose d amendments to the HMRs do not always mandate a change to policy, practice or programmes; instead they may facilitate future changes to policy or clarify the current position. This mea ns that much of the way in which the policy will be implemented has not yet been confirmed; potentia l scenarios for the use of these amendments have been discussed where possible. 6. Overview of assumptions and scenarios As noted above, in many cases the proposed amendmen ts to the HMRs do not necessarily mandate changes in practice, rather they may facili tate potential future policy changes or clarify the current position; for example, amending the HMR s does not mandate that a wider workforce must be trained to administer vaccines, nor does it detail how this will occur - it simply enables this to occur if needed. 9 There is considerable uncertainty about when a vacc ine will become available and its characteristics, as well as details of deployment. Therefore, we have identified several core assumptions to guide quantitative analysis and qual itative discussion. These are discussed below; it should be noted that these are not eviden ce based and have been chosen to guide our scenario-based analysis in the absence of evidence. As previously noted, this impact assessment does no t appraise the cost and benefits of using a temporarily authorised vaccine, nor procuring a COV ID-19 vaccine itself. Instead it focuses on the proposed amendments to the HMRs, which aim to f acilitate deployment of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, if it becomes available . As such, we have made some overarching unevidenced assumptions to guide analysis in both t he BAU and HMRs Amendment scenarios; it is assumed that: A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine will be iden tified, which may provide immunity from the disease for a year, or reduce severity of symptoms if the disease is contracted; Sufficient supply of a COVID-19 vaccine will be av ailable over time to administer to high- risk populations, as identified by JCVI 3; and Depending on the characteristics of a COVID-19 vac cine, its deployment will reduce the transmission of the virus to low levels or reduce t he consequences of infection in high risk patients in the UK, to allow something close t o pre-pandemic life (in terms of health and social care provision, education and the lack o f social distancing measures) to return. That is to say, we assume that introduction of a vaccine would allow society to live with COVID-19 as we do with seasonal influenza. These are simplistic and unevidenced assumptions. I n reality, it may be that a combination of measures will help to reduce the prevalence of t he virus and help to recover the UK to pre-pandemic conditions of health and productivity. For example, this could be aided by the development of therapeutics which help to treat COV ID-19 more effectively. It is also possible that there may be some level of immunity, although the evidence related to this is uncertain and duration of immunity is unkno wn. Serology studies suggest that approximately 5-6% of the UK population have antibo dies to the virus, and the exact relationship between serological positivity and imm unity is unclear; similarly, some groups, such as health and social care workers may have hig her levels of immunity due to high levels of exposure. 4 Given the uncertainties around the duration of imm unity, we have not factored this into our analysis. However, if there is some level of immunity our benefits may be lower than expected. For simplicity and for the purposes of this impact assessment, we focus on a COVID-19 vaccine as the sole measure to help the UK to recov er from the impacts of COVID-19 on health and social care, wider society and the econo my; however, in reality, it seems likely that a package of measures may be needed to reduce prevalence of the virus over the long- term. Business as Usual Scenario: While a vaccine is not available, it is uncertain w hat measures will be required to control the spread of COVID-19 over 2020/2021. We assume other measures will be utilised to maintain COVID-19 levels at a constant level over 2020/2021, including: 3 Department of Health and Social Care, 2020. JCVI: updated interim advice on priority groups for COVID-19 Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, 2020. SPI-M-O: Consensus statement on COVID-19, 2 Septemb d 29 September 2020]. 10 All current national regulations remain in place, with schools and universities open; retail, restaurants and pubs remain open. 50% of the population in local lockdown at any one time, where social gatherings between households are not permitted (given the add itional challenge of schools, universities and winter). Current infection control measures, such as PPE, a re maintained. Current test and trace capacity. It is important to note that these measures do not represent Government policy and are not a prediction of what measures will be in place over t ime; they are unevidenced assumptions to set our analysis in context. We assume a stable COVID-19 rate per week is mainta ined over 2020/2021: Infections: 22,000 Hospitalisations: 570 Deaths: 140. This is based on the average per week of a low inci dence planning scenario produced by SPI- M. By assuming a low level of incidence, we may be underestimating the benefits of introducing a vaccine. Given the uncertainties related to immunity discuss ed above, we assume natural immunity in 2020/2021 will be insufficient to bring an end to C OVID-19 or to significantly reduce its severity. The virus itself will maintain the same characteris tics in terms of transmissibility, severity and fatality over 2020/2021. If there is a build-up of natural immunity before the vaccine is available, less benefit will be realised. HMRs Amended Scenario: The five amendments to the HMRs all aim to enable t he deployment of a safe and effective COVID vaccine at pace and scale compared to the bus iness as usual scenario: 1. Temporary authorisations: This specific proposal aims to make clear that a t emporary authorisation of this kind can have specific condit ions attached by the licencing authority. These conditions enable the licensing authority to define safeguards that are a prerequisite for the safe supply and use of the pro duct, and without which authorisation would not be valid. This will also provide clarity to the supply chain. 2. Civil liability and immunity: By making it explicit that pharmaceutical companies bringing an unlicensed vaccine to market would have immunity to civil liability, except in cases of serious breaches; this may make suppliers more willing to engage with the process. 3. Expanded workforce: By expanding the workforce who can administer vacc ines, the amendments will ensure that when a vaccine becomes available, it can be deployed more quickly than would have been possible with the existing workforce. 4. Pandemic treatment promotions: Whilst a Government/NHS information campaign that promotes vaccination/treatments is not an \"adv ertisement\" for the purposes of regulation 7 of the Human Medicines Regulations 202 0, supporting materials produced by pharmaceutical companies would be. By promoting a vaccine in support of Government backed national campaigns, this may incr ease uptake of a vaccine if it becomes available; however, it is contingent on suf ficient supply being available. This will also support the provision of guidance to heal thcare professions and the public and ensure more rapid deployment of a vaccine, by makin g the public more aware of it and therefore encouraging take-up and combatting misinf ormation. 11 5. Make provision for wholesale dealing of vaccines: By enabling movement of vaccines between healthcare organisations without t he need for wholesale dealer licences, this may ensure a vaccine can reach the p ublic more quickly; this is contingent on sufficient supply being available. Therefore, the impact of the different amendments o n the deployment of a vaccine will differ. In practice, the amendments will interact to produce t he benefits of making the amendments; however, for simplicity within this document, we co nsider the benefits of each amendment separately and discuss the interactions where appro priate. 7. Amendment 1) Temporary authorisations 7.1. Summary and preferred option At present, European Union (EU) legislation require s biotechnological medicines to be authorised via the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This is applicable during the transition period until the end of 2020. After withdrawal from the EU, the UK's licensing authority will have new powers to approve medicines. However, there are some circumstances where an unli censed medicine can be brought to market and administered; Regulation 174 of The Huma n Medicines Regulations 2012 (HMRs) allows the licensing authority to grant a te mporary authorisation for the supply of an unlicensed medicinal product for use during pandemi cs, only if there is sufficient evidence to show safety, quality and efficacy of the medicine. This provision could be used to authorise nationwide distribution and supply of an unlicensed COVID-19 vaccine, as well as other therapeutics, in the UK. Currently, it is implicit in the HMRs that Regulation 174 allows specific co nditions to be attached to the authorisation of an unlicensed medi cine, although this is not mentioned explicitly in the legislation. The Government inten ds to amend the HMRs to make it explicit that recommendation of the use of any unlicensed pr oduct, including COVID-19 vaccines if and when they become available, authorised for temp orary supply under Regulation 174, and its sale or supply, will be subject to conditions. It is likely that these conditions will be similar to conditional marketing authorisations, with some flexibilities in pandemic situations. Therefore, there may not be any material change to the practices around authorising unlicensed medicines, but there will be clarity and certainty for all in the supply chain about the licensing authority's powers. The ongoing opera tion of authorisation of unlicensed medicines will continue to be held by the licensing authority. This will help achieve the objective of enabling the deployment of a safe and effective COVID vaccine at pace and scale, by clarifying to all in the supply chain the licensing authority's powers in relation to safeguarding vaccines and pandemic treatments. The proposed amendment is not time limited, and the refore is a permanent change to the legislation. The amendments will be made in October 2020. 7.2. Monetised and non-monetised costs and benefits 7.2.1. Costs The proposed amendments to the HMRs only intend to change the ability to attach conditions to the temporary authorisation of the supply of unl icensed medicines from implicit (in the BAU scenario) to explicit (in the HMRs Amendments scenario). Therefore, it is likely that any costs associated with imposing conditions will remain the same; the licensing authority's ability to attach conditions to the temporary authorisation of the sale and supply of unlicensed medicines has not changed. If an unlicensed medicin e was authorised in a BAU scenario, the licencing authority would still be able to attach c onditions to the temporary authorisation; this 12 remains the case in the HMRs scenario. As such, the re are no anticipated additional costs associated with this amendment. 7.2.2. Benefits Changing the HMRs to show that the ability to attac h conditions to the temporary authorisation of unlicensed medicines from implicit to explicit will provide certainty for the licensing authority and those in the supply chain a bout the nature of the licensing authority's powers in the area. It has not been possible to qua ntify this benefit, given its subjective nature and the uncertainty around the number and na ture of any organisations involved in any eventual unlicensed medicine, such as a COVID-1 9 vaccine. Attaching conditions to the supply and sale of unli censed medicines allows the licencing authority to put safeguards in place, such as the p rovision of batch testing, quality assurance and cold storage, which help to ensure patient safe ty. However, these benefits are marginal and not additional under the HMRs Amendments scenar io; the licencing authority is still able to put safeguards/conditions in place under the BAU scenario, the proposed amendments to the legislation just explicitly state this in the H MRs scenario. As such, there are no additional benefits to quantify. 7.3. Risks The ability to grant temporary authorisation for th e supply of unlicensed vaccines already exists and is not considered to change as a result of the proposed amendments to the HMRs; the proposed amendments to the HMRs do not pose an additional risk in this regard, as the ability to grant temporary authorisation has not ch anged as a result of the amendments. Instead this amendment aims to clarify that the licencing authority may place conditions on the supply of such products, if a temporary authori sation is granted. Supply of an unlicensed vaccine will only be authorised in this way if the licensing authority i s satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the safety, qual ity and efficacy of the vaccine. Whilst we do not anticipate direct wider impacts fr om the proposed amendments, there may be some risk of public perceptions of the UK taking short-cuts, particularly in the e vent that the licencing authority grants a temporary authoris ation and a) other international regulators do not follow this approach; b) there is a very lon g delay before other regulators licence; c) if a new safety signal emerges which was not been iden tified by clinical trials. In such a scenario, there may be some risk of damage to confi dence in the wider UK vaccination programme. These risks apply to any temporarily aut horised vaccine, which is already a provision in the regulations and will not change wi th the proposed amendments. 8. Amendment 2) Civil liability & immunity 8.1. Summary and preferred option At present, EU member states must confer immunity f rom civil liability on both manufacturers who supply medicines for use during the roll-out of mass vaccination programmes for unlicensed vaccines and pandemic disease treatments , and registered healthcare professionals who supply or administer the product. However, the pharmaceutical companies who place the unlicensed product on the market are in an uncertain position. The Government proposes to amend the HMRs to clarif y in which situations pharmaceutical organisations would be immune in cases of civil lia bility; going forward, it will apply not just to companies that do their own manufacturing but also to those that outsource their manufacture. The immunity offered is only partial; it won't avail organisations if a problem is 13 discovered with the product that elevates the inher ent risk of the product to a level that was higher than the public was entitled to expect (thus engaging Part 1 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987). It also won't avail them if t here is a breach of the conditions imposed by the licensing authority that is sufficiently seriou s to justify setting aside the licensing authority's recommendation. In such cases, companie s may face legal action and associated costs from patients. The third proposed amendment to the HMRs (discussed further below in section 9) aims to expand the existing workforce who are eligible to a dminister vaccines. As a result, the Government has also proposed to extend immunity fro m civil liability to all of the extended workforce who are able to administer vaccines, incl uding vaccinators who are not registered health professionals (for example, student doctors and nurses). This will help achieve the objective of ensuring ra pid deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine if and when it becomes available because it will give assurance to both pharmaceutical companies and the extended workforce about their im munity and may make them more willing to participate in the process of delivering a COVID-19 vaccine, which will enable its deployment at a faster than expected rate. This amendment is not time limited and therefore is a permanent change to the legislation. The amendments will be made in October 2020; there is a convention that, where possible, a negative SI should be laid in Parliament at least 2 1 days before it comes into effect. Error!

Costs Pharmaceutical companies For pharmaceutical companies bringing a product to market, at present their position in terms of immunity to civil liability is uncertain. The am endment to the HMRs aims to clarify in what situations these organisations would be immune in c ases of civil liability. Going forward, it will apply not just to companies that do their own manuf acturing but also to those that outsource their manufacture. However, in relation to both typ es of company, it will nevertheless be the case that the immunity offered is only partial. It won't avail them if a problem is discovered with the product that elevates the inherent risk of the product to a level that was higher than the public was entitled to expect (thus engaging Pa rt 1 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987). It also won't avail them if there is a breach of th e conditions imposed by the licensing authority that is sufficiently serious to justify s etting aside the licensing authority's recommendation. In such cases, companies may face legal action and associated costs from patients. However, it is likely that this is n ot an additional cost under the HMRs Amendments scenario; it would still be possible for these companies to face such costs under the BAU scenario. Under the HMRs scenario, the only costs such organi sations may face would relate to serious breaches to conditions which result in an u nsafe and defective product. In such cases, companies may face legal action and associat ed costs from patients. However, it is likely that this is not an additional cost under th e HMRs Amendments scenario; it would still be possible for these companies to face such costs under the BAU scenario. Government There may be circumstances where a patient experien ces harm as a result of an unlicensed vaccine or pandemic disease treatment and wants to bring a case of civil damages; all 14 organisations within the supply chain who are respo nsible for the product being on the market would be partially immune and therefore it i s possible that an alternative remedy might be sought from Government. However, as stated above, it is likely that this is not an additional cost under the HMRs Amendments scenario; it is still possible that Government would have faced this type of challenge in a BAU sc enario as the position of pharmaceutical companies was uncertain. It is also uncertain wheth er or not the courts would entertain such an action against the Government. Any costs associa ted with it are therefore entirely speculative. Healthcare staff For healthcare staff who are newly able to administ er vaccines under the third proposed HMRs Amendments (see section 9), there will be no c hanges in costs incurred; under the BAU scenario, these staff would not have been permi tted to administer vaccines anyway. 8.2.2. Benefits Pharmaceutical companies By explicitly extending immunity from civil liabili ty to pharmaceutical companies who may bring an unlicensed product to market, this will gi ve such organisations assurance that they will not be exposed inappropriately to civil liabil ity; this may make them more willing to participate in mass vaccination programmes under co nsideration for COVID-19 or mass distribution of treatments in other situations. Thi s might improve the availability of vaccines in the UK, which will in turn have benefits for mortal ity and morbidity impacts of the disease as well as wider health, social and economic impacts. Given the uncertainty of this benefit and the uncertainty around the availability of a vaccin e, it has not been possible the quantify this. There is also a potential for reduced costs for suc h pharmaceutical companies, who may in fact face reduced costs since the regulations now c larify their immunity to civil liability. However, there is considerable uncertainty related to this, mostly due to the uncertain position such companies are in under the BAU scenar io; therefore, it has not been possible to monetise this benefit. Healthcare staff In addition, this amendment gives the new extended workforce, eligible to administer vaccines, assurance that they will have immunity fr om civil liability; this therefore removes a disincentive of participating and may encourage hea lthcare staff to participate, therefore contributing to the policy aim of enabling rapid de ployment of a COVID-19 vaccine, if and when it becomes available. It has not been possible to monetise this benefit, as it is difficult to know to what extent this assurance would instrument ally impact the pace of deployment of the vaccine programme. 8.3. Risks Whilst the amendment clarifies the current position in relation to immunity, there is a risk that wider stakeholders and the public may consider that this change allows pharmaceutical companies to be less careful about their processes in relation to producing a COVID-19 vaccine. There is therefore a reputational risk to government that this legislative change is interpreted as removing accountability for pharmace utical companies even though the amendments only are a clarification of the underpin ning position derived from EU law. This risk can be managed through adhering to best practi ce around communication and transparency. It is important to note that organisa tions will not be immune in cases of serious breaches. 15 9. Amendment 3) Proposed expansion to the workforce eligible to administer vaccinations 9.1. Summary and preferred option At present, under the BAU scenario, only specific ' appropriate practitioners' are eligible to administer 'prescription only medicines' (including vaccines), defined in the HMRs 5 as: A doctor A dentist A supplementary prescriber A nurse independent prescriber A pharmacist independent prescriber. In specific circumstances, some other healthcare pr ofessionals can administer certain medicines: A community practitioner nurse can administer pres cription only medicines specified in Schedule 13 An optometrist independent prescriber can administ er any prescription only medicine other than a medicinal product that is a controlled drug or for parenteral administration An EEA health professional can administer prescrip tion only medicines other than a controlled drug. Given capacity constraints of the current workforce , an expanded workforce is needed to ensure safe deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine as soo n as it is available. An expanded workforce would also help to fulfil the recent anno uncement of an expanded flu vaccination programme in winter 2020, with more people able to receive the flu vaccine than last year. 6 The Government proposes to amend the HMRs to allow a wider group of healthcare workers to be considered 'appropriate practitioners', eligi ble to administer a COVID-19 vaccine, if and when it becomes available. Three changes are propos ed: a) Patient Group Directions Patient Group Directions (PGDs) provide a legal fra mework to allow certain registered health professionals to supply and/or administer specified medicines to a pre-defined group of patients, without having to see a prescriber such a s a doctor or nurse prescriber. 7 PGDs are reserved for circumstances where this mechanism wou ld offer a benefit for patient care whilst not compromising patient safety. 8 Types of PGDs include routine immunisation program mes, travel vaccinations and emergency preparedness, res ilience and response. 8 Healthcare professionals who are able to administer a vaccine under a PGD (signed by an appropriate practitioner - see above) include: chir opodists, podiatrists, dental hygienists occupatio nal therapists, optometrists, orthotists and 5 Human Medicines Regulation, 2012.

Patient group directions: who can use them [Accessed physiotherap ists, radiographers, and speech and language therapists. 8 At present PGDs cannot be used to administer unlice nsed medicines.8 The Government proposes to expand the scope of PGDs to allow for t he administration of any medicine, the supply of which has been temporarily authorised; th is might include COVID-19 or flu vaccines. This proposal will enable an expanded wor kforce to administer an unlicensed vaccine, which will help to achieve the intended po licy aim. This amendment is not time limited and is intended to be permanent. The amendm ents will come into force in early November 2020. b) New national protocol The Government proposes developing a new national p rotocol to allow registered healthcare professionals who do not normally administer vaccin es and people who are not registered healthcare professionals (working under supervision ) to safely administer a licensed or temporarily authorised COVID-19 or influenza vaccin e. Developing a new national protocol will enable a br oader group of individuals (under supervision where appropriate) to administer vaccin es, thereby aiding the policy objective of rapidly deploying a COVID-19 or influenza vaccines. This will be reviewed after a year and a report will be published of the review. The amendme nts will come into force in early November 2020. c) Occupational health scheme expansion Vaccinations for health and care workers are admini stered through occupational health schemes, but only nurses are authorised to administ er prescription-only medicines under written instruction of a doctor. The Government proposes expanding the workforce leg ally permitted to administer vaccines under occupational health schemes, so that addition al healthcare professionals in the occupational health workforce can administer vaccin es. The HMRs would be amended to allow midwives, nursing associates, operating depar tment practitioners, paramedics, physiotherapists and pharmacists to administer vacc ines under an NHS or local authority occupational health scheme. This amendment aims to ensure there is sufficient w orkforce to deliver a mass COVID-19 vaccination programme and an upscaled influenza pro gramme in autumn 2020. The amendments will come into force the day after the l aying of the regulations in October 2020. The amendment is limited to specific occupational h ealth schemes and healthcare professionals and will be time limited until 1 st April 2020 (the end of next year's annual flu immunisation programme), to allow fuller considerat ion of making a long-term change in this area. Training Any additional workforce operating under the nation al protocol to administer vaccines will be trained and shown to be competent via an NHS and PH E approved national training programme to ensure patient safety. 9.2. Monetised and non-monetised costs and benefits 9.2.1. Assumptions and methodology Estimates of eligible population 17 At present, JCVI have published an interim ranking of priority groups for a COVID-19 vaccine. 9 It is important to note that this could change sub stantially if the first available vaccines are not considered suitable for, or effect ive in, older adults. For the purposes of this impact assessment, where we do not yet know the cha racteristics of a potential vaccine, we assume that a first vaccine may be suitable and ava ilable for anyone aged 50 or over, people at high or moderate risk of COVID-19 and health and social care workers, in line with initial JCVI guidance (therefore we exclude 'rest of the po pulation'). However, it is possible that an eventual vaccine may not be suitable for all these groups; there is considerable uncertainty about this. To estimate the number of people included in these groups, we add the following figures: The number of people aged 50 or over in the UK: 25 m 10 The number of healthcare workers aged below 50: 1m11 The number of social care workers aged below 50: 1 m12 The number of people who shielded, aged below 50: 0.05m (as a proxy for 'at risk') 13 To note, the data we use for healthcare workers rel ates to those in NHS trusts, CGGs, Support Organisations and Central Bodies; as such, not all of these workers will be providing front line services. This is also true for social c are worker data. Therefore, we may be overestimating the number of people who may be elig ible for the vaccine. Given there may be health and social care workers w ho were shielding, and therefore a risk of double counting, we assume about 4% of these gro ups were shielding. We do not have data on shielding amongst these groups, and therefo re this is based on NHS estimates that 4% of the total population in England were shieldin g - it may be that this proportion is higher or lower amongst health and social care workers. Therefore, in total this gives an approximate popul ation of 28m who may be eligible to receive a vaccine. In reality, it is possible that this figure may be higher or lower than we estimate, depending on the suitability of a vaccine for different groups in the population. Estimating the counterfactual In order to understand the benefit from training a newly expanded workforce, it is important to understand how much faster a vaccine could be deplo yed if the workforce was expanded. Therefore, we need to estimate the counterfactual, in terms of how long it would take the existing workforce of appropriate practitioners to administer both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines. The HMRs apply to the UK as a whole and will enable the expansion of the workforce in any of the Devolved Administrations (DA) if needed, alt hough the actual approach to workforce expansion will differ for each DA. For the purposes of this impact assessment, we consider the impact on the UK as a whole. However, we have t he most data available for England, 9 Department of Health and Social Care, 2020. Priority groups for coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinat ion: advice from the [Accessed 1 October 2020]. 10 ONS, 2020.

Available from: https://digital.nhs.uk/dashboards/shielded-patient- list-open-data-set [Accessed 1 October 2020]. 18 which we have used to produce the following methodo logy, and have then upscaled the data to UK level. The following estimates are not predictive of how q uickly it would take to deploy a vaccine; they are simply calculated to provide us with scena rios upon which we can consider any potential benefits from amending the HMRs. In 2019, we know that approximately 15 million flu vaccines were administered in England, although 25 million were invited to have it. 14 We assume this is based on 1 dose per person. In 2020, the Government intends to expand this to m ore than 30 million flu vaccinations for England. Error! Bookmark not defined. ,15 According to NHSEI guidance about the national flu immunisation programme for 2020/21, providers in En gland should aim to schedule their flu immunisation services to match vaccine supply, usua lly from September, and complete vaccination by the end of November, where possible.16 There are reported to be similar plans for upscalin g in the Devolved Administrations (DAs) 17 ,18 ,19 ; we assume a similar increase in flu vaccinations could be possible across the DAs, and that the current rate of flu vaccinations in England represent 84% of the UK (based on ONS population estimates). Most current vaccinators would provide immunisation as part of a broader role, so do not spend 100% of their working time vaccinating. There fore, any additional ask from extra flu vaccination or COVID-19 vaccination could mean de-p rioritising other areas of healthcare services. For the purposes of estimating a counterf actual scenario, we assume that the current workforce could administer approximately 30 million doses of vaccine between September and November, on average about 2.1 millio n vaccine doses per week. This is based on the assumption that there has previously b een capacity to administer 25 million flu vaccines in England, scaled up to UK level (84%). 20 It is also important to note that a proportion of t he flu vaccines administered in 2019/20 would include children eligible for the vaccine, who gene rally received the vaccine in a school setting. Error! Bookmark not defined. We assume that the professionals who administered vaccines to children in previous years are also able to adminis ter a COVID-19 vaccine to adults in the future. It is also important to note that not everyone who is eligible for a vaccine will take it up. In the current climate it is very difficult to be certain about the public's appetite for vaccination. For the purposes of this analysis, we assume 75% uptake amongst those eligible. Evidence from the 2018/19 flu vaccine suggests that uptake was be tween 44% to 74%%, with the highest uptake in older people and health care workers, cor responding with some of those likely to be 14 BBC, 2020.

Available from: https://www.bbc.co.uk/new s/health-53515078 [Accessed 15 September 2020]. 19 eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine .21 A recent survey by Ipsos MORI suggested that 85% agreed that if a vaccine for COVID-19 were availabl e, they would get it; reasons for not accessing the vaccine included concern about side e ffectives, doubts about efficacy, not perceiving they are at enough risk from COVID-19 an d being generally against vaccines. 22 Whilst there have been concerns raised by the anti- vaccination community, the public may be more in favour of vaccination given their experienc es living in lockdown as a result of COVID- 19; indeed, we are seeing high demand for flu vacci nes already. 23 If this vaccination rate was maintained over time, and if take-up is 75%, we estimate it would take approximately 36 weeks to administer COVID-19 vaccines to the at-risk population (as defined above) and an expanded flu vaccination prog ramme in the UK. It is important to note that maintaining this level of vaccination beyond t he usual flu vaccination programme would have impacts on other areas of heath care provision , as vaccinators would be spending time vaccinating instead of their other work responsibil ities. Similarly, this only presents a scenario based on a range of assumptions; in reality, take u p and the eligible population may be very different, depending on the characteristics of a CO VID-19 vaccine. Therefore, these estimates should only be considered illustrative, n ot predictive. HMRs Amendment Scenario Under the HMRs Amendment scenario, we assume deploy ment would be faster since there would be more vaccinators eligible to administer va ccines. As a result, less of the burden would fall on existing vaccinators and therefore th ere would be less of an impact on potential de-prioritisation of other healthcare services, in order to make time for vaccine administration. For the purposes of this impact assessment, we assu me that there would be sufficient vaccinators to administer COVID-19 vaccines; in thi s optimistic scenario, we assume it would take approximately 21 weeks to administer both flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines at a quicker rate than the BAU, so their capacity is mat ched to the demand for them to a high-risk population. This is in line with government prepare dness planning. However, it is important to note that this is optimistic, and it could take lon ger due to various factors including time for training, availability of supply or take-up. Theref ore, we also consider a central scenario, where it takes 1.25 times as long (26 weeks), and p essimistic scenario, where it takes 1.5 times as long (32 weeks). It is important to stress that these scenarios are purely illustrative; they are not predictive and may differ depending on the characteristics of an eventual COVID-19 vaccine. Table 1.

Costs The Vaccines Taskforce, DHSC, PHE and NHS England a nd NHS Improvement are coordinating the planning for settings individuals can be safely vaccinated within, as well as 21 Public Health England, 2020.

Throughout, they are also working closely with the devolved adm inistrations to ensure successful delivery across the whole of the UK. Dependent on the amount of vaccine which becomes av ailable, it is likely that we will need to mobilise additional delivery arrangements and the w orkforce required to manage the volume of vaccinations. This will need to be done alongsid e maintaining and recovering the routine programmes, which could lead to an ambitious mass v accination programme. Public Health England and NHS England and NHS Impro vement are key partners in ensuring that the vaccine(s) is/are delivered safely and eff iciently to the public. Planning considerations include the size and make-up of the workforce needed to deliver a potentially extensive vaccination programme at pace, training r equirements, guidance, consumables and other equipment, as well as the supporting infr astructure required, including warehousing, transport, logistics, security, cold c hain, and end-destination 'clinic' storage. The following sections outlines potential costs ass ociated with making this amendment, as far as possible: Recruitment costs There are likely to be recruitment costs associated with expanding the workforce. Early estimates from NHSE-I suggest that approximately 50 ,000 extra vaccinators may need to be recruited to be trained to administer vaccinate; ho wever, it is unlikely that these will be full time vaccinators, instead undertaking vaccination a s part of their wider existing role. It should also be noted that there is uncertainty about this figure, as the capacity of the current workforce is not clear. However, it is possible that NHSE-I may incur some costs related to recruiting an expanded workforce, for example through advertisement and re source for recruitment tasks. Given the current uncertainties about the scale of this recru itment and the roll-out of the vaccine, it has not been possible to include quantified cost for th is. Training costs The proposed amendments to the HMRs would allow for an expansion of the workforce who are eligible to administer vaccines. There are like ly to be training costs associated with this, including both the existing vaccinator workforce an d the new vaccinator workforce, as we assume existing vaccinators would need to be traine d to administer a new COVID-19 vaccine (although their costs are likely to be lower given existing experience). According to NHSEI modelling involving a range of potential delivery m odels to deploy the COVID-19 vaccine, the cost of training individuals in England would be \u00a34 1m and the cost of delivering training would be \u00a39m. Scaled up to capture the UK as a whol e (assuming England is approximately 84% of the population), training individuals would cost approximately \u00a348m and delivering training would cost approximately \u00a311m, totalling a round \u00a359m. It is important to consider how this would compare to a business as usual scenario. Costs of training individuals would be smaller in a BAU scen ario, as fewer vaccinators would exist and therefore need to be trained on the COVID-19 vaccin e. We do not know the current capacity of vaccinators, so it is challenging to estimate th e additional cost of training; as previously stated, early estimates suggest 50,000 more people may need to be trained but these are not full-time vaccinators, nor are they all expected to administer vaccines as some may be involved in logistics. Similarly, we do not know th e individual competency of existing vaccinators; it is possible that they may not need to undertake the same training as new vaccinators because they already have some relevant experience or have undertaken some relevant training before. 21 We estimate that around 2.5 times as many vaccines will need to be administered compared to the assumed current capacity. Given the uncertai nties around this, for illustrative purposes we assume 2.5 times as many vaccinators are needed as in the BAU scenario; the cost of training individuals in UK may be around \u00a319m and c osts of delivering training costs of approximately \u00a34m. However, this is based on a very simplistic, unevidenced assumption and therefore should be treated with caution. Under this illustrative scenario, there may be an additional cost under the HMRs Amendments scenario of approximately \u00a335m. It is important to note that these costings are bas ed on the potential to administer a COVID- 19 to the adult population. Throughout this impact assumption, we have based our analysis on the assumption that only at-risk populations may be offered the vaccine - at least initially. Therefore, this may overestimate the necessary cost of expanding the workforce to administer to this smaller group; however, it may b e pertinent to train an expanded workforce able to administer vaccines to a much larger group in case of various uncertainties, such as developments in the availability of a COVID-19 vacc ine, suitability for different groups, take- up and public demand. Administration costs Administering a COVID-19 vaccine will incur costs i n terms of the cost for the individual vaccinating. It is difficult to estimate what the c osts of administering the COVID-19 vaccine would be in a BAU scenario, where the workforce was not expanded, and existing vaccinators were responsible for administering the vaccines. The same number of vaccines would be administered under both scenarios, which m ay suggest similar costs under both scenarios. However, there may be fewer costs in the HMRs Amendment scenario if the expanded workforce is a more efficient skill mix th an existing delivery models. Equally, there may be additional costs in the HMRs Amendments scen ario, since the NHSEI model assumes a complex multi-arm mode of delivery which may bring additional costs. Whilst there may be efficiencies under a BAU scenario wher eby experienced practitioners are administering vaccines, these efficiencies may not actually be realised due to the extra time needed for infection control and social distancing measures. As a result of these uncertainties, we assume simil ar costs in both the BAU and HMRs Amendment Scenario and we have not included a quant ified cost of this. However, it is important to note that the opportunity costs may va ry between scenarios, since eligible vaccinators would be spending more of their time on vaccination instead of their other business as usual work. If a larger workforce is ab le to administer vaccines, this opportunity cost would be spread across a large group of people and felt less significantly by existing vaccinators only. Incentive costs Typically, using a primary care route to administer vaccines involves commissioning a service from GPs and paying per person vaccinated. Given th e expansion of the workforce, primary care could be used to support COVID-19 vaccines if there is capacity, but the fee structure may be different to that used for other vaccines an d will relate to the delivery models used; as a result and given uncertainty about existing vacci nator capacity, it has not been possible to quantify this cost. Additional flu vaccine costs We have focused primarily on costs related to the C OVID-19 vaccine, in terms of recruitment, training and administration. This amendment would a lso enable an expanded workforce to administer part of the expanded flu vaccination pro gramme, if needed. The current capacity of the existing workforce is not clear so there is uncertainty about the extent to which the 22 existing workforce, or the expanded workforce would administer the additional flu vaccines. In terms of costs, under the BAU and HMRs Amendment sc enarios, we might expect similar administration costs as the same number of vaccines would be administered. There may be additional training costs for administering a flu v accine. The existing workforce will be trained to deliver flu already so there would no extra cost s. There may be additional costs for the expanded workforce flu vaccines, but the training i s likely to be less significant for flu and it is possible that some of this training may feature in the COVID-19 vaccine training anyway. Given the uncertainty about the current capacity of the workforce, it has not been possible to quantify costs associated with training the expande d workforce for the flu vaccine. Additional deployment costs There will be other deployment costs associated wit h administering any vaccine which are not limited to workforce and other activities depen dent on the specific deployment approach undertaken. These costs are highly dependent on the specific requirements of the vaccine being administered at that point in time. As such, given the high level of inherent uncertainty, it is difficult to quantify the actual costs, which is further compounded by the possibility that these deployment costs may be offset by not underta king other currently funded work and also losing the associated benefits of these activi ties. Any deployment costs for vaccinations are subject to separate value for money assessments conducted at the time a decision is made to administer the vaccine. 9.2.3. Benefits Enabling a more rapid deployment of a COVID-19 vacc ine, if and when it becomes available has a range of benefits, including direct benefits of reduced mortality and morbidity from COVID-19. Mortality impacts Faster deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine would likel y have a benefit in terms of reducing mortality directly caused by COVID-19. A Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) representation of a fatality is based on the years of life lost, and the quality of life that person was expec ted to have lived. A measure of quality of life lost has been developed called EQ-5D-5L 24 , which helps to translate health conditions into a quality of life weighting on an individual. It comp rises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/ discomfort and anxiety/ depressio n. Certain comorbidities are especially common in vict ims of COVID-19, including heart disease, respiratory illnesses including asthma, an d diabetes 25 . These diseases are chronic and have a significant effect on quality of life (Q oL). To estimate the counterfactual QoL of a COVID-19 fatality, we use the EQ-5D-5L approach, ba sed on what we know to be the prevalence of health conditions for COVID-19 fatali ties. We use data from the Health Survey for England (HSE ) 2017 26 ; as well as collecting data on existing health conditions, the HSE also asked adul ts (age 16+) to complete questions on the 24 5Q-5D-5L - About [Online].

Therefore, this data can provide an estimate for the counterfactual average \"QoL\" for a COVID-19 fatality. We have assumed an individual is at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 if they had one or more of these conditions: Cardiovascular diseases including diabetes & high blood pressure Long-term respiratory conditions Long-term endocrine & metabolic conditions. The QoL for individuals with 1 or more of these com orbidities is used for the 'high risk' group. Individuals without one of these conditions have be en considered 'low risk' individuals. It was not possible to calculate the QoL for individuals w ith 3+ conditions due to the limited number of data points in the HSE data. The HSE data were g rouped by age group, sex and risk status, and the average health-related quality of l ife was calculated for each group, weighted by the survey weighting. For the 2017 HSE cohort we generated a quadratic be st-fit line to the average QoL by age (in single years). We have assumed that under each grou ping, the QoL for individuals under 16 would be the same as a 16-year-old due to the lack of data points and the curve showing a slight dip in QoL for under 16 when extrapolated. QoL estimates have been discounted 29 following the Green book guidelines 30 . The average discounted QALYs are calculated by gender and age ( in single years). For high risk individuals, life expectancy data for individuals w ith 2 conditions is used. It has not been possible to calculate life expectancy of an individ ual with no condition, and therefore average life expectancy has been used. Therefore, these est imates may present an underestimate, as we could expect life expectancy for individuals wit h no conditions to be higher than what is included in the analysis. These results have been a ggregated to 5-year age bands to calculate the average QALYs by age band and gender using ONS population data. Therefore, the average discounted QALYs are split i nto categories of high-risk male, high risk female, low risk male and low risk female by age ba nds. Estimates for the number of individuals in the cate gories for mortality and morbidity estimates used severity parameters, provided in the Reasonabl e Worst-Case Scenario (RWCS) signed off by Cabinet office July 2020. There parameters p rovide proportions of infected individuals who are hospitalised, proportions of hospitalised c ases needing ICU, proportion of infected people who die, proportion of hospitalised cases wh o die, as well as the mean lengths of stay in days for individuals in hospital without critica l care, and the mean length of days of patients in hospital with critical care. These are broken do wn by 5-year ages bands. Though the modelling of the July 2020 RWCS includes a reductio n of in hospital death due to dexamethasone, the severity parameters do not inclu de this impact. Deaths occurring in the community are not included in the deaths' severity parameter, and has been updated to do so using an ONS-suggested adjustment. We assume 22 ,000 new weekly infections of COVID-19 in the UK over all age groups. This is bas ed on the average weekly infections in the low incidence planning scenario produced by SPI -M. The low incidence scenario assumes a low and roughly flat level of incidence b etween July 2020 and June 2021, with no 27 5Q-5D, 5Q-5D-5L - 5L_Crosswalk_Value_Sets.xls [Accessed 16 June 2020]. 29 The value of health affects increases over time, a nd therefore discounting captures the increase in t he future value of health effects. 30 HM Treasury, 2018.

This may cause an underestimate of the benefits of deploying the vaccine sooner, depending on the future trajectory of the d isease. The deaths are further split by gender. Proportions of deaths by gender and age band were calculated using ONS weekly deaths data 31 . In order to calculate the proportion of the population that have a pre-existing condition, ther eby placing them in the high-risk category, data from March and April 2020 32 has been analysed. This allowed us to estimate the average weekly number of deaths per 5 year age band in the high risk male, low risk male, high risk female, low risk female categories which were combined with the average discounted QALYs for each category and age band to find the total discounted QALYs lost. These were combined to find the total weekly discou nted QALYs lost. There is considerable uncertainty about the charact eristics of a vaccine, and there are various possibilities about its efficacy: Immunity: A COVID-19 vaccine offers immunity to the virus for a certain period of time. In this case, those who receive the vaccine w ill not contract the virus and therefore there will be fewer deaths from COVID-19. Severity: A COVID-19 vaccine reduces the severity of the viru s if contracted. In this case, fewer people would die as a result, and fewer people who have severe health impacts require hospital and critical care. For the purposes of this impact assessment, we inve stigate a scenario where the vaccine offers immunity from the virus for a certain period of time (we assume about a year). It is possible that the vaccine may need to become part o f an annual or biennial vaccination programme; we do not yet know the duration of immun ity. If a vaccine offers immunity to COVID-19 for those who receive it and if expanding the workforce allows for a faster roll-o ut of the vaccine to at-risk groups, we estimate there could be between 480 and 1,800 deaths averted, depending on how much more quickly the wor kforce could deploy the vaccine compared to the Business as Usual scenario. This eq uates to between 3,800 and 14,000 QALYs saved, with a monetary value of between \u00a3230m and \u00a3850m. We assume each QALY is valued at \u00a360,000. Table 2.

Given the range of uncertainties, not just how effective a vaccine might be, but other aspects that could reduce the benefits of this policy, such as v accine availability and other delays in roll- out, we have also considered a conservative scenari o where only half of the benefits may be realised, as seen below: Table 3.

It is also possible that the benefits may not be realised because the expanded workforce cannot deploy the vaccine more quickly, f or a range of reasons - for example delays in supply or other demands on their time. I n this case the benefits would be equal to 0, and there would be a net loss as the Government would have already incurred costs from recruitment and training. It is important to note that this analysis is based on a range of illustrative scenarios; there are many uncertainties about deployment of a vaccine an d the current capacity of the existing workforce. Therefore, these estimates should be int erpreted with caution. Morbidity impacts Overall, evidence suggests there are likely to be m orbidity impacts from being hospitalised or being in critical care with COVID-19, and even cont racting the virus itself. 33 Early evidence on mental health impacts from COVID-19 suggests that a significant number of patients suffered from mental health conditions following discharge, which is supported by evidence from previous pandemics. 33 Evidence also demonstrates there are likely to be longer term health implications of becoming severely ill and needing c ritical care. 33 Table 4.

The impact of community-acquired pneumonia on the health-related quality-of-life in elderly. BMC infectious diseases , 17(1), pp. 208. 26 The morbidity impact of COVID-19 patients is split into three categories: a) Patients hospitalised not requiring critical car e, and b) Patients in critical care. The table above outlines the assumptions used to ca lculate the lost QALYs for individuals who have contracted COVID-19 in these two categorie s. To calculate the average QoL impact for someone contracting COVID-19 and being h ospitalised, we have used the cross- walk dataset (dataset providing a QoL for a given h ealth state) 35 which uses the EQ-5D-5L scale, and have assigned a score to each of the 5 d imensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) . For those in critical care, we have used the lost QALYs from the Mangen 36 (2017) study. A) QALYs lost from patients who are hospitalised To calculate the average (QoL) impact for someone i n hospital and not needing critical care we have assumed an individual would have severe iss ues under all 5 dimensions: Lost QALYs in high risk group = (QoL of those in hi gh risk group - QoL when hospitalised) x Duration Lost QALYs in low risk group = (QoL of those in low risk group - QoL when hospitalised) x Duration To calculate the average (QoL) impact for someone o nce they leave hospital, we again have used the Crosswalk dataset37 and have assumed an in dividual would have slight issues under 4 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual acti vities and pain/discomfort) with moderate levels of anxiety/depression. We applied the lost Q ALYs to the number of people hospitalised to calculate the total lost QALYs. We applied the severity estimates to the figures fo r average weekly infections by age group to estimate the number of patients hospitalised, no t needing critical care and surviving. The estimates were again broken down into gender and ri sk group. B) QALYs lost by patients in critical care To calculate the lost QALYs, we have used evidence investigating the lost QALYs of patients with pneumonia in critical care, a loss of 0.13 QAL Ys after a year from being discharged. This study only includes patients over 65, and we e xpect lost QALYs for younger age groups would be higher. Without further evidence, we have applied the lost QALYs of 0.13 to all age groups. It is important to note that this estimate relates to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. This also only accounts for the impact within the first year and there are likely to be long-term impacts for some patients. We estimated the weekly average number of patients in critical care and surviving using the severity estimates. This is then applied to lost QA LYs, to calculate the total QALYs lost. 35 5Q-5D, n.d. 5Q-5D-5L Mangen, M. J., Huijts, S. M., Bonten, M. J. and de Wit, G. A., 2017.

In this case, those who receive the vaccine w ill not contract the virus and therefore there will be fewer deaths from COVID-19. Severity: A COVID-19 vaccine reduces the severity of the viru s if contracted.

It is possible that the vaccine may need to become part o f an annual or biennial vaccination programme; we do not yet know the duration of immun ity. If a vaccine offers immunity to COVID-19 for those who receive it and if expanding the workforce allows for a faster roll-o ut of the vaccine to at-risk groups, we estimate there could be between 90 and 340 QALYs saved, depending on how much more quickly the workf orce could deploy the vaccine compared to the Business as Usual scenario. This eq uates to a monetary value of between \u00a35.4m and \u00a320m. We assume each QALY is valued at \u00a3 60,000. Table 5.

I n this case the benefits would be equal to 28 0, and there would be a net loss as the Government would have already incurred costs from recruitment and training. It is important to note that this analysis is based on a range of illustrative scenarios; there are many uncertainties about deployment of a vaccine an d the current capacity of the existing workforce. Therefore, these estimates should be int erpreted with caution. Recovery of the health and social care system In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many changes to the health and social care system occurred which could have impacts on health. This i ncludes many different areas, including emergency care, adult social care, elective care, a nd primary and community care. Each of these areas are discussed in more detail in Annex A - Recovery of the health and social care system. Previous papers submitted to SAGE have demonstrated the potential costly health impact that could occur. 38 They suggested 570,000 QALYs could be lost as a re sult of direct mortality and morbidity COVID-19 impacts until Marc h 2021. In comparison the analysis estimates 380,000 lost QALYs from changes to the he alth and social care, with an additional 210,000 QALYs potentially lost from mortality and h ealth impacts over the first five years. Overall, this suggests there could be significant h ealth impacts as a result of changes to health and social care. If a vaccine is found to provide immunity or reduce dis ease severity, it may help to reduce COVID-19 to low levels or reduce the consequences o f infection in high risk patients in the UK, allowing something close to pre-pandemic life t o return. This may have indirect benefits for health and social care; however, it has not bee n possible the quantify these impacts given the uncertainties around when a vaccine may become available and the challenges in isolating the impact of more rapid deployment of a vaccine on patient level care. Health impacts of social distancing and lockdown me asures Earlier in 2020, the Government introduced a number of lockdown measures that have since been gradually lifted, although many social distanc ing measures remain in place. In recent weeks we have seen the imposition of 'local lockdow ns', where a spike in cases has led local authorities to impose specific restrictions on the local population. For the purposes of this impact assessment, we have made several assumptions about the presence of lockdown measures in the coming months. It is difficult to be certain about this, due to the unpredictable nature of the virus and th erefore these should be considered illustrative not predictive. We assume the following measures will b e needed to manage COVID-19 in the absence of a vaccine: All current national regulations 50% of the population in local lockdown at any one time (whereby social gatherings between households are not permitted) Current infection control measures, such as person al protective equipment (PPE) Current test and trace capacity Schools and universities remain open. 38 Department of Health and Social Care, Office for N ational Statistics, Government Actuary's Department and Home Office, 2020. Direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on excess deaths and m orbidity: executive summary [Online]. 9 September 2020]. 29 There are likely to be a wide range of impacts as a result of lockdown measures on health, social and economic outcomes. This has been previou sly discussed in a paper prepared by DHSC and the Office for National Statistics for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), based upon a simplistic 2-month lockdown. 39 Given the uncertainties around how lockdown measure s will be used in the future, it has not been possible to quantify these impacts. If a vaccine is found to provide immunity or reduce disease severity, it may help to reduce COVID-19 to low levels or reduce the consequences of infection in high risk patients in the UK, allow ing something close to pre-pandemic life to return. This may have indirect impacts if severe lo ckdown measures are no longer needed these are discussed in Annex B - Health impacts of social distancing and lockdown measures, although this is not an exhaustive list. 9.3. Risks There is a risk in hiring less experienced vaccinat ors, with a higher potential from injury - for example due to incorrect administration. However, t his risk should be mitigated through a robust clinical governance process and training pro gramme which is being developed by the NHS and Public Health England for any additional va ccinators. New vaccinators will also be supervised by an experienced registered healthcare professional. There is a potential risk that people who should not receive the vaccine may be vaccinated; however registered healthcare professionals (albeit less experienced t han usual vaccinators) will undertake this task so this should be mitigate this risk. 9.4. Wider impacts This amendment may have a long-lasting impact on th e view on the medicalisation of vaccination. This could challenge and disrupt the p rimary care delivery model for adult vaccination and methods of procurement of adult vac cines, such as flu, shingles or COVID- 19. Equalities analysis There may be a differential impact of the proposed amendment for different groups (see section 12.5). Some groups are more negatively impa cted by COVID-19 in terms of contracting the virus and it is also possible that some groups may be more likely to be impacted by the wider benefits of the Amendments. T herefore, by deploying a vaccination more quickly to the population, it is likely that s ome groups more than others will benefit, because the negative impacts of the virus will be m itigated. 10. Amendment 4) Pandemic treatment promotions 10.1. Summary and preferred option At present, it is prohibited to promote an unlicens ed medicine to healthcare professionals and the public. The Government proposes that the prohib ition should be disapplied to allow 39 Department of Health and Social Care, Office for N ational Statistics, Government Actuary's Department and Home Office, 2020. Direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on excess deaths and m orbidity: executive summary [Online]. 9 to other restrictions in the HMRs) adverti sing of any temporarily authorised products, including a COVID-19 vaccine. As part of this, the Government also proposes to ea se restrictions in Part 14 of the HMRs, such as the prohibition on advertising prescription -only medicines. Whilst a Government/NHS information campaign that promotes vaccination is n ot an \"advertisement\" for the purposes of regulation 7 of the Human Medicines Regulations 201 2, supporting materials produced by pharmaceutical companies would be. Some of these re strictions - which deal essentially with advertisements to the public, are in any event alre ady disapplied in the case of vaccination campaigns, and that approach is extended to all pro ducts given temporary authorisations under regulation 174. The disapplications would be restricted to advertising as part of a campaign approved by ministers and would permit the supplier to participate in any public or healthcare professional information campaign relati ng to the use of the medicine. These amendments on the easement of advertising res trictions are not limited to unlicensed vaccines only but are intended to apply to all the public health purposes that would justify temporary authorisation of the distribution of an u nlicensed vaccine or other treatment listed in regulation 174. This means that, in relation to medicines advertising, the permitted campaigns could relate to any medicinal product use in response to \"...the suspected or confirmed spread of... pathogenic agents... toxins... che mical agents or...nuclear radiation...\". By amending the HMRs to allow for promotion of unli censed vaccines, this would help to achieve the policy objective by making the public a ware of a newly available COVID-19 vaccine or treatment and potentially encouraging ta ke-up amongst those eligible for it. This amendment is not time limited and therefore is intended to be permanent. The amendments will come into force in early November 2 020. 10.2. Monetised and non-monetised costs and benefit s 10.2.1. Costs The main certain cost associated with this amendmen t is likely to be the cost of a communications campaign to promote a new COVID-19 v accine. Because this amendment does not only relate to a CO VID-19 vaccine but also other medicines, there are likely to be other costs to Go vernment that arise. Amending the legislation in this way does not mandate the occurr ence of communications activities, it only enables future campaigns to take place. Given the u ncertainty about what other treatment may arise in the future for use in response to the suspected spread of pathogenic agents, toxins, chemical agents or nuclear radiation, it is very difficult to quantify the cost to Government. It is worth noting that this may represent addition al cost to Government, which would require extra funding. Alternatively, this may represent an opportunity cost, wherein the cost is consumed by existing Government communications budg ets and other activities cannot take place as a result, thereby losing the associated be nefits of those activities. 10.2.2. Benefits The aims of promoting a COVID-19 vaccine, or indeed any other treatment promotion facilitated by this amendment, would be to raise pu blic awareness and encourage take-up to ensure that the intended benefits are realised. It will allow pharmaceutical companies to take part in support of such campaigns. The efficacy of a communications campaign in ensuring the benefits of a policy are realised are likely to depend on several factors, including: 31 1. Public demand: If a communications campaign is to be effective, i t needs to increase public demand. A greater demand for the vaccine wil l result in the realisation of a greater proportion of the benefits (see below). Dem and is likely to depend on several factors, including the efficacy of the communicatio ns campaign as well as wider contextual factors such as the progress of the pand emic, media coverage and concern amongst the public about the risks of an unlicensed vaccine. 2. Supply: The public's appetite for a vaccine may be very po sitive; however, this high take-up cannot be realised if there is insufficient supply to meet demand. Only if there is spare supply would vaccine promotion have an upt ake effect. 3. Workforce: The efficacy of a communications campaign will also interact with Amendment 3. If there is enough public demand for a vaccine, and sufficient supply, the full benefits of a communications campaign cann ot be realised unless there is sufficient workforce to administer it to the public . Assuming a communications strategy is effective in encouraging public take-up of a vaccine (and can be appropriately supported by the proposed easements on vaccine promotion), supply of a vaccine can meet demand and there is su fficient workforce to administer a vaccine, this would help to realise the aims of the policy by ensuring faster deployment of a vaccine (compared to a BAU scenario where no commun ications are possible). Administering the vaccine to as many people in high-risk groups w ho would like to receive it will help to enable the country to reduce COVID-19 to low levels or reduce the consequences of infection in high risk patients in the UK, potentially allowi ng something close to pre-pandemic life to return. As such, the benefits of this amendment are likely to be similar to those outlined for Amendment 3 (see section 9), including reduced COVI D-19 mortality and morbidity. There may also be wider benefits for society, such as ind irect impacts for resuming health and social care, wider health impacts from the easement of lockdown and social distancing measures and economic benefits (see Annex A - Recov ery of the health and social care system Annex B - Health impacts of social distancin g and lockdown measures Annex C - Wider economic impacts). However, there are many un certainties about the realisation of these benefits as they depend on a number of differ ent factors as noted above. 10.3. Risks As previously mentioned, the efficacy of promotiona l activities is highly dependent on several factors and other aspects of the HMRs Amendments. I f any of these variables do not materialise, there is a risk that a communications campaign is not effective in increasing take- up of a vaccine. The risk of limited workforce woul d be mitigated by Amendment 3, discussed above (see section 9). It is also important to note that there may be publ ic concern about the use of a temporarily authorised vaccine or treatment, in comparison to a licensed product, which could affect take- up. As noted previously, the proposed amendments do not propose to introduce the use of temporarily authorised vaccines or treatments; this is an existing power noted in the HMRs. Therefore, we may assume that similar risks of this nature would be experienced in the BAU scenario as in the HMRs Amendment scenario. 10.4. Wider impacts We do not anticipate any further wider impacts as a result of this amendment. 32 11. Amendment 5) Make provisions for wholesale deal ing of vaccines 11.1. Summary and preferred option At present, the supply of vaccines from one healthc are organisation to another is subject to having a wholesale dealer licence. If there is a su rplus in one organisation and a lack of vaccine in another, currently the first organisatio n would have to return the surplus to the wholesaler before the product could be redistribute d to where there was demand. This could lead to problems and delays with moving vaccines be tween service providers and runs the risk that patients cannot access the vaccine. The Government is proposing to provide an exemption from the need for a wholesale dealer's licence allowing swift and safe transfer o f COVID-19 and flu vaccines and other medicines for treatment of pandemic disease. This w ould help achieve the policy objective by ensuring faster deployment of a vaccine and reducin g wastage in a scenario where supply of a COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be in high global d emand. This amendment is time limited; it will come into f orce in October 2020 and will cease to have effect on 1 st April 2022. 11.2. Monetised and non-monetised costs and benefit s 11.2.1. Costs As is the nature of several of the proposed Amendme nts, they do not necessarily inherently mandate specific policies; instead they enable or c larify specific actions to be taken. Therefore, it is not a foregone conclusion that thi s provision will be used in the event a COVID-19 vaccine is available or in relation to flu vaccine, although such use is likely. The costs associated with this amendment are highly contingent on the eventual deployment mechanism that is used; the details of this (which will be NHS arrangement or armed services arrangements) are not yet finalised. If th e distribution between organisations without a wholesale dealers' licence (facilitated by the Am endment) is needed, it seems possible there would be costs to central government from pot entially coordinating the redistribution of surplus vaccines. However, this may not materialise if existing logistic providers from the current supply chain are used in practice and could be a fairly marginal additional cost of collection or delivery for these organisations in r eality. At present, there is much uncertainty in how the Am endment will be used in practice; therefore, it has not been possible to quantify the se costs. 11.2.2. Benefits Amending this section of the HMRs is likely to ensu re more timely access to vaccines by patients; this would contribute to a faster deploym ent of a COVID-19 vaccine and the benefits associated with this (see section 9), including red uced COVID-19 mortality and morbidity. As previously noted, there may also be indirect imp acts for resuming health and social care, wider health impacts from the cessation of lockdown and social distancing measures, and economic benefits (see section Annex A - Recovery o f the health and social care system Annex B - Health impacts of social distancing and l ockdown measures and Annex C - Wider economic impacts). However, this is highly contingent on the deploymen t strategy used, and may only be realised if there is sufficient supply and workforce to deli ver the vaccine (as discussed in Amendment 4 - see section 10). 33 Enabling a faster redistribution of COVID-19 vaccin es is also likely to ensure less wastage, which is particularly important since there would b e significant global demand for access to vaccines. By enabling vaccines to be redistributed directly b etween healthcare organisations, this would likely result in a number of saved costs to t he supplier, including potential saved costs in relation to transportation (unless they are invo lved in Government strategies discussed above), as well as reduced storage costs of surplus vaccines whilst waiting to redistribute them. 11.3. Risks We do not anticipate any additional risks as a resu lt of the amendment 11.4. Wider impacts We do not anticipate any further wider impacts as a result of this amendment. 12. Impact tests In line with Better Regulation Guidance 40 , we have considered the following issues as part o f this appraisal: 12.1. Trade impacts We do not anticipate that the proposals are likely to impact trade or investment. 12.2. Legislation The proposals are aligned with the Human Rights Act and should not infringe on any right included in the Act. The proposals should not contr avene the Data Protection Act or Freedom of Information Act. 12.3. Competition test The proposed amendments to the HMRs would affect th e vaccine market, and indeed other markets which involve temporarily authorised produc ts, supplied by private organisations. We do not expect the amendments to: Directly or indirectly limit the number or range o f suppliers Limit the ability of suppliers to compete Limit suppliers' incentives to compete vigorously Limit the choices and information available to con sumers. In fact, we expect the amendments related to tempor arily authorisation conditions and immunity will bring the benefits of certainty and a ssurance to potential suppliers and may make them more willing to bring a product to market . 40 Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strat egy, 2020.

Rural issues We do not expect specific direct impacts of amendin g the HMRs on rural areas. However, there may be indirect benefits for rural areas, due to their demographic characteristics since older people are more likely to live in rural areas and are likely to be prioritised for a COVID- 19 vaccine;41 there are higher rates of COVID-19 mortality among st older people 42 , so the expected benefit of lower mortality as a result of more rapid deployment of the vaccine may present a specific benefit for rural communities. 12.5. Equality - Public Sector Equality Duty As previously noted, the benefit to the public from amending the HMRs is likely to relate to reduced direct COVID-19 mortality and morbidity, as well as indirect impacts from improvements to health and social care, as well as other impacts from social distancing and the economy. Here we discuss how these factors may differentially impact different groups of society, based on the protected characteristics des cribed in the Equality Act 2010. COVID-19 mortality Over the course of the pandemic to date, certain gr oups have been more affected by COVID- 19 than others. We have seen greater rates of morta lity amongst: Men 42 Older people 42 People limited a lot by a health problem or disabi lity 43 People from Black and Asian ethnic groups 42 People from Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and Sikh groups 44 . It is currently not clear whether there have been d ifferential impacts by sexual orientation or transgender status; some stakeholders suggest these groups may be at higher risk, but a lack of routine monitoring data limits our understa nding. 45 Early evidence suggests no higher risk of mortality among pregnant women. 46 It is not clear whether there are higher mortality rates by different marital statuses. By facilitating deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine, t here is likely to be reduced COVID-19 related mortality and therefore the groups noted ab ove are likely to particularly benefit.

Hidden figures: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LGBT communities in the COVID-19 during pregnancy from: 35 As previously discussed (see section 9.2.3), there are likely to be morbidity impacts for people who contract and survive COVID-19. Evidence to date suggests: Experiencing COVID-19 symptoms appears to be more likely amongst younger people 47 , and a younger age group tend to be in critical ca re than in lower levels of hospital care 42 ; this likely does not suggest greater symptom seve rity but reflects critical care admission criteria. COVID-19 symptoms are more likely in women, but it is possible that men experience more severe symptoms. 47 Evidence from the United States suggests pregnant women with COVID-19 may be more likely to be hospitalized and receive mechanic al ventilation than non-pregnant women.46 Evidence indicates a potentially greater impact fo r people from ethnic minority groups; a greater proportion of critically ill patients fro m Asian, Black and Other ethnic groups were critically ill with COVID-19 than the local po pulation and tended to spend more time in critical care than White patients. 48 Stakeholders suggest that people who identify as le sbian, gay or bisexual may be at greater risk due to risk factors, but this cannot be confir med due to a lack of available data. 45 The Centers for Disease Control in the United States ha ve suggested that most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk but may be at higher risk due to presence of underlying medical conditions. 49 Currently there is a lack of available evidence fo r the impact by gender reassignment, marriage/civil partnership, and religion or belief. By facilitating deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine, t here is likely to be reduced COVID-19 related morbidity and therefore the groups noted ab ove are likely to particularly benefit. 12.6. Family test We do not anticipate any direct impacts on families as a result of amending the HMRs. However, there may be indirect benefits for familie s associated with shorter periods of time under severe lockdown if a vaccine is deployed more rapidly and if it allows something close to pre-pandemic life to return. For example: If administering a COVID-19 vaccine reduces incide nce to a low level, this may facilitate the easement of lockdown measures and me an that couple and family formation may be easier. It seems likely that families going through key tr ansitions may be aided by easement of lockdown measures, if a vaccine helps to reduce incidence. For example: o Currently couples are limited in the ways they can marry; social distancing measures limiting gatherings may not be required to quite the same extent. o For couples becoming parents, there are likely to be benefits from potential easements to social distancing and infection contro l measures in place before and at the birth (such as limiting partner attendan ce at appointments). o There are likely to be benefits for new parents fr om being able to spend time with family and friends, play a full role in family life or provide care, whilst no 47 Understanding Society, 2020.

Sustainable development impact test Environmental standards In line with the wider environmental impacts test, we do not expect the proposed amendments to the HMRs to impact the environment ap art from a potential change to air pollution (as discussed in Annex B - Health impacts of social distancing and lockdown measures ). However, there is considerable uncertai nty around this and the extent of the impact. Intergenerational impacts We do not expect significant impacts which may disp roportionately fall on future generations. By enabling a more rapid deployment of a COVID-19 v accine, we are aiming to mitigate more long-term effects which could impact future generat ions. 12.8. Health and safety The risks associated with the proposed amendments t o the HMRs are discussed for each amendment in turn earlier in this document. In part icular, it is thought that by introducing Amendments 1, this would be mitigating risks to the public by making it explicit that conditions can be attached to temporarily authorise d products. 12.9. Regional perspectives Medicines regulation is a devolved matter in relati on to Northern Ireland and a reserved matter (to the UK Parliament) in relation to Scotla nd and Wales. This why changes to the UK- wide HMRs are made by the UK and Northern Ireland m inisters, acting jointly. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Ag ency (MHRA), an Executive Agency of the Department of Health and Social Care, is the bo dy that performs the functions of the UK's 'licensing authority' under the HMRs across the who le of the UK, acting on the authority of the Minister of Health in Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. We engaged a number of stakeholders from organisati ons in the devolved nations as part of our stakeholder briefings on the consultation. 13. Monitoring and Evaluation As part of the amendments, the Government is commit ting to review Regulation 174A of the Human Medicines Regulation within a year of first u se. 37 Annex A - Recovery of the health and social care sy stem The pandemic has led to various changes to the heal th and social care system. Reducing COVID-19 to low levels or reducing the consequences of infection in high risk patients in the UK may allow something close to pre-pandemic life to r eturn. The potential implications and benefits for the health and social care are discuss ed below; however, it is important to note that there is considerable uncertainty about when and ho w these might be realised given the uncertainties about when a vaccine might be realise d, who might be eligible to receive and its characteristics. Emergency care During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to data in England there was a sudden drop in Accident & Emergency (A&E) attendances as s een in Figure 1; this fell from 1,530,000 attendances in March to 920,000 in April 2020, a de crease of 1,200,000 from the previous year. 50 According to the latest data, A&E attendances are still not at expected levels; in August 2020, there were 1,720,000 attendances compared to on average of 1,970,000 over the previous five years. 50 50 NHS England, 2020. A&E Attendances and 38 Figure 1. A&E Attendances in England There is a fairly similar picture in emergency admi ssions (see Figure 2), which have been falling since the start of the year; there were 430,000 adm issions in March 2020, falling to 330,000 in April 2020 which was 210,000 fewer than 2019. 50 Emergency admissions are still not comparable to previous years according to the lates t data; in August 2020, there were 470,000 admissions compared to an average of 490,000 over t he past five years. 50 Figure 2. Emergency Admissions in England As noted for both attendances and admissions, level s are increasing month-on-month although they are still not at expected levels for the time of year. It is important to note that there is a da ta publishing lag, which means it is likely that curre nt A&E attendances and emergency admissions may have increased in England 39 Decreased use of emergency care services has been o bserved in several other countries during the pandemic 515253 and may occur for several reasons: There may have been naturally less occurrence of d isease because of the reduced contact between people as a result of social distan cing measures and less trauma due to lower vehicle use. At the same time, there may also be increases in some causes, such as the concern about increases in domestic violence during lockdown. Illnesses were managed differently; patients may h ave been treated in other ways such as accessing primary and community care services. There were concerns that symptoms for some illness es, such as breathlessness and chest pain for heart attacks, were being confused f or COVID-19 symptoms which may have led people to self-isolate at home instead of seeking emergency care. 54 People remained at home with illnesses that needed to be treated in hospitals due to concerns about catching the virus, putting pressure on the NHS and about leaving the house. 55 In particular, there were concerns that fewer peop le were attending hospital for stroke and myocardial infarction 54,56 . During the peak of the pandemic, senior governmen t figures reiterated that people should attend hospit als in an emergency and the NHS launched a campaign encouraging unwell people to se ek urgent care. 57 Considering the latest data, it seems that emergenc y attendance and admission is on an upward trajectory and may return to expected levels in the coming months particularly as we reach winter. However, if some people are still con cerned about attending hospital in an emergency due to concerns about contracting COVID-1 9 or not wanting to overwhelm hospitals, it is possible there may be ongoing mortality and m orbidity impacts. If - as we assume - infection rates remain at relat ively low levels, this impact may be relatively minimal; people will see infection rates are fairly low and that the NHS is not overwhelmed with COVID-19 related care and may therefore be more lik ely to seek help in an emergency. As such, the more rapid introduction of a COVID-19 vac cine may have relatively limited impact on mortality and morbidity impacts from reduced levels of emergency care. In the event of an increase of cases and hospitalis ations, it is possible that we may see a return to the patterns in emergency care observed during t he peak of the pandemic. In this case, a more rapid deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine could b e beneficial in either reducing COVID-19 to low levels or reducing the severity of the disea se; concerns about contracting the virus and overwhelming the NHS would decrease and patients wo uld be more likely to seek emergency care. However, there is considerable uncertainty ab out the explanations for the observed decrease in emergency attendances and admissions; t herefore, it is difficult to be certain that we would see the same patterns arising in the futur e. 51 Hartnett, K.

During the pandemic, many changes occurred to adult social care services to prepare for the pandemic. This ranged from closing day centres to i ntroducing strict infection control measures in care homes and limiting visitors 59 . Reduced staff availability, PPE and social distan cing measures are likely to have impacted the type and q uality of care received. 59 It is also important to note that care home settings experienced a large number of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess deaths during the pandemic. 60 ,61 Admissions to care homes and the use of home care fell during the peak; some suggest that people refr ained from asking for support for similar reasons as emergency care - reluctance to use servi ces and concern about adding to pressure on the system; this may have increased responsibili ties of unpaid carers. 59 For some people who receive adult social care, the impacts of the pandemic and social distancing have been very challenging. For example, many people with autism find that part of their diagnosis involves restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviours, activities, interests or routines. 62 People with autism have described the impacts of d isruption to routine as a result of the lockdown measures. 63 Suddenly removing the structure they previously re lied on has led them to feeling overwhelmed, confused, unmotivated, anxious and distressed. 6465 Others have mentioned forgetting to take their medication, expe riencing disrupted sleep as a result of changes to their routine, 64 as well as disruption to medical appointments and service users not liking the change to teleconferences. 64 As a result of these disruptions, some people with autism have mentioned experiencing meltdowns, described by the National Autistic Society as \"an intense response to overwhelming situations\", poten tially including shouting, screaming and physically lashing out. 65 There is also the potential for shut downs, which are muted responses to stress, being unable to move, silent or needing to withdraw somewhere quiet. 65 Whilst some lockdown measures have been eased (such as resuming socially distanced visits to care homes) 66 and some services have resumed (for example, dayce ntres 67 ), it is likely that 58 The King's Fund, 2019.

Under the HMRs Amendment scenario, we assume a vacc ine could be more rapidly deployed and may reduce levels of COVID-19 or the consequenc es of infection in high risk patients in the UK, which may allow something close to pre-pandemic life to return. It is possible that this could help to allow the resumption of health and social c are provision to pre-pandemic productivity and quality levels. Therefore, there could be benef its for those receiving adult social care, in terms of the changes that could be made to deliver care without social distancing and infection control measures. However, there is considerable uncertainty around t his, and it is difficult to be certain about the extent to which this will translate into measurable health benefits. It has not been possible to quantify this benefit. Elective care To prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic, the NHS tried to reduce risks to patients and increase its ability to respond to the crisis by continuing to treat urgent elective patients, such as most cancer treatments, and de-prioritising non-urgent c are. 68 In advance of the pandemic, NHS services cancelled or postponed various elective care treatments. Unfortunately, NHS England data on canc elled elective operations is not yet available, however various published data suggest c onsiderable disruption to patient care over the course of the peak of the pandemic. As Figure 3 shows, the number of admitted referral to treatment pathways (patients whose treatment started during the month and involved adm ission to hospital) dropped from 286,000 in February to 41,000 in April. 69 This was 244,000 lower than the average for the sa me month over the past five-years. A similar picture is observed in monthly hospital activity data, with a fall in elective general and acute total admissions (for el ective and non-elective inpatient admissions) from 708,000 in February to 182,000 in April. 70 68 NHS England and NHS Improvement, 2020. Next steps on NHS to COVID-19 Available NHS Consultant-led referral to treatment activity/monthly-hospital-activity/ [Accessed 9 42 Figure 3. Admitted (unadjusted) RTT pathways. There has also been an increase in the number of pe ople waiting more than 6 weeks for diagnostic tests, from 85,000 in March to 469,000 i n April 2020. 71 There was a corresponding fall in diagnostic tests carried out, from 1.52 mil lion in March to 610,000 in April 2020. 71 According to the latest data, the level of diagnost ic tests is still not at the average levels over th e past five-years, 344,000 lower than might usually b e expected. Published data also shows that 2.15 million people were waiting for more than 18 weeks to start treatment at the end of July 2020, 1.74 million hig her than the average for July over the past five years. 69 This may suggest that there has been a significant increase in postponements of non- urgent treatments. 71 NHS England, 2020. Figure 4. Incomplete RTT pathways longer than 18 we eks. It is also worth noting that the total number of pa tients waiting fell below 4 million in April 2020, the first time in two years. 69 This may suggest a lower caseload, but instead lik ely represents a reduced referral rate due to lower levels of health care activity during the peak; we may start to see a surge in referrals onto waiting lists as cons ultations resume and patients start to seek help again. 72 The above administrative data on delays to treatmen t is supported by surveys of patient experience. Understanding Society COVID-19 survey d ata indicates that of those who had expected or needed inpatient care in April, 60% did not have the treatment they needed, mostly due to NHS cancellations. 73 Of those who needed outpatient care, 42% had their appointments cancelled by the NHS, while 7% cancelled their appo intments themselves. The evidence above suggests there has been signific ant disruption to elective treatments over the course of the pandemic. The postponement and ca ncellation of elective care is likely to have avoided short-term deaths but may have morbidi ty and mortality impacts in the longer- term. Urgent care was expected to occur, but in som e cases life-saving treatment, such as organ transplants, may not have taken place during the peak in order to protect vulnerable patients from contracting COVID-19 and to avoid the m becoming particularly vulnerable in their recovery phase. This, combined with the routine ele ctive treatments that were cancelled or postponed, means there is likely to be a significan t backlog of care that the NHS will need to reschedule. Furthermore, since the NHS has started to resume el ective treatments, reports suggest there are lower levels of occupancy and productivity of c are, due to social distancing, infection control measures and staffing gaps. 74 For example, it is thought that the number of case s operating 72 Findlay, R., 2020.

Available from: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/sites/defaul t/files/downloads/general/ukhls_briefingnote_covid_ NHS told to return to than 18 weeks 44 theatres can cope with has fallen due to infection control measures increasing the time taken to bring patients into the operating theatre and for t he operation itself. 75 This reduced productivity constrains how quickly the NHS is able to resume no n-COVID-19 elective services and thus catch-up on the backlog of treatments produced as a result of COVID-19 restrictions on the healthcare service. 76 All of this combined means there may be longer dela ys for elective care patients waiting for hospital treatment, if no changes to NHS capacity a re made. Previous DHSC analysis for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) ha s suggested that if it takes the NHS five years to eliminate the COVID-19 related delay in el ective treatment, this might correspond to a loss of 160,000 QALYs, rising to 380,000 QALYs if i t took 10 years; this is in addition to short term impacts in the first year of disruption. 77 Under the HMRs Amendment scenario, an expanded work force is assumed to deliver a vaccine in a shorter period of time; by administering the v accine to at-risk populations at least at first, this may help to reduce COVID-19 to low levels or r educe the consequences of infection in high risk patients, which may allow something close to p re-pandemic life to return. Therefore, this may bring some benefits for pre-pandemic productivi ty levels within health and social care. However, it has not been possible to quantify the s pecific impact on provision of elective care services. Primary and community care As a result of the pandemic, many changes were made to primary care, community care and screening services; some services were reduced to o nly provide urgent care and others witnessed a decrease in patient attendance. Primary care services give the first entrance into the healthcare system, and include general practice, dental and optometry services, 78 which have seen considerable disruption since the pandemic. Community care services are varied 78 and there have been constraints on some aspects of community care services since the start of the pandemic. Screening services might include screening for pregnant woman, for new-born babies, diabetic eye screening, cervical screening, breast screening, bowel cancer screening and abdominal aortic aneurysm screening. 79 The number of GP appointments attended fell from 21 million in March to 14 million in April 2020, approximately 7 million fewer than April in t he previous year. 80 The format of general practice also changed considerably, with a lower pr oportion of appointments taking place face- to-face (47% in April, compared to 80% in February 2020) and more taking place via telephone (48% in April, compared to 14%). Since April, GP ap pointments attended have been increasing but there were still 3.1 million fewer attended GP appointments in July 2020 compared to 2019. 75 Batchelor, G., 2020.

Appointments in General Practice [Online]. from: https://digital.nhs.uk/da ta-and- information/publications/statistical/appointments-i n-general-practice/july-2020 [Accessed 9 September 45 This decrease in GP appointments may have long-last ing impacts for the nation's health. Whilst the upward trajectory is promising, we might have e xpected a surge in appointments due to a backlog from the peak of the pandemic. Whilst some causes may have naturally decreased due to lockdown measures (e.g. workplace accidents), ot her causes may have increased; equally some people may have delayed accessing primary care in order to not overburden the NHS or due to fear of contracting the virus during the pea k. Understanding Society data suggests that three quarters of those who needed GP services in A pril were still able to receive services; however, for the remainder most cancelled the appoi ntment themselves with a smaller proportion having the NHS cancel the appointment. 81 A similar picture is seen in pharmacy; about three quarters were still able to access phar macists if they needed too, but a significant proportion cancelled their appointment or had the s ervice cancelled by the NHS. Patients cancelling appointments themselves may suggest the issue was not that serious; however, delaying accessing care may mean that health proble ms may be identified later and therefore lead to worsening health outcomes. There are also likely to be impacts on other primar y and community care services. The provision of all routine, non-urgent dental care including or thodontics as well as routine optical services stopped in England during the peak. For both, urgen t care was still available; however, ceasing routine care has produced a backlog of appointments which will need to be caught up. Delaying treatment may mean a risk that more serious problem s are not picked up as a result of suspending routine appointments; harm to health may occur as a result of delaying referral to secondary care. Across all aspects of primary, community care and s creening, delays in accessing care may mean that serious problems are not identified as ea rly as they would have been; if patients continue to not access the appropriate services (du e to concerns about overwhelming the NHS or contracting the virus) this could result in sign ificant impacts for mortality and morbidity in the medium to longer-term. Whilst we are starting to se e an upward trajectory in appointments in some areas (e.g. general practice), there may be a backlog of appointments that need to be caught up over the coming months to ensure health i ssues are identified as early as possible. Under an HMRs Amendment scenario, we assume an admi nistering the vaccine to at risk- populations at pace and scale would bring benefits, either by reducing COVID-19 to low levels or reducing the consequences of infection in high r isk patients in the UK, allowing something close to pre-pandemic life to return. It is possibl e that the introduction of the vaccine would give the public confidence in attending healthcare setti ngs and may mean they are more willing to access the help they need, rather than delaying acc ess and potentially leading to more serious health problems. There are many uncertainties around this; it is pos sible that the public's confidence in attending healthcare settings may return to normal levels and the NHS may be able to maintain a consistent level of care if incidence remains low a nd stable. Therefore, as a result it has not been possible to quantify these impacts. Annex B - Health impacts of social distancing and l ockdown measures The Government introduced a number of lockdown meas ures that have since been gradually lifted, although many social distancing measures re main in place. There are likely to be a wide range of impacts as a result of lockdown measures o n health, social and economic outcomes. Reducing COVID-19 to low levels or reducing the con sequences of infection in high risk patients in the UK may allow something close to pre-pandemic life to return. The potential implications 81 Understanding Society, 2020. COVID-19 survey briefing note: Wave 1: April 2020 - health and caring [Online]. Available from: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/sites/defaul t/files/downloads/general/ukhls_briefingnote_covid_ health_final.pdf [Accessed 9 September 2020]. and benefits for wider health, from potential easem ents of lockdown measures are discussed below; however, it is important to note that there is considerable uncertainty about when and how these might be realised given the uncertainties about when a vaccine might be realised, who might be eligible to receive and its characteri stics. Air pollution Some benefits of the initial lockdown were expected from reduced air pollution, with decreased mobility resulting in fewer car journeys being made . As Figure 5 shows, there was a significant drop in transport use after the lockdown, but some vehicular use (such as cars) has since return to levels experienced before the pandemic. 82 Figure 5. Percentage change in transport use from ba seline (Great Britain) for all motor vehicles Whilst there is a drive to deliver infrastructure t o better enable walking and cycling in city centres, it is possible that the expected benefits from reduced air pollution will not continue in the medium term; the public may make use of cars to avoid public transport and stop walking or cycling over the winter period. Under an HMRs Amendment scenario, we assume the dep loyment of a vaccine at pace and at scale may allow something close to pre-pandemic lif e to return. This may mean an adjustment to transportation practices much faster; for exampl e, people may be more willing to return to using public transport instead of their cars if the virus is at low levels. This would occur much quicker in the HMRs scenario than under BAU. Overal l, it seems possible there would be marginal net benefit to health from reduced air pol lution. 82 Public Health England, n.d. Social determinants of health [Online]. Available from: https://analytics.phe.gov .uk/apps/covid-19-indirect-effects/ [Accessed March 2020, 'stay at home' guidance was introduc ed, and workers were advised to work from home if they were able to. 83 This change likely means a large number of people are now using display screen equipment (DSE) whilst working at ho me. Although employers have a legal obligation to assess the risks of those who use DSE and put measures in place to mitigate any identified risks, it is not expected that employers would provide office-equivalent equipment. 84 Therefore, many workers may not have access to suit able equipment whilst working from home, which may lead to and exacerbate musculoskeletal co nditions. It is possible that some of this harm may have alre ady occurred and may remain the same or be exacerbated if home working continues for a long pe riod. It is possible that this could be improved with the return to offices and the use of ergonomic office equipment, particularly when this change is made permanent and social distancing may no longer be needed. Under an HMRs Amendment scenario, it seems likely that the p ermanent return to office working could occur quicker than under a BAU scenario. Therefore, there may be some benefits related to musculoskeletal conditions; however, there is consi derable uncertainty with this, and it is possible that harm has already taken place as a res ult of working from home until this point. Home & occupational accidents Under the 'stay at home' guidance, many more people were spending longer periods of time in their homes during the initial lockdown period. The refore, it seems likely that the incidence of home accidents may have increased as a result. Whil st these measures have been lifted to some extent, it seems likely that a large proportio n are still spending longer periods of time at home, particularly if they are working from home. A dministering the vaccine at pace and at scale to high risk patients, at least at first, may allow something close to pre-pandemic life to return more quickly and could lead to a faster reduction i n home accidents. On the other hand, it is important to consider the impact on occupational accidents. In 2018/19, an estimated 1.4 million workers were suffering fro m an illness they believed was caused or made worse by their work, 581,000 workers sustained a non-fatal injury at work, and 147 died from fatal injuries. 85 Considering the distribution of employees across s ectors, the highest numbers of work accidents were observed in the whol esale and retail trade, the human health and social work sector, the manufacturing sector, t he accommodation and food sector, the education sector, and the administrative and suppor t sector. It is possible that there may be some reduction in occupational accidents amongst this sector under ongoing lockdown measures and therefore the q uicker deployment of a vaccine could be detrimental in this case. However, it is important to note the potential impact of musculoskeletal disorders for home workers too (as noted above). Sexually transmitted infections & other infectious diseases As a result of social distancing measures, it is po ssible that the incidence and transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other in fectious diseases decreased over the initial 83 The Health Foundation, 2020. COVID-19 policy tracker [Online]. Available from: https://www.health.org.uk /news-and-comment/charts-and- infographics/covid-19-policy-tracker [Accessed 9 Se 84 A guide to temporary n.d. Industries [Online]. Available from: https://www.hse.gov.uk/st atistics/industry/ [Accessed 17 September 2020]. 48 lockdown period. Whilst this may have risen slightl y with the easing of restrictions and some people seeing the guidance as more relaxed, it seem s likely the transmission is still reduced compared to the pre-pandemic period. It is feasible that once it is possible to ease soc ial distancing measures if the virus remains at a low level, the transmission of infectious diseases will start to increase with the removal of social distancing measures. Therefore, a more rapid deploy ment of a vaccine under the HMRs Amendment scenario could result in an increase in t ransmission of other diseases sooner than under the BAU scenario, which would result in harm to health. Alcohol use There was some concern that alcohol consumption has increased as a result of lockdown measures. Indeed, Kantar Worldpanel demonstrates an increase in volume purchased around the time lockdown was introduced which may correspo nd to the stockpiling behaviour that was observed with other groceries. 86 PHE data (see Figure 6) also suggests a surge in h igher risk drinking in England, from 11% in February 2020 to a lmost 20% in April 2020. 86 This corresponds with findings from a recent pre-print s tudy analysing longitudinal survey data, which found that the COVID-19 lockdown in April was associated with substantial increases in problematic drinking in UK adults. 87 Figure 6. Prevalence of higher risk drinking in Engla nd Due to a lack of recent data, it is difficult to kn ow whether this trend has been maintained or whether alcohol consumption levels have decreased a s lockdown measures have eased. However, if similar high levels of drinking were as sociated with the imposition of lockdown measures, we may see harm to health if local lockdo wn measures are introduced. In this case, if lockdown measures can be eased once a vaccine has b een deployed, there may be impacts for harm related to hazardous alcohol consumption. 86 Public Health England, n.d. Behavioural risk factors [Online]. Available from: https://analytics.phe.gov .uk/apps/covid-19-indirect-effects/ [Accessed 9 September 2020]. 87 Daly, M. and Robinson, E., 2020.

This was reflected in preliminary figures reported by the National Policy Chiefs' Council, with a 4%, 6% and 8% rise in domestic abus e incidents in April, May and June respectively compared to the same period in 2019; t his relates to concerns brought to the attention of the police, so not all concerns will r esult in a crime being identified or recorded, and this will also not capture abuse that is not report ed. 88 ,89 ,90 Refuge, the UK's largest domestic abuse charity, reported a 700% increase in helpline calls in a single day during the peak. 91 With the assumed introduction of local lockdown, it is possible that these increases in domestic violence may continue to be seen, perhaps to a less er extent. Under an HMRs Amendment scenario, if lockdown and social distancing measure s can be eased sooner if the virus remains at low levels following the introduction of a vacci ne, this may see a faster realisation of benefits from reductions in domestic violence with victims m ore able to access support. Interpersonal violence During the initial lockdown, police observed a decr ease in many different categories of harm, including violence against the person (such as comm on assault, grievous bodily harm and murder) 92 ; compared to 2019, there was a 10% decrease in suc h offences in April 2020, although this rose by 13% during May 2020. 93 This may suggest that lockdown measures had a positive impact on crimes against the person, likel y due to social distancing measures and reduced mobility amongst the population. However, i t is clear that levels seemed to increase after the initial lockdown period which may suggest the benefit was short-lived. If local lockdown measures are imposed, it seems po ssible that there may be some benefit in terms of reduced interpersonal violence; however, i t is difficult to be certain. Therefore, when something close to pre-pandemic life can return we may see a faster return to pre-pandemic levels of interpersonal violence, representing a co st to health and society. Mental health For some people, lockdown measures may have led to improvements in mental health; however, evidence from longitudinal surveys suggest that overall there has been a detrimental impact of lockdown on the adults' mental health. 94 A recent pre-print study analysing longitudinal 88 NPCC, 2020.

Available from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S 2215036620303084?via%3Dihub [Accessed 10 September 2020]. 50 data found a significant and prolonged deterioratio n in mental health occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic between April and June 2020. 95 The research found that the population prevalence of mental health problems increased from 24% in 2017-19 to 39% in April 2020 and remained significantly above pre-pandemic levels in May (35%) and June (32%). The greatest increase was seen amongst 18 to 34-year olds, parti cipants who identified as female, those with high income and education groups. The disparity by age has also been noted in other COVID- 19 specific research. 96 The researchers also suggest that these rises are unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation. Another pre-print study found that about 30% of adu lts without a common mental disorder in 2017/19 had a CMD in April 2020; we do not know whe ther that change occurred before the pandemic or as a result of lockdown. 97 Incidence then reduced to 13% in May 2020, with mu ch of this change coinciding with a reduction in stres sors such as loneliness and increases in domestic demands, working from and receiving care. Therefore, it is possible that some people adapt to living under lockdown and find a 'new norm al'; however, it is also possible that some people have developed diagnosable mental health con ditions over the course of lockdown. Indeed, we do not know the impact on mental health following the easing of lockdown measures; it is possible that mental health will ha ve improved for some, but may worsen for others, if they feel a sense of anxiety about retur ning to 'normal' life. Similarly, we know that having a job is a protective factor against develop ing psychiatric disorders; 98 therefore if we see an increase in unemployment following the end of th e furlough scheme, it is possible that mental health problems may increase again. A pre-print study of young people aged 13 to 24 sur veyed in April 2020 suggests similar findings to research with adults. 99 Researchers found 40-50% of participants felt sign ificantly more anxious and 50-60% were worried about their parents or family. However, this relies on retrospective data and does not involve a longitudi nal design. A Young Minds survey of young people in March 2020 who had ever looked for suppor t for their mental health found 83% agreed that the pandemic had made their mental heal th much or a bit worse. 100 Research on the effect of quarantine in general sug gests that loss of usual routine and reduced social and physical contact with others may cause b oredom, frustration, isolation, and distress. 101 Longer quarantine is associated with poorer psycho logical outcomes; researchers also suggest extending periods of quarantine can ex acerbate feelings of frustration or demoralisation. Overall, it seems likely that a pro longed period of lockdown would be harmful for mental health, even if we only experienced local lo ckdowns and never returned to the initial level of national lockdown. 95 Daly, M., Sutin, A. and Robinson, E., 2020.

The Lancet, 395 (10227), pp. 912 - 920. 51 Overall, we do not know whether levels of mental he alth problems have remained high over the summer period, and therefore it is difficult to ant icipate to what extent a potentially shorter or less severe lockdown period before a vaccine is int roduced would improve the nation's mental health. There may be benefits for mental health ser vices being able to return to pre-pandemic productivity levels quicker and therefore, it is po ssible that people who have developed new or worsening mental health problems as a result of the pandemic would be able to access treatment or support more quickly than under a BAU scenario. Annex C - Wider economic impacts The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of impacts on the economy, and the UK is now in recession. 102 If the expanded workforce is able to more rapidly deploy a vaccine, there may be benefits to the economy as a result. Furthermore, w e know that recessions have impacts on health, and therefore limiting the period of recess ion is likely to have broader impact on health too. Reducing COVID-19 to low levels or reducing the con sequences of infection in high risk patients in the UK may allow something close to pre-pandemic life to return. This may bring benefits for the wider economy and these are discussed further b elow. However, it is important to note that there is considerable uncertainty about when and ho w these might be realised given the uncertainties about when a vaccine might be realise d, who might be eligible to receive and its characteristics. It is important to note that the a nalysis below represents one of many possible scenarios. Impacts on the economy Here, we have estimated the impact of a shorter per iod of lockdown on the economy. Business as Usual scenario Our central assessment of the counterfactual econom ic costs is based on the Office of Budgetary Responsibility's (OBR) Fiscal Sustainabil ity Report published July 14th 2020.103 The GDP data for 2020 Q2 suggests that the coronavi rus outbreak and the health measures put in place to address it have resulted in a very shar p economic contraction, of the order of magnitude of 22.6% of GDP. However, the pace of the recovery and the extent of any long-term economic 'scarring' are both still highly uncertain . Given the uncertainty, the OBR have produced 3 projected scenarios for the economy movi ng forward: An upside scenario where activity rebounds relativ ely quickly, recovering its pre-virus peak by the first quarter of 2021, and there is no enduring economic scarring. A central scenario where output recovers more slow ly, regaining its pre-virus peak by the end of 2022. In our downside scenario, output recovers even mor e slowly, returning to its pre-virus peak only in the third quarter of 2024. For our framework, we use their central scenario as our main counterfactual for the economic trajectory of the economy. The OBR states that the central scenario is consistent with an effective vaccine or treatment taking around a year to deliver, but also with a faster resolution of the health threat but greater persistence in its ec onomic consequences. This is slightly longer than our own assessment of business as usual scenar io on vaccine delivery timelines absent of 102 Chan, S. P. and Plummer, R., 2020. UK officially in recession for first time in 11 yea rs [Online]. Available from: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53748278 [Acces sed 21 September 2020]. 103 Office for Budget Responsibility, 2020. Fiscal sustainability report - July 2020 [Online]. Available from: https://obr.uk/fsr/fiscal -sustainability- report-july-2020/ [Accessed 21 September any policy intervention; however, we retain the 1-y ear assumption for the purposes of presenting an illustrative scenario. Based on the OBR scenario, GDP reaches its pre-pand emic peak by 2022 Q4; given assumed delivery of vaccine of 1 year, we present a scenari o where expanding the workforce under the HMRs could ensure deployment of a vaccine is achiev ed in half the time (which is in line the mid-point between our optimistic and pessimistic sc enarios noted above). However, we know that the pace of recovery will dep end on the course of the pandemic globally and the development of effective vaccines and treat ments; the speed and consistency with which the Government can lift public health restric tions without increasing infections; the response of individuals and businesses as it does s o; and the effectiveness of policy measures to protect viable businesses. Thus, policy measures introduced that speed up the development of a vaccine or aid the speed to market of a vaccine are likely to generate econo mic benefits relative to the Business as Usual scenario. In the next section, we consider the consider the e conomic impact of three policy measures that set out above. Modelling Our modelling suggests that the introduction of ame ndments to expand the workforce eligible to administer a vaccine will decrease the time to roll out the vaccine to 0.5 years. Based on these assumptions, we produce an alternate projection for the economy by changing parameters on the time for deployment that is assoc iated with the OBRs central scenario, as shown in Error! Reference source not found. . It is important to note that the OBR provides a projection over a 5-year period; however, we have o pted to present a conservative scenario until the end of 2021, given the uncertainty about the course of the pandemic and the extent of future economic growth we might expect to see. Overall, our modelling suggests the benefits to the economy could amount to \u00a321bn. However, this is based on a series of unevidenced assumption s about the impact of a vaccine on the economy and should be treated with considerable cau tion. Figure 7. Economic impact of HMRs Amendments relativ e to the OBR As Usual 53 We have not evaluated here any additional reduction to long-term economic scarring from the policy interventions. The OBR central forecast sugg ests that the economy will have lost 3% of economic output relative to its pre-pandemic trend. Our modelling assumptions maintain this impact. However, the speed with which effective vac cines and treatments are deployed and brought to market may limit this long-term economic impact further. This is because if a vaccine is deployed and procured sooner, then the arising i mpacts from bankruptcies and necessary changes in the organisation of businesses (re-struc turing) to cope with Covid-19 may be further reduced, limiting the long-term impact. Impacts on health from recession induced deprivatio n We know that recessions have impacts on health, and therefore limiting the period of recession is likely to have broader impact on health too. Thi s has been discussed in previous papers submitted to SAGE, which suggests that whilst short er term impacts of recession tend to be associated with short-term reductions in mortality rates, the medium and long-term impacts may have a negative impact on health and mortality, par ticularly for people who were young during recessions. Overall, it has not been possible to es timate the impact of the lockdown-induced recession on health, but it seems likely that poten tially returning to something close to pre- pandemic life sooner, and therefore a potentially s horter period of recession under the HMRs Amendment scenario would have positive impacts for health.
