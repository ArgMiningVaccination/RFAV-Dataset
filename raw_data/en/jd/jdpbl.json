Upon primary immunization, participants with pre-existing immunity mounted 41 higher antibody responses faster and achieved higher steady-state levels compared to na\u00efve 42 individuals. Antibody durability was characterized by two phases: an initial rapi d decay, followed by 43 a phase of stabilization with very slow decay resulting in an individual spike binding antibody 44 steady state. Booster vaccination equalized the differences in antibody levels between participants 45 with and without hybrid immunity, but the antibody titers reached decreased with each successive 46 antigen exposure. Break-through infections increased antibody titers to similar levels as an 47 additional vaccine dose in na\u00efve individuals. Our study provides strong evidence for the fact that 48 SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are long lasting, with an initial waning phase followed by a 49 stabilization phase. 50 .

Vaccines to mitigate the impact of the pandemic were developed at record speed and have 54 saved millions of lives. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants1 and waning immunity2 55 have decreased the effectiveness of the vaccines against symptomatic disease3. These two 56 issues, emergence of antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants and waning immunity, are often 57 conflated and used interchangeably but represent two different phenomena4. Most vaccines used 58 in North America and Europe are based on lipid nanoparticles (LNP) containing messenger RNA 59 (mRNA) produced by Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273), and the common 60 perception now is that mRNA-based vaccine-induced immunity wanes quickly5. However, this 61 assumption is mostly based on data from short-term studies that include a very limited number of 62 data points following peak responses2,5. 63 In March of 2020, the densely populated New York metropolitan area was hit with an 64 exponential increase of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting in a staggering number of 65 fatalities and a severely overburdened health care system6-8. Due to shortages of personal 66 protective equipment, essential workers in the health care system were at high risk for infection. In 67 response to this crisis, we established ( a) a specific and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 binding enzyme- 68 linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure humoral immune responses9, and ( b) an 69 observational longitudinal cohort of health care workers of the Mount Sinai Health System to 70 determine the kinetics of these humoral responses. This study, named Protection Associated with 71 Rapid Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 (PARIS)10, aims to capture the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody 72 responses to both infection as well as vaccinations, to determine re-infection rates, and to assess 73 correlates of protection in the context of individual immune histories. 74 With over 8,000 longitudinal study visits across a single cohort during the first three years of 75 the pandemic, our investigation represents one of the most extensive and in-depth assessments of 76 the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses to date. Using this longitudinal cohort, we 77 determined the kinetics of antibody responses to spike protein after infections, during the primary 78 immunization series, during monovalent and bivalent booster vaccination as well as during 79 breakthrough infections. Our findings indicate that, in contrast to common perception, COVID-19 80 mRNA vaccination induces long-lasting antibody responses in humans. The PARIS study also 81 provides insights into the effect of booster vaccination and breakthrough infections on the stability 82 of antibody responses. 83 .

The first participants were enrolled in April 2020 when NYC 88 emerged as one of the very early epicenters of the pandemic in the United States. We have 89 conducted over 8,000 study visits with data and biospecimen collection spanning a three-year 90 period (April 2020 to March 2023). 91 Of the participants, 67% were female and 56% self-identified as white. The mean age at 92 study enrollment was 41 years ( Table 1 ). At the first study visit, 62% of the participants had no 93 measurable SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibodies (naive, seronegative). At each study visit we 94 collected data and biospecimen (e.g., blood, saliva). Study visits were scheduled at shorter 95 intervals (2-4 weeks) from study entry through week 8 after enrollment, but the intervals between 96 visits were extended (to approximately 4-8 weeks) for follow-up visits after week 8. Ad hoc study 97 visits were included at short intervals (e.g., weekly) after immune events such as vaccination or 98 infection. Serum samples were used to measure antibodies binding to the ancestral spike protein 99 using an established in-house method that was developed early in the pandemic9. 100 465 of 501 PARIS participants (93%) were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 using mRNA 101 vaccines: 342/465 received two doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 and 111/465 received two doses of 102 Moderna mRNA-1273. A small proportion of participants received one dose of the Johnson & 103 Johnson vaccine [ Ad26.COV2.S ], or two doses of the CoviShield [AZD1222] vaccine as their 104 primary SARS-CoV-2 immunization regimen ( Table 1 ). The number of vaccine doses administered 105 to a given PARIS participant ranged from two to six doses. Briefly, 366/465 (79%) of PARIS 106 participants who completed their primary immunizations subsequently elected to receive a third 107 vaccine dose (\"booster\"). Of t hese 366 participants, 97 (27%) received a second booster (4th 108 vaccine dose overall; 27/97 monovalent ancestral booster vaccine versus 70/97 bivalent 109 ancestral/BA.5 vaccine). Of these 97 participants, 15 opted for a third booster (5th vaccine dose 110 overall). Of these 15 participants, one opted for a fourth booster (6th vaccine dose overall). Lastly, 111 14/27 participants with two monovalent boosters elected to get the bivalent booster. 112 113 ANTIBODY RESPONSES TO INFECTION AND PRIMARY IMMUNIZATION 114 38% of the study participants entered the PARIS study having detectable spike binding IgG 115 antibodies, albeit at highly variable levels ( Figure 1 , area under the curve (AUC) range at baseline: 116 .

Infection-induced anti-spike antibodies showed re latively high stability over 117 approximately 10 months of pre-vaccine follow-up. A detailed analysis of this phase of the study 118 has been reported previously11. 119 Vaccinations with mRNA vaccines were available to health care workers in Mid-December 120 2020 (December 15th, 2020, for Pfizer BNT162b2; December 28th, 2020, for Moderna mRNA- 121 1273). In na\u00efve individuals, the first dose of the mRNA vaccine induced no to relatively low levels of 122 antibodies ( Suppl. Figure 2A ) but the second vaccine dose, administered 16-31 days after the first 123 (Pfizer BNT162b2: median 21 days [range:16-30]; Moderna mRNA-1273: median 27 days [21-31], 124 increased titers to 5,936 (AUC, peak at 35 days post first dose, Figure 2A, Suppl. Figure 2 ). In 125 contrast, individuals with pre-existing immunity induced by infection reached peak titers faster, 126 approximately 10 days after the first dose and achieved significantly higher antibody titers (AUC 127 19,594, peak at 10 days post first dose ( Figure 2A, Suppl. Figure 2 ). After completing the primary 128 immunization regimen, participants without pre-existing immunity had > 3-fold lower peak 129 responses compared to participants with pre-existing immunity (p<0.001). 130 During the approximately 400 day-long follow-up period, we found an initial steep five-fold 131 drop of antibody titers in vaccinated individuals with and without pre-existing immunity followed by 132 a stabilization phase ( Figure 2A) . Based on a simple rolling geometric mean, post-vaccine data 133 was observed to have two rough \"phases\" with different rates of decay ( Figure 3A ). This 134 observation resembled a bi-phasic decay that is well-approximated by a two-component three- 135 parameter one-phase exponential decay model framework, prompting us to explore the kinetics of 136 the antibody response in more detail. We fitted a nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model to 137 describe the antibody dynamics from two weeks up to one year after the completion of the primary 138 vaccination series. The same model was also fit to antibody dynamics after the third vaccine dose. 139 Specifically, our model has two components: a rapid-decay component with a half-life measured in 140 weeks to months (e.g., antibodies produced by the plasmablast response), and a steady-state 141 component to capture convergence to stable titers during prolonged follow-up (e.g., antibodies 142 produced by long-lived plasma cells) ( Suppl. Figure 3A ). 143 NLME models were fit using the NLMixed procedure in SAS to account for variable 144 longitudinal sampling between participants. A per-participant random effect for each component 145 accounts for the significant variability in both antibody response magnitude and kinetics. Fixed 146 effects due to demographic parameters and vaccine type were fit as multiplicative shifts in the 147 expected geometric mean area under the curve (AUC) across the entire time course. Datasets 148 were stratified by immune status prior to vaccination, with models fit independently to each 149 group. Results for the final models including demographic factors are reported, with independent 150 .

It also provides the means for a personalized 154 two-component immunity score accounting for an individual's SARS-CoV-2 immune history 155 reflecting both the magnitude of the peak response and the stability of that response ( Suppl. 156 Figure 3 ). These two phases with distinct half-lives distinguish the PARIS model from commonly 157 available models that only consider exponential decay in binding antibodies after vaccination. 158 When comparing our two-phase decay model with a simple exponential decay model, we noted 159 that the latter overestimates the rate of decay in months 6 to 12 post-vaccination in our cohort 160 (Suppl. Figure 3B ). 161 For the post-vaccine model ( Figure 3A ), the initial antibody levels measured at 14 days 162 after the second dose are 6,100 AUC in the na\u00efve group (blue) and 17,000 AUC in the hybrid 163 immunity group (2.8-fold higher, in orange). This \"peak\" response is composed of two components 164 in each case. In the na\u00efve group, the short-lived component has a magnitude of 5,700 AUC (95% 165 Confidence Interval [CI]: 5,200-6,400) with a half-life of 29.6 days (CI: 28.1-31.2) and the stable 166 component has a magnitude of 330 AUC (CI: 290-370). In the hybrid immunity group, the short- 167 lived component has a magnitude of 15,000 AUC (CI: 13,000-18,000) with a half-life of 30.7 days 168 (CI: 28.4-33.5) and the stable component has a magnitude of 1,800 AUC (CI: 1,500-2,100). 169 Because of the larger difference in the stable component, the gap between the hybrid immunity 170 group and the na\u00efve group increases to 4.8-fold at 180 days and 5.4-fold at 360 days after 171 completion of the primary immunization regimen, respectively. Six months after vaccination, the 172 predicted geometric mean antibody titer (GMT) was 445 AUC in the vaccine-only immunity group 173 corresponding to an 18.6-fold reduction relative to the peak antibody levels. In the hybrid immunity 174 group, the predicted GMT was 2,142 corresponding to a 10.7-fold reduction relative to the peak 175 antibody levels. Reductions in antibody levels over the next six months. At 12 months post- 176 vaccination, the predicted GMT was 329 in the vaccine-only immunity group corresponding to only 177 a 1.35-fold reduction relative to antibody levels six months after vaccination. In the hybrid immunity 178 group, the predicted GMT was 1,783 AUC a year after the initial immunization corresponding to a 179 1.2-fold reduction relative to antibody levels at six months post-vaccination. Thus, although the 180 kinetics of decay in the stable plateau phase are comparable between the two groups, the 181 predicted antibody titer levels for each group differed by more than four-fold (e.g., AUC 329 versus 182 AUC 1,783). 183 .

Of these, only age and vaccine type were statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level in any 187 group. The effect of vaccine type is illustrated in Figure 3D for the post-vaccine model. There is a 188 statistically significant effect in the na\u00efve group, with a 1.43-fold increase in antibody levels (CI: 189 1.20-1.70) in the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients compared to the Pfizer BNT162b2 190 recipients. There was no statistically significant impact of vaccine type noted in the hybrid immunity 191 group. The effect of age was modest but nonetheless significant in the na\u00efve group: each decade 192 of additional age lived corresponded to a 1.17-fold decrease in antibodies (CI: 1.041-1.187) 193 (Suppl. Table 1 ). In the hybrid immunity group, there was no statistically significant effect. 194 In summary, based on our data and modeling, antibody titers achieved a steady state 195 seven to nine months after the primary vaccination series. Stable titers were higher for individuals 196 with hybrid immunity as compared na\u00efve vaccinees suggesting induction of long-lived serum 197 antibody titers even after the primary vaccination series. In addition, vaccine type and age had a 198 modest but measurable influence on antibody titer levels in participants without hybrid immunity. 199 200 ANTIBODY RESPONSES TO BOOSTER IMMUNIZATIONS 201 Third dose booster vaccination were authorized for health care workers in September 2021 202 (September 22nd, 2021, for Pfizer BNT162b2 and October 20th, 2021, for Moderna mRNA-1273). 203 Booster vaccination resulted in 27-fold increases in peak spike antibody responses in previously 204 naive individuals ( Figure 2B ). In contrast, hybrid immune individuals displayed only a 4-fold 205 increase due to their higher baseline. Four weeks after booster vaccination, the peak titers were 206 similar between previously na\u00efve participants (mean AUC: 10,162) and those with hybrid immunity 207 (mean AUC: 8,001, Figure 2B ). This stands in stark contrast to the humoral immune responses 208 mounted upon the primary series ( Figure 1, Figure 2A, Suppl. Fig. 2B ). The third vaccine dose 209 seemed to act as an 'equalizer' lifting the antibody titers of participants with vaccine-only immunity 210 for the first time in our longitudinal study to the level of those with infection- and vaccine-induced 211 immunity. 212 Antibody kinetics post-boost were different compared to kinetics after the primary series 213 (Figure 3B ). The initial waning of antibodies was slow er, and titers stabilized at similar levels to 214 those of the hybrid immune group post-primary vaccination. Importantly, titers settled at 215 comparable levels for both previously na\u00efve and participants with hybrid immunity and stabilized 216 .

Interest ingly, although they stabilized at similar 217 levels, peak levels post boost were moderately but significantly lower than in the hybrid immune 218 group post primary vaccination series. 219 The fourth vaccine dose did boost serum antibody levels, albeit to a much lower fold- 220 increase compared to prior vaccine doses (vaccine-only 3.9-fold, hybrid immune 4.8-fold) ( Figure 221 2C). The peak antibody titers after the second booster vaccine were comparable to the peak titers 222 achieved after the first booster vaccination. Antibody waning kinetics were also very similar to the 223 kinetics observed after administration of the 3rd vaccine dose ( Figure 1, Figure 2B, Suppl. Fig,2 ). 224 For individuals receiving a third/fourth booster dose (fifth or sixth vaccine dose overall), the data 225 was too sparse for an in-depth analysis, but antibody titers were generally within the same range 226 observed post-3rd and post-4th vaccine doses ( Figure 1 ). 227 We next used our model for the analysis of post boost antibody kinetics. For the post-boost 228 model, antibody levels at 14 days after third dose are 9,500 AUC in the na\u00efve group and 7,400 229 AUC in the hybrid immunity group ( Figure 3B ). In the na\u00efve group, the short-lived component had 230 a magnitude of 7,500 AUC (CI: 6,500-8,700) with a half-life of 44 days (CI: 39-50) and the stable 231 component has a magnitude of 2,000 AUC (CI: 1500-2500). In the hybrid immunity group, the 232 short-lived component has a magnitude of 5400 UC (CI: 4,300-6,800) with a half-life of 73 days 233 (CI: 60-93) and the stable component has a magnitude of 2,000 AUC (CI: 1,400-2,700). Predicted 234 geometric mean antibody levels 180 days after the beginning of the modeling period (14 days post- 235 boost) are 0.22-fold peak antibody levels in the non-hybrid immunity group and 0.38-fold peak 236 antibody levels in the hybrid immunity group. The rate of decay slows over the next six months, 237 with predicted antibody levels at day 360 of the modeled period are 0.79-fold antibody levels at day 238 180 in the na\u00efve group and 0.70-fold day 180 antibody levels in the hybrid immunity group. Despite 239 this difference in shape, the geometric mean magnitude of the antibody response is similar across 240 both groups throughout the entire time course studied, with fold-change between groups with and 241 without hybrid immunity ranging from 0.72 to 1.22 and no detectable difference in the magnitudes 242 of the stable component of the model. Because of this, antibody kinetics after boost are well 243 approximated by a single model trained on a combined dataset disregarding prior infection status 244 (Figure 3B ). 245 We next compared antibody kinetics after the first booster immunization to those mounted 246 after the primary vaccination ( Figure 3C ). In the model, peak antibody levels after boost are 247 between those for the na\u00efve and hybrid immunity groups post-primary vaccination, and the stable 248 component of the response post-boost is slightly higher in the hybrid immunity group suggesting 249 slower decay. Of note, in the post-boost dataset, the effect due to primary vaccine type follows a 250 .

Participants without hybrid immunity who 251 received the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine for their primary series show a 1.41-fold increase 252 relative to Pfizer recipients (CI: 1.10-1.82). The hybrid immunity group shows no statistically 253 significant difference nor trend due to primary vaccine type. Taken together, our data indicate that 254 booster vaccine doses increase the level at whic h long term serum antibod y responses stabilize. 255 256 IMMUNE RESPONSES UPON BREAKTHROUGH INFECTIONS 257 While during the early phase of the pandemic, re-infections were rare, breakthrough 258 infections increase with the emergence of variants of concern, especially the Omicron variant. Viral 259 variants of concern started to circulate in the NYC metropolitan area in early 2021 ( Figure 4A ). In 260 our study, we identified breakthrough infections based on participant self-reporting (rapid antigen 261 tests or PCR testing at external facilities), nucleic acid amplification tests and/or an increase in 262 antibody titers (e.g., >4-fold). 263 A total of 225 SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded among participants over the duration 264 of the PARIS study, with most new infections (214/225) occurring after immunization (at least one 265 vaccine dose administered). We documented three infections after the first vaccine dose and 37 266 infections after the second vaccine dose but before the booster vaccination ( Figure 4B ). There 267 were 174 breakthrough infections identified in participants who had received at least one booster 268 vaccine dose. The bulk of breakthrough infections were observed after December 20, 2021, when 269 Omicron BA.1 started to spread widely in our community (192/214 new infections). At that point in 270 time, 299 PARIS participants had received a vaccine dose within the prior six months (10/289 271 second dose of the primary immunization series, 288/289 a booster vaccine dose). 55/299 272 participants who received a vaccine dose within six months prior to the Omicron wave, experienced 273 a breakthrough infection between December 2021 and February 2022. Nine infections occurred at 274 least 14 days after the participant received a bivalent booster. Of note, one person had three 275 consecutive infections with Omicron variants. Interestingly, before highly antigenically distinct 276 Omicron variants started to circulate in the NYC metropolitan area beginning around mid- 277 December 2021 ( Figure 4A ), most breakthrough infections occurred in vaccinated individuals who 278 were previously na\u00efve, and none occurred in the hybrid immunity group ( Figure 4C, left panel). 279 After the emergence of the different Omicron lineages, this picture changed, and breakthrough 280 infections also became more common in hybrid immune individuals ( Figure 4C , right panel), but 281 hybrid immunity continued to have a protective effect as compared to non-hybrid immunity 282 (p=0.00029, log rank test). 283 .

We compared the data for 176 breakthrough 285 infections (at least 14 days after primary vaccination) to the effect observed after receiving an 286 additional vaccine dose ( Figure 4D ). To start, we compared the effect of a booster dose after the 287 primary immunization series ( VVV) in participants who had no recorded infection to the change in 288 antibodies in participants who experienced a breakthrough infection after the primary immunization 289 series (VVI). Breakthrough infection in participants who had only had vaccine induced antibodies 290 was the third antigen encounter and increased antibody titers by more than 30-fold, in a manner 291 comparable to an mRNA vaccine booster dose. If the breakthrough infection was the fourth antigen 292 encounter, the fold induction was lower (due to a higher baseline) resulting in an approximately 293 four to five-fold increase which was comparable to a 4th vaccine dose. For the fourth antigen 294 encounter, in the case of a participant whose breakthrough infection was not their first infection and 295 who initially had hybrid immunity (IVVI), however, saw a relatively lower fold change in antibody 296 responses as opposed to participants with hybrid immunity who received a booster dose (IVVV). 297 This difference may be due to the hybrid immunity limiting virus replication during breakthrough 298 infections, leading to less immune stimulation. A similar observation was made when the 299 breakthrough infection as opposed to booster dose was the fifth exposure in participants with 300 hybrid immunity. Especially in formerly na\u00efve individuals, one could argue that breakthrough 301 infections, their first infections, are equivalent to vaccine booster doses in terms of antibody 302 response, while in individuals with hybrid immunity the vaccine has a better effect on boosting 303 systemic antibodies when compared to a second infection. 304 305 REACTOGENICITY DURING PRIMARY VACCINATION SERIES AND BOOSTER DOSES 306 In addition to immunogenicity, we analyzed the reactogenicity profiles associated with the 307 different vaccine doses in study participants with and without immunity prior to the primary 308 immunizations. After each vaccine dose, participants were provided a survey to provide self- 309 reported side effects experienced. This analysis builds on preliminary data published in early 310 202112 which reported that participants with pre-existing immunity experience more systemic side 311 effects after the first vaccine dose compared to na\u00efve participants. We now have data not only on 312 the reactogenicity of the second and third vaccine doses but also longitudinal data on how side 313 effects changed at an individual level. 314 We collected information regarding local (injection site: pain, erythema, induration, 315 lymphadenopathy) and systemic (e.g., fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia 316 .

From all survey responses received, we 321 selected the subset of 228 participants (69% female, 70% na\u00efve at primary vaccination) who 322 submitted surveys after each of the first, second and third vaccine doses. Of note, 69% of these 323 respondents received three doses of Pfizer BNT162b2, 21% three doses of Moderna mRNA-1273, 324 and 11% had a mix of vaccine types. Participants without three mRNA vaccine doses were 325 excluded. The distribution of vaccine types was broadly similar across participants with differing 326 immune histories ( Suppl. Table 3 ). 327 Overall, the vaccines were well tolerated with most participant experiencing mild to 328 moderate side effects. Of the participants who reported severe side effects, none required medical 329 attention. 60-72% of the participants who completed all three surveys reported at least one 330 symptom (Dose 1: 60%, Dose 2: 72%, Dose 3: 67%). Across all vaccine doses and independent of 331 infection history, injection site pain is the top reported local side effect and fatigue is the top 332 reported systemic side effect. 11/160 na\u00efve participants and 5/68 participants with hybrid immunity 333 recorded a breakthrough infection prior to the booster dose. Participants with hybrid immunity 334 experienced overall more side effects ( Figure 5 ) although the difference in frequency relative to 335 na\u00efve participants became smaller with each additional vaccination. After the first dose, both local 336 and systemic side effects were more common in participants with pre-existing immunity compared 337 to na\u00efve participants ( Figure 5 ). After the second dose na\u00efve participants reported a higher 338 incidence of systemic side effects while the frequency of local injection site symptoms remained 339 relatively unchanged. The booster vaccination resulted in less painful injection site reactions in the 340 participants with hybrid immunity (Dose 1/2: 63% vs. Dose 3: 49%) while there was no such 341 difference in the vaccine only immunity group (Dose 2: 52% vs Dose 3: 53%). Both groups also 342 reported lymphadenopathy (e.g., axillary) to occur more frequently (7-11%) while fatigue remained 343 unchanged (43-44%). The incidence of chills jumped from 6% to 28% in the na\u00efve group while 344 participants with hybrid immunity only experienced a two-fold increase (19% to 32%) upon booster 345 vaccination. Suppl. Table 4 provides a summary of the frequency of side effects. When analyzing 346 the data, age had no observable trend for the incidence or severity of reported vaccine 347 reactogenicity. Female participants reported more side effects in most categories when compared 348 to male participants, but this could also be a bias from the side effects respondents' group as most 349 participants are female.

The 352 median duration between 2nd and 3rd vaccine doses was 272 days (range: 155-400). 353 To better capture how vaccine reactogenicity changes between the three vaccine doses 354 and visualize symptom clusters, we performed Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic 355 Mean (UPGMA) clustering based on Jaccard distance with optimal leaf ordering ( Figure 5 ). This 356 ordering showed that, while overall frequencies of side effects appeared comparable between 357 Dose 2 and 3, this does not hold true at the individual participant level. Indeed, some participants 358 with vaccine induced immunity experienced little or no symptoms after the second dose but 359 reported several systemic side effects after the third dose while others had far fewer side effects 360 after the booster vaccination compared to the second dose. 361 Taken together, these real-world data indicate that pre-existing immunity modulates the 362 reactogenicity with additional SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses resulting in more pronounced side 363 effects. Booster vaccine doses produced slightly fewer systemic side effects relative to the second 364 vaccine dose in na\u00efve participants while the opposite is true for those with hybrid immunity. 365 .

Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provided 368 unprecedented challenges but also opportunities to address fundamental questions in human 369 immunology. A large proportion of the human population was exposed \u2014 for the first time and 370 within a very limited time window of the pandemic \u2014 to a new respiratory viral pathogen and to a 371 series of sequential immunizations that included an antigen to which the whole population was 372 naive. 373 We used our extensive longitudinal antibody data with frequent sampling to address several 374 important open questions about SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based immunity. It is often assumed that 375 immunity after vaccination with mRNA vaccines wanes quickly. In some cases, this is based on the 376 observation that vaccine effectiveness decreases over time2. However, declining vaccination 377 effectiveness is impacted not just by waning immune responses, but also by virus evolution13. In 378 other cases, the observation window is limited to the peak response and a brief period, thereafter, 379 producing a linear decay model that does not accurately reflect B-cell biology. Finally, many 380 studies analyze receptor binding domain-focused neutralizing antibodies only but ignore the large 381 number of other epitopes present on the spike protein. Our study design allows us to follow 382 individuals longitudinally from the onset of the pandemic, through primary immunization series and 383 now after booster immunizations providing an invaluable opportunity to comprehensively analyze 384 long-term kinetics of antibody-based immunity ( Figure 1 ). We found that anti-spike antibody 385 kinetics after the primary immunization series follow a pattern that would be expected from basic B- 386 cell biology. After primary vaccination, serum antibodies produced by plasmablasts reach a high 387 peak14. Plasmablast responses are the first line of defense when it comes to B-cells14. These cells 388 proliferate quickly, circulate in the periphery, and produce large amounts of antibodies - but 389 typically disappear within two weeks15,16. The antibodies they produce have a longer half-life (e.g., 390 IgG1 has a half-life of approximately four weeks17), but eventually also wane over the period of 391 weeks to months. This is consistent with the 28-to-34-day half-life of the short-lived component of 392 our PARIS model following the primary vaccination series. However, serum antibody responses 393 then stabilized after the initial few months. The mo re stable long-term seru m antibody response is 394 likely produced by long-lived plasma cells which have in the meantime migrated from lymph nodes 395 into the bone marrow18. Again, the observations in our cohort basically follow textbook B-cell 396 biology. Interestingly, waning kinetics were slower after the booster doses and the level at which 397 titers stabilized became higher after each booster dose. We noted a clear \"ceiling\" effect with 398 respect to the overall peak antibody titers reached. While initial titers after the primary vaccination 399 .

This ceiling seemed to slowly become 401 lower with repeated exposures and booster doses ( Figure 2 ). 402 A key contribution of our study is the development of a robust model suitable for dissecting 403 the biological factors contributing to the durability of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses ( Figure 3 ). 404 Leveraging our extensive longitudinal antibody data, we could identify patterns and associations 405 that shed light on the mechanisms underpinning long-term antibody protection. Our model allows 406 us to interrogate the determinants of antibody dynamics, including prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and 407 vaccine type as well as age. We found that individuals with initial infections followed by vaccination 408 had antibody decay kinetics similar to individuals who were na\u00efve before the primary vaccination 409 series, however their peak titers were higher12, and so was the titer at which their long-term serum 410 antibodies eventually settled. Interestingly, the booster dose acted as an equalizer, bringing the 411 serum antibody to similar levels in the group who was initially infected and the group that was 412 initially na\u00efve. Other factors that influenced antibody titers, including long-term stable titers, were 413 age and vaccine type. As observed in other studies that stated superiority of Moderna mRNA-1273 414 over Pfizer BNT162b2 in terms of induced immune responses or protection19,20, we saw that the 415 Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine induced approximately 1.3-fold higher titers than the Pfizer 416 BNT162b2 vaccine, although differences were only significant in initially na\u00efve individuals. 417 Our study also allowed us to determine infection rates in our cohort. We found that during 418 the pre-Omicron era very few breakthrough infections occurred and only in the previously na\u00efve 419 group ( Figure 4 ). During this time not a single breakthrough infection was detected in the hybrid 420 immune group over the course of 11 months. This changed significantly during the Omicron era 421 when the majority of our participants experienced breakthrough infections over the course of 18 422 months. This observation makes sense since Omicron has a strong escape phenotype and its 423 spike mutations undermine neutralizing antibodies induced by the ancestral or earlier variant 424 spikes1. However, a notable protective effect remained in the hybrid immune group as compared to 425 initially na\u00efve individuals ( Figure 4C ). We also assessed the immune responses to breakthrough 426 infections. When comparing the number of antigen exposures, we found that a breakthrough 427 infection after the primary vaccination series in previously na\u00efve individuals induced antibody titers 428 comparable a third dose of vaccine (booster dose). We found a similar pattern for the fourth 429 exposure (4th vaccine dose versus breakthrough infection after the 3rd vaccine dose). This suggests 430 that these initial breakthrough infections in vaccinated but previously na\u00efve individuals do in fact act 431 similarly to a booster dose in terms of inducing antibody responses. The picture changed in 432 individuals who had an initial infection followed by two or three vaccinations. When comparing 433 .

We speculate that virus replication in these individuals was 436 highly restricted due to their strong pre-existing immunity and that therefore the presence of less 437 antigen leads to a lower induction of immunity. 438 Our longitudinal study setting also allowed us to investigate vaccine reactogenicity as it was 439 experienced after the first, second and third vaccine dose in a longitudinal manner at individual 440 participant level. These data are of great relevance since reactogenicity can increase vaccine 441 hesitancy and reduce uptake. In PARIS, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were generally well 442 tolerated with mild to modest side effects occurring in two thirds of the vaccinees. As reported by 443 us and others12,21, both local and systemic side effects were more common in individuals with 444 hybrid immunity ( Figure 5 ). Our participant level analysis of vaccine reactogenicity reveal the 445 landscape of reactogenicity with several symptom clusters being apparent in the participant group 446 with no infection prior to vaccination. In future studies, we plan on analyzing whether certain 447 pattern of vaccine side effects predict the level of immunogenicity. These real-world data on side 448 effects associated with sequential vaccine doses is important to provide guidance for individuals 449 concerned regarding future immunizations. 450 Our study has several limitations. We were unable to analyze mucosal immune responses 451 which are especially interesting during breakthrough infections. We and other have previously 452 shown that secretory IgA antibodies are not induced or boosted by mRNA vaccination in 453 individuals who were previously na\u00efve but that titers increase in hybrid immune individuals after 454 their first vaccination22,23. We plan, therefore, to conduct similar studies at additional time points in 455 our cohort in the future. Additionally, because our purpose was to analyze serum antibody kinetics, 456 the current study did not measure neutralizing antibody responses since binding antibodies contain 457 all antibodies to the spike and not just antibodies to certain neutralizing epitopes. Similarly, the 458 current study focused on antibodies to the full-length spike rather than RBD. However, since we 459 have observed differential antibody kinetics for spike and RBD24 (which is part of the spike), we 460 plan to measure RBD antibodies in the future. We plan to assess antibody avidity in our 461 longitudinal cohort using different methods as previously described25. Of note, binding antibodies 462 have been tied to protection from severe COVID-19 outcomes in the absence of neutralizing 463 antibodies in a recent study26. Finally, the current study examines reactivity to ancestral spike, and 464 not to later variant spikes or nucleoprotein. Assays utilizing the ance stral spike also detect 465 antibodies induced by variant breakthrough infection and existing bivalent vaccines. Indeed, it has 466 .

We also show that hybrid immunity showed better protection 471 against breakthrough infection in both the pre-Omicron but also the post-Omicron era and we show 472 that breakthrough infections in vaccinated, previously na\u00efve individuals have an effect like a 473 booster dose. These data suggest that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination does induce long lasting 474 spike-specific antibodies consistent with B-cell biology. 475 .

Pre-vaccination 631 timepoints were collected within 10 weeks prior to vaccination while peak post-vaccine timepoints 632 were 1-5 weeks after administration of the vaccine dose (the second dose, in the case of the 633 primary series). The increase in spike-binding antibodies post-vaccination was statistically 634 significant for all recipients (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank). Peak antibody levels post-primary 635 vaccination were approximately 3-fold higher in the hybrid immunity group (p < 0.0001, Mann- 636 Whitney U) compared to the vaccine-only immunity group. After third dose, peak antibody levels 637 were modestly elevated in the vaccination-only immunity group compared to those in the hybrid 638 immunity group (p = 0.023, Mann-Whitney U). Peak antibody levels post-dose 4 are comparable 639 across hybrid immunity and vaccination-only groups (no statistically significant difference, Mann- 640 Whitney U). 641 642 .

Personal Protective Equipment was in high 708 demand and needed to be distributed to essential workers providing high risk services. Health care 709 workers performing a wide array of different jobs (e.g., from housekeeping, students, nurses to 710 medical doctors) fell into this category. 711 The observational longitudinal PARIS Study (Protection Associated with Rapid Immune 712 response to SARS-CoV-2) enrolled adult individuals who worked at the Mount Sinai Health System 713 (MSHS) in New York City in April 2020. Adult family members of MSHS employees were also 714 eligible for participation. The study protocol IRB-20-03374 / STUDY-20-00442 was approved by the 715 Institutional Review Board of the Mount Sinai Hospital. All study participants signed written consent 716 forms prior to providing data or biospecimen. 717 In the first two months of the study, participants were asked to provide saliva samples 718 weekly and to provide a blood sample every two weeks. After the two-month study visit, 719 participants returned monthly for a period of one year, thereafter study visit frequency varied 720 between one and two months. Nasopharyngeal or ante-near swabs were collected when 721 participants reported symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection. Ad hoc study visits were 722 performed in these situations as well as after vaccination. If participants reported testing positive 723 for a viral respiratory infection, details about the diagnostic test performed, symptom onset and 724 disease severity were collected. 725 A total of 501 health care workers were enrolled in PARIS between April 2020 and August 726 2021. Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollout in December of 2020 412/501 participants had been 727 enrolled. Based on serological status at baseline prior to vaccination, 38% of participants had 728 SARS-CoV-2 spike binding IgG antibodies above the limit of detection of an in-house ELISA test. 729 One single participant reported a SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to enrollment into the study but was 730 seronegative at baseline. 731 Of the 501 participants enrolled, one (0.2%) has received four mRNA booster doses (total 732 vaccine doses: 6), 13 (2.6%) have received three mRNA booster doses (total vaccine doses: 5), 83 733 (16.6%) have received two mRNA booster doses (total vaccine doses: 4) and 269 (53.7%) 734 received one booster vaccine dose. 465 participants (93% of the total cohort) have been 735 vaccinated with the remainder of the participants having withdrawn or being lost to follow up since 736 immunization became mandatory for health care workers. Indeed, 36 participants withdrew from 737 the study and their vaccination status is unknown. Of the 465 participants who were vaccinated, 99 738 (21.3%) elected not to receive any booster vaccine dose. Over the three years of the PARIS study, 739 we have documented over 8,000 study visits collecting blood, saliva and/or nasal swabs. 740 .

When participants received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, a survey to 744 collected information about side effects was sent out after the 1st and 2nd dose in the primary 745 immunization series as well as after the 1st booster vaccine dose. 746 After vaccination, surveys were sent to participants to provide data on side effects 747 experienced after dose 1, 2 and 3. The questions for the survey were designed to capture diversity 748 of possible effects broken into two categories: systemic effects and local injection site effects. The 749 symptoms recorded ( Suppl. Table 2) included side effects reported in publications from Pfizer and 750 Moderna about their respective vaccines30,31. 751 Dates by which vaccines became available to health care workers were as follows: Pfizer 752 Moderna) were distributed starting September 754 2022. Three participants received vaccine in the Pfizer Phase 3 vaccine trial. 755 The surveys for the first two doses were released early in 2021 and the booster survey was 756 launched in the fall of 2021. 245 participants completed all three surveys. Participants who did not 757 receive mRNA vaccination as their primary immunization or booster dose were excluded from the 758 analysis as well as participants with known immunomodulatory comorbidities leaving a total 759 complete survey response from 228 participants. For each indicated side effect, branching logic 760 questions were designed to ask about the duration of the side effect and perceived severity. For 761 fever and nausea/vomiting, quantitative ranges were asked. For fever, we asked about the highest 762 temperature known. For nausea/vomiting we asked about the number of times a day the 763 participant felt ill and vomited. The other side effects, if indicated as severe, had follow-up 764 questions to ask if medical care was required. None of the participants who reported a severe side 765 effect required hospitalization for treatment. All survey data was captured using REDCap 766 database system. Severity scoring was tabulated in a REDCap report output (not reported = 0, mild 767 = 1, moderate = 2, severe = 3) per effect per vaccine dose. The dataset for all three doses was 768 combined and subgroups based on infection history pre-vaccine, vaccine type, and gender were 769 created. Percent totals of reported incidence and severity were calculated per subgroup and then 770 compared to understand differences within the PARIS cohorts and observe trends between groups 771 across doses. 772 773 Enzyme-linked 774 well-established ELISA method9,32 in which serum samples are at a single dilution (1:50) 775 .

In the first step, serum samples were screened in a high-throughput assay using the 778 recombinant RBD protein. In brief, 96-well microtitre plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated with 50 l 779 recombinant RBD protein at a concentration of 2 g/ml overnight at 4 /i3\u00b0C. The next day, the plates 780 were washed three times with using an automatic pl ate washer (BioTek). The plates were 782 blocked with 200 l blocking solution consisting of PBS-T with 3% (w/v) milk powder (American 783 Bio) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Serum samples were heated at 56 /i3\u00b0C for 1 /i3h 784 before use to reduce the risk from any potential residual virus in the serum. The blocking solution 785 was taken off the plates and 100 l of the serum samples dilut ed 1:50 in PBS-T containing 1% 786 (w/v) milk powder was added to the respective wells of the microtitre plates. After 2 h, the plates 787 were washed three times with PBS-T and 50 l anti-human IgG (Fab-specific) ed 1:3,000 in PBS-T containing 1% 789 milk powder was added to all wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The microtitre 790 plates were washed three times with PBS-T and 100 l SigmaFast o-phenylenediamine 791 dihydrochloride (Sigma) was added to all wells. The reaction was stopped after 10 min with 50 l 792 per well 3 M hydrochloric acid (Thermo Fisher) and the plates were read at a wavelength of 490 793 nm with a plate reader (BioTek). Serum samples that exceeded an optical density at 490 nm 794 (OD490) cut-off value of 0.15 were categorized as presumptive positive and were tested in a 795 second step in confirmatory ELISAs using the full-length, recombinant spike protein. To perform 796 the confirmatory ELISAs, the plates were coated and blocked as described above except full- 797 length spike protein at a concentration of 2 g/ml was added to the plates. After 1 h, the blocking 798 solution was removed, presumptive positive serum samples that were serially diluted (from 799 1:80/1:100 to 204,800) in 1% milk prepared in PBS-T were added and the plates were incubated 800 for 2 h at room temperature. The remainder of the assay was performed as described above. The 801 cut-off value was set to an OD 490 value of 0.15 and true-positive samples were defined as samples 802 that exceeded an OD 490 value of 0.15 at a 1:80/1:100 serum dilution. The end-point titer was 803 calculated and defined as the last dilution before the signal dropped below an OD 490 of 0.15. The 804 area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated and plotted using Prism 9 software 805 (GraphPad). AUC values >10 were plotted as above the limited of detection in the figures included 806 in this manuscript. 807 808 SARS-CoV-2 variants: Genomic data on the viral variants circulating within the New York City 809 metropolitan area were obtained through the New York City Department of Health and Mental 810 .

The DOHMH maintains a publicly available database updated 811 regularly since the beginning of the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 variant tracking within the database 812 begins on January 1st, 2021, and was updated weekly until May 18th, 2023 (when the COVID-19 813 emergency was declared over in the US). Data on specific viral variants was only available for 814 cases sequenced by and/or shared with the NYC DOHMH. Sequences were not available for all 815 the SARS-CoV-2 positive test cases reported to DOHMH. Certain variants within the NYC data 816 were collapsed into single categories due to the limited size of variant. The following variants were 817 finally the B.1.526 lineages with and without E484K (Iota). 819 820 Statistical Analysis : Statistical testing for paired samples was done using the Wilcoxon signed 821 rank test, with unpaired samples compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The protectiveness of 822 hybrid immunity was evaluated using a log rank test. UPGMA clustering for Figure 5 and all 823 statistical tests were run using Scipy (version 1.11.1) in Python 3.9.15. Curve fitting for 824 Supplemental Figure 3 was done using the statsmodels package (version 0.13.2). All figures 825 were rendered using Matplotlib (3.7.1) and Seaborn (0.12.2). The antibody kinetic model was fit 826 using the NLMixed procedure in SAS9.4, using the trust region optimization technique and the 827 adaptive gaussian quadrature integration method, assuming a normal distribution for the random 828 effects and the dependent variable. 829 830 Non-Linear Mixed models for spike binding antibodies: Data were selected for the post- 831 vaccine model under the following criteria: Timepoints with a discrepancy between the results 832 generated by the research grade SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding ELISA and the Kantaro spike-binding 833 assay performed in the CLIA certified Pathology laboratories of the Mount Sinai Hospital in the top 834 or bottom percentile over the entire dataset were excluded. Participants who did not receive two 835 doses of an mRNA vaccine as well as participants with unknown SARS-CoV-2 infection status prior 836 to immunization were also excluded. Similarly, data from participants without at least two valid 837 timepoints 14 days post-dose 2 were excluded. Samples obtained after subsequent vaccine doses 838 or breakthrough infections were censored. 839 Data were selected for the post-boost model using the following criteria: Participants 840 excluded from the post-vaccine model dataset were also excluded from the post-boost dataset. 841 Participants with a breakthrough infection pre-third dose were excluded. Samples after fourth 842 doses of the vaccine or breakthrough infections were censored. Participants without a minimum of 843 two valid time points at least 14 days post-dose 3 were excluded. 844 .

Unlike clinical treatments, natural immunity has multiple sources of 846 antibody production. Since there are multiple sources of antibody production naturally within the 847 body, single component exponential decay models are insufficient as they will over-predict the 848 change in decay rates. The model used here has two components which are assumed to have 849 distinct decay rates. When reporting aggregate antibody data, the geometric mean is generally 850 used due to a high variability with in and among participants (across multiple orders of magnitudes 851 in the datasets used here). By fitting the model directly within the log-transformed space, the output 852 curve directly estimates the geometric mean rather than the arithmetic mean. 853 854 All models were generated using the NLMIXE D procedure in SAS9.4. This procedure is 855 capable of fitting arbitrary nonlinear functions including both fixed and random effects. The specific 856 model structure used in this case is shown in Supplemental Figure 3B . A two-phase fitting 857 procedure was used. First, a simplified model without random effects was run from a na\u00efve starting 858 point, and the fitted parameter values were used as the initial values for the mixed effects model. In 859 order to account for underlying variability across participants that was not captured by the fixed 860 effects, a random effect was added to each component for the final mixed effect model. In addition 861 to allowing for variability in the overall magnitude of the antibody response, this approach captures 862 observed variability in the kinetics of the response (fold-reduction relative to peak varies among 863 participants). The model was fit independently to datasets for participants with and without pre- 864 vaccine SARS-CoV-2 infection (hybrid immunity) using a feature in SAS to build stratified models. 865 The same model framework was used for both post-vaccine and post-boost models. Data from a 866 post-boost model fit to the combined dataset without accounting for pre-vaccine immune status is 867 also presented, reflecting a close correspondence in post-boost kinetics in both stratified groups. 868 The impact of demographic factors was assessed in the stratified post-vaccine and post- 869 boost models. In all cases, these factors were assessed as a multiplicative factor across the entire 870 time course studied (manifesting on graphs with log-transformed y axes as a y shift). All 871 demographically informed models were constructed iteratively, beginning with a model including all 872 factors considered (age, gender, race, ethnicity, and primary vaccine type). After each model fitting 873 run, the factor with the highest assessed p value was removed if that p value did not meet a 874 relaxed threshold for statistical significance (p < 0.1). The model was then re-run with the reduced 875 set of fixed effects and finalized when all factors hit this relaxed threshold. This stepwise 876 subtractive modeling practice helps to account for confounding factors and avoids double 877 controlling for effects that alte r the result through the same mechanism.
