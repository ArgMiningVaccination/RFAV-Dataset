It was in her field biology class where Andrea had the opportunity to become a certified Naturalist after learning about the native flora and fauna of Tongva land also known as Los Angeles. This opened a whole new world of understanding between our health and connecting to mother nature. It wasn't again until the lockdown where she found reassurance that deepening our connection to mother nature was truly important and finally mustered the courage to invite others to reconnect with the land and its creatures.
