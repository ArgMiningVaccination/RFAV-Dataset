It is argued that non-indigenous people in the region possess a tourist gaze that creates a distance (spatial and temporal) between cosmopolitan and local practices that lead them to view local medicines as exotic knowledge. The Museum of Maya Medicinedescribed in this article demonstrates how, through this same tourist gaze, localmedicines are conned into a secure space and tied to another time. I discuss how, while cosmopolitan medicine's practitioners and 'tourists' recreate local medicines in the museum as something culturally authentic, local medicines are,in contrast, characterized by their hybridity.Keywords /H18546authenticity /H18546Chiapas /H18546local medicines /H18546Museum of Maya Medicine /H18546nostalgia In this article I describe some of the causes for and the consequences of the transformations that local medicines have undergone during the lastdecade in Highland Chiapas. 1Partly as a result of the presence of outsiders (including tourists) in San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, local healers and bureau-cratic agencies (governmental and NGOs) have produced new represen-tations of local medicines. This article is partly about ways of looking at an image: that of 'indigenous', 'traditional' medicine, and, at the same time, it is partly about the (re)creation of images, their interplay, and the effectsthey have upon those whose images are produced, and those who produceand consume images of local medicines in Chiapas. San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas in particular, and the Highlands of Chiapas in general, have become a very important tourist destination along theMaya Route. This is true both for tourists looking for quaint villages, col- orful costumes and exotic customs, as well as for the politically motivated pilgrims, such as those attracted by the 'Indian' rebellion under way in theregion since 1994. 2The latter are often seen wandering around in San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas. They prefer to call themselves travelers (Van DenBerghe, 1994) and partake in trips to those indigenous communities whereArticle Vol 20(2) 173-190 [0308-275X(200006)20:2; 173-190;012649] Copyright 2000 \u00a9 Delhi) 06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 173Zapatista rebels are in majority. These trips are locally known as 'Zapa- tours'. Both types of tourist share a romantic approach to travel. Not yetpost-tourists, they are travelers engaged in post-Fordist consumption of rep-resentations locally produced, often times (whether they are aware of it or not) for their own benet. 3They do not belong with the modern, collec- tive form of mass tourist consumption, but, most often, nd their kind with those engaged in the nostalgic search for the lost community, for solidarity with and from other people, and for harmony with nature. They are roman- tic travelers engaged in a quest for the authentic (Kaplan, 1996; Urry, 1990,1995). And authenticity they may nd in the highlands of Chiapas. In global culture it is becoming rare to nd an individual who does not possess what Urry (1990: 2) calls the tourist gaze: an experience partlydened by the notion of departure; by a separation from everyday experi-ence. Thus, a bureaucrat who travels to the Highlands of Chiapas and visits a small hamlet ( paraje) may also experience, in addition to a sense of removal from her own place of residence, a form of time-traveling. There they are: indigenous people dressed in 'traditional' costumes and engaged in age-old, pre-Colombian practices. Many visitors/tourists to these com- munities, anthropologists included, are all too willing to see in local prac-tices ties to a pre-Hispanic past. The cargo system and so-called traditional medicines are often seen as having continuity with practices developed locally and uncontaminated by the different groups that have arrived in theregion (Europeans, Africans and other indigenous groups). 4The mere recognition of some mild form of hybridity in local practices is considered politically incorrect, a breach in the sense of what Herzfeld has dened as cultural intimacy . Herzfeld (1995: 3) calls cultural intimacy: . . . the recognition of those aspects of a cultural identity that are considered a source of external embarrassment but that nevertheless provide insiders with their assurance of common sociality, the familiarity with the bases of power thatmay at one moment assure the disenfranchised a degree of creative irreverenceand at the next moment reinforce the effectiveness of intimidation. Here, local medicines that privilege prayers and offerings to saints continue to hold value for the afflicted. However, in the institutionalized, bureau- cratic local medicine which can be found in local organizations of indigen-ous healers, these practices are concealed behind less 'irrational' ones, or displayed as part of a heritage that we must not forget, but should be con- ned within museums. In this article I describe two strategies that serve to secure the local sense of cultural intimacy: the establishment of the parameters which legit-imize local 'indigenous' medicines, and the institutionalized connementof religious medical practice to the museum. There is, among indigenouspeople afliated with the local organizations of healers and their non- indigenous consultants, the need to identify some continuity between the174 Critique of Anthropology 20(2)06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 174medicine practiced within the organization and the medicine of the ances- tors. This continuity is recognized through the enactment, somewhat for- malized, of a set of parameters that dene who among the healers is truly ('authentically') indigenous, and who is not. Second, although religiouslybased forms of healing are considered 'traditional' regional practices, years of disqualication have led to the denial of their importance within bureau- cratized medical regimes. 5Today, 'traditional' practices are partially con- cealed as embarrassing customs that undermine the sense of local culturalintimacy. More recently, these shamanistic types of healing have achieved some recognition, but, as I discuss below, they are now conned within certain spaces and times. In the following sections of this article I will provide a brief description of three different forms of local medicines that I have observed amongTojolabal-, Tzeltal- and Tzotzil-speaking groups in the Highland region ofChiapas. 6Then I will describe the criteria used to include local healers within the organization. I discuss how these criteria are related to a nostal-gic view of indigenous life that leads to the constitution of a simulacrum ofthe indigenous community. Then I describe the connement of religiouslybased medicine in the museum and discuss the implications that this action has on the creation of hyper-real healers. I end the article with a discussion about how the (re)creation of those images of local medicines can poten-tially undermine the legitimacy and recognition that local healers seek. Local medicines in Chiapas In the Highland region of Chiapas there is a great variety of medical prac-tices in competition for consumers of medical attention. San Crist\u00f3bal delas Casas is the main town in the region and hosts federally funded and private cosmopolitan clinics. A number of cosmopolitan healers have private ofces in town. Some hold degrees as general practitioners andothers are medical specialists (allergists, orthopedists, ophthalmologists, gynecologists, cardiologists and dentists). There are alternative forms of healing which have gained some degree of recognition from cosmopolitanmedicine: acupuncture, Yoga and meditation, massage, non-local herbalisttreatments, naturopathic medicine, homeopathy, certied midwifery and chiropractice. There are also support groups such as Alcoholics Anony- mous and Neurotics Anonymous. To visit the outskirts of town is to nd oneself in districts where the majority is either poor or migrants from indigenous communities. In barrios, where the poor move more freely, one can nd other types of healers. Someof them are mestizo men and women who can cure the evil eye, who can feel the sick person's pulse, detect and undo witchcraft. Others are individualswho, although they are unlikely to acknowledge it themselves, are perceivedby many as having the power to perform witchcraft. These are healers who175 Ayora-Diaz: Local Medicines of Chiapas06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) Page 175provide attention to both urban Ladinos and indigenous people from differ- ent ethnic groups. There are also some Tzeltal- and Tzotzil-speaking healers who, because of economic or political circumstances within their com-munities of origin, chose or were forced to abandon their hamlets and seek a living in San Crist\u00f3bal. 7 There is also an Organization of Indigenous Healers in San Crist\u00f3bal. Its existence was only possible after the shift in policies regarding theindigenous people of Mexico. Since the beginning of the 1980s the Insti- tuto Nacional Indigenista (INI, Indianist National Institute) accorded local medicines some degree of ofcial recognition. The Mexican government moved toward the acknowledgment of both the existence of a multicultural society and, less openly, of its own inability to provide medical attention for all Mexicans. Different organizations of local healers were created in differ-ent villages in the Highlands of Chiapas. Some died out, and some survived with greater or lesser nancial success. 8This shift in policies granted legit- imacy to non-cosmopolitan medical practices. In consequence, one does not need today to justify or to hide one's own medical preferences (Ayora- Diaz, 1998). An effect of the current heterogeneity in medical choices is that out- siders feel compelled to classify local medicines according to their per- ceived degree of authenticity. When I was conducting research in San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, I once showed interest in visiting the Tojolabal region to see how local medicine was practiced and understood there. Ageneral practitioner, who is a consultant for the town's organization of indigenous healers, sought to discourage me: 'It is not worth the trip. Those healers are not really traditional', he said. I asked why he thought so, andhe replied that 'Tojolabal healers are mixing their traditional remedies with patent drugs.' Instead of discouraging me, this made me more interested. Some months later, I learned that one of the federally funded hospitals inthe city of Comit\u00e1n had three Tojolabal-speaking healers in residence andthey were offering medical care to Tojolabal patients. I began traveling back and forth between San Crist\u00f3bal and Comit\u00e1n. These Tojolabal-speaking healers, when I arrived there, were located in a marginal part of the hospital. The room where they provided attention totheir patients had cracks in the walls, the paint was falling off, and unusable furniture was stored in the corners. The room was divided in two by anincomplete wall of wood and the door was closed with a piece of cloth. The unpleasantness of the physical environment was further aggravated by the fact that cosmopolitan healers in the hospital openly derided the Tojolabalhealers, openly calling them witches ( brujos), and making unfavorable com- ments about their presence in the hospital. Seeking respect, the Tojolabal healers, in attempting to improve their image, began wearing white coats and requested, and obtained, from the director of the hospital stethoscopesthat they wore around their necks. Their attempts, as they put it, 'to regain their dignity' within a hostile environment backred and only increased the176 Critique of Anthropology 20(2)06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 176level of ridicule and triggered demands to have them, if not expelled from the hospital, at least conned to a space where they could not be mistaken for 'real' doctors. In practice, at the hospital a Tojolabal healer rst conducts a diagnostic procedure that consists of taking the patient's pulse in the wrists, the elbowsand both temporal parts of the skull. (Outside this setting, the healer placesthe tips of his or her ngers in those body parts and 'feels how the patient's blood speaks to the [healer's] heart'; in the hospital, a healer often takes the pulse by placing the stethoscope in the parts already mentioned.) After thediagnosis the healer goes on to perform limpias (cleansing ceremonies) which are meant to establish the cause of the disease and to transfer the disease from the afflicted body to an animal or to the leaves of plants. To do this the healer passes an egg over the head, the back and the torso, the armsand legs of the patient, placing more emphasis on the body part that the patient has identied as affected by a disease. Breaking the egg into a glass of water, the healer establishes whether it is a 'natural' disease, or is causedby witchcraft. Then the healer prays to God and the saints placed on his altar, 9lights candles, burns copal (a local resin used as incense) and continues with the cleansing using sometimes a chicken, sometimes a cat, and if the disease is a 'powerful' one, a frog. At the end of the ceremony, the healerprescribes some herbal remedies, and pharmacy drugs. If the disease is bad enough, and the patient needs a longer (and stronger) treatment, the Tojo- labal healer proceeds to prescribe 'very expensive drugs, such as monkeyblood and donkey blood' and informs the patient and his or her relatives that someone has to be called to bring the medicine from Guatemala. Then it is announced that the cost of the treatment will be around 2500 pesos(about US$300, that is, about 100 days of minimum wage in the region). Then the patient is asked to return for two more cleansing ceremonies. The Tzeltal-speaking healers in Tenejapa, on their part, base their healing on prayers, the burning of candles and incense, and offerings to God and his saints. Not all Tzeltal healers know how to take the pulse. Some have a more limited knowledge and are less efcacious (i.e. in spite of their prayers and offerings the patients do not get well). In the eyes of some localpeople, this limitation may be an indication that the self-proclaimed healer is a quack. A Tzeltal man once told me that, because they have all listened to prayers and invocations since their childhood, anyone can learn them ifan effort is put into it. However, a false healer will prove to be ineffective because he or she has not received the gift from God. Tzeltal healers in Tenejapa use very few herbal remedies, nor do they perform cleansing cer-emonies on their patients as these are, I was told, used only in mestizo medi- cine. To my questions as to what herbal remedies they know, they replied that, although they know a few medicinal herbs, it is the mestizos who rely on herbal remedies. For their own healing ceremonies they rely on prayers and offerings which facilitate God's intervention in favor of the diseased. The Organization of Indigenous Healers based in San Crist\u00f3bal de las177 Ayora-Diaz: Local Page 177Casas near the Barrio de la Hormiga . This is a settlement on the outskirts of the city where the majority of residents are Tzotzil- speakers and have been expelled from their own communities under thecharge of professing evangelical religions. The organization itself is domi- nated by Tzotzil healers and its executive committee is constituted by three Tzotzil men and two Tzotzil women, all of whom are J'iloletik, a shaman-type of healer (sing. J'ilol). 10However, as soon as one enters the main building, where the healers and the cosmopolitan healers who act as their consul-tants have their ofces, one can see the walls decorated with photographsof medicinal plants and, placed below, the names of the plants in Tzotzil,Spanish and Latin. The site of the organization has an exhibition garden of medicinal plants and a garden where Tzotzil-speaking healers grow plants which arelater transformed into pills, capsules, syrups and skin lotions for sale. In conversations with the current president of the board, he repeatedly told me that he knows a great deal about medicinal plants. He said that helearned about these plants from his grandparents, who had in turn learned about them as a result of 'their close contact with nature'. Several times, he and the consultants have proudly showed me a small book of local medici-nal plants with abundant color photographs, a product of their collabor-ation with the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS). Everything in the site displays the prominence of herbal medicine. The exception is a small museum of traditional medicine that I will addressbelow. During 1996 and 1997, when I asked about religiously influenced healing ceremonies, the director of the executive committee told me that there is a small building in the back of the place where they conduct, uponrequest, cures based on prayers, candle and incense-burning, and cleans- ing ceremonies. A general practitioner, who acts as a consultant to the organization, acknowledged this practice and suggested that he and theother consultants have to tolerate it. This relationship with shamanisticcuring is slowly changing, but there is as yet no full recognition of its import- ance in the hierarchy of local medicines. Local healers are slowly gaining more control of the management of their own public image, but not as yetenough power to disclose publicly the importance of their own religiously based medical knowledge and practice. In the next section I will describe the parameters established by this organization for recognizing 'indigenous' healers. I suggest an explanationfor the uneasy response of this consultant to the practice of shaman-like healing. I show how this staged characterization of local medicines is basedon, and helps to recreate, a simulacrum of the indigenous community. Nostalgia and the parameters of local medicines Although cosmopolitan healers still hold some control over the publicimage that the Organization of Indigenous Healers projects, their power to178 Critique of Anthropology 20(2)06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 178dene the direction in which the organization must move is somewhat limited by the interests and actions of the local healers themselves. Cosmo- politan healers have the legitimacy to provide 'rational' justications for theexistence of the organization, and this is a good reason for local healers to accept their continuous presence within it. In spite of the imaginary that frames cosmopolitan healers' desires for the re-creation of an egalitarianindigenous community, the fact that the executive committee is made up of ve J'iloletik has progressively gained recognition for shaman-like healing practices within the organization. 11Recently, shortly after the inauguration of the Museum of Traditional Medicine in San Crist\u00f3bal, on 28 November 1997, one could nd in local travel agencies a leaflet advertising the Centro Regional de Desarrollo de la Medicina Maya (Regional Center for the Develop- ment of Mayan Medicine) as it is now called. The leaflet announces thecomprehensiveness of the organization: pulse-takers, 12Further, the leaflet states: We, the indigenous [people], have always had our own ways to prevent and heal our people's diseases. Like our ancestors, we heal through prayers, using plants, candles, stones, incense and trago, [alcoholic] drinks. Our rst grandfathers taught their children and they to their own, until we received this know- ledge. . . . We are in charge of our communities' health care. This self-representation speaks of what Herzfeld (1995) has called 'iconic- ity', a sense of continuity between present cultural forms and an ancestralpast. I do not attempt to question here this sense of ties to the past. Neither do I wish to expose the elements of a structural nostalgia (Herzfeld, 1995) which seem to be present in the narrative printed in that leaflet. However,it is my contention that this self-representation, furthered by local healers, is linked to a set of representations which are re/produced by the consul- tants and which betray another form of nostalgia: the romantic nostalgiathat characterizes the tourist gaze and longs for the 'traditional' indigen- ous community and the harmony between indigenous culture and nature. The same leaflet has, in a small box, the following statement: 'From theencounter of men [sic] with plants, animals and minerals emerged theknowledges that have given life to Mayan medicine.' As Stewart (1988: 227) points out: [N]ostalgia takes on the generalized function to provide some kind (any kind) of cultural form. In positing a 'once was' in relation to a 'now' it creates a framefor meaning, a means for dramatizing aspects of an increasingly fluid and unnamed social life. Nostalgia is an essential, narrative, function of language that orders events temporarily and dramatizes them . . . in that 'threaten to erupt at any moment.' The ladinos or mestizos working for the organization have recreated an imaginary which is based on a romantic, nostalgic view of indigenous life.13 They have appointed themselves as the guardians of the local sense of cul- tural intimacy and of the constructed iconicity of local medicines. Let me illustrate this point. One morning, during the year of 1996, I was at the179 Ayora-Diaz: Local Medicines of Chiapas06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 179ofce of one of the consultants within the organization's headquarters. I was having a conversation on the development of the museum, then under construction. A man from a Tzeltal community entered the room and saidthat he was there to request some information. He asked how could he, a 'traditional' healer, join the organization and whether he would be paid, and how much, if he did. My friend replied that no healer can join theorganization by him- (or her-) self. He needed to return to his community and le a request with the village authorities for the community to join the organization. In the request form it could be established that he had been selected as the traditional healer for the community. Then, the communityhad to designate a piece of communal land for the planting of a garden of medicinal plants. He, as their healer, and other community members would have to ensure the continuous production of medicinal plants. The organiz-ation would pay him nothing as it is not within its mandate to support the healers economically. His community would have to support him with pay- ments in cash or kind. The man left, apparently confused and disappointed. My friend then told me that many self-proclaimed healers come to the organization believ-ing that they can obtain a salary from the government. He insisted that itwas necessary that the community as a whole, not necessarily the wholevillage, but at least a barrio, or a hamlet, le the request. In this way they could make sure that the healer was acknowledged by the community, thatthere would be a garden of medicinal plants, and that the newcominghealer would not be proting from the patients and the organization. What community is this consultant imagining? The criteria for admis- sion are the following: rst, there must be a community of which the healer is a member; second, in this community, agreements are reached by con- sensus; third, the ownership of land is communal and once the community reaches a consensus, land can be allocated for the cultivation of medicinalplants without fear of conflicts among members of the community; fourth,in spite of the fact that the local economy has been monetized for several decades now, and that individuals may need an income, a true 'indigenous' healer, in contrast to cosmopolitan healers, should not be interested in the economic benets of a specialized praxis but, rather, should be rst and foremost interested in the welfare of his fellow villagers; fth and nally, local medical specialists must give most importance to herbal treatments(hence the need for a garden of medicinal plants in order to be healer in a community member to the organization). These imagined relationships among healers, community and nature disregard many events and pro-cesses that have taken place in the region. Cancian (1992) has described, for example, how changes brought on by the process of modernization and the local influence of national politi-cal parties and transnational churches have led to a 'decline of community'which, among other things, has resulted in decreased participation in the local cargo system. Churches themselves have been very influential in the180 Critique of Anthropology 20(2)06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 180replacement of local by cosmopolitan medicine (Harman, 1974). Thus, evangelical churches have made self-nominated 'traditionalists' feel their traditions and local interests threatened by an alien world-view. As a result,many families have been expelled from Indian communities on the charge of having converted to Protestantism over the last two decades (Estrada Mart\u00ednez, 1995; Perez Enr\u00edquez, 1989; culture encompasses the 'explosion' of communi- ties where diverse social movements emerge along religious, political, land tenure and gender lines (Collier, 1995; Hern\u00e1ndez Castillo, 1995; Nash,1995a, 1995b). Communities ( in the sense imagined by those related to the organization) are now fractured and groups tend to cluster around specic interests, (re)producing simulacra of communities. 14 One of the Tojolabal healers who was working at the Comit\u00e1n Hospital once told me that he had been trained to become a better 'indigenous'healer (called capacitaci\u00f3n in Mexico, a term that disqualies the knowledge that the subject possessed previous to the training course). He was partly trained at a center for 'traditional medicine' in the state of Puebla and partly in San Crist\u00f3bal. When he was trained in San Crist\u00f3bal, he unsuccessfully tried to get 'his' community into the organization of local healers. He foundthat other healers objected to his attempts to practice 'traditional' medicine,as his community fellows accused him of trying to get rich at the expense of others. His request to get land for the garden of medicinal plants met resist- ance as other villagers accused him of attempting to use a common resourceto grow plants that he would sell for a prot to the same people who had provided the land. Working at the hospital, he still longs for a garden for medicinal plants as the director of the hospital has warned him that theTojolabal healers may have to take a test to nd out whether they are effec- tive healers. Part of what the cosmopolitan healers from the hospital expect from these local healers is that they will have an extensive knowledge of med-icinal plants and will be able to transform herbs into capsules, gels and otherformats common in pharmacy drugs. What cosmopolitan healers expect from local healers is that they should conform to the standards of rationality which have validated herbaltreatments developed and studied within the organization of indigenous healers in San Crist\u00f3bal. However, as I have described, Tzeltal-speaking healers resort in a limited way to herbal remedies, and when the Tojolabalhealers use them, they subordinate their use to the cleansing ceremonies and prayers. The organization's insistence on their use is based on the imag- ined harmonic relationship between indigenous people and nature. Thisdesire frames the discourse of the Tzotzil healer, president of the organiz-ation's executive committee, who stressed in each conversation we had that his grandparents had learned the use of medicinal plants from their close contact with nature and that he learned the use of these plants from them.In contrast, local healers outside the organization have insisted to me that they learn about effective herbs mainly through their dreams (i.e. through181 Ayora-Diaz: Local Medicines of Chiapas06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 181revelation). In fact, the president of the organization also claims to have received most of his knowledge in his dreams. As indigenous healers gain this knowledge in their dreams, when someone comes to see them with anaffliction they had not dealt with previously, they must dream of the treat- ment before prescribing it. When I have asked healers outside the organiz- ation whether one can learn local medicine, they have answered that if onewants to learn, one has to go to a medical school. Local medicines are a gift from God; not something one can learn from anyone. For the cosmopolitan healers associated with the organization, as well as for the Tzotzil healers who lead it, it is the community - an egalitarian society, where the healer does not try to obtain nancial gain, where all agree to provide land for medicinal gardens - which decides who is (or are) the best suited healers. I would suggest that the main reason why theorganization has attempted to conceal the presence of J'iloletik is that these have been described in the literature as individuals who tend to accumu-late power within their own society and who control the actions of othervillagers (Fabrega 1966). J'iloletik' s accumulation of power questions the nostalgic longing that the organization's consultants have for an egalitarian community. 15 It is this longing for the authentic natural community that is leading to the constitution of simulacra of the community (Baudrillard, 1994). Thatis, in a region where, for many reasons, communities have become increas-ingly fragmented or have disappeared, local medicine, institutionalized and bureaucratized, strives to re-create them from a model of a vanished past, authentic indigenous community. As the criteria for membership of theorganization spring from this nostalgic notion of community, local healers have to devise strategies to make themselves eligible for membership. The Tojolabal-speaking healers at the Comit\u00e1n hospital were clear thatafliation with the organization would provide great benets. As thisorganization receives funding from both the Mexican government and international agencies, healers who are members have been legitimized as 'true' indigenous healers. In turn, they have set the standards for recog-nition of other healers and they legitimize or refuse recognition to other local healers when ofcially requested - as would be the case for the Tojo- labal-speaking healers. These Tojolabal healers have abandoned their com-munities of origin for different reasons. In the hospital they provide attention to Tojolabal patients who may be living in the city of Comit\u00e1n or in different hamlets, ejidos and ranches in the region. The Tojolabal healers are aware that their standing in the eyes of the hospital's administration would improve if they could get recognition from and membership in the San Crist\u00f3bal organization. Furthermore, they could receive training to transform their herbal remedies into pharma-ceutical formats, and further improve their position vis-a-vis the hospital. However, they no longer have an identiable community from which to182 Critique of Anthropology 20(2)06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 182receive backing for their application. Thus they are now trying to convince patients from many different places of residence to sign their petition so as to help them become members of the organization. If they prove success-ful the organization will have a community member which will have moved away, signicantly, from that community desired and longed for by the cre- ators of the organization. The museum of the dying past and the temple of (modern) 'traditional' medicine In November 1997, with the help of funding from European organizations and the State of Chiapas government, the Organization of IndigenousHealers inaugurated the Regional Center for the Development of Maya Medicine. This was a rare display of the site to the public eye. Different ofcials of the State of Chiapas' government and the Health Ministry senttheir representatives to the event. The ofcials were busy with other choresand thus unable to attend the ceremony in person. Some members of the executive board took turns at the microphone, some speaking in Tztozil, some in Spanish. The bureaucrats sitting at the table seemed not to paymuch attention. At one side of the podium an ofcial spent most of the time during the speeches on his cellular phone. Besides the healers and a small number of indigenous people, most of the attendees were socialresearchers, NGO members and other curious people mainly from Mexico City and other metropolitan areas. 16 At the site's entrance a building has now opened to the visitors. This is the new Museum of Maya Medicine. The building is divided into several rooms. A wall painted to depict the main church in Chamula, dedicated to Saint John, the patron of the village, frames the main entrance to the museum. On the inauguration day I, along with the other visitors, entereda dark room where juncia (pine needles) had been spread on the floor. Several rows of church seats give the room the appearance of a 'real'church. There is, in the room's front, a saint in a niche. The light of severalcandles burning at its feet illuminates this saint. Under the niche, there are mannequins representing in a highly realistic format a group of Tzotzil people praying for someone's health. A recording played through hiddenspeakers furthers the impression of witnessing a 'real' prayer. The impres-sion is so strong that visitors immediately lower their voices showing respect for the 'traditional' practice of asking the saints for the health of a relative. The next room has a cross, regionally held to be typical of Chamula, in themiddle. There is juncia on the floor. The recording reproduces the noises of the night: crickets and other nocturnal animals provide the ambientsound. In front of the cross, a mannequin kneels, portraying a man invok-ing an ancestor's favor. A painting on a wall depicts a rustic house on a hill and enhances the effect of being in the eld, witnessing a man performing183 Ayora-Diaz: Local Medicines of Chiapas06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) Page 183a not fully, or not 'really', Christian ritual. In another room the mannequins in a corner represent a midwife attending childbirth with a woman kneel- ing supported by a man, surely her husband. In another room, one can seesome mannequins representing the manufacture of candles of different color that are used in healing rituals. All of these representations are extremely realistic. There is a sense of hyper-reality in the rooms: 'Indians'in poses that they are supposed to adopt in order to be recognized as 'tra- ditional' people; recreations of the authentic 'Indian' for the benet of the tourist gaze; nostalgic invocations of a time already gone; dying culture thatneeds to be preserved in a museum to prevent people from forgetting thatthis used to be their culture. 17 The passage that leads to the exit is the entrance into current, modern 'traditional' medicine. Hanging from the walls in the room there is a rowof drawings that starts with the arrival of Europeans on the continent and ends with the Zapatista rebellion. A Ladino man who denes himself as a person sympathetic to the Indians drew these images. His paintings depicthis (our?) guilt for being a member of a social group that several hundreds of years ago transformed local cultures and end in a glorication of the Zap- atistas as the movement that will allow local cultures to re-emerge. Connected to this room is another small room where one can nd a number of herbal remedies in display cases. Outside the exit door is a demonstration garden of medicinal plants. The plants are classied and small wooden plaques announce their names. I was informed that thegarden where the medicinal plants are cultivated for their commercial use is at the back of the site. As Casta\u00f1eda (1996: 122) suggests, the museum can be seen as a helpful mechanism in the art of memory: The rhetorical, occult, and rational arts of memory inhabit the museum as its inspiration and principles. . . . The art of memory describes the logic and practices of individual rhetors, orators, readers and visitors of an architecture of memory, whether predominantly mental or physical. . . . [M]emory is rede-posited in and recalled from loci that are themselves reinscribed and rereadsuch that both the permanence (repetition) and novelty (alterity), the indi- vidual and collective, as well as the presupposed and contested facets of memory-knowledge, can be comprehended. The visitor has left past culture and now faces authentic 'modern tra- ditional' medicine. One sees local healers who now privilege the rationaluse of remedies which have a pharmacological effect that can be proven bylab tests. 18Local herbal medicine is resignied within the scientic para- digm and understood as a local rational form of medicine close to some ofthe principles of cosmopolitan medicine far more advanced and 'modern'than shaman-like practices. The effect of this museum is to x religiously based healing practices in the past and conne them to a dark, closed space where they do notthreaten the 'rational' world. The contrast with herbal medicine enhances the power of cosmopolitan medicine and its kin. The past lies behind our184 Critique of Anthropology 20(2)06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 184backs and the present faces the future of local medicines: their progressive modernization and incorporation into the secular world. We gaze upon hyper-real healers within a simulacrum of community and tradition. Discussion There are contrary efforts in the struggle for the recognition of local medi-cines. On the one hand, cosmopolitan healers and other non-indigenouspeople have developed this distanced gaze, the non-localized tourist gazeof the individual displaced from home who lives allochronically in relation to local cultures. The gaze is pervaded by a nostalgic, romantic construc- tion of indigenous culture. Some, consultants for ofcial organizations,help to construct and produce representations of local medicines that privi- lege herbal medicines because they are perceived as possessing a higher degree of rationality (Ayora-Diaz, 1998). The medicine of J'iloletik and its representations is admitted within the conning walls of the museum. Ifunconned, it could threaten the rational world outside the museum. It is better to banish it to obscure rooms and to the past. Others - outsiders, travelers, pilgrims, local mestizos - are there to consume the exotic, seeking utopian communities and others' authenticityto compensate for the loss of their own. Both contribute to the creation of the simulacra of indigenous communities and hyper-real healers. However,their gaze transforms and inverts the local hierarchy of medicine. By recog- nizing the 'rationality' of herbal medicines, they question what local cul- tures dene as the main attribute of their own medical system, the gift thatGod bestows upon healers and the power they have to intercede betweenthe diseased and God. Herbal medicine, as institutionalized and bureau- cratized in the local organization, is marked by the commodication of medicinal products. On the other hand, local healers seek to preserve their local hierarchies and, at the same time, to provide satisfaction to the 'tourists' who fund theirprojects and provide legitimacy to their existence in the modern Mexicannation-state. They produce representations and herbal medicines to be consumed by romantic travelers, and attempt to preserve their own medical tradition. However, this tradition involves change and continuoushybridization. Local healers are usually willing to accept new developmentsfrom other medicines. Even Tzeltal healers, who privilege spiritual prac- tices, include a few herbal remedies and (why not?) prod- ucts. As one Tzeltal healer told me: 'When I am ill, I make offerings to God,I pray, and I go to the clinic. It is better for me to combine the medicines as together they heal me sooner than any of them by itself.' Authenticity and purity in knowledge and practice is more of a quest for tourists/travelers than for local people (Handler and Saxton, 1988; Urry,1990, 1995). Hybridity is the form of the local. However, in the interaction185 Ayora-Diaz: Local Medicines of Chiapas06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 cultures, in post-industrial, post-Fordist, postmodern societies, the authentic has become an object of consumption. Individuals who have lost their own communities long for communitieswhere pure forms can be found. Local people nd themselves compelled to objectify segments of their culture for the consumption of travelers in order to maintain their own mechanisms of hybridization. Notes A rst draft of this article was presented at the Society for Applied Anthropology Annual Meetings in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in April 1998. A revised version was presented at the internal research seminar in CIESAS Sureste, San Crist\u00f3bal de lasCasas. The present version has proted from extensive comments made by John Haviland, Ronald Nigh and Gabriela Vargas-Cetina. Stephen Nugent has read and commented on this article too. I sincerely thank him for his encouragement toimprove it. None of the above is, of course, responsible for the ideas expressed here.Fieldwork was made possible through a research grant from CONACyT from January 1997. 1 In my work I prefer to draw the contrast between local and cosmopolitan medicine. Robertson (1990, 1992, 1995) has suggested that cultural globaliz-ation must be understood as the simultaneous processes of homogenization and heterogenization which make cosmopolitan and local cultural formssometimes converge and sometimes diverge. In this sense, I believe that allmedicines are hybrid constructions, and that the issue of their degree of auth- enticity is a subject that deserves close attention (Ayora-Diaz, 1998). I prefer to avoid using, other than when I echo other discourses, allochronizing and orien-talizing distinctions (Fabian, 1983; Said, 1978) such as those between 'modern'and 'traditional', or 'Western' and 'non-Western' medicines, or other logically inconsistent oppositions with local currency such as that between 'allopathic' and 'traditional' medicines. 2 San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas (San Crist\u00f3bal, for short) has been for some time now one of the places of choice for foreigners and Mexicans looking for exotic places to visit or to live in. San Crist\u00f3bal possesses a quaint colonial architec- ture and has a traditional market of handicrafts where visitors enjoy thecolorful picture of exotic peoples involved in traditional market practices. My reference to these outsiders as tourists attempts to convey the experience of distance (in time and in place) that even long-term residents have regardinglocal culture. Thus, this is not an article about tourists but rather about theexperience of foreignness that outsiders seek in San Crist\u00f3bal, and the (sometimes) instrumental use of these representations that local people do in order to obtain greater social, economic and political benets. 3 According to Urry (1990), post-tourists are those individuals who adopt a reflexive and ironic stance toward their own performance as tourists. This does not seem to be the case for most politically oriented travelers in Chiapas, who share romantic notions about Indianness, nature, the rebellion, or all three. 4 Since I arrived in Chiapas, in July 1993, I have had conversations with local social researchers. Some have argued that the cargo system is indigenous to the region, that the cold-hot dichotomy present in some forms of local medicine is a Mesoamerican construction, and that the use of images of saints in healing186 Critique of Anthropology 20(2)06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 186ceremonies masks the fact that indigenous people are 'really' praying to pre- Hispanic deities. As cargo systems developed in the Mediterranean (BazarteMart\u00ednez, 1989; Behar, 1986; Brown, 1981; Magliocco, 1993), hot-colddichotomies have been found in much of Europe (Foster, 1994), and prayers are associated with religions of Middle Eastern origin (Judaic, Christian and Islamic) I nd these arguments uninformed. See also Hervik's (1998) criticalappraisal of the discourse about cultural continuity among the Yucatec Maya. 5 The consolidation and universalizing of these parameters is one of the reasons why I refer to the medicine these healers project outside the organization asbureaucratized. 6 My description aims at providing a simple picture of these medical systems. More complex accounts of the medicine practiced among Tzotzil- and Tzeltal- speaking groups can be found in the work by Fabrega and Silver (1973), Holland (1963) and Harman (1974). Michele Day is currently working on herPhD dissertation about present-day Tzeltal medicine. Campos (1983) and Ruz (1983) have also provided brief descriptions of Tojolabal medical practices. 7 Since the study on the municipality of Chamula by Pozas (1959) who reported that Chamulas were expelling unorthodox members of their communities, many sources have recorded politically, religiously and economically motivated expulsions of indigenes from their own communities Hern\u00e1ndez, 1997). 8 Kohler (1975) provides an account of the efforts, from the 1950s to the 1970s, to eliminate local medicines during the attempt by the Mexican state and the Indianist National Institute (INI), to assimilate indigenous people into the modern nation state. Freyermuth Enciso (1993), in turn, provides an extensiveaccount of the shift in policies by the Indianist National Institute as well as adescription of the different organizations of local healers with which INI and the government experimented. 9 These and other healers in the Highlands have explained to me that God is the only one who can heal the sick people. However, some saints have proven to be good mediators between the healer and God by rapidly communicating to Him the healer's requests on behalf of his or her patient. The Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin of Guadalupe are among these healers' preferred saints. 10 Fabrega and Silver (1973) have examined and described in depth healing practices by Tzotzil J'iloletik from Zinacantan, in the Highlands of Chiapas. They have argued in favor of characterizing this type of healing as shamanistic. Thereare different spellings for the Tzotzil name of these healers. John Haviland(personal communication) suggests that J'iloletik is more respectful of Tzotzil current use than Ilol, Hilol , or H ?-ilol. 11 Cosmopolitan healers privilege the more 'rational' practice of herbal healing over religiously influenced healing. This is so because in their eyes herbalmedicine is based on trial and error experimentation conducted over the centuries by local herbalists. However, the power J'iloletik (shamanistic healers) have in the local hierarchy of healers is manifest in the fact that it is always J'iloletik who are elected by the other healers to the directive board at the end of each term. 12 Pulse-takers ( pulsadores) are healers whose specialization consists in the gift they have received to diagnose diseases by feeling the pulse beat of the diseased.They may also have the gift to heal, but some have been described in the litera-ture as full specialists in diagnosing without healing power (Hermitte, 1970). Mountain priests may also be J'iloletik, but they are characterized by a special- ized function: they can and must perform cyclical rituals at caves in the187 Ayora-Diaz: Local Medicines of Chiapas06 Ayora-Diaz (jl/d) 4/4/00 1:24 pm Page 187mountains seeking to secure rainfall, good agricultural production and freedom from epidemics for the whole village. 13 Ladino is a term that, in Chiapas and Guatemala, is locally used to describe indi- viduals of European origin. In this region the ethnic contrast has been, histori- cally, between indios and ladinos Pitt-Rivers, 1989 [1970]). Mestizo is a term which in the Spanish- speaking part of the American continent is used to describe individuals of mixed origin (Indian and European). 14 Simulacra emerge where the conditions for the existence of a community have ceased to exist (Ayora-Diaz, 1999; Baudrillard, 1994; Ramos, 1994). In theabsence of conditions (economic, political) to support face-to-face and closeaffective social relations, communities are recreated on the basis of models which may satisfy the nostalgia for those lost social conditions. 15 The mind behind the organization was a cosmopolitan healer who conceived the ideal structure of the organization and dened the criteria for member-ship. Of course the structure is not static. After excluding women from the executive committee for several years, the current board has two women out ofve members. The most recent move has been to make public the presence ofJ'iloletik in the organization. 16 In spite of the almost 20 years of existence of this organization, local people from San Crist\u00f3bal seem to be unaware of whatever may happen concerninglocal healers. In conversations with local cosmopolitan healers, herbalists andother citizens, I have found that most local people say that they ignore the existence of the organization. 17 It is important to understand that this museum is not a self-representation of indigenous culture. The mannequins and the layout were conceived by consul- tants to the museum. Foreign investment in the museum suggests that faraway people must be pleased with the end result. In a conversation I had with one of the consultants to the organization, he told me that his role was importantwithin the organization as a facilitator in the local people's attempt to preserve a memory of their own culture . This same person confessed to be skeptical of the efcacy of the healing practices performed by J'iloletik. See, in a parallel example, how Japanese museums are meant to preserve vanishing traditionsand practices (Ivy, 1995). 18 Under the supervision of cosmopolitan healers, indigenous technicians and local healers are conducting laboratory tests and some experiments thatattempt to identify the pharmacologically active components present in'traditional' medicinal plants.
