Keep tightly closed. Store at room temperature. Avoid excessive heat and direct sunlight. INTERACTIONS FAQS A: Diindolylmethane (pronounced: dye-indo-leel-methane), or DIM for short, as well as indole-3 carbinol (I3C) are plant nutrients found in broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and other related vegetables. Research has shown that DIM improves the way estrogen and other reproductive hormones are metabolized in the body.* However, the research on I3C has been mixed, with some studies showing benefits and other studies having negative results. As a dietary supplement, DIM provides the exact compounds that are found in vegetables. It's fully active and ready to be absorbed, while IC3 must first be synthesized into DIM after it is digested. When combined with vitamin E and phosphatidylcholine, DIM is highly absorbable. IC3, on the other hand, has an unpredictable absorption rate. The stability of IC3 is very low compared to DIM. Some research has shown IC3 may cause certain side effects, including stomach upset and dizziness; DIM has no known side effects. Therefore, Indolplex\u00ae features active DIM. There is no I3C in the product.
