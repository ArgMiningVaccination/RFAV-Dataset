Six month later, Dr. Smith started as Senior Associate Dean for Research of our Institution and he stepped down as head of our Department. Dr. Gustavo Blanco took over the position of Interim Chair of Physiology , starting February 1st, 2015. During Dr. Smith's relative short tenure as Interim Chair, he continued working hard towards keeping the Department of Physiology strong. He supported all current research programs and importantly, he was able to recruit a ne w Faculty member, Dr. John Thyfault to the Department . This was an impressive accomplishment considering the current shortage of funds. Recruitment of Dr. Thyfault represents an important enhancement for our Department. He has brought with him new expertis e, research projects and technologies that will help advance the research efforts and the overall mission of our Department. Subsequently, under Dr. Blanco , the Department has continued to hold up well, despite the continuing difficult funding environment at the Federal and State levels. The state of Kansas faced serious budget challenges and KU Medical Center sustained a $2.1 million reduction in allotments or budget cuts for fiscal year 2015. Research programs in the various areas have continued vibrant and the Department has maintained a consistent publication level and funding. Also, the Department has had another important year with respect to teaching. In the medical curriculum, the Department was responsible for the Cardiopulmonary and Renal - Endocrin e modules. Two of our Faculty, Dr. John Wood and Dr. Michael Wolfe have played an instrumental role in leading those modules. In addition, several of our faculty have been recognized with important teaching awards for their efforts in medical education. Our Faculty have also continued making important contributions to the core IGPBS curriculum and they run different Advanced Physiology courses. We can proudly attest that Physiology Faculty are committed to high quality teaching and are significantly involve d in the education mission of our Institution. Regarding service, Dr. Blanco restructured several committees. Our Faculty have served in numerous key committees at our University, the national and international level. Numerous members of our faculty served on NIH grant review panels, editorial boards for different journals and made presentations as invited speak ers at other Universities, and national and international meetings. Without a doubt, the continued success of our Department during the period 2014 -2015, and over the years, can be credited to the talent and hard work of our Faculty. Another outstanding aspect to highlight is the excellent support from the office staff. A special thank you to our Senior Administrator, Shari Standiferd for her dedicat ion and hard work. Soon after Dr. Blanco started as Interim Chair, he decided to move the office from its location in the 2nd floor of the Hemenway building to the ground floor of Wahl Hall East. This has helped enhance the identity of our Department and p laced the office in a location similarly distant from all Physiology laboratories. Also, changes were made regarding the office staff, with the hire of two part time administrators. This has improved service coverage for all members of the Department. 2 Finally, we would like to recognize our great supporter and advocate, Jim Osborn, his wife Marion, and his daughter Kathleen. The very generous contributions that they have made over the years have importantly contributed to our success. The lectureship in hon or of Kathleen M. Osborn continued this year and is the longest named lectureship at KUMC. We have also enjoyed two endowed professorships that have supported by Mr. Osborn. The Marion M. Osborn Professorship, held by Dr. Leslie Heckert, and the Kathleen M . Osborn Chair, which was formerly held by Dr. Paul Cheney. In addition, Mr. Osborn's funds have supported a student fellowship in the honor of Kathleen Osborn. After a competitive application process, the first fellowship was presented in the fall of 2014 and the recipient was Faezeh Koohestani, Ph.D. , who received it in the fall of 2014. Once again, all members of our Department immensely appreciate the continuous suppo rt of Jim Osborn and his family. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE 2014 -2015 ACADEMIC YEAR RESEARC H FUNDING : Based on data provided by KUMC Enterprise Analytics, total research funding for the Department was almost 8 million dollars ($7,885,987), an amount which was similar to that of the previous year. Total NIH funding was $4,223,748, which is lower than that of last year ($4,908,943). The latest data available shows that our Department was ranked 31st at the national level for NIH research funding among 82 medical schools receiving NIH funding. While this is a good position for our Department, we wou ld like to improve this ranking. Most of our research programs are supported by major external funding. This is something that we are proud of, especially taking into consideration the extremely James & Marion Osborn Kathleen Osborn3 difficult current funding environment. We owe this to the ded ication of our Faculty, who have continued crafting high quality research grant proposals. EDUCATION : The Department has had another outstanding year with respect to teaching. As mentioned previously, Dr. John Wood and Dr. Michael Wolfe lead two key modul es of the medical curriculum, the Cardiopulmonary and Renal -Endocrine modules. The Cardiopulmonary module received from the medical students an award for being the best module, presented to the Department at the \"Grande Affair\" celebration in April. At thi s same event, two of our Faculty members, Dr. John Wood and Dr. Gustavo Blanco were recognized with \"Student Voice Awards\" for their excellence in teaching. These awards are a testimony of the long lasting commitment of our Faculty members to education. TENURE TRACK APPOINTMENTS: Dr. John Thyfault was recruited in the Department as Associate Professor on April 1st, 2015 . He came to us from the Department of Nutrition & Exercise Physiology in University of Missouri, Columbia. Dr. Thyfault is working in th e area of exercise and how this modifies liver and muscle metabolism. RESEARCH TRACK APPOINTMENTS: No new research track appointments were made this year. JOINT AND ADJUNCT APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Randolph Nudo, who transferred to Rehabilitation Medicine as new Vice Chair of Research, was approved for a joint appointment as Professor in our department beginning October 1, 2014. FACULTY PROMOTIONS: Dr. Vargheese Chennathukuzhi was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure starting July 1, 2015. We are de lighted for Dr. Chennathukuzhi's accomplishme nts. During the years after being recruited, he has developed a well -funded research program in the area of uterine leiomyomas and he has built a strong research group. Dr. Shahid Umar was granted tenure at th e Associate Professor level. He has developed a strong research program in the area of colon inflammation and cancer. We are proud of these Faculty members. FACULTY/STAFF DEPARTURES: There have been some departures from the Department. Dr. Vijayalax mi Gupta, left on February 1, 20 15 to work in the Department Hematology and Oncology here at KUMC.

I am an RNA biologist with interests in understanding the mechanisms that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional levels of mRNA stability and translation during tumorigenesis. My laboratory has been a leader in the identification of novel RNA binding protein protooncogenes and tumor suppressors. In addition, we have been leading the efforts on determining the mechanism by which natural and synthetic compounds affect cell signaling pathways in ga strointestinal cancer cells. My lab members primarily focus their work on gastrointestinal cancers.

Belousova, Senior Research Assistant 59 V. Gustavo Blanco, M.D., Ph.D. , Professor & Interim Chair Our laboratory studies the role of ion -transport proteins of the plasma membrane in cell function. Research is focused on the Na, K -ATPase, a pla sma membrane enzyme system that uses the energy from ATP to maintain high intracellular K+ and low intracellular Na+ concentrations in the cell, which are essential for cell function. The Na,K -ATPase comprises a group of isozymes, each characterized by uni que enzymatic properties and a cell -dependent and developmentally regulated pattern of expression. Our research is focused on two main projects. 1. Studies on Na,K -ATPase alpha4 . Alpha4 is of the Na,K -ATPase that is sel ectively expressed in spermatozoa. We have found that alpha4 has functional properties that are different from those of the other Na,K -ATPase isoforms. Alpha4 is expressed in the mid -piece of the sperm flagellum, and is important for sperm motility and fer tility. A variety of molecular, cell biology and genetics approaches are being used to study the regulation, activity and mechanisms of action of alpha4 in sperm physiology. Also, we are searching for compounds that will specifically inhibit alpha4, with t he idea of using them as male contraceptive agents. These studies will help understand the importance of ion transport in male gamete fertility and contraception. 2. Studies on the role of the Na,K -ATPase in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (AD PKD) . We have found that renal epithelial cells from patients with ADPKD and various mouse models of ADPKD, have Na,K -ATPase with an abnormally high affinity for ouabain, a hormone released by the adrenal glands. We have demonstrated that ouabain stimulate s cyst formation and growth by ADPKD cells and kidneys. This places ouabain as an agent that can exacerbate the progression of ADPKD. Currently, using human kidney ADPKD cells and different mouse models of ADPKD, we are investigating the mechanisms by whi ch ouabain affects cyst formation and progression in the disease and how to interfere with these effects. Our goal is to find pharmacological approaches to slow ADPKD cystogenesis. Meetings Attended: August -September 2014 - Chair of a session entitled: A TPases.

Chennathukuzhi, Ph.D. , Assistant Professor My research interests include uterine fibroids, fertility and contraception. Uterine fibroids are the most common tumors of the female reproductive tract and are the predominant indication for hysterectomies in the US. Yet, there is no approved drug to treat uterine fibroids chronically. Our laboratory is currently trying to understand the regulation and function of GPR10, a G protein -coupled receptor aberrantly expressed in uterine fibroids. Activation of GPR10 by its cognate ligand promotes cell prolifer ation, specifically in cultured primary leiomyoma (fibroid) cells. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing GPR10 in the myometrium in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of fibroids. Transgenic mice expressing hGPR10 in the myometriu m develop uterine fibroids that are phenotypically identical to the human disease. We plan to use this preclinical model for the development of small molecule modulators of GPR10 as treatment for fibroids. In addition, we have identified the molecular mac hinery that regulates aberrant expression of GPR10 in uterine fibroids. We are currently developing loss of function models for REST, the transcriptional repressor of GPR10, and for PRICKLE 1, the gene that regulates REST. Our laboratory is also interest ed in molecules that regulate sperm function and male fertility. We are studying functional regulation of the sperm specific sodium -proton exchanger (sNHE) in expression systems that utilize chimeric channels.

Research in my laboratory focuses on understanding the terminal events involved in follicular development, ovulation and luteal tissue formation. The studies have direct implic ations in development of a fertile healthy oocyte, contraception and disease conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and ovarian cancer. Current studies focus on understanding the role microRNA post -transcriptional gene regulation plays in the ovulatory process. The laboratory is also working to understand what role extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles) play in ovarian function (oocyte maturation, granulosa cell function) and in ovarian cancer. These studies use the latest state of t he art technologies, including next -gen-sequencing, nanoparticle analysis in addition to standard molecular and biochemical techniques. The laboratory also uses a comparative approach using human, bovine and murine cells and animal studies in both cows an d mice to gain further insights into the reproductive biology of the ovary.

Geiger, Ph.D. , Associate Professor Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. T2D is characterized by insulin resistance and is typically correlated with obesity and aging. In our lab, we study the molecular mechanisms underlying age -related and high fat diet -induced insulin resistance. We hypothesize that oxidative stress is responsible for inhibiting insulin signaling and for the impairment of glucose homeostasis. Stress kinases such as JNK and IKK - are activated by oxidative stress and have re cently been implicated in inhibiting insulin signal transduction. Thus, we are examining the targeted inhibition of stress kinases to improve insulin sensitivity. We are also exploring therapeutic interventions such as heat therapy, exercise and anti -oxida nt treatment in high fat -fed rats.

Gonzalez, M.D. , Professor I am currently in the Phased Retirement program at 50% effort . This is my last year in the department . I have already closed my laboratory and terminated my last NIH R01 grant which was originally funded in 1988. Currently my research efforts consist of collaborations with colleagues, mainly Dr. G eiger and Dr. Wood from our Department, and Dr . Kasturi from Pharmacology. My resea rch during the last several years has center ed on the mechanisms of adaptation to alveolar hypoxia in intact animals. Alveolar hypoxia occurs when the environmental oxygen l evels are reduced as it happens in altitude, or when pulmonary function is altered, as in COPD, ARDS, and restrictive pulmonary diseases. My laboratory has been involved in two main aspects of the effec ts of hypoxia in intact animals. One involves the mec hanisms by which aerobic capacity is affected by hypoxia ; these studies have been carried out in a rat model that allows the characterization of the systemic O 2 transport from the atmosphere to the cell at rest and during maximal exercise . In these studies we have investigated the roles several factors on the determinants of maximal exercise capacity, including exercise training, changes in red blood cell mass and alterations of the affinity of Hb for O 2. Longitudinal studies in rats artificially bred for d iverging aerobic capacity have provided important clues on the development of the determinants of exercise capacity along several generations. The information obtained in these studies has helped advance the understanding of the role of hypoxia on the diff erent steps of the O 2 cascade from atmosphere to cell and, by extension, of the factors that determine aerobic capacity. A second major research theme has involved the mechanisms by which alveolar hypoxia induces systemic inflammation. In collaboration wit h Dr. Wood we carried out experiments in which the microcirculation was directly visualized in vivo. These studies showed that hypoxia induces systemic inflammation triggered by activation of alveolar macrophages , and demonstrated the sequence of events th at lead from reduction in the alveolar O 2 tension to the development of inflammation in the systemic microcirculation . This extrapulmonary effect of alveolar macrophage activation by hypoxia may be a contributory mechanism of the systemic effects frequentl y present in patients with systemic hypoxia originated by pulmonary diseases.

Osborn Professor for Reproductive Sciences The research in our laboratory focuses on the transcriptional and cell -signaling processes fo r proper function and development of the gonads. Sequence and structural information of the genome are queried to identify new proteins and regulatory pathways that direct cellular differentiation and gametogenesis, with the goal of extending our understan ding of the mechanistic requirements for fertility, as a means to improve the options for contraception as well as diagnosis and treatment of infertility. Current research is focused on genes that encode the follicle -stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) an d doublesex and mab -3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) and using genome editing technology to evaluate the function of predicted regulatory elements in vivo. FSHR is required for cells to respond to the pituitary hormone FSH and thus hormone signali ng occurs only in cells that produce the receptor. FSHR expression is highly cell -specific, limiting FSH response to only somatic cells of the gonads. DMRT1 is a transcription factor that is essential for male fertility. It is found only in the testis, where it is required for the differentiation and survival of both germ cells and Sertoli cells.

Nothnick, Ph.D. , Professor The uterus is a vital organ for the successful propagation of all higher species. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development and subsequent function of the uterus are absolutely essential for successful reproduction to occu r. It is well established that complex interactions among biological mediators dictate the normal pattern of uterine development and that disruption of these factors plays a causative role in uterine abnormalities, disease and infertility. Our research focuses on three major areas: 1) the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of the female disease, endometriosis, 2) the role of miRNAs in uterine decidualization and early pregnancy loss/embryo implantation insufficiencies, and 3) the identificat ion and development of novel, estrogen -sparing target s for endometriosis treatment. Collectively, the research in my laboratory focuses on examining the mechanisms which regulate normal uterine development and function, identifying those factors which cont ribute to these mechanisms and understanding how alterations in these mechanisms lead to uterine diseases such as endometriosis and recurrent pregnancy loss/infertility. The long -term goal of the research conducted in my laboratory is to better our underst anding of the pathophysiology of these uterine diseases and in turn develop novel diagnostic/prognostic markers and therapeutic agents for their treatment.

Nudo, Ph.D. , Professor & Vice-Chair of Research , Director of The La ndon Center on Aging My research focuses on neural mechanisms of repair after brain injury, using modern electrophysiological, neuroanatomical and behavioral techniques. Currently I am studying the capacity for functional plasticity in primary motor cor tex of adult primates. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the functional organization of cerebral cortex is alterable throughout life. Plastic changes in cortical \"maps\" may reflect basic adaptive processes underlying functional recovery from brai n injury, learning and memory. By tracking changes that occur in the motor cortex as a result of stroke, we hope to provide a simple model of neurophysiological processes operating in recovery of motor function. We are also investigating the development a nd application of neuroprosthetic microdevices that interface with the brain to repair communication links within after injury. Thus, this research program has great significance for the development of future rehabilitation approaches that are based on th e underlying principles of brain plasticity. Techniques used in our laboratory include intracortical microstimulation mapping, multi -unit and single -unit recordings, behavioral ischemic lesion techniques, neuroanatomical tract imp regnation and of dendritic arborization, immunocytochemistry, electron microscopic analysis of synapse numbers, microarray analysis of gene expression. These studies have led to the development of a translational research program that is now movi ng interventions for stroke recovery from the bench to the clinic.

Treatment and prevention of colon cancer is often unsuccessful and has an extremely high morbidity rate. The major feature of solid tumors is hypoxia; the de creased availability of oxygen has been shown to increase chemotherapy resistance th ereby favoring tumor progression. Hypoxia and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) stabilize HIF -1 (hypoxia inducible protein -1), a endothelial factor (VEGF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase HSP90 inhibitors inhibit the expression of VEGF and iNOS suggesting that HSP90 is a critical player in HIF -1 mediated expression of these genes. My research focuses on understanding the mechanism of hypoxia -mediated regulation of cancer stem cells and the effect of hypoxia on hypoxia inducible factor. In addition, to determine the effect of natural HSP90 inhibitors, celastrol and triptolide on the growth and tumor formation of cancer stem cells. Addition to this, isolating cancer cells from fr esh human cancer patient sample and to try HSP90 inhibitor with and without hypoxia.

Poster presentation. 106thAmerican Association of Cancer Research Annual meeting, Philadelphia, PA 105 Joseph S. Tash, Ph.D. , Professor My research is funded both by NIH and by NASA. My NIH -funded research focuses on reproductive biology and the regulation of sperm motility and sperm function, and identification of testis and/or sperm specific functional components that can be targeted for development of reversible non -hormonal male contraceptive agents. My ongoing NIH grant effort is focusing on continued drug development and elucidating the mechanism of action of H2 -gamendazole (H2 -GMZ), an 100% effective and 100% reversible orally -active, highly -potent anti -spermatogenic contraceptive agent. The project is also discovering alternative chemic al scaffold lead agents that target the same Sertoli cell molecular targets as H2 -GMZ. We recently met with the FDA to establish the first ever guidance for a non -hormonal male contraceptive that established the testing necessary to enable registering H2 -GMZ as an IND and to ultimately enable first -in human clinical trials. With regard to gravitational research, I have been funded by NASA since 1996 and examining the effects of space flight on both male and female reproductive health. I have had 5 flight experiments on the Space Shuttle from 1997 -2011, including three of the last five shuttle flights). We recently completed a successful flight experiment in May, 2013 on a Russian BION satellite that was the largest and longest animal space flight experim ent in NASA and Russian Space Agency history. We are examining the effects of 30 days of space flight, including continuous exposure to microgravity and space radiation, on testis function and sperm health in adult male mice. A new NASA grant scheduled to begin funding in Aug 2013, will be the first ever flight of mammalian and sea urchin sperm to the International Space Station National Laboratory to study the impact of space flight on sperm motility, metabolomics and signal transduction.

Thyfault, Ph.D., FACSM , Associate Professor Chronic physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and low aerobic fitness are linked to the development of chronic disease conditions including obesity, insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In contrast, daily physical activity and maintenance of aerobic fitness throughout the lifespan are associated with protection against chronic disease(s). The mechanism(s) underlying the development of these diseases and the role that activity and fitness status play in alt ering susceptibility remain largely unknown and are the focus of our research. We utilize integrative (multi - tissue and whole body), translational (cells, rodents, humans) approaches to perform studies in these areas with a focus on clinical or human relev ance.

Special Invitation for Freelance Interview. 111 Michael W. Wolfe, Ph.D. , Associate Professor Summary of Research: Proper regulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal axis as well as development and regulation of the placenta are essential to mammalian reproduction. Research in my laboratory is directed towards understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the genes encoding the hormones within these tissues. An area of interest is how gonadotropin -releasing hormone secreted by hypothala mic neurons signals to the pituitary to induce the expression of the gonadotropin genes and also how gonadal steroids feedback to regulate the hypothalamus and pituitary. A second area focuses on elucidating the events associated with the differentiation and function of placental trophoblast cells. Our overall goal is to identify the physiologically relevant molecular and cellular events responsible for regulating cell differentiation and tissue/organ function. This will provide a better understanding of how the reproductive system is normally regulated and ultimately, will provide clues as to how diseases, drugs and the environment impact reproductive success.
