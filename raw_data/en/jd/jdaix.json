Rural fieldwo rk conducted with traditional healers, villagers and health staff in Champasak province utilised methods from anthropology and ethnopharmacology, and includ ed work within state institutions . In rural Laos, t raditional medicine use is commonly a response t o chronic illness, as part of complex trajectories of care. Its popularity is strongly influenced both by social and familial connections and trust in practitioners associated with their reputation and positive experiences of the therapeutic encounter. Good health necessitates strengthening the blood and body boundaries to prevent illness, and attention to the mental -emotional and spiritual state. Social wellbeing and networks of care are also integral to regaining health ; this is enacted during the soul -calling ceremony, a popular ritual for wellbeing. Traditional medicine forms are heterogeneous and localised , operat ing primarily outside the formal healthcare context , without a prominent power hierarchy with biomedicine and state regulation. Concurrently, Lao medic al practices and knowledge can be situated within intersecting and layered medical and religious landscapes of Southeast, East and South Asia. Characteristics of the Lao healers' medicine s includ e the collection of fresh plant materials in the wi ld, preparation methods such as grinding raw woody parts into water , the use of unique herbal formulae, blowing techniques and mantra . Whilst tacit knowledge of medicinal plants among rural people arises t hrough social relations and correspondences betwee n plant names and illness forms , the healers' knowledge is transmitted in specific forms. In treating illness such as fever , healers formulate a complete treatment based on symptom patterns. To ensur e potency, the healers follow the logic of phitsanu , whic h frames efficacy through sources of spiritual power based in local cosmologies, and draw on natural forces such as van plants and astrology . They must thus regulate their actions to protect themselves and their patients from harm. 4 Impact statement From an academic perspective, this research utilises interdisciplinary research methodology at the interface of anthropology and ethnopharmacology. It demonstrates how anthropological research into healing practices can incorporate botanical aspects, and studies of plant use benefit from an ethnographic perspective. Keeping plants central to the text, and naming plants according to both local and Linnaean classification systems, the thesis contributes to developments both in research methodology and medicin al plant documentation. The research also contributes to medical anthropology theory, particularly in the study of efficacy in traditional medicines, drawing out concepts of medicinal potency, therapeutic power and healing effectiveness. As one of the few studies of traditional medicine practice in Laos, this thesis impacts scholarship on Asian medical systems, examining how Lao healing practices intersect with medical and religious traditions across Asia. It provides descriptive, botanical and linguistic data, providing a point of comparison. It analyses traditional medicine and the state in historical and contemporary perspective, arguing that the case of Laos is distinct from bordering nations. Outside academia, the research is relevant both to healthca re policy and the application of traditional medicinal knowledge. The findings outlined in this study can contribute to health systems policy in Lao PDR and towards efforts with healthcare integration, as well as current ASEAN policies on the promotion and regulation of traditional medicines. In demonstrating how and why traditional medicine is utilised in Laos, the research can also contribute towards traditional medicine policy within global health more broadly, especially as the role of local healing pra ctices is often not well understood. The research also outlines the use of herbal medicine for specific disorders, such as malaria. The results of this have and will be analysed further and disseminated in journal article form, and shared through public m eans such as lectures, workshops and seminars both in Laos and internationally. The data can also be of use to practitioners or the development of education programmes in Laos such as the new traditional medicine degree programme. Demonstrating the importa nce of medicinal plants can also benefit environmental initiatives towards the conservation of biodiversity. 5 The thesis contains a large amount of primary data, especially herbal prescriptions, and documents the work and life of traditional healers. This will assist towards documenting traditions which are in rapid decline, and in preserving information for future generations. Related outputs, both past and future, include printing and disseminating a book of herbal prescriptions and contributing towards p rojects for knowledge and plant conservation in Laos. Traditional medicine is also part of Lao culture; recording and highlighting the importance of these traditions is welcomed by both the state and the public. 6 Acknowledgements First and foremost, this thesis would not have been written without those who generously shared their knowledge, time and thoughts on traditional medicine in Laos.

It will not be ther e long...[and] denigration of native folk knowledge is not supported by the contents of w estern pharmacopoeias, nor by the history of some of the most recently discovered drugs from the plant kingdom that have revolutionised the practice of modern medicine .\" (Schultes 1991:65 -66) Across the world today, t raditional medicin es still act as a primary form of healthcare for much of the population . They hold the potential to provide cost -effective care, as well as an incentive for good management of natural res ources . Furthermore, m uch of the history of drug development , as Schulte s points out, has relied upon the appropriation of traditional knowledge. However, both health interventions and research frequently fail to appreciate the practical and cultural significance of these method s. Rapid knowledge loss in current generation s makes efforts into documentation, preservation and protection vitally important. But what is mean t by 'traditional medicine '?1 The term can hold many meanings; a broad and frequently use d definition is : \"The sum total of the knowledge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, i mprovement or treatment of physical and mental illness \" (WHO 2019 ). This throws up multiple questions . Who do these \"knowledge, skill and practices\" belong to? Why, and for what, are certain 'traditional' methods use d, and what does this demonstrate about healthcare access? How can we define and judge whether medicines and healing practices are \"explicable\" - whether or how they work? Research on traditional medicine may attempt to answer these questions - or to explore spiritual and ritual practices, local definitions and experiences of illness and health, the social role of medicinal 1 The term 'traditional' is contentious in anthropology - I discuss this further in Chapter 3. However, as traditional medicine is the most commonly used term for medicinal practices involving plants, manual & spiritual techniques throughout the world, and is the usual translation o f the Lao term ya phuen mueang, I use it throughout the thesis. It is intended to refer to this Lao language term, unless capitalised and given extra qualifiers, such as in Traditional Chinese Medicine. 19 plants , the transmission and production of specific knowledge and techniques, or the political dimension of traditional medicine in the health system. Beyond its practical r elevance to healthcare , research into traditional medicine has plenty to contribute on a theoretical level to the discipline of anthropology . Given the central role of health and illness to human experience , it is not surprising that traditional healing practices have been integral in the development of the field. Indeed, the origins of medical anthropology are rooted in studies of indigenous healing practices. Classic early works such as Evans -Pritchard's \" Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande \" (1937) and W.H. Rivers' \" Medicine, Magic and Religion\" (1924) were preoccupied with questions of belief and the cause of illness, albeit from a perspective which aimed to demonstrate that whilst the answers were \"explicable\", they were still essentially wron g. Since the ontological turn and new approaches to cultural relativism, studies of \"folk\" or \"ethno -\" medicine2 became a fertile ground of understanding medical and cultural diver sity without emphasizing comparison to western systems (Briggs & Nichter 201 8). More recently, analys es of traditional practices have primarily focused on medical hierarchies and hegemonies and the effect of regulation, evaluation and integration (Laurent 2010; Laplante 2015 ; Kadetz 2012 ). In the 21st century, Laos - positioned o n the crossroads of Asian medical and religious systems , with a predominantly rural population and slow ly developing biomedical health system - is perhaps the ideal place to explore these perspectives in the present day . However, traditional medicine in La os has been barely explored by either national or international researchers . This is perplexing for a country which is so rich in natural biodiversity for the formation of herbal remedies, with an estimated 8000 -11,000 species of plants (Soejarto et al. 20 12). To date, there has been little study made of its rich tapestry of plants, knowledge and pr actices, or of the place of traditional medicine in the healthcare landscape . This thesis is not, and does not aim to be, a definitive study of Lao traditional m edicine. However, it con tributes to the field by sketching a landscape of traditional healing in Laos , providing a case study of how, why and in what forms traditional medicine is used, set against the wider social, cultural, political and historical conte xt. By exploring the life experiences , background and perceptions of those seeking and providing care, it deepens 2 Although commo nly used to describe local healing pr actices, I do not use the terms 'folk' or 'ethno -' medicine in this thesis because this implies a dichotomy with formalised practices (see next section). 20 our understanding of the contemporary Lao healthcare context, demonstrat ing why research into these practices is important . From a personal pe rspective, this research grew out of a long -term interest in East and Southeast Asian medical practices , and through living , working and studying in their countries of origin. My subsequent involvement with Laos , Lao people and practitioners over the cours e of almost a decade has meant a great deal to me. Beyond its academic contribution, I also hope that this thesis succeeds in convey ing a little of what they have generously shared with me , and in bring ing their stories to life. Defining 'Lao' medicine: historical approaches Il n'existe point, au laos, de specialistes en l'art de connaissance des Chine, en Annam. \"There are no specialists in the art of healing in Laos. The knowled ge of simple and curative formulas is not the exclusive privilege of a few literate people as in China and Vietnam .\" (Spire 1907: 13 , trans. E Elliott ). What is Lao traditional medicine? When I began my research, after studying medic al practices in China and Thailand, I found this very difficult to define. Asian medicine traditions , primarily China and India and the associated medical schools of Tibet, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and others have left behind rich textual r esources which have aided scholars in their quest for insights . But in Laos there seemed to be almost no textbooks, no public or private large treatment facilities, no training school, no large -scale commercial medicine production ; nothing which could really help to define a nation al system of traditional medicine in contemporary or historical terms . Indeed , Laos - as we know it toda y - has not had a long existence. The nation is now officially named the Lao People 's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), establish ed in 1975 21 after years of war and revolution.3 A landlocked nation with currently j ust over 7 million inhabitants (UN 2020), it is bordered by China, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar. Whilst narratives of p opular Lao history reference a civilisation thousands of years old , this has been rejected in contemporary academic discourse (Pholsena 2006 ; Stuart -Fox 1997). As Evans (1999) observes, a central paradox in studying Laos is whether it exists as a national entity at all. Laos was colonised by France in the late 19th century (1893 -1953), and in creating Indochina and protecti ng their territory against Siam, the French d efined the current borders. Indeed, Jerndall & Rigg (1998) argue that, more than any other mainland Southeast Asian country, the geogr aphy of modern Laos is a construct of the colonial period . Laos has been subject to little ethnographic examination compared to it s more developed neighbours . Rarely appearing in world news, it is common ly described as forgotten, marginal or secretive - creating the image of a deeply forested country of rural farmers, with poor transport infrastructure and a repressive one -party state, unaffected by the outside world .4 However, this \"myth of isolation\" (Pholsena & Banamyong 2007: 131) is being increasingly questioned, and an alternative perception conceives Laos as a \"crossroads \" or \"linking \" state, in which its abundant natural resources and central position on the Me kong River were both of historical importance for trade routes and later strategic importan ce during the Cold War (Walker 1999: 27) . Now described as a \"post-\" or perhaps more accurately \"late-socialist \" state (Zuckerman 2018) in the process of capitalist reform, it is also of growing significance to the current economic development of the regio n. Ongoing and planned developments such as the construction of new roads , a railway linking Thailand and China, and a controversial series of hydropower dams on the Mekong (Singh 2009) show the rapid pace of change in the 21st century. The words of French colonial doctor C. Spire above, written over 100 years ago, reflect assumptions still made today . Traditional medicine , he suggest ed, had not become the realm of specialists but remain ed a medicine of the people in which knowledge of simple remedies was w idespread. Likewise, in 21st century Laos people told me \"If you want to find traditional medicine, you need to go to the countryside\" . Following this advice, I 3 Throughout the thesis I use Laos to refer generally to the geog raphical area, and Lao PDR when specifically referencing the political entity post -1975. In Lao language the country is usually referred to as pathet Lao (the Lao nation), the name also given to the communist party forces in the mid -20th century, or just Lao. 4 This has been especially noticeable during the Covid -19 pandemic of 2020, during which although Lao PDR has, at the time of writing, been extremely successful in controlling the virus, i t has been barely mentioned in international news. 22 learned that in rural areas, t raditional medicine, as people frequently comment, is everywhere. Conversations about plants, health and healing are never far from the surface of social interaction. Spire contrasted the Lao rural healing traditions with what he described as th e \"literate \" traditions of neighbouring countries (Spire 1907) . This often -assumed dichotomy between folk and elite medicine types persists today , sometimes described as 'Great' or 'Little' traditions5. In Thailand this has been described as \" rural \" and \"royal \" medical traditions ( e.g. Brun & Schumacher 1987) , although this has b een criticised as an over -simplification (Tambiah 1970; Salguero 2016). Subsequently, with the rise of the nation state in the 20th century, and often in reaction to western colonialism, many Asian countries have created a system of national medicine. Thes e medical systems, sometimes described as 're-invented traditions ' may take on new and hybrid forms, incorporating elem ents of biomedicine and removing elements deemed superstitious . The common factor is the existence of a centralised knowledge source, thr ough the production of textbooks, training schools, clinics or hospitals or manufactured medicines. There is thus a point of comparison between the heterogenous forms of practice often characterised as folk medicine, and more standardised national system s such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) or Traditional Thai Medicine (TTM) (see Chapter 8 ). In Laos, it is diff icult to find evidence for these kinds of divisions and reconstructions. In the 21st century, traditional medicine, for the most part, still o perates outside the formal healthcare context. Despite official recognition and a high socio -political value, it has remained mostly separate from biomedicine and has undergone little re -invention. It is thus still a primarily non -regulated, heterogeneous and localised set of practices . The majority of what is termed ya phuen mueang , which can be translated as traditional, local or vernacular medicine , is found among rural healers. However, even a century ago, Spire was not correct in his assumption that La os lacked medical specialists . It is true though that there is very little recorded about Lao medical history, especially in relation to traditional medicine. Perhaps the oldest evidence is from 5 These terms were popularized by Charles Leslie (1976), who used the term \"Great Traditions\" to refer to professionalized medical systems such as Ayurveda and TCM, creating a distinction between text -based \"Great Traditions [which] appealed to cognitive fa culties, in particular to rationality and logic, and attended to the moral issues of sin, rebirth, and soul, while the Little Traditions of folk religion and superstitious practice attended to and manipulated affect, emotions, and feelings, and were concer ned with the regulation of everyday misfortune and worship \" (Hsu 2008:317) . 23 stone inscriptions written in Sanskrit, found in Sayfong, Vie ntiane province, thought to date from the 12th century . These describe the existence of a 'hospital' based on Buddhist principles, including the use of common herbs such as ginger, sesame, cardam on, and turmeric (Finot 1903). Palm leaf manuscripts (bailan) written primarily in tham script ( an older writing form used for religious texts ) are often kept in Buddhist temples and represent the treatment records of monks for diverse disorders, combined with reflections on magic, Buddhist ethics and stories. These predominantly date back no more than a couple of hundred years (Elkington et al. 2013), although the skill of reproducing manuscripts is still valued in the training of novice monks, s uggesting that the contents have a much older origin. Manuscripts held in Vientiane have been partially analysed for herbal prescriptions (Elkington et al. 2009 ), but represent a heterogeneous knowledge source. An often -referenced Lao history suggests that Lao medicine dates back 4500 years from the establishment of the Lao -Tai in China (Viravong 1973 ), but provides little evidence. Callis (2009) provides a brief overview of medicinal plants and traditional environmental knowledge in Laos recorded in pre -colonial European explorers and missionaries' texts from the 16th - 19th century. From the French colonial era (1893 - 1953) onwards, the re are a number of French -language historical resources. The region known at this time as Indochina attracted explorers to record the diverse plant life, such as colonial botanists Crevost & Petelot (192 8) who catalogue d medicinal plants used across the region, observing similarities between their use in Laos and in Malaysia, Indonesia and India. At the latter end of the colonial era, the celebrated botanist Jules Vidal produced a number of studies of medicinal plants in Laos (Vidal 1958, 1959a, 1959b, 1960, 1962, 1963), which record local names, botanical determinations and some medicinal uses. Former Lao minister of health Oudom Souvannavong also discussed traditional medicine practices in a French -edited anthology of this era , and advocated the use of biomedicine and traditional medicine together (Souvannavong 195 9). In the period after the Lao royalist government gained power and prior to liberation (1947 - 75) a few scholars undertook work on traditional medicine. Richard Pottier, a French anthropologist who was commissioned to work in public health during the 1960s , made an extensive study of traditional healing practices by becomi ng apprenticed to a local healer. Like many westerners, he l eft Laos when the communist party took power in the mid -70s, and did not publish the results of his work for another 50 years (Pottier 2007). This rich ethnographic study undertaken in the pre -revolutionary era is the most extensive to date, 24 and provides m any useful points of comparison with the present day. During the era of heavy American presence from the 1960s -70s, anthropologists Joel Halpern (Halpern 1963, 1964) and Joseph Westermeyer recorde d some observations on 'folk medicine' . Westermeyer (1988) d ivided treatment methods of the lowland Lao in 17 categories, including herbal, animal or mineral medicine, massage, sauna, divination, magic, spirit ritual and Buddhist ceremony , comparing this to Hmong medicine. After the establishment of the Lao PDR in 1975, few researchers remained, and there is very little field data available from the next 25 years. Baird (1995) produced a short report on animal products used in traditional me dicines. French remained the language of medical publications ; Lao medical doctor Phetsouvanh (19 90) published a short booklet of traditional medicine prescriptions, as well as a small clinical study on anti -malarials (Phetsouvanh 1991). Expatriate French-Lao doctor Souk -Alou m (2001) wrote on the Theravada Buddhist origins of Lao medicine . As in Thailand, the majority of work discussing Lao medicine focuses primarily either on the Indian and Buddhist aspects (Tomecko 2009 ; Souk -Aloum 2001); or, on the indigenous spiritual elements (Pottier 2007, Westermeyer 1988). In general, it is agreed that Buddhist and Sino -Indian infl uences helped shape the traditional pharmacopoeia and practices used in traditional medicine (Elkington et al. 2007) , although Spire (1907) argued that Chinese influence was much less extensive than other parts of Indochina. Pottier (2007, 2008 ) bases much of his analysis of Lao medical origins in the religious landscape, drawing attention to the spiritual complexity of the practitioner's lifeworld including Buddhist, Hindu and animist elements . Comparative research on Thai medicine may help to fill in some of the gaps of Lao medical history. Laos and Thailand have many linguistic and cultural similarities, especially when considering the northern (Lanna) and northeastern ( Isan) parts of Thailand which have historica lly shared territor ies and roy al families . Studies from the 1970s - 90s include ethnopharmacology of rural healers (Brun & Schumacher 1987), anthropolog y of healing ritual (Tambiah 1970; Golomb 1985; Heinze 19 77), studies of Thai medical history (Ratarasar n 1986), and scholarly textual work (Mulholland 1997). Brun & Schumacher's study of Northern Thai rural medicine (1987) is particularly relevant to interpreting the work of Lao healers, as there are many parallel terminologies and linguistic crossovers represented in their research. 25 In the 21st century, ethnographic research in Laos , predominantly in the form of unpublished theses, has touche d on the use of traditional medicine within healthcare regimes. Lundberg (2008) records a number of modalities of tr aditional medicine commonly used in Vientiane, including herbal medicine, blowing doctors, sauna, postpartum practices, divination, spiritual healing and massage , and observes that many older people know simple remedies . Buchner (2011) comments on the disc repancies in payment for traditional medicine between village practitioners and travelling medicine sellers. Philippe (2013) records maternal healthcare practices at Wat Si mueang in Vientiane. Bertrand & Choulamany provide insights into folk categories of mental illness, suggesting that \"integrat[ing] mental health care facilities with traditional healers could have positive results in interpersonal, intrapsychic and physiologic terms \" (Bertrand & Choulamany 2002:16 ). There have also been a number of ethno pharmacological studies on medicinal plants. The Institute of Traditional Medicine, founded in 1976, has been part of various internationally partnered research projects . Primarily, these focus on recording local plant use, mapping biodiversity and identif ying pharmacological components of plants. The geographical range of these studies includes most of the provinces of Laos, and a variety of ethnic groups. For example, researchers from the University of Illinois in Chicago have created a \"Traditional Medic ine Mapping Project \" (Riley et al. 2009); explored the potential development of new drugs ; identified 573 species of medicinal plants across 15 provinces, a significant number of which showed anticancer, anti -HIV, assays (Soejarto et al. 2012); found plants with no previous medicinal uses recorded (Libman et al. 2006), and identif ied plants used both in palm leaf manuscripts and used by healers to treat symptoms of TB (Elkington et al. 2009). Much of this resea rch has focused on the pharmacopoeias of upland ethnic groups, such as the Hmong medicine sellers of Vientiane (Dubost et al. 2019), and plants used in the p ostpartum period among Lao, Saek, Brouk and Kry ethnic groups in Nakai District, Khammouane ( de Boe r & Lamxay 2009; de Boer , Lamxay & Bjork 201 2). A study of temple -based herbal sauna practices (Tomecko 2009) documents the plant knowledge of a well -known Buddhist nun. Ethnobotanist Biba Vilayleck describes plants used ceremonially ( Vilayleck & Strob el 2011) and guided the establishment of an ethnobotanical garden in Luang Prabang in 2018. In Lao language literature, the Institute of Traditional Medicine has produced a number of illustrated guides to medicinal plants , 26 and is working towards a full pha rmacopoeia. The newly established botanical gardens of Luang Prabang have produced short field guides to ho me plant use . These plant -based studies demonstrate the popularity and rich potential of the Lao herbal pharmacopoeia as treatment for common ailment s, combined with the rapid loss of knowledge and need for conservation methods (Sydara et al . 2005). They point also to the difficulty of translating local terms for illness into contemporary disease categories, and issues with focusing solely on the pharm acological effects of individual plants or their component s rather than how they are used in practice (Elkington 20 13). Therefore, the last century of publications combined provide s intermittent glances at different aspects of traditional medicine practic e in Laos. Despite its cultural, social and medical importance , since the work of Pottier and Vidal in the pre -revolutionary era there has been very little attempt to ethnographically document the medicine of the lowland Lao . Neith er has any research tackl ed broader questions about the place of Lao medicine in the context o f the national health system or in relation to other Asian medical traditions. Furthermore, the majority of contemporary approaches to traditional medicine in Laos focus primarily on the botanical and pharmacological aspects of medicinal plants . Whilst this is valuable in documenti ng the potential of medicinal biodiversity , an ethnographic approach can add details of lo cal plant cultivation , preparation methods and combinations , as well as exploring the significance of their use in daily life and medical practices. Research aims: mapping a 'landscape of healing' This thesis address es the gap in research on traditional medicine in lowland Laos . In approaching this project , I aim ed to prod uce a n ethnographic study of health, illness and healing which contextualises the use of plants as medicine, and examines what, how and why traditional medicine practices are used in contemporary rural Laos. I conceptualise this as a 'landscape of healing' , exploring how medical and health practices engage with , occur within and are influenced by the local environment, and the wider social, political and religious landscape . 27 Key themes and questions the thesis addresses are: 1. Traditional medi cal knowl edge Firstly, h ow can traditional medicine in Laos be defined, in local, national and historical context? How do lowland Lao medical practices and knowledge relate to other Asian medical systems? How, and in what forms is medic al knowledge produced and tra nsmitted , and by whom? How does this relate to human -environment interactions as well as the socio - cultural context? How can traditional medicine knowledge be best documented and preserved? 2. Potency and power Secondly, what defines traditional medicine practices as effectiv e, and perceived as effective? What makes medicine 'potent', and gives a practitioner power? How does traditional medicine incorporate local cosmologies, and how significant are religious and spiritual elements to its effect? What is the s ignificance of relationships with plants in creating medicinal efficacy? How does power operate within medical practices , and how does th is affect people 's healthcare choices and experiences? 3. Health and healing Thirdly, what does it mean to be well ? What c auses illness , and how is it managed through the use of traditional medicine? How are health and wellbeing defined in socio -cultural perspective, and what is required for a person to fully recover from illness ? What do the use of traditional healing practi ces say more broadly about how notions of health and illness in Laos are defin ed and enacted? 4. Integrated medicine Finally, what is the relationship of traditional medicine to the state healthcare system ? How do people use traditional medicine in comparis on to biomedical modalities? Has integration occurred at any level, and is the development of a formal integrated medical system possible? How has the political context affected traditional medicine systems in comparison to surrounding countries? What is t he effect of scientific development on the future of traditional medicine in modern Laos? 28 Thesis outline Each chapter of the thesis explore s one 'landscape of healing '. Beginning by contextualising the fieldsites, healthcare modalities and patterns of s eeking care, the following chapters explore the process of acquiring medicinal knowledge, diagnosing illness and creating a treatment. From both the practitioner and patien t's perspective, it asks how and why medicine 'works' , and how experiences of the th erapeutic encounter affect healthcare choices. Broadening the perspective to include the wider social and spiritual sphere it then examines how health is created and maintained. Finally, it tackles the political landscape - past and present intersections w ith the state and the future of traditional medicine within the government health care system. Chapter 1 discusses methodology from theoretical and practical perspectives. It situat es the research approach at the interface of medical anthropology and ethn opharmacology , arguing that keeping the plant at the 'forefront' of research is a valuable ethnographic method, both practicall y and theoretically. It describes the specific methods used, and considers the research context of working in Laos. It describes the specific field sites in southern Laos , and introduces the traditional healers and other key interlocuters. Chapter 2 sets the scene of the 'medical landscape' . It outlines the geographical and historical landscape of Champasak province, and the contem porary landscape of illness and healthcare. It maps local healthcare modalities, and explores how they intertwine. Drawi ng on narratives of those seeking care, this chapter begins to examine how people negotiate this medical landscape and make healthcare choices. Chapter 3 explore s the landscape of medicinal plants , tackling question s of knowledg e production . With an emphasis on practitioners' engagement with plant forms, it demonstrates that close examination of the nomenclature and organisation of plant s and of the material object of the plan t itself provide s insights into medicinal applications. It explores the extent to which medicinal knowledge is shared, and how it is produced through social relations and actions of daily life, as well as being trans mitted, hidden or revealed in specific forms. 29 Chapter 4 explores the landscape of illness and its treatment with plant -based medicines. Using the example of fever, this chapter shows how sickness is understood to arise in the body, and how it is different iated. It describes practices and preparation methods that create a medicine , and how a complete treatment is formulated by the healers. It examines how herbal prescriptions also incorporate medicinal plant classifications and correspondences. Chapter 5 focuses on the religious -spiritual landscape. It examines therapeutic power , or what the healer does to make his medicine potent . Exploring efficacy from the practitioner's perspective, it outlines how he follows a coherent system of logic based on local cosmologie s. This dictates how and why he undertakes the actions of creating medicine, collecting plants and interacting with his patients. Chapter 6 is located in the relational landscap e, exami ning the experience of people seeking care. It asks h ow the th erapeutic encounter, and the multiple relationships, between place, practitioner, patient and their therapeutic network, influences the healing outcome and the p erson 's satisfaction with their treatment. Chapter 7 explores the wider social landscape and asks, what does it mean to be well? Using the story of a soul-calling ritual held for a young girl , it explores how significant elements in health -creation are enacted through the metaphorical and phenomenological aspects of the ritual. By analysing the us e of the ritual in the recovery from illness, this chapter explores how health is socially produced , and performed. Chapter 8 broadens the context to the political landscape , tracing the past and future of traditional medicine in relation to governmental ity. It compares Laos to neighbouring nations, and examines to what extent healthcare integration has already occurred and the future possibilities . It considers the impact of scientific development and input from outside Laos on education and practice. 30 Chapter 1: Methodology Methodological reflections Disciplinary positioning: plants and practice Research into traditional medicine does not fall obviously into one discipline . Botany, pharmacology, clinical sciences, public health, history, linguisti cs, psychology, textual and religious studies, philosophy, medical humanities , political science and anthropology may all contribute to understanding its multi -faceted forms. Further more, traditional medicine is something that is commonly approached from t he perspective of 'doing' . Practitioners have their own contributions to make, which may conflict with academic approaches Indeed, this is a subject which obviously straddles the modern divide between the 'natural' and 'social' sciences . Research which is not clearly delineated (described as inter -, multi - cross -, trans - or meta -disciplinary ) incorporate s ideas and perspective s which may cross, merge or communicate to varying degrees (Salguero 2020) . Ultimately, the particular disciplinary orientation lies in the subjectivity of the researcher - after all, we are not 'black boxes' , but human beings who incorporate ourselves and our experience and conditioning into our work , especially in the often deeply personal nature of a PhD. In this project, I have aimed to provide a perspective on traditional medicine which encompasse s accurate documentation of plants and their u se as medicine, cultural aspects of illness, health and healing , and analysis of the wider socio -political context. From a methodological persp ective, this is an ambitious task. However, attempting to integrate these perspectives is, I argue, vital to gain ing a fuller understanding of traditional medicine in practice. This research is methodologically positioned within anthropology , but I also draw strongly on techniques and ideas from ethnopharmacology , and more broadly across other discipline s. The meeting point of medical anthropology and ethnopha rmacology is in the study of plant - based medicines , but the interface between these disciplines has lacked critical analysis. Within anthropology, the use of plants is often approached from a cultural constructivist or symbolic perspective that does not reflect their very real physical effect upon bodily 31 processes when prepared as medicine (Elle n 20 06; Hsu 2010 ). Concurrently , ethnopharmacological studies frequently f ocus upon the idea of medicinal plants as natural product s containing an active ingredient with specific anti -disease properties, mak ing assumptions about a universal human body. As Hsu argues, such information needs to be contextualised: \"...knowledge about plant use is generated in dynamic social fields and is often highly situational, as it constitutes an intrinsic aspect of social processes and their negotiation \" (Hsu 201 0:2). The questio n of whether and how medicines work has been central to research in ethnopharmacology . The efficacy of traditional healing practices has also re-emerged as a topic of discussion in medical anthropology (Etkin 1988 a, Waldram 2000 ). Recent trend s in medical anthropology towards material culture has encouraged focus on \"medical materialities\" ( Parkhurst & Carroll 2019 ). Indeed, as Hsu (2010 ) argues, if medical anthropologists fail to attend to the biological and thus material aspects of medicinal substances, t hey are at risk of reinforcing the Cartesian mind -body dualism that the discipline aims to avoid . As Ellen comment s, it is perhaps surprising that medical anthropologists rarely explore the \"phytomedical reality \" of traditional medicine, especially given t hat medical practices worldwide depend on plants and animals (Ellen 2006 : S10 ). However , questions of efficacy may in volve competing epistemologies and methodologies, bringing up questions about knowledge authority and production. Is a plant described as medicinal if it has been well -cited in scientific literature, performs well in pharmacological or clinical tests, is mentioned in classical medical texts, is widely used as medicine by the general population, recommended by a trusted healer, or according t o the spe cific situation and relationship within which it is used? In practice, my methodological approach stemmed from the epistemological reality of doing research in Laos, rather than the other way around. For example, I could not refer to textbooks if these di d not exist. A certain ignorance of the subject was useful, as it forced me to pay attention to what was directly in front of me. Indeed, the ethnographic method emphasises the importance of responding to the immediate situation rather than basin g researc h on pre -conceived theories or hypotheses. As such, 'methods' is a term many anthropologists are uncomfortable with, considering that their primary technique is usually participant observation, famously described by Geertz (1998) as \"deep hanging out\"; 32 essentially, just being present and waiting to see what happens6. However, in researching the use of plants for medicine, some structured methodology is crucial in order to accurately document knowledge which has been shared. In practical terms, wor king with plants is challenging, especially for the non -botanist. Standard ethno pharmacological methodology involves a shorter timeframe than anthropology, usually involving a questionnaire on a particular medical condition followed by collection of plants for analysis in the laboratory. However, t he collection, processing and identification of plant specimens is a long and difficult process , especially with limited scientific facilities . And then, once identified, how and why can this information be used in an anthropology thesis? Quantitative or laboratory -based work involving the 'pharma' aspect of ethnopharmacology was outside the scope and relevance of this study ; I have not attempted to define efficacy from a pharmacological or clinical perspective .7 However, I aim to provide plant data which is as empirically accurate as possible, and to interweave plants throughout the lan dscapes I portray . I argue that keeping the plant at the forefront of the landscape of healing is a method that can yield insights both into the construction of knowledge and the place of traditional medicines within research more broadly. Another methodological orientation is practical learning . My theoretical and methodological orientation stems primarily from the discipline of med ical anthropology, but my background in studying and practi sing Asian medical forms undoubtedly influenced my approach. It was natur al to want to situate myself as a student during this research . Whilst my progress was slow, placing myself in the practica l mode of learning and recording knowledge and techniques provided a way of forging relationships and positioning myself that made sense to others . Keeping a cool heart: doing r esearch in Laos \"Chai yen , chai yen !\", I was often told, as I despaired of ever receiving all the correct documents I needed to undertake research in Laos . Anthropological research typical ly emphasises long -term, detailed fieldwork . For my study, in which there was little secondary data available, the primary da ta gathered during fieldwork was of extra importance. 6 It is however worth noting that participant observation, although not following a rigid structure, is still a method which can lead to comparative data, as in the case of Geertz observing co ckfight s in Bali. 7 For a more structured study including pharmacological approaches, see Elliott et al . 2020 . 33 To be chai yen - to have a cool heart - is often defined as patience. It may also refer to 'keeping cool' in public to avoid embarrassment, to maintain one's own state of mental - emotional balance, to refrain from pass ing judgements or to desire what is not possible . Chai yen is a realistic response to the const raints of everyday life in Laos. People know that their personal agency to enact change is limited , and that accepting these limitations (or finding ways around them) will cause them less anguish in the long run than directly contesting them. Becoming too involved in the trials of others may carry personal risk. Like the popular Lao saying that \"thinking too much is dangerous \", ideas that may stem from localised c oncepts of wellbeing have a cautionary tone when applied to interactions with the state. C ertainly, keeping a cool heart was a lesson I learnt over and over. Staying calm and patient whilst also having to push forward is a feeling that will be familiar to many researchers . In Lao PDR, often humorously described as \"Lao Please Don't Rush \", this is especially true. Gaining research permission in Laos - and then being allowed to actually implement it - is not a simple process, and is partially the reason why there has been so little research undertaken there, as documented by scholars of the region (Turner 201 3). Sarinda Singh refers to Tsing's notion of \"patchwork ethnography \", describing her field research in Laos as \"a result of delays in obtaining official permission...and an open approach to unexpected possibilities which arose \" (Singh 2012:vii). Eventually, after trying and failing to navigate the system as an individual researcher, I was able to partner with the French Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9velop pement (IRD), who had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Faculty of Pharma cy (FoP) in the University of Health Sciences (UHS) , which became my base in Vientiane. Initial surveys and work with Champasak Hospital Traditional Medicine Departm ent during 2015 were covered by letters from the Faculty , with help from the Institute of T raditional Medicine . For longer rural fieldwork, ethical permission was granted by the National Institute of Public Health (NIOPH) (no. 042/2015), from September 201 5- September 2016 (see Appendix 3 and 4 ). Once all the appropriate documentation had been achieved , it was surprisingly easy to put fieldwork into practice. Research trips could easily be arranged spontaneously - indeed it was difficult to plan in advance , as staff never knew when they would be called for a government mee ting. \"Just call on the day\" I was told in almost every instance. However, it took time, tact and persistence to approach the matter of working alone in the countryside. In order to live i n a village and conduct research without supervision, I had to 34 wait until January 2016, at which time I received permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , and a multi -entry 12 month 'expert' visa, even if only seven of these months remained . The majority of rural fieldwork was thus carried out during the hott est and wettest times of the year. Similarly to Singh's description, d elays in permission , restrictions on my movements due to bureaucracy or the weather, and the necessity of being depend ent on others, although frustrating, also presented opportunities . As a part -time and primarily self -funded student, I had the benefit of time and flexibility in my research agenda, if not a lot of money. Without a strict sche dule or too limited parameters for research, I was able to maintain an open mind about where the research would take me. In fact, this resulted in a richer landscape of fieldsites and interlocuters than anticipated , such as the months I spent in Pakse at the hospital TM department . Likewise, my lack of control over the places I stayed during fieldwork opened up unexpected possibilities. Although I initially planned to live in the healers' houses, and indeed did stay there for short periods, I soon realised that this created a tricky si tuation for them, as officially foreigners are not allowed to co -habit with Lao citizens without being linked by marriage . Also, th is meant that I was usually sleeping in the centre of the house with no privacy , and it helped to have a place to return to w here I could write up field notes and recuperate energy. So, the local health authorities were left to find places for me to sleep. I n Phamuk village, I lived for two months in a small house for government workers in the centre of the village, together wit h two Lao university students who had the job of reading out local laws by loudspeaker at 6.30am every morning. On two subsequent vis its, I lived in the dormitory at the district public health centre together with a number of young doctors and nurse s and o ne NGO worker. In Bajiang district, after an initial stay in the healer's house, I later slept for periods in an old office at the di strict hospital. These varying situations broadened the scope of fieldwork and gave me the chance to make social connection s with government health staff , and to comfortably spend time within biomedical facilities as well as with the traditional healers. Ethics, power and relationships The rationale for the research location in Champasak Province is discussed later in this chapter. However, like most anthropological fieldwork, the reality was that fieldsite selection happened as much by following opportunities, intuition and chance encounters as 35 from planning. Specific locations were chosen according to relationships with the two traditional healers and the elderly doctor who guided my research and became the locus around which my work centred . They watched over me carefully - teaching, explaining, gently admonishing , teasing - and were unfailingly generous in sharing their kn owledge and time in the midst of other demands. However, s tudying with them was at times a n awkward process, as I struggled to negotiate both their and my expectations, and to observe correct social conduct. As I had not been initiated into healing traditi ons, there was a limit to what I could ask about (see Chapters 3 and 5) , especially in a traditionally male domain .8 Throughout my fieldwork , the healers steered me towards appropriate behaviours, a concern which I felt stemmed as much from the possible im plications for them if I transgressed any boundaries. The director of C RH TM department was, officially or not, my guardian during the course of research, and carefully delivered me to each location along with my fieldwork equipment, sleeping mat, mosquito net, and an old motorbike he lent me. He worried constant ly about my safety, fears which I tried hard to allay , although his suggestions sometimes strayed into comedic realms. Although I later managed to make more informal visits after building relationsh ips with local people and officials, it would have been ot herwise impossible to work outside of the state - for both my safety and that of my interlocuters. This is a common experience for researchers in Laos . As Holly High describe s of her fieldwork in ru ral Champasak, \"At first I thought this was a well-meaning but misplaced concern for my wellbeing... [but] they explained that the authorities wanted me close so they could keep an eye on my activities \" (High 2006:70) . It is difficult to know how my associat ion with the state affected people 's perception of me . As I worked almost entirely with lowland Lao people , the politically dominant ethni c group , there was less likely to be a power hierarchy than with more marginalised groups . However , I was always aware of my positioning as effectively a government representative. During structured research such as a household survey, which I was required to undertake in the 8 However, beyond this, I was fortunate that gender was rarely an issue during fieldwork - despite the irritation of being constantly questioned about my status as a single female, I have no recollection of ever feeling threatened, or even disrespected . Although I do not concur with theories about women in the field being viewed as 'honorary men' , I have always appreciated that in Laos I feel treat ed as a human being first, and a female foreigner second. 36 presence of a government representative , it could be difficult to ensure that people answered fre ely. Research (khon kh ua/vichai ), as opposed to development work or health interventions , is not well known in Laos - especially if it involves more than a questionnaire. However , the material nature of traditional medicine and plant use and the tradition of apprenticeships made my work easily comprehensible to local people , and they frequently expressed pleasure in my interest . Although people often asked me for help with medical problems, I always explained that I was a student rather than a doctor, and t ried to refer them to others better placed to assist them. H owever, they appreciated time spent to listen and sympa thise with their complaints. Informed consent is a crucial part of any research with people, and especially for vulnerable subjects. But d uring my research, I rarely asked people for written informed consent . This was a conscious choice, after reflecting o n the power dynamics at play. Written consent may appear to be the ethically appropriate method for Western researchers . But in Laos , many ru ral people do not have a high literacy level, and can feel intimidated or embarrassed by being asked to read something th ey might struggle to understand. Even if the document is read to them, as is common practice, people associate this with official gover nment business and may thus be fearful of signing their name, not knowing if there could be negative conseque nces for them. Instead, I and/or the staff accompanying me explained the purpose of research in detail, and made it clear to people that they were free to refuse participation, or not to reveal personal information, asking them for verbal informed consent . This was captured in audio recording s and noted . However, primary in terlocuters with whom I had developed relationship s, and whose testimony was c rucial to my research later signed written documents giving their permission to use their identities, consent to video, photo and audio recording and to share their knowledge . There are also many ethical issues relating to plant collection and knowledge p reservation. As part of the Nagoya Protocol, research on living tissue is strictly regulat ed. Laos ratified the protocol in 2014, meaning that moving plants out of the country would have required a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA). At the time of my field work , the protocol had not yet been implemented on a national level in Laos, so an MTA was impossible to obtain . Therefore, I kept all voucher specimens in Laos for identification . The Nagoya Protocol also advocates benefit -sharing , in which those particip ating in research are not 'informants' but ' collaborators '. In practice, benefit -sharing is not always an easy task, especially in a 37 country where processes tend to get mired in bureaucracy, and well -meaning attempts to 'give back' may create more problems than they solve (High 2010). Financial payment for interlocute rs is also a complex ethical issue . Throughout my fieldwork I offered nominal sums to those who helped me . For government st aff this was at the standard daily rate to supplement their low incom es, and for the healers, gifts as seemed appropriate to their contribution and the familial connection I developed with them. Other than direct monetary contributions, I offered help in o ther small ways , such as paying for new wheels and repairs to the ho spital car , teaching English (in local communities and at the ITM ), providing help with editing and writing reports, and inclusion in publications as a co -author or contributor. With IRD a ssistance, I also helped C RH TM department publi sh of a book of herb al prescriptions . At the end of fieldwork, based on recommendations of the Nagoya Protocol, I drew up a benefit sharing agreement which was signed by key participants (Appendi x 4), and also documented the healers' ideas for future project to preserve their knowledge ( Chapter 8 ). One important issue outlined in the protocol is intellectual property protection . To those who contributed information about the use of plants, it was made clear that the information would be use d only for research and knowledge pre servation purposes, not for profit, and that they would be credited . Indeed, it was important to the healers that their names were used.9 Research m ethod s Surveys and questionnaires 1. Traditional h ealer surveys i) Preliminary surveys During the preliminary phase of my fieldwork in 2015, I conducted a two-part survey of traditional healers in Champasak province, in all ten districts. The main purpose of this was to find healer(s) who would accept me as a student and potential fieldsites for longer term ethnog raphic study. Additionally, the survey provided a broad perspective on the practices of living t raditional healers in the province. Healers were selected based on a list belonging to the T M department in C RH, which contained details of 36 healers at the st art of the 9 For more discussion of access and benefit sharing, see Bannister 2002 and Laird 2002. 38 research, and others discovered during the course of fieldwork by the use of snowball methodology . Interviews did not follow a strictly structured format, but all healers were asked about their age, personal history and knowledge transmission, t hrough questions such as \"How many years have you practised for? \" \"How did you learn traditional medicine? \", \"Are your children interested in traditional medicine? \". It included the speci fics of their practices, types of disease treated, origin of medicine s, and their economic situation (whether they sold medicines, had worked in local hospitals, other occupations). Additionally, a number of herbal prescriptions were recorded, and the GPS location noted. ii) Disease -focused surveys (fever and liver) In collabo ration with ethnopharmacology researchers from IRD, two further surveys were conducted to collect specific information about fevers (especially malaria ) and liver disorders . These follow ed a more structured format, including nosology of conditions, sympto ms, diagnosis methods, pathogenicity, aetiology, and recipes used accordingly. Plant s indicated were collected and voucher specimens were created, and GPS locations recorded. In total , during these surveys 37 healers were interviewed, some on several occas ions - see Appendix 7 for full list. 2. Household survey A household survey was designed using the ODK data collection app , and conducted in Phamuk village, Munlapamok district, to give socio -demographic data about households, and to generate information ab out health -seeking behaviours, health status and diseases suffered in recent years, interest in and knowledge about traditional medicines of villagers, as well as specific questions ab out fevers and concepts of health. It was carried out during April 2016, and 97 households were chosen using snowball methodology, out of a total of 452 households. One person from each household was selected , with a mixture of ages (young/old) and genders (male/female)10. Data was then accessed in ONA software and downloaded i nto Excel. 10 However, the aim of the survey was not to give data which could be used as a quantitative compar ison, as there was no randomized sampling nor method of ensuring that the sample was representative. 39 As well as providing information about lives and health of the villagers, it also strengthened my social connection with them , as the survey took the form of household visits , usually with additional time spent in conversation or eating together , and I was often invited back. I was accompanied by the district representative for the Food and Drug department (who also lived in the village and acted as the village health worker), or sometimes the local healer . This both helped and hindered, as they helped explain my questions and both had a good knowledge of the villagers' health, often having acted as primary caregivers, but also tended to answer for them and to e ncourage 'correct ' responses . 3. Student survey A paper questionnaire was given to 64 stu dents studying to be pharmacists and health assistants at Champasak College of Health Sciences in Pakse, who also took a class on traditional medicine. This asked questions about their use of, knowledge, perceptions of efficacy and toxicity, and interest i n using traditional medicines. After I explained the purpose of the questionnaire, t hey filled in the questionnaire themselves by hand, which was then manually entered into an Excel spreadsheet by a native Lao speaker. Questionnaires are shown in English t ranslation in Appendix 6. Semi -structured interviews Semi -structured interviews made up a large part of the research. A semi -structured interview uses mostly open -ended questions, encouraging the interviewee to freely express their thoughts and opinions, but keeping a framework of themes. Many interviews were conducted in a non -formal manner , such as conversations with the healers which would usually begin with specific questions and then move onto other topics. On a slightly more formal level, this was t he primary method used to elicit information from gover nment health staff . I have records of interviews with 41 health and/or government staff; a number of these were interviewed on multiple occasions. The majority of interviews were audio -recorded. 40 Participant observation Participant observation was used throughout the project - in combination with all other methods. Participant observation is a technique used by anthropologists in order to immerse themselves in the life of a particular place or cultur e whilst keeping the p osition of observer (Kawulich 2005). Participant observation is also important in building trust - especially in Lao society where a high value is placed on sociality and joining in, and direct questions from a stranger are likely to be viewed with suspici on. Becoming known to people greatly facilitated encouraging them to open up about their feelings and experiences. During fieldwork, I wrote detailed notes into notebooks (resulting in 6 full books) almost every day, which I then type d into Microsoft Word format as regularly as possible . This method is particularly well -suited to research into medical practices. As Comelles (2000) points out, ethnographic research methodologies such as participant observation and detai led descriptive writing have historically been closely linked with the practice of medicine. The healers encouraged me to participate in the rapeutic encounters, by talking with patients, recording medicinal prescriptions, and physical involvement (helping to prepare medici ne, assisting with massage treatment, participation in rituals). At the hospital TM department, turning up every day to spend time talking with staff, writing notes, studying medicines, coll ecting plants and talking with patients provided insight into the functioning of the centre and the experiences of those who worked in or attended it. More generally, participant observation meant simply being present in daily rural life. This enabled insi ght into the rhythms of each day, planned and spontaneous occurren ces. For example, when I slept in the healers ' houses , I was able to observe when patients arrived - usually times such as the early morning I would have missed if only visiting. Living in the countryside, I took part in meals, social occasions, religious and village events. Walks through the village and time spent chatting with people outside their houses or in the village centre often yielded information about health and illness. Encounters with plants, through eating, gardening, excursions to the forest or plant collection provided insights into relations and use of plant medicines (see Chapter 3 ). It was also notable that, after final ly gaining permission to stay in the countryside, participant observation allowed me substantially more freedom to conduc t research without supervision, in comparison to more structured methods such as survey s. I found that the most valuable insights came from non-structured interactions - during conversations which occurred naturally rather than 41 specific questioning, and observing people 's behaviour rather than relying only on their testimonies . Non -participant observation Although most observation included a participatory element, there were also a number of occasions in particular medical settings where I only observed . This had the benefit of making my presence as a researcher less obvious. During my stay at Bajiang district hospital, I often sat quietly in the waiting area, watching interactions between medical staff and patients and the behaviour of patients and medica l staff. Whilst staying at the healers' house s, if patients arrived spontaneously, I sometimes would watch from a vantage point far enough away not to disturb them. I recorded 68 therapeutic encounters observed between healer and patient , although the real number would have been substantially higher. Plant collection Plant collection was undertaken during healer surveys, the household survey and during specific trips taken with healers or hospital staff. In total, 277 plant samples were collected between 2015 - 18 either by m e alone or with colleagues from IRD particip ating in field trips. Of these, 169 specimens were identified to species level , 45 more to genus level and 25 to family level. 38 were unable to be identified. When there was no specimen, ten tative determinations based on the name were made based on consultation with local staff and previous botanical works (e.g. Vidal 1962), but it was noted that this was not necessarily accurate. Plants were collected usually w ith healers after interview, cl ose to their home, during their plant collection trips, or with hospital st aff in dedicated medicinal plant areas . At the time of collection, the plant was photographed, habitat recorded, and GPS location taken. Where possibl e, fertile specimens were colle cted, or if the fruit or flower was not available, just the leaves and woody parts. Plants were placed into newspaper, labelled with herbarium numbers, and immediately dried, or preserved in alcohol prior to drying in the Faculty of Pharmacy in Vientiane , where information was then recorded in Excel form at and herbarium labels created. All of the specimens, where possible, were identified in the Department of Botany in the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the National University of Laos (NUoL) , where duplicat e specimens were incorporated into the herbarium. A s there were often several plant specimens collected with the same local name, any discrepancy between identifications was noted. Plant names were checked using The Plant List database and A 42 Checklist of t he Vascular Plants of Lao PDR (Newman et al. 2007) . Animal products were recorded according to their name, and when available, a sample of the used part was collected. Plant identification was not the primary aim of research, which focused more on emic classification. However, in order for data yielded in research to have a broader relevance within ethnopharmacology, and the much under -studied area of Lao botany, it was useful to obtain the Latin binomials. No reliable list showing the link between Lao and Latin names exists, and anyway the names can vary between ethnic group, region and even between people . As Hunn ( 2006) observes , collecting a plant voucher specimen also provides a link between two bodies of information, enabling the researcher to conside r dual perspectives through the medium of the plant. A voucher specimen is also a piece of material culture . Discussing plant us es in the presence of a specimen will often generate new information as well as ensuring accuracy by making sure the plant spoke n about by interviewer and interviewee is the same. Photography Photography was used throughout fieldwork, primarily with a camera rather than smartphone. Permission was always asked before taking photographs , but it was rarely refused - perhaps due to th e prevalence of smartphones and the popularity of social media . In fact, the healers constantly encouraged me to take photos, even in situations where I was hesitant such as during healing rituals. Photographs were also an important part of plant identific ation, in order to record the plant in its natural environment, as well as of the newly pressed specimen before losing its co lour. Audio recording Audio recording was a crucial research method. I used a Zoom Hn4 to make good -quality recordings throughout the household survey, healer surveys, interviews with health staff and government workers, and during my 'lessons' with the healers, creating hundreds of hours of recording. Although previous re searchers mentioned suspicion towards audio recording during fieldwork in Laos (Lundberg 200 8; Buchner 2011), causing a reliance on field notes, I never found this to be an issue . In fact , it was preferable not to be writing constantly in the presence of interlocuters . However, this method was suited better to planne d rather than spontaneous situations, and I didn't record during social gatherings or 43 when sensitive personal data was discussed such as during medical consultations . In these situations note-taking or writing later from memory seemed more appropriate . Wor king in a second language also made it essential to have an audio record . I listened again and again to the recordings in order to gain a fuller understanding of conversations. Audio data is also useful when considering the 'landscape' in multi -sensorial d imensions; listening to the sound of the voices, background noises, ebb and flow of conversation, and interruptions all help to evoke a sense of place and of relationships. Video recordi ng Video recording was not used as a regular method during the bulk o f fieldwork, due both to lack of equipment, and also because I was rarely in a situation where it would have felt appropriate. However, returning to the field in November 2019 with specialised video equipment, I filmed a number of interviews with my primar y informants as well as ' walk s- in-the-wood '11, treatments (with permission) and shots of the treatment area and village life. This video footage will be used for a future project. Documenting texts and oral knowledge Documenting textual and oral knowledge was an important part of the research process . Often the two were linked, as healers would have memorised texts in their possession . With the permission of knowledge owners, documentation methods took two forms: i) Photographing te xts 8 exercise books belong ing to healers or doctors, including herbal prescriptions and other information , were partially or fully photographed . The images are not included in the thesis other than pages used as example s. ii) Writing herbal prescriptions Multiple herbal prescriptions w ere recorded from all the healers and practitioners in the research , first into notebooks and then typed (in Lao script). Far too man y (100+) were recorded to all be included in this thesis . Prescriptions for fever are given in Chapter 4 and Appendix 12 . 11 This is a method used in ethnobotany in which researchers walk with their interlocuters through an area of plants to obtain information about their use in a real-life setting. 44 Collecting plants with Ajan Vilaysack, hospital staff and IRD researchers Recording herbal prescriptions with Po Nueang, hospital staff and IRD researchers 45 Interviewing a healer in Munlapamok district with PRH TM centre and local public health staff Preparing plant specimens in Vilaysack's medicine area 46 Data management Data storage and protection Data from cameras, audio recorder and tablets w ere downloaded regularly and stored by date. Handwritt en notes were typed into Microsoft Word regularly , with the original fieldnotes kept as backup. All data was backed up in both password -protected cloud storage and on an external hard drive. For botanical data, plant specimens were brought as regularly as possible to a dry storage area (either C RH TM department, or the laboratory run by IRD in the Faculty of Pharmacy in Vientiane ) before duplicates were deposited at the herbarium of NUoL. The original data collected includes the identities of informants. In the text, I have kept the names of the traditional healers, Champasak hospital staff and other key informants who agreed or requested to be named . In other cases , I have changed names to pse udon yms or referred to them by their general job title. Data an alysis Quantitative data (household survey, healer survey, student questionnaire) w ere downloaded or recorded into Microsoft Excel and then analysed with Excel functions. Qualitative data (fieldnotes, interview notes, audio transcriptions) were transferred into Dedoose, a mixed -methods data analysis application , and coded according to themes which emerged from the data . This provided a basis for more detailed free textual a nalysis. Botanical data (record s of herbarium specimen collection and identification , herbal prescriptions , local plant names ) were recorded in Excel and analysed using Excel functions . Local plant names were grouped according to linguistic themes and use . 47 Language Research using Lao language All research was conducted in Lao langua ge, the first language of almost all of my interlocuters, other than some interviews with government staff in Vientiane who were comfortable speaking English. Laos is a multi -lingual country , but the official and most widely spoken language is Lao. Lao is part of the Tai language family, an isolating, analytic tonal languag e, closely related to Thai (Enfield 200 7). It is also spoken by a minority in Northeast Cambodia, and a large minority in Northeast Thailand (Enfield 200 7), although the written script is different. Dialects and tones vary by region ; the Vientiane dialect has become the current standard. Th e language includes a substantial number of loan words from Pali and Sanskrit, especially in relation to Buddhism and/or in f ormal writing . Before going to Laos, I had never studied Lao, as even in London I could not find local language classes. I took beginner and intermediate language classes in Vientiane (at Candlelight and ARDA language schools) before undertaking fieldwork (in 2013 and then 2014 - 15). However, a lthough my Lao language skills ar e far from perfect, I did not use a research assistant or on-site translator during any point of the research. The reasons for this were multiple. Firstly, on a practical level, I could not - I had a small budg et for fieldwork, but even with funding it would have been very difficult to find somebody with the requisite language skills and flexibility to accompany me , as English language fluency is still not widespread in Laos . I also knew that my language skills would develop much more quickly if I knew there was no other choice but to find a way of communicating. As the accent and dialects in Champasak province are quite distinctive, it was also useful that I develop my language skills in the same environment as my fieldsite .12 Secondly, using an assistant would have altered my relationships with people - as much of the time I was conducting participant observation which involved sponta neous conversations and interactions. Although I did find it difficult to fully understand when a group of people were talking together, having a person from outside present as an interpreter would have changed this into a formal research atmosphere and I would have missed many nuances. Thirdly, for an anthropological study it is imp ortant to be familiar with local and specific terminology. This is especially true for the medical lexicon , including 12 The Champasak accent and manner of speaking is quite fast, loud and with a fla tter and more staccato intonation in comparison to other regions , perhaps influenced by its proximity to Cambodia. 48 the names of diseases, treatments and plants . Writing out list s of herbal prescriptions by myself , especially using a Lao computer keyboar d, was arduous and time -consuming, but it helped to develop my understanding of plant names and classification, and the methods of creating herbal formulae (see Chapters 3 and 4 and appendices ). It should be strongly emphasised that the majority of quotes in this thesis are translated from Lao and thus represent my subjective interpretation of people 's words. In order to compensate for possible misunderstanding, as described earlier , I did a large amount of audio recording. As much as possible, I made roug h transcriptions and translations of every recording during the course of fieldwork while the encounter was still fresh in my mind. Later, or between gaps in fieldwork, I employed a Lao medical master 's student to listen to audio recordings with me and che ck and fill in gaps in my transcriptions . I also asked Lao friends on an ad -hoc basis for help. It was noti ceable also that a number of terms commonly used in Champasak were not known to Lao speakers from Vientiane , such as disease terms and names of plant s. Finally, it is worth noting that as Wikan ( 1992 ) argues in the concept of \"resonance\", words are not the only way of communicating or understanding. Although I may not have understood every word they said, the relationships built by living , eating , and joking with people, and observing how they treated myself and others was equally as valuable as a precise translation of their words. I have done my best to convey this by using ethnographic description to underlie lexical concepts as much as possible. Transliteration of Lao terms All Lao -language data is shown in appendices; in the text I have romanized Lao terms and placed them in italics , other than when in tables. There is no standardised system of romanization of Lao script, which often leads to confu sion. Throughout the text, I have followed the trans literation system used by the National Library of Laos in digitizing palm leaf manuscripts (Hundius & Wharton 2011), which is based on the Royal Thai general system of transcription (1954) (Table 1). I ma de one change by substituti ng ch for c, a more common spelling (e.g. Champasak).13 This system phonetically describes the words but does not include tone markers or differentiate vowel length. Some consonant 13 However, when spelling people 's names or words w hich already have a commonly -used transliteration which differs from this system , I have ke pt this version - for example , baci. 49 transliterations may seem counter -intuitive to a n English speaker , as they are closer to French intonation - for example, the word written as kai is pronounced closer to gai, and toum is pronounced like dtoum. When writing herbal prescriptions, as it is easy for a non -native speaker to make mistakes in written Lao, I asked C RH staff and/or the director of the ITM to check the spellin g. I also re-checked with the healers, though there are undoubtedly still some small errors . Table 1: Transliteration system used for Lao alphabet (source: Digital Library of Lao Manuscripts) 50 Plant names In the text, the romanized Lao name of plants are written in italics, other than in tables. The appendices contain all plant names written in Lao script. I have included the Latin binomials referr ing to botanical determinations of plants mentioned in the text whenever possible. Names were checked in The Plant List database. In the text, these follow a standard format, including the full name (in italics) and author on first mention, followed by the abbreviated version for later mentions. In photo captions I have placed the full name without author. Within tables I have not italicised the names for the purpose of visual clarity. 51 Fieldsites Figure 1: Map of Champasak province showing location of fieldsites and interviews (created by J.A. Torres from GPS data collected during fieldwork). 52 This was a multi -sited study in Champas ak province . Official fieldwork took place from September 2015 - September 2016, with earlier visits and surveys, and intermittent visits in the years following. A full timeline is shown in Appendix 3. My decision to choose Champasak province as a fieldsite was based on the following factors: i) Geography & ethnicity . I aimed to focus on the healing traditions of the lowland Lao, and Champasak is a predominantly lowland and ethnically Lao area. ii) History . The province has an interesting history including the Khmer empire and links to Thailand and Cambodia which could influence local traditional medicine. iii) Local pathologies . I planned to include some applied work on traditional medicine for malaria as part of collaborative work with IRD (see Elliott et al. 2020) - malaria is sti ll endemic in southern provinces. iv) TM hospital department . After discussions with the ITM, I learned that there were not many provincial hospitals operating traditional medicine departments or active field centres - CRH was one of the most active. v) Bureaucra cy and ease of work. C RH staff had a reputation for being easy to work with according to the ITM, and the F oP already had a good relationship with local health officials . Althou gh fieldwork was conducted across the province, the three primary locations wer e as follows. 1. Pakse: Champasak Regional Hospital Traditional Medicine Department CRH (see Figure 1 for location) was established by the French as Pakse hospital in 1908 , and has included a TM department (sathani ya phuen mueang ) since the mid-1970s . This occupies a small one -story building divided into six rooms which were under varying levels of construction during my visits. There are rooms for acupuncture treatment, storage of plant materials, medicine production and an office, and a small garden with 2 0 types o f medicinal plant s. The department also utilises and is responsible for a medicinal plant preserve on the outskirts of Pakse (Donkalong village). The re is a staff of 6 people (a medical doctor, a pharmacis t, two acupunctur e practitioners , a garden er/ traditional healer and his assistant ). The department creates herbal remedies in the form of capsules, decoctions and 53 teas. Seven principal medications are manufactured on -site and sold in the hospital pharmacy , for the treatment of digestive, liver an d kidney disorders, diabetes, fever and for post-partum use (see Appendix 8 for full details). All of the medicines are prepared manuall y from fresh materials. The plants are sourced from the hospital garden s or collected in the wild , mostly from Phatumpho ne and Pa ksong districts, or further afield in Attapeu province. In the future, the staff hope to produce tablets and to expand production of herbal products for sale, as well as increasing the capacity for traditional medicine use within the hospital. The re have b een several healers working in the provincial hospital since 1975 (the most recent is Simon, who is also the gardener and has the job of cutting wood, roots and bark into pieces by machete). T hey occasional ly host workshops with TM station heads a nd traditional healers. Dr. Outhai Souvannasy is a medical doctor who has been the head of department since 2005 (he retired shortly after the end of my fieldwork at the age of 62) . He deals with the administrative demands of the department but is happies t when producing herbal medicines, drying, grinding and mixing them with great care in an old machine, placing them in herbal capsules or teabags, or when tending plants in his garden. He has a remarkable ability to spot medicinal plants and rarely leaves a place without a plant in his pocket or briefcase. His assistant is Phaiboun, the department pharmacist . Born in 1984, he studied pharmacy in Vientiane and also chose to specialise in herbal medicine due to his lo ve of nature. He makes and prescribes her bal medicines and gives acupuncture treatments. With the help of overseas scholarships, he has travelled to Beijing to study acupuncture , and to Thailand to learn about manufacturing herbal medicines . He also spent a few months studying traditional medicin e with a monk in Champasak from his own volition . Dr. Outhai and Phaiboun have a list of the traditional healers known to them in the province , containing the name of the village and phone number - we added to this during fieldwork when we came across other healers . Figure 1 and Appendix 7 show the location of the healers we interviewed together across the province. 54 Simon the de partment gardener and traditional healer cuts tree wood and roots into pieces with a machete so they can be used for decoctions CRH Traditional Medicine Department and garden in Pakse 55 Producing herbal capsules: Top, Phaiboun with fresh turmeric powder.

Bajiang District: Nonxay Village Fieldwork in Bajiang district took place primarily at the house of traditional healer Vilaysack Phonephayly, widely known as Ajan (teacher/scholar) Vilaysack, one of the best -known healers in the province. I also spent time observing in the district hospital, where I stayed during the rainy season months of June - July an d September 2016 (see Figure 1 for locations) . The district ho spital is located on the main road between Pakse and Saravane, 50km from Pakse in Bajiang district centre, with a few shops, noodle soup restaurants and a market . Nonxay village is approximately 6km from the hospital, but most of the distance is along a dirt road through a rubber plantation, which becomes very muddy and difficult to navigate after it has rained. There is no pharmacy or health centre in the village. Slight ly closer facilities are the health centre in neighbouring \"Village number 8\" . Nonxay is a relatively small village with less than 200 households, a mixture of lowland Lao (Lao loum ) and Lawen (a Mon -Khmer group) ethnicity. It is close to the higher altitu de areas of the Bolav en plateau and the mountains of Saravane, but is still low lying at an elevation of 260m . The majority of resid ents are agricultural workers, rice, coffee or cassava farmers, or work in occupations such as government offices in the district centre . There are f ew large or modern houses, other than the spacious house belonging to Vilaysack . Opposite his home is a small Catholic church built by French missionaries, probably in the mid -20th century. There is no temple in the vill age. Residents, including Vilaysack' s family members, describe themselves as either Buddhist or Christian - this seems to make little practical difference to daily life as the church is locked other than for special occasions. Vilaysack was born on the 3rd of March, 1958 in Saravane province (making him 57 at the time of fieldwork) , and completed high school and some higher -level education in Champasak college. He then moved to Nonxay village in neighbouring Bajiang district, the home of his wife . He is now the village chief , and h is family h ave a number of acres of land in Bajiang and Paksong districts , on which they farm rice, coffee and cassava, as well as patches of teak and natural forest . He has t hree daughters and two sons . His elder son, who has a brain injury from an accident, lives t here and works on the farm, as well as his daughter, Da, a nurse in the district hospital , and her husband, who works in a government office. His eldest daughter lives next door, and his younges t daughter is at medical school in Vietnam . In his family com pound there is a hut on stilts in which he keeps medicinal plants (mostly roots, barks and woods ), and an area for receiving patients. Across the road from his house 57 is an area conserved for med icinal plants, next to which are two small houses for patients to sleep in. He is known for his extensive knowledge of herbal medicine and expertise in conducting rituals, and treats people predominantly for chronic disease which has not responded to other methods. He particular ly receives patients diagnosed with ca ncer, especially of the liver, breast and lymph glands. Other commonly treated issues are respiratory disorders, broken bones, liver disease, toum (spots on skin or inside), headaches, madness, padong (musculoskeletal) disorders , and women's diseases such as uterus inflammation, bleeding or leucorrhoea. He sees local people, but his patients also frequently travel long distances to consult him . They come by their own volition, or have been referr ed by other healers, or even the hospital - he looks at their results, such as X -rays or blood tests. He also travels to see people who are too ill to move, and sometimes he goes to the hospital to see people after operations. Between medical, agricultural and administrative work he is constantly busy. 58 Vilaysack arranging plant medicines in the medicine hut Table in Vilaysack's medicine hut with items left by patients 59 The 'patients' house' where peo ple receiving ongoing treatment from Vilaysack stay Vilaysack's home compound 60 The Catholic church opposite Vilaysack's house The road leading from Vilaysack's house to the village and district centre 61 3. Munlapamok District: Phamuk village Figure 2: Map of Phamuk vil lage showing location of health practitioners (created by J.A. Torres based on GPS data collected during fieldwork). 62 Phamuk village (Figure 2) is situated on the western bank of the Mekong, 100km south of Pakse, at a low elevation (78m above sea level) (see Figure 1 for location) . Access is via a long, straight and well -paved road following the eastern bank, and then a ferry crossing . An alternative route is the road on the west bank which passes Champasak town and Wat Phu before becoming a rougher dirt road after passing Sukhoma district .14 It is a large village of 454 ho useholds, divided up into several smaller units with two roads (one paved, one dirt) running through it . It includes some local administra tive buildings, and the house of the district chief - previously , it was the mueang , district centre, of Munlapamok di strict, and is still known as mueang kao (old centre). The village is surrounded by patches of forest, much of which has been cleared for cultivation , but becomes denser in the direction of the Cambodian border . According to the survey made of approximatel y a quarter of these households, the number of household occupants was an average of 3.8 adults (often more than one generati on), and 1.7 children. T wo-thirds of the householders were rice farmers and/or fisherm en; other occupations included office worker , construction worker, teacher, healthworker , shop owner and soldier. Approximate yearly household income ranged from $300 to $10,000, with an average of $1200. 50% of interviewees had completed primary school, 20% had completed secondary school, and 30% h ad never been to school. All described thems elves as lowland Lao ethnicity (other than two Vietnamese who ran the village shop ) and Buddhis t. The nearest health facilit y is the Munlapamok district hospital , 5km by road from the centre of Phamuk village , in the new district centre close to the market . The road varies in quality, according to the time of year . During the rainy season the mud can make it difficult to pass and the potholes expand in size - however, it is still within easy reach . Named the \"Refe rral Hospital\", the building is airy a nd pleasant and relatively new (built in 2014) after being moved from its old site . There is a small patch of land outside which the hospital director would like to make into a medicinal plant garden. The previous hos pital location is now the district pub lic health centre, close to the Mekong, which houses a basic dormitory where the younger doctors and nurses who are not from the district live. It is also my home for some months. 14 This is close to the ancient road thought to have run from Wat Phu south to Ankhor Wat in present -day Cambodia during the time of the Khmer empire . This route is currently under archaeological study (M Lorillard, pers. communication, 2020). In the 19th century, the district centre of Munlapamok, according to French explorer Pavie, had a larger population than Vientiane (2,300 comp ared to 2000) (Pavie 199 9). 63 There are two temples in Phamuk villa ge - next to the newest and largest is the house of Boun Nueang Dalachak, who is known as Po (father) Nueang , the busiest and most well - known village healer. A s is common for people of his generation, his exact age was never quite clear. During my fieldwor k he told me that he was between 70 and 75 - however, his school certificate granted by the RLG marking the school year of 1968 - 69 states that he was younger - born on the 18th of May, 1954, putting him in his early 60s at the time of my research (see ph oto). He was born in a vi llage close to the Mekong (Saphong N uea village) , and studied until high school. After a brief stint in the military, he moved to Phamuk village (3km from his birth village ) to get married in the 1970s ; he now lives in the house he built on his wife's (M ae Pe) family land. When he moved to the village, he also began to study traditional medicine. He explain ed that: \"Before there wasn't a hospital, so we treated many more people, there was only one doctor in the whole district. Now there are many types of m edicine\". Po Nueang has five sons and one daughter. Also living in his house are h is daughter -in-law, Sone who looks after the house (her husband is a soldier in Phontong district with his brother, and returns home periodically), h is two young grandchildre n, to whom he devotes much time and affection, and sometimes a nephew who assist s with household tasks. His daughter lives 100m away, on the banks of the Mekong ; another of his sons is a teacher in the district centre, and his wife 's sister and other relat ives live next door. His older sister, Mae Thao Pong, is the village traditional birth attendant (TBA) (mo tam nyae ). He also has relatives living in France, who visited whilst I was there. As well as herbal medicines, he is renown ed for his skills in blowing, bonesetting , and massage. The majority of his patients come from Ban Phamuk and surrounding villages, but some he says come as far as from Pakse, Savannakhet, Vientiane or even the occasional person from Thailand. 64 Po Nueang underneath his house showing 'ya fon' formulae composed of roots, lianas, woods, shells and horns.

Engagements with and with in these landscapes produce the 'landscape of healing' which the thesis portray s. In this chapter, I introduce the geographical and historical setting of Champasak province , and bring focus to the medical landscape. The term \"medical pluralism \" was first proposed as an alternative to biomedicine as a hegemony (Leslie 1976), to describe how different healthcare modalities co -exist. However, i t is questionable whether plurali sm is really an accurate representation of the everyday realit ies of using and provi ding healthcare . As Hsu (2008) summarises, the notion of a plurality of methods which are selected by people seeking care has been criticised as: \"...grounded in an overly simplistic concept of culture; for conceptualizing health care from the professional's , rather than p atient's, perspective; for engendering an overly behaviorist account of health seeking; for generating a false consciousness of choice; for underplaying the importance of financial, structural, and other political economic considerations; fo r insufficientl y attending to issues of power, authority, and policy, or working with naive notions of them; and for implicitly reproducing a monolithic concept of (bio -) medicine .\" (Hsu 2008: 316-317). Instead, I use the term \"medical landscape \" in which therapeutic modalities are emplaced within the physical and socio -political landscape. Th is concept implies a relationship between the 'foreground' and 'background' in which the researcher's positioning is included (Hirsch 1995). Rather than deno ting a set of clearly bounded systems, it suggests movement between these different levels of perspective and boundaries, relatedness and social processes , which are captured as the \" the cultural artifact of an ethnography \" (Hsu 2008 : 320 ). The process of 'mapping' the medical landscape can thus be used as a method for the researcher to examine people's literal and metaphorical journeys through these landscapes of care. In this mapping process , I provide data on the most frequently encountered he alth problems and the patterns of accessing healthcare modalities for village residents, including traditional medicine. I examine how binary distinctions such as biomedical/traditional and 68 public/private may not encapsulate the reality of how care is offe red. I show that heal thcare - seeking trajectories can be complex and involve multiple modalities used simultaneously, and that traditional medicine use is often a response to chronic illness. This chapter therefore establishes the significance of traditional medicine as healthc are in rural Laos, and sets the scene for the rest of the thesis. 69 Champasak province Figure 3: Map of Laos and bordering countries showing the location of Champasak province (created by J.A. Torres) 70 Figure 4: Map of Champasak province showing location of districts, National Protected Areas, historical sites and bord er crossings (created by J.A. Torres). 71 Geography Champasak province is the southernmost of Laos (Figure 3). With a mainly low-lying land area of 15,415 sqm , it is the largest and third most popul ous province, home to 11% of the population. This is one of the highest population densities in Laos at 45 people per sq km, although still low by most standards worldwide (Lao PDR Population and Housing Census, 2015). One -quarter of this population are def ined as urban. Agriculture, as in much of Laos, is the most common occupation, even for those with other sources of income . The province contains ten districts, and can be divided into 3 distinct geographic sub -regions , the most populated of which follows the Mekong River valley , which divides the province from East to West and is surrounded by fertile land for the cultivatio n of rice (Figure 4) . This landscape, which was the main setting of my fieldwork, is reflective of stereotypical images of \"peasant La os\" (Evans 1990 ); paddy rice farming, water buffalo, palm trees, brightly painted Buddhist temples and fisherm en in small boats casting nets at dawn. In the north eastern part of the province is the Bolaven Plateau , which rises to 1300m and spreads into Sa lavan, Sekong and Attapeu . This area is distinctly cooler, known for its rich volcanic soils which are favourable for agri culture and coffee and tea production. Many lowlanders have land in the upland areas, or migrate there for work (High 201 4). In the southeastern part, three rivers converge to make the Xe Khampo plains, an important wetland habitat which is rich in biodiversity and home to many endangered bird and mammal species as well as medicinal plants (Elkington et al. 201 4). The province contains three National Protected Areas: Xe Pian NPA, Dong Hua Sao NPA and Thong NPA. The provincial capital is now Pakse, located on the east bank of the Mekong in the north of the province . Previously, the seat of power was at Champasak town ( old name Bassac), where the ancient Khmer city of Wat Phu was located , 50km to the south of Pakse on the other side of the river . The area now defined as Champasak province contains territories on the west bank of the Mekong as well as the east, which prior to the 20th century grew or shrunk with the expansion of Siam (present -day Thailand). It was also an important commercial centre, with the presence of Chinese traders and a well -used route up to the Bolaven plateau (Garnier 1996). Indeed, the French explorers Pav ie and Garnier commented on the densely populated banks of the Mekong in the mid -19th century, describing a continuous settlement of villages and ricefields, in which the river enabled trade in rice and other goods (Pavie 1999; Garnier 1996). 72 Once a well -connected area by water, the province has seen increasing land accessibility, with well -made roads running down the Mekong valley and up towards the Bolaven plateau, as well as the construction of a new road on the western bank of the Mekong, cutting out the need for frequ ent river crossings. Champasak province today has international border crossings with Thailand and Cambodia, as well as a number of local crossing points. Rural life, increasingly, is not a self -sustaining world of subsistence agriculture as previously described (Ireson 1996 ). Instead , village life incorporates the effects of new economic and political contexts (Walker 2009) and connections to elsewhere, in which the river has serve d not just as a boundary but as a means of mobility and exc hange (High 2006) . In Laos, as Jerndall & Rigg (1998) argue, it has often been easier for individual provinces to maintain ties with neighbouring countries than each other. Legal and illegal cross -border migration across the border to Thailand, usually for work, is very common. However, the net loss of population between 2005 and 2015 in Champasak (4008 people) is not as high as some other less -populated border provinces (Lao PDR Population and Housi ng Census 2015). This suggest s that there are reasons to s tay, or return . Despite the permeability of internation al borders, r elationships with neighbours remain complex . 'Elder brother ' Thailand was depicted in the 1970s as a corrupting capitalist influence, an anxiety which partially remains even if ideologica l and military differences are no longer as significant, and despite the importance of trade relations . Indeed , Pholsena and Bana myong (2006) argue that the state has partially defined national Lao culture in opposition to Thailand. Others observe an incre asing nostalgia and 're -traditionalising' of Lao society as a means by which the government maintains legitimacy and defines a se parate Lao natio n (Evans 1998; Stuart -Fox 1983). The border with Cambodia , including the southern most part of Champasak provinc e, is also a contentious area, as shown by recent conflicts between the Lao and Cambodian armies . This contested area is also a s ite for illegal trade, such as the rosewood industry (Singh 2014a). In the early 2000s, the far south was perceived as 'poor' and 'marginal', in contrast to its prosperous history (High 2006) . This common description of rural Laos by both residents and foreign development workers is based on a low GDP, high unemployment rate and relatively high price of commodities . Ho wever, it is strongly associated with ethnicity, as the lowland Lao occupy the majority of politically and economically powerful positions (Singh 2012 ). In villages which still have good food security such as those located along the Mekong river, Evans argues that th ere is more theoretical than actual poverty, in which 73 purchasing power is low but basic needs are still met ( Evans 2008) . According to assessment s based on indicators from the 2015 census, poverty has decreased in the province , to <30%, down from <40% in 2 005, and decreased even more in the Bolaven Plateau (Coulombe et al. 2016) . However, economic growth and development in Laos also comes with increased inequalities, exacerbated by village relocation programmes which may involve enforcement resettlement (Ri gg 2007; Evrard & Goudineau 2004; Baird & Shoemaker 2007). Ethnicity Most of the population of Champasak is described as Lao loum (lowland Lao), of the Lao -Tai ethnolinguistic family , who typically cultivat e sticky rice (khao niao) in lowland paddy fields . The lowland Lao are closely related to their neighbours . Over the southern border, ethnic Lao make up a substantial proportion of the population in the norther n areas of Cambodia (Baird 2016); to the west, in the Isan region of Thailand, Lao speakers are more numerous than in Laos itself ( Draper et al . 2019 ). Indeed, w hilst this thesis focuses on traditional medicine practices among Lao speakers in the particular lowland context of Champasak province, it is important to remember that the idea of a homogen ous lowland Lao culture is artificial, owing much to the structures of the colonial period (Pholsena 2006). More broadly, as Walker points out, the linguistic, religious and cultural similarities of the 'Tai world' across mainland Southeast Asia may have b een exaggerated (Walker 2009). Although Champasak is a predominantly lo wland area, it is also a site of interaction and exchange between ethnic groups . Laos is extremely ethnically diverse, with approximately 40% of its population defined as ethnic minorit ies. The government officially recognises 49 ethnic groups and over 160 sub-groups ( Lao Front for National Construction 2018) - although studies suggest the true number is more than 200 (King & Van den Wall 201 2). From an ethnolinguistic perspective , ethni c groups are usually categorised Mon -Khmer, Sino -Tibetan and Hmong -Mien . Whilst the latter two are found mainly in the northern uplands, Champasak has a number of Mon -Khmer (also termed Austro -Asiatic ) people s, popularly termed Lao thueng (midland people) ,15 including Chieng, Inthi, Kaseng, 15 The designation of Lao loum (lowland Lao), Lao thueng (midland Lao), and Lao soung (upland Lao) has been officially discarded but is still widely used by people to describe ethnicity. 74 Katang, Plateau , Mon -Khmer ethnic groups have traditionally practis ed rotating agriculture and now often c ultivat e coffee as a cash crop . Whi lst they mainly follow animist practices, they have begun to increasingly incorporate Buddhist rituals into their lives (Sprenger 2018). Ethnic diversity is also found in lowland areas, such as the Cambodian border region, and Khmer influence is seen in ancient temple sites such as Wat Phu, which mixes Hindu deities with Buddhas. In Laos, this area is also known for its magical practices linked to Brahmani c and Khmer cosmologies (Goudineau 2008) (see Chapter 5 ). History The area now known as Champasak province was part of the Khmer kingdom during the 9th to 13th centuries, and other Indianized civilisations which existed prior to this. Following its foundation in 1713 , Champasak was the centre of one of three s eparate independent kingdoms , with its own royal fa mily, following the mandala pattern of power distribution.16 There is still a perception that the se far southern regions have maintained an independent and separatist spirit, as well as having an outward -looking tendency . People of this region are known fo r their warmth, vigour and humour . The geographical remoteness of the kingdom aided it in resisting centralised power, such as taxes (Lintingre 1972), but was forced to become a vassal of Siam in 1778 , losing parts of its territory on the western bank (Archa imbuilt 19 71). However, it was still allowed considerable agency to make decisions, and Baird (2013) suggests that the influence of Champasak at this time was extensive, reaching north as far as present -day Khammouane province, and across the now international borders to control areas in the east, west and south. After the Franco -Siamese treaty was signed in 1893, descendants of the royal fami ly still ruled as a tributary of Siam, and it remained one of t he last provinces to resist French 16 As an alternative to the European idea o f the bounded state, the mandala model, as proposed by Wolters (1982), which draws o n Hindu -Buddhist cosmology to suggest a series of centres in an area without fixed boundaries , each attempting to be a focus of power, and the idea of 'galactic' polity as proposed by Tambiah (1977) to describe a situation in which power radiates from a ce ntral point, a sphere of influence into which smaller states may be incorporated . The era of Lan Xang ('Million Elephants), with Luang Prabang at its centre, which existed from the 14th century until its incorporation into the 'mandala' of Siam in the 18th century (after first breaking into three separate kingdoms of Vientiane, Champasak and Luang Prabang), can be viewed as an example of this; a social hierarchy with a divin ely-appointed king at the centre, surrounded by free peasants (phai), slaves (kha) a nd non -ethnic Lao (Pholsena 2006); a feudal system bound up in Lao mythology and religious imagery (Stuart -Fox 199 7). 75 occupation. It was not until 1904 that some of the west -bank lands were ceded to France and became part of French Indochina (Stuart -Fox 1997). Even under col onialism, there was little sense that the south was joined with the central and northern sites of power; despite French attempts to create a unified state there was a \"mutually antagonistic\" relationship between the southern and northern seats of power (Stuart-Fox 1997: 54). Indeed, t he French to a large extent preser ved the political structure of the royal kingdoms . Power was focused within the provincial capital , keeping the prince of Champasak, Chau Nyuy, as governor of the regio n, although as Keyes ( 1977) argues, this position had no real power. The ruling elite we re still associated with Siamese power, and Evans (2009), referencing French officials' descriptions at the time, describes a poor and bad-tempered leader. With some family members even in the empire's employment, he argues that the people of Champasak's s ense of identity can be understood as \"evidence of a trans itional consciousness, between allegiance to a traditional ruler, and allegiance to a nation -state\" (Evans 2009:242) . The south of Laos has also been the site of frequent rebellions, such as the Ay Sa rebellion against the kingdom of Champasak and Siamese control in the early 19th century, led by a Buddhist monk and carried out by minority groups such as the Brao/Lavae (Baird 2007 ). At the start of the 20th century there were a series of major mille narian uprisings in the region, the majority of which were led by ethnic minorit y leaders against French control, such as Ong Keo who was ethnic Ngkriang (Nye) - the Phu Mi Bun rebellion , and Ong Kommadam, who was ethnic Jro (Laven) , as well as in neighbou ring Isan (Keyes 1977). Ong Keo in particular, despite his ethnic minority origins, has since been appropriated as a symbol of Lao nationalism, a \"patriotic hero\" (Pholsena 2006:128). There are also suggestions that the Champasak royal house was involved i n these uprisings against colonial powers (Baird 2013). During the revolution, the Champasak royal house was also an ideological opponent of the communist forces , and the province was one of the last areas to be liberated. For rural people, this change imp acted primarily t he rice economy, with a ban on commercial sales and enforced collectivisation, leading to food shortages (High 2006). Although agricultural collectivisation was a short -lived policy , large numbers of people fled to nearby Thailand until th e 1990s (Evans 19 90; High 2006) . Resistance to state power continued, albeit in minority factions, into the 1980s. Since independence, the revolution and the establishment 76 of the Lao PDR, the province is now controlled from Vientiane although implementatio n of policies is still the responsibility of provincial authorities. Health and illness in contemporary Laos The healthcare sector The provision of services through the national healthcare system , especially in rural areas, is a continuing challenge in Laos. From a practical perspective, with a widely dispersed, village -based population in often mountainous areas , a lack of trained health workers, low salaries for doctors and difficulty of mobilising them to remote areas, it is not an easy task. Consisten tly described in the rather euphemistic term 'undeveloped', examination of Lao medical history reveals a fragmente d story characterised by intermittent and unfinished development efforts which change with each political era and the associated external dono rs. Lack of investment in the health sector under colonialism, conflict, and the focus on doctrine over technical and management skills have all inhibited the capacity of the health system to improve (Sweet 2015). As Sweet (2015: ix) observes, \"The cumula tive impact of marginality and long -term dependence on diverse sources of external assistance has been the under -funded, under -developed and under -used patchwork of health facilities, staffing and service models apparent today.\" Examination of health poli cy documents reveals an emphasis on rhetoric and ambitious ideas over systematic planning, and a tendency to shift blame for poor utilisation of health services to the individual level . Total health care expenditure per capita in 2016 was just $55 USD17, 2.36% of GDP, despite substantial aid packages, including most recent assistance from China such as rebuilding Mahasot Hospital (ODM 2017 ). Low rates of taxation, systemic corruption and reliance on changing donors make consistent financing of health service s extremely difficult (Transparency International 201 9; J\u00f6nsson et al. 2015 ). Official policy does not allow prioritisation of resources towards the most disadvantaged ethnic groups (Pholsena 2006). In this context, the often -mentioned expectation of trans itioning away from external funding towards a sustainably funded health system seems unfeasible, and domestic and international will towards evolving new welfare institutions for healthcare have yet to make 17 This is less than Cambodia ($76), Vietnam ($122) an d Thailand ($221). 77 a large impact (Sorensen et al. 2017 ). Government healthcare was free during the early years of the Lao PDR, but user fees were introduced in the mid -1980s . Despite initiatives to increase affordability by subsidising care especially for vulnerable groups , the cost of care remains high for many (J\u00f6nsson et al. 2015) . In 2016, 45.1% of health spending was directly financed by h ouseholds (World Bank 2017). From 2017, a new scheme began to be rolled out offering a set price for consultation and treatment with government providers of between $2 -3USD (WPRO 201 7; Kim & Loa yza 201 8). Private healthcare has been officially allowed in Lao PDR since the economic reforms of the late 1980s, instigating a change from a state -dominated health system into an increasingly mixed market (Alvesson 2013). The majority of facilities are run by state -employed healthcare workers to top up their income. However, private health enterprises were also part of the fabric of healthcare in Laos prior to 1976, and after a short hiatus trained health staff were authorised to apply for l icences to operate priva te pharmacies . As Sweet (2015) observes, the issue of doctors diverting their energies towards private healthcare was also an issue prior to the socialist era. This licensing system does not for the most part extend to traditional medicine practices (othe r than manufacturing for export or urban clinics) which are included in the informal private sector . The integration of traditional and bio -medicine is official policy (Sweet 2015) , and under socialism, traditional medicine was, as in neighbouring revolutionary nations, promoted as an inexpensive, low -tech and culturally appropriate medicine (Wahlberg 2006; Monnais et al. 2011; Thompson 2015). However, very little has been actually done to achieve integration , and thus traditional me dicine has hardly become systematised or scientised, keeping a low professional role . In the post -revolutionary era, a traditional medicine hospital functioned for some years in Vientiane , and a few provincial hospitals such as Champasak still operate smal l departments which manufacture and prescribe herbal medicines.18 Current health challenges The picture of illness and healthcare in Laos today is one that points to the challenges faced especially by rural people in maintaining good health. Laos falls beh ind the region on most health indices (WHO 2016), with a n average life expectancy of 65.8 ye ars. As in most 18 Chapter 8 discusses the regulation and political history of traditional medicine in more detail. 78 developing countries of the global south , the continuing prevalence of infectious disease is combined with a rise in chronic illness ; a \"double burd en of disease \" (McMichael 2001). Fevers are an ever -present part of rural life; mosquito -borne diseases such as malaria and dengue remain endemic , especially in southern lowland regions (see Chapter 4) . Other common communicable illnesses are diarrhoeal di sease, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis and associated liver conditions ( Paboriboune et al . 2018). A large number of other infectious and parasitic diseases including typhoid, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, Japanese encephalitis, melioidosis, pneumonia, HIV, ch romoblastomycosis and others, are also widespread (Mayxay et al. 2013) . A prevalent issue in southern Mekong regions is infection by liver and intestinal flukes (Chai et al. 2007) . There are also rising levels of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer, linked to high levels of tobacco and alcohol consumption and decreasing physical activity ( Vonglokham et al. 2019 ). Road traffic accidents are another cause of premature death (the second highest rate per capita in Southeast Asia); a sudden increase in vehicles with economic growth has not been accompanied by traffic regulation, and drunk driving is common ( Slesak et al. 2015 ). Mother and child health are a current health policy priority; however , the under -five child mortality rate remain s among the highest in southeast Asia (LSIS -II). Levels of child malnutrition are also high; the stunting rate of under -fives is approximately 33% (LSIS -II), and infantile beriberi due to thiamin deficiency may still be widespread (Barennes et al. 2015). There are almost no mental health treatment facilities in Laos; Bertrand & Choulamany (2002) note the negative effects of widening economic inequality on social violence and mental health, and observe that untreated epilepsy and increa sing levels of drug addiction are major problems. Climate and environm ental change are also bringing new health challenges . Increasingly sever e outbreaks of dengue fever are thought to be linked to fluctuating weather patterns and environmental change ( Bhatia et al. 2013 ). Rates of mortality and nutritional deficiencies, especially among ethnic minority groups , are associated with a shift away from traditional dietary diversity linked to loss of interrelated culinary and kinship principles, damage to the ag ro-ecosystem , the disruptive effect of resettlement p rogrammes and continuing exposure to chemical residues from the war period (Krahn 2005 ; Buchner 2011) . Floods and droughts are becoming more severe, affecting food production ( Bouapao et al. 2016 ). The recent hydropower disaster (2019) in which a dam burst in Attapeu , close to Champasak, left several villages without homes or access to safe water . 79 In Champasak province, d uring the time of fieldwork, the majority of problems seen in rural health facilities involved the digestive and resp iratory systems, as well as accidents and mosquito -borne fevers. The 2013 -16 health statistics for Munlapamok district report the highest number of patients seeking outpatient cares for colds, followed by diarrhoea, pneumo -bronchitis, otitis (ear infection ), malaria, dengue, road traffic accidents and other trauma. In -patient stays mainly resulted from diarrhoea, malaria, pneumo -bronchitis or women giving birth. Statistics from Bajiang district for the same period were simila r although in notably lower numb ers. The majority of inpatients suffered from acute digestive issues such as vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach -ache. Colds, flu, sore throat and fevers, including malaria and dengue, and road accidents were also common . This pattern was similar to that found in the household survey of Phamuk village. In 97 households, the most common health problems per household reported in the last year (Figure 5) included stomach and digestive problems , followed by fever , each seen in aroun d two-thirds of households (including 18 cases of malaria and 17 of dengue fever). The next most common were a rthritis or back pain (one-third of households), gynaecological disorders such as leucorrhoea or post -partum problems (one-quarter) , and fewe r cas es (one-fifth or less) of hypertension , diabetes , liver disease , acute diarrhoea, kidney disease , skin disease, heart disease , other respiratory disease , cancer or thyroid issues . Other problems reported included eye issues , dizziness, paralysis and i njuri es. The village healer, Po Nueang, described the most common ly seen cases as fevers, digestive problems and children's' illnesses like stomatitis, an inflammation of the mouth and tongue ( bat buay). However, he explained that 'new' diseases like diabetes ( baowan ), high cholesterol man) and thyroid problems ( kho kin lueat) were becoming more common reasons for seeking care compared to the past. 80 Figure 5: Most common health problems reported in 97 households in Phamuk village (% of households with one or more family member experiencing illness episode in the last year) Healthcare modalities The Lao PDR state healthcare system is composed of a network of health centres and hospitals at the village, district, provincial and n ational level, managed by the Ministry of Health. Most of Champasak province has relatively good access to health facilities in comparison to more remote areas of Laos (usually accessible within a day) ( CMPE, MoH 2017 ). These are combined with private and informal healthcare modalities . Village health centre s The most basic level of government healthcare provision is the village health centre (souksala ). They vary from run -down wooden shacks to newly built concrete buildings with multiple rooms . The upgrad ing of these primary healthcare facilities has been a pr iority of MoH since the 1990s, but facilities still vary greatly and the number actually declined by almost half between 1990 and 2000 (Sweet 2015: 251). Each health centre serves 4 - 8 villages ( usually a tasseng, the administrative division above the village) . In Champasak province there are 74 health centres, an average of 7.4 per district ( CMPE, MoH 2017). Health centre s contain facilities for outpatient visits, basic medications, vaccination stor village81 and delivery rooms; nurses are also responsible for frequent outreach vaccination campaigns which may leave the centre without medical staff (Elliott et al . in press). The souksala did not feature in my research in Champasak, as both Phamuk and Nonxay village were in easy reach of a district hospital for primary healthcare (Figure 6 shows the network of village health centres across Munlapamok district). However, in research in other parts of Laos I found that rural people appreciate their proximity an d convenience, even if they complain that they are lacking in medicines and can only treat simple health issues (Bourdy et al. in press). Figure 6: Map of health centres in Munlapamok district (source: Health Poverty Action, 2017 ) Village health worker s Village health workers are usually volunteers (asasamak ban) who may receive a small stipend if their work requires them to travel, but also make e xtra income through selling basic medications or offering injections. In remote areas they may bear a heavy burden of responsibility for villagers' health, including diagnosing malaria through the use of rapid tests (Bourdy et al . in press). VHWs usually have only rudimentary medical training , but in Phamuk village the VHW is public heal th official Dr. Sipha, who lives in the village with her family, on the road a little way down from P o Nueang 's house. I often meet her in the evening walking to a neighbour's house to offer treatment such as amoxycillin injections, a popular antibiotic vi ewed as a cure -all, or to give IV infusions of 'vitamins'. 82 State hospitals The state hospital system includes facilities at the national, provincial and district level, a structure inherited from the RLG regime and continued by the Lao PDR government (Sweet 2015: 251). Most districts have a hospital with fairly limited facilities and of varying quality, designed to treat simple disorders. The Bajiang district hospi tal is old and uninviting to patients, and was less used (see Chapter 6). In contrast, the Munlapamok district hospital is relatively new and well -equipped, reportedly accessed just over a third of illnesses; the provincial hospital in Pakse was accessed in one -sixth of cases. It contains rooms for internal and external medicine, gynaecology, ma ternity, children, and dentistry . The hospital has 45 members of staff - 10 doctors, 20 nurses and 15 other staff such as pharmacists, technicians and orderlies. Recently qualified health staff make up much of the workforce, as they may be expected to work in rural areas for several year s after graduation if they received a government scholarship. Despite this, d uring my fieldwork in 2015 -16, Munlapamok district hospital seem ed very empty, the row of beds mostly unoccupied . However, visits in 2018 and 2019 , after the roll-out of new universal health policies in 2017 which introduced a flat fee19, show ed a different picture - the hospital beds were full, and the staff busy . As medications are included under this fee (if they are in stock), doctors also commen t that patients are rarely satisfied unless they receive several. A young doctor working there says this is also associated with the 2016 forestry law to prohibit illegal logging20 - as people make less money from logging , they can no longer afford to visit private clinics. More complicated problems are referred to CRH in Pakse , because they don't have the facilit ies to do X-rays or blood work. 19 30,000 kip [$3.50] flat fee for inpatients, 10,000 kip [$1.20] for outpatients in hospitals. 20 MOIC, 2016.

Although in the earl y years of the Lao PDR civilian and military healthcare servic es were separate, in the present day military facilities represent another branch of government healthcare services (Sweet 2015). There is a military hospital on Route 13, 10km south of Pakse, which was popular with villagers (in Phamuk village, 90km away, it was accessed i n 1/10 of reported illness incidents ). The military emplo ys a large number of men from rural areas (Po Nueang had two sons stationed in the Thai border area of Phontong district), meaning that many families are able to access care in mili tary hospitals, as well as those employed by the military (Bourdy et al. in press). When asked why they used it, people also expressed their perception that the military hospital was cheaper and offered better care than the public state hospital. The pharmacy in Munlapamok district hospital 85 Private pharmacies and clinics Private health facilities range from very basic vill age pharmacies all the way up to modern private clinics in Vientiane. The number of private pharmacies increased rapidly from approximately 32 in 1986 to 1,850 in 1995 (Jonsson et al. 2014). Pharmacies have been reported as widely popular as a source of se lf-medication , which is not always acknowledged in public health research in Laos (Buchner 2011 ; Nonaka et al. 2009 ; Alvesson 2013 ), although in my survey their use came behind pub lic healthcare facilities. Issues with accurate labelling and dispensing of medicines are common, which may lead to adverse reactions (Caillet et al. 2017). In the past 10 years, new policies have attempted to acknowledge the popularity of private care an d to increase the quality of care on offer . This has been done by including private enterprises into national programmes such as dispensing free antimalarials , termed Public -Private Mix (PPM) (Simmalavong et al. 2017). Phamuk village has two pharmacies, the larger of which expanded to become a small clinic from 2017. Th is pharmac y is owned by a local family - a nurse at the district hospital, and her father who works in the district public health office. It sells a limited ran ge of medication including paracetamol , a wide range of antibiotics (penicillin, amoxcin (amoxycillin), erythromycin, hemomycin, ofloxin, sulfdiazine - in both child and adult versions), chloroquine phosphate (previously used for malaria but no longer effe ctive ), beta blockers, drugs for gastric disorders, various cough and sore throat syrups, arthritis drugs and deworming medication. It's clearly easy to buy medications such as broad -spectrum antibiotics in small doses , and the owner describes a beta -block er, Propanolol, as a 'tonic ' (ya bamlung). There are also three manufactured herbal remedies sold for post -partum and gynaecological use or blood tonics - two from companies based in Vientiane and one Thai brand. The director of the Munlapamok district hospital, Dr. Bouabai, also runs a clinic close to the hospital and market , where he prescribes both biomedic al and herbal medications , a mixture of Lao and Vietnamese brands. 86 Foreign -owned healthcare As well as Lao -owned private healthcare facilities, there are also a number of hospitals and clinics operated by non -Lao nationals - ranging from entirely expat riate embassy clinics in Vientiane to Vietnamese hospitals which are associated with Vietnam's historical influence in the Lao health sector (Sweet 2015). Rural people sometimes reported accessing a Vietnamese hospital in Paksong ( in 1% of illness episodes in Phamuk village). More common, especially wit h those living close to the border , was cross -border healthcare seeking in Thailand . Lao patients are able to access state Thai healthcare facilities at a relatively low cost , although still it is still more expensive than in Laos - this option is most popular among those of a higher socio -economic status (Bochaton 2015 ). However, it was notable that people would invest significant amounts of time and money to seek care when they felt their health issue was se rious. For example, P o Nueang travelled to visit private clinics and/or the public hospital in Ubon on several occasions to treat chronic kidney illness and gout. People often commented on their preference for Thai healthc are, perceiving it to be better qu ality (see chapter 6) . The same was true for pharmaceutical products - Vietnamese, French or Thai brands (rarely Chinese) were particularly sought after. Traditional healers Traditional healers (mo ya phuen mueang ) were the main focus o f my research. Ac ross Champasak province, I met and interviewed 35 in total across ten districts, all m en. In Phamuk village, I knew of two healers who were currently practising . Po Nueang was the most well -known and popular, and Po Long, who treat ed mainly children . I als o met four others in nearby villages. Some women also ut ilised medicinal plants but did not define themselves as mo ya (see Chapter s 3 and 5 for discussion on gender). All the healers I interviewed were elderly , aged between 50 to 99 years; the average age was 69. The oldest healer, P o Hom from Champasak province, aged 99, said he was still strong and producing medicine . All were lowland Lao and Buddhist, although it is likely that there are some healers of other ethnic groups on the Bolaven plateau. Five of the healers had either studied with or had previously been monks at local temples . However, none of the monk -teacher s mentioned were still alive , and other than one well -known monk in Pakse , I did not hear of any other monks currently practising medicine in Champasak province. The length of time spent practising medicine varied, from only two months to 65 years (the average number of years was 30 ). Only a few had, or were currently transmitting their knowledge 87 - a rare example was P o Khamp ud from Phontong district, who was teaching his young grandchildren . The healers all used various types of herbal medicine ( see Chapter s 3 and 4) composed of fresh or older plant materials, especially roots, woods, barks, lianas and rhizomes; less common was the use of le aves and flowers.21 The majority of plant materials were collected from the wild rather than cultivated. In some areas, such as Phatumphone and Khong districts, which are particularly rich in biodiversity, the forest was described as being near the village. In Munlapamok district, Po Nueang collect ed plants from the forest near the Thai border - or people who can recognise the plants sometimes brought them to him. Some healers , such as Vilaysack , gathered medicines in the wild from all over Southern Laos (including at times, Salavan and Attapeu). In northern Phontong district, the healers would ascend nearby mountains to find plants, but these were not so easy to reach. Many of the healers also used animal products in small quantities , various varieties of ho rn and antlers from large mammals, bones from many different animals, chicken feet, freshwater fish parts, and sea and freshwater shell s. Animal parts were either by -products of eating meat, or bought from hunters or traders. Sea -shells came from Thailand or Vietnam. The majority of the healers did n ot sell their medicines, but instead asked for donations (see Chapter 5 ). Many of them had other occupations, such as farming, growing coffee, producing charcoal, having a shop, or singing ( mo lam). This also e xplain s the prevalence of more elderly healers , as Westermeyer observed in the pre -revolutionary era : \"Healing is a part-time occupation for one's leisure hours. Only a few older men and women, supported by the labours of their offspring, can devote more than leisure time to healing \" Westermeyer (1988:77) . 21 The tendency for using the woody part of the plant is shown by the term ya hak mai ('root medicine'), sometimes used to refer to traditional medicine.This preference is similar to medicines from neighbouring countries such as China and Cambodia (see Chassagne et al. 2016). However, it contrast s with, for example, the Nuaulu of Indonesia who prefer soft parts - in fact traditional medicines are called 'leaves' (Ellen 1993). 88 Po Bounton, 80 years old, with daughter Nang in Khong distri ct Po Hom, 99 years old with Dr. Outhai in Pakse district 89 Mr. Konmilit, 72 years, Khong District L: Po Konmilit, 70 years old, Khong district.

Torres from GPS data collected during fieldwork). 91 Medicine sellers Medicine sellers (mo khai ya) are usually differentiated from traditional healers as they sell medicines for profit, although the distinction was not always so clear -cut. They s ell decoctions packaged in plastic bags, or manufactured pills, and w ere either mobile, visiting different vi llages, or stationary, such as a market stall. They were reportedly used in one - tenth of illness episodes in Phamuk village. Hmong medicine sellers are particularly successful throughout Laos, with plants harvested from the northern province of Xieng Khoua ng (Dubost et al. 2019) - and even in the far southern lowlands, there was one Hmong female seller who could sometimes be seen in the district market of Munlapamok. Women from Phamuk village reported visiting her primarily for gynaecological ailments. Travelling med icine sellers may also sell biomedical treatments such as small packets of drugs which contain antibiotics and painkillers for generalised complaints , or offer injections of antibiotics or vitamins (Lundberg 2008) . Buchner (2011) observes how travelling commercial sellers may exploit poor and ill villagers by demanding high prices for their services , in comparison to village -based practitioners. For those who produced large amounts of medicine, such as Po Konmilit in Khong district with a small 'factory ', often several family members were involved in production. Massage and bonesetting Massage (nuad) is primarily an urban phenomenon in contemporary Laos , offered in private shops and salons as well as within hospital rehabilitation departments. P o Nueang practises some massage for the elderly people of Phamuk village, but he learnt these techniques as a military healthworker rather than from his traditional medicine training. Unlike Thailand which has established linea ges of massage specialists (Salguero 20 17b), massage in Laos d oes not appear to have become elevated to the same extent, although the techniques used are similar. However, in rural areas, massage tends to be offered in a non-formal manner, within families or among neighbours. I n Phamuk village, I met a woman in her 70s who was still practising. Bonesetting is a traditional medicine modality commonly used in East and Southeast Asia to manage injuries including fractured bones, and place joints into correct alignment. In Thailand, this indigenous me dical form has influenced the development of modern Thai massage (Salguero & Roylance 2011). In Laos, it involves the application of sesame oil to 92 the skin, and gentle manipulation of bones and tissue, such as in cases of sprains (see Chapter 6). It is als o closely associated with blowing and the use of healing mantra (see Chapter 5). Female massage practitioner in Phamuk village , a grandmother in her 70s. Po Nueang examines and treats a woman's sprained wrist 93 Other practitioners As well as tradit ional healers, rural Laos has a number of other mo, a prefix used to denote a pract itioner .22 In Phamuk village, there was a female practitioner, M ae Chanta, who used plants from her garden and treat ed women's disorders , and an elderly traditional birth attendant (mo tam nyae ), Mae Thao Pong , who was P o Nueang 's older sister . A number of older men would sometimes 'blow' for problems on the external part of the body such as skin conditions, general pain, broken bones or sprains, cancer and snakebite , as well as spirit possession. These practi tioners are known as mo pao (blowing doctors), or mo mon, specialists in using the power of mantras . Some monks also utilise blowing, and in Phamuk village people said there had previously been a nun at the temple who prac tised divination (mo du). Occasionally a mo thiam (female spir it medium) would visit the village; I also heard about exorcist s or 'spirit doctors' ( mo phi) coming from Thailand. Ritual specialists (mo phon) perform rituals such as the baci or su khuan, or the sia ko , in order to assist with the patient's healing process (see Chapter 7) . This rich fabric of village practitioners is similar to that described by Pottier (200 7) and Westermeyer (1988) in 1960s - 70s rural Laos, albeit in much fewer numbers. As Westermeyer (1988) observed, there is a large amount of overlap between practices and practitioners, and it should be noted that the healers would often perform other roles and incorporate techniques into their healing practices , with the exception of fema le-only practices (spirit medium, traditional birth attendant). However, th e healers perceived themselves as generally superior to other practitioners (Chapter 5 ). Negotiating the medical landscape Seeking care In general, villagers reported a high lev el of care -seeking for illness from a variety of places. In Phamuk village , as show n in the map (Figure 2), people had access to a relatively wide choice of healthcare options . Of the 97 households surveyed in Phamuk village , the most used healthcare optio n was the district hospital, accessed in just over one -third of all reported illness episodes . This was followed by treatment from a traditional healer (usually 22 Mo more generally means 'expert', e.g. mo lam, folk singer. 94 Po Nueang ) and the village healthworker (each used in one -quarter of illness episodes ). Other l ocal forms of healthcare used less frequently included the village pharmacy (7%) , private clinic (s) (6%) , traditional medicine sellers (11%) and self -medication with herbal medicine (4%)23. Further afield were the provincial hospital in Pakse (16%), the nea rby military hospita l (3%) , or the Vietnamese hospital near Paksong (1%) which were consulted in cases w here local methods faile d. A small number (less than 5%) of people reported travel to Vientiane, more than 700km away or across the border to nearby Ubo n in Thailand (1%) . The most commo nly used forms of medicine were thus within a 3km radius of the village . Figure 8: Healthcare facilities accessed according to type of health problem and number of illness episodes 23 This percentag e is low, but it may not include the ways in which people use plants without necessarily conceptualising this as \"medicine\" (see Chapter 3). 0 20 40 60 80 100 120Blowing doctorClinicDistrict hospitalHealth workerHerbal Medicine or bonesettingMedicineNothingOtherProvincial hospitalThai hospitalVientiane hospital Arthritis Back pain Cancer Diabetes Diarrhoea Fever Heart problems Hypertesion Kidney problems Liver Respiratory problems Skin problems Stomach problems Thyroid Women disorders Number of illness episodesType of healthcare accessed95 In the process of mapping the medical landscape, there are different ways to think about how the various healthcare modalities can be differentiated or classed together. Of most relevance to this thesis is the distinction between 'biomedical' ( ya luang medicines . According to the survey conducted in Phamuk village, healthcare types can be classed as follows: Biomedicine Ya Luang Traditional medicine Ya phuen mueang District hospital Provincial hospital (Pakse) Local health worker Private clinic Military hospital (Pakse) Vietnamese hospital (Paksong) Thai hospital (Ubon) Vientiane hospital Medicine from pharmacy Surgery Traditional healer Traditional medicine seller Herbal medicine from family Herbal medicine mad e alone Massage Blowin g doctor Acupuncture /hospital TM Table 2: Biomedical and traditional medicine types 55% 29%16%Biomedical vs. Traditional medicine used Biomedical Traditional Both Figure 9: Proportion of illness episodes in Phamuk village in which traditional medicine, biomedicine, or both were accessed (%) 96 There was also an overlap between the use of different methods, as shown in Figure 9. Although biomedicine used alone was almost twice as commo n as traditional medicine used alone, in 16% of illness episodes both were used, suggesting that TM was often a complementary treatment. Of all health problems and treatments reported, the widest use of traditional medicine was for stomach and digestive d isorders and diarrhoea (reflecting the prevalence of this commonly experienced issue among rural people and the link between herbal medicine and food plants - see Chapter 3 ). Another common use was to treat the musculo -skeletal system, particularly back pa in (used in almost half of cases) , and for disorders of the skin . Acute conditions such as fever s were more often treated first with biomedicine , but traditional medicine was used in less severe cases and/or as a complementary treatment . However, as shown in Figur e 10, although chronic health conditions such as liver issues, diabetes , hypertension and cancer were less commonly reported, the use of traditional medicine in these cases was proportionally high er than for more common ailments. These statistics a lso mirrored the findings of the healer survey, in which the healers most commonly reported treating gastro -intestinal issues, followed by fevers of various types, muscolo -skeletal conditions, liver disor ders, and skin complaints. However, some healers such as Vilaysack described themselves as specialists in certain areas such as cancer , emphasising that they mainly received patient with chronic and severe health conditions. Figure 10: Proportional use of biomedicine and traditional medicine according to health problem and number of illness episodes in Phamuk village. 97 Another distinction is the private versus public sphere of healthcare provision. As these modalities are often operated by the same people, the distinction is mostly a matter of cost and convenience. The local health centres, healthworkers, state and military hospitals represented public healthcare, whilst the private sector included the regul ated pharmacies and clinics (which might include packaged herbal medicines), and the unregulated sphere, traditional medicine practitioners, travelling sellers of injections, pills or packaged herbal decoctions, and practitioners of spiritual hea ling (blow ing, divination, exorcists), including Buddhist clergy (Table 3) . As Figure 11 shows, public healthcare was used almost twice as much as private modalities, with 16% of conditions treated with both. Interestingly, these proportions are almost th e same as for biomedicine and traditional medicine, reflecting perhaps the predominance of traditional medicine within the informal and private sector. The pattern was also similar according to the type of disease (Figure 12).

Figur e 11: Proportion of illness episodes in Phamuk village in which public or private healthcare, or both, were accessed (%) 99 These overlaps point to the fact that people often accessed more than o ne healthcare facility for the same illness. Figure 13 shows the number of places people reported seeking treatment for the same illness episode. Whilst more than half only visited one place, almost 30% visited two places, and 10% visited three places. A m uch smaller proportion (less than 3%) visited four or five places . As shown in Figure 14, conditions which include more extensive treatment -seeking included fever episodes, digestive an d liver conditions.

This is comparable with Brun & Schumacher's research in Nor thern Thailand during the 1980s (Brun & Schumacher 1994). Observation of patients being treated by the healers also indicated also that acute and high fevers were rarely seen; most had low -level or chronic fever. Treatment of mild children's fevers was qui te common . Figure 15: Use of treatment modalities by people experiencing fever in Phamuk village (n=62) Why use traditional medicine? What explains these patterns of seeking care? And especially, why do people use traditional medicine? Exploring treatment -seeking behaviour is a complex issue, as decisions are rarely based on systems of causal reasoning (Last 1981), and are likely to be influe nced by which commodities are available (Nichter 19 96b). Indeed, it is questionable whet her free choice is really possible, as this omits to acknowledge that medicine is part of a larger field of political or economic power (Brodwin 1996). So, what most influenced the use of healthcare? Whilst proximity was an important factor in terms of acc ess, it was also noticeable that people were willing to travel long distances to consult practitioners who had the reputation of being able to cure thei r particular problems. People and their families affected by chronic illnesses would also invest signifi cant sums of money into care that had been recommended by others traditional by residents of Phamuk village101 village, o ther than the hospital, which was located only 4km from the villag e, the most used healthcare options were offered by residents of the village with significant social rol es. Indeed, behind binary distinctions such as biomedical/traditional and public/private was a heterogenous medical landscape in which modalities of he althcare are not necessarily distinct, but rather intertwine. The village healthworker , Dr. Sipha, was a lso a public health officer, and medicine seller . The village pharmacy was run by a doctor from the hospital and his family. The district hospital direc tor ran a private clinic, also selling packaged herbal medicines. The village healer, P o Nueang , had bee n a military healthworker during 1960s - 70s and still occupied an honorary local administrative role , being often called upon to officiate both spiritual and official occasions. As Alvesson (2013) comments, \"in describing a health system, the concepts of p ublic/private health institutions and biomedical/traditional medicines are often used. These distinctions are useful analytically but should be conceptu alized on a conceptualized on a continuum which allows for overlaps. This is especially true in Laos \" (Alvesson 2013:2) . When negotiating government healthcare, people still explained their choices through social and familial connection; for example, those who had a relative working in a particular hospital or were able to utilise military healthcare as they had a child in the m ilitary. In other words, it was necessarily not about the type of medicine provided, but the relationship with a particular practitioner. Dr. Sipha is an example of this. During the time we spend together conducting household interview s, she knows many of the health conditions of the villagers already, and is clearly well -trusted. She uses the opportunity to sell pills for stomach problems or colds, one or two at a time, from a small medical box. Likewise Po Nueang often jokes that he i s \"better than the ho spital\" because most people in the village have consulted him at some point. Uptake of healthcare was thus strongly mediated by social connection, more than access, cost or preference for particular types. Arguably, this was also a rea ction to what Buchner (2011) observed as mistrust of government care and to a generalised anxiety about seeking treatment without the protection afforded by prior knowledge of the person providing it , or paying extra costs . Utilising one's social capital a nd network minimised the risks involved in negotiating care. As Bochaton (2015) observed in a study o f cross -border health seeking in the same province, even the process of seeking care in Thailand is strongly influenced by social networks; these affected the choice of healthc are provider more than socio -economic or spatial factors. Likewise, in neighbouring Saravane province, local information sharing 102 could lead to increased antibiotic intake, even if the original source advised the opposite (Haenssgen et al. 201 9). It is important also to note that, as shown in Figure s 13 and 1 4, people did not always just access one h ealth option exclusively, but often used them in combination . Although biomedicine was more widely used overall , in 16% of illness episode s the use of biomedical and traditional medicine was combined (Figure 9). Conditions such as gastro -intestinal illness, fever episodes and liver disease in which more places were accessed were also those in which traditional medicine was popular. In seeking care, peopl e predominantly framed their preferences in pragmatic terms, such as : \"I don't know which is better yet, I just try them out to see if they can help me .\" Or, statements about effect: \"Ya luang works quickly but it doesn't really cure. Ya phue n mueang takes time, but it cures completely .\" \"Ya luang is effective, but is toxic if you take it for more than a few days .\" Counting the number of places accessed also does not take into account the frequency of visits to each place . Treatment from the healers typically involves repeated visits or long stays (see Chapter 6). In government healthcare, a s Buchner (2011) points out, even if overall public health facility u tilization is low, this often involves multiple visits for the same illness episode . This tendency to consult both multiple places for treatment and repeated visits has also been observed in studies of care -seeking for malaria (Bourdy et al, in press; Nona ka at al. 2009). Furthermore, home -management of illness is often the first method used at the onset of the problem (Buchner 2011 ; Nonaka et al. 2009 ). Indeed, c ontrary to common stereotypes o f traditional medicine as primary healthcare, my research demonstrated that traditional medicine was more often used as part of complex healthcare -seeking strategies or a s a response to chronic illness . Among the patients staying at Vilaysack's house are Kanti, a local Lao coffee farmer in his 20s who is here with his parents . Kanti describes his symptoms: \"I have had a heaviness in my head ( nak hua ) that won't go away [makes a movement like fainting] and hard painful shoulders ( keng ba ) for 5 months already. I spent 3 days in Pakse hospital on an IV ( ya song nam ), and also went to a private clinic , but it didn't help. \" 103 He's been staying at Vilaysack 's place for 2 months already but isn't feeling better . His mother says: \"I'm so worried about my son! He's our only son, we just have 2 younger daughters, and he's not married yet - so there is nobody to look after him, and now that he can't work on the f arm we're struggling for money. We paid 5 million kip ($ 600) already in medical costs - we had to sell land and other things to pay for this - and even though we don't have to pay for treatment with Vilaysack, we still have to buy many things. The hospital told us it was sen pasat (nerves), but I don't think they're right - I think the cause was khai mak de ng (fever with red spots, measles). I hope that he will get better soon. \" His father says: \"I'm not sure yet if traditional medicine is good or not, beca use he's not cured yet . I think the cause was drinking too much alcohol; after this Kanti didn't want to eat or sleep .\" Wen , in his 40s, is from a village on the Bolaven plateau , of Lawen ethnicity . He's a rubber farmer, helped by his six sons - they sell rubber to the Vietnamese, but he cannot work at the moment. He suffers from pain in his stomach (chep tong) , 'nerves' ( sen pasat) and liver inflammation aksep tab). He also has a headache, anaemia (lueat chang) and is tired, and has a problem with his ey es - his vision is blurry ( ta mua ) and he feels dazzled ( lai ta ). He looks tired and thin. \"I have inflammation and spots in my stomach and intestines ( aksep lamsai, toum) and feel very hot inside. I don't know what the cause was - maybe something to do with food, in the past I ate everything, many things! Maybe I drank too much alcohol. I went to many places for treatment already - Pakse hospital, the military hospital ne ar Pakse, the Vietnamese hospital in Paksong . I had 3 'echoes' in the Vietnamese hospi tal and a lot of injections ( sak ya ), but the medicine was not correct ( bo thu ek). I stayed in the military hospital for four or five days - it helped the pain, but it di dn't cure me, and it was really expensive - 2 million kip [$240]. But this is still ch eaper than the provincial hospital, which is why people prefer to go there. I have these medicines that I got there - I stopped taking them now, do you know what they are? [shows three packets of tablets including amoxycillin]. I knew Ajan Vilaysack becaus e he treats so many people in this area - here the treatment is very cheap, you just have to give a donation and pay your own expenses. I've been here for a few weeks already , and t he pain is already better but I'm not cured yet ( bo sao), my abdomen is sti ll hot and painful , although I hope I will be soon. He's giving me decoctions ( ya tom), grinding medicine ( ya fon ). I also did a su kh uan ceremony with a monk in a temple in Bajiang [he has strings around his wrist] - it's good to do when you're ill. \" On m y next visit, Wen has left , and Vilaysack said it was because he's feeling better and has taken medicine to drink at home, although I cannot speak to Wen to verify this. His descrip tion shows how closely the choice of practitioner is associated with social connection 104 and reputation. Both his narrative, as well as those given by Kanti and his parents show the complexity of their care -seeking journeys, during which they had already invested substantial sums of money . The economic losses due to the cost of he althcare and inability to work can deeply impact the whole family's wellbeing . The narratives demonstrat e that medicine use is approached pragmatically , in which the use o f multiple methods is deemed necessary in order to provide the possibility of a cure. Conclusion This chapter sets the scene for the rest of the thesis , describing the particular geographical and historical context of Champasak province , and the picture of illness and health systems in contemporary Laos . It sketches the medical landsca pe, and show s how different medical modalities are accessed in combination. Traditional medicine use is often part of complex treatment -seeking strategies, espe cially for chronic illness. I argue that this is strongly influenced by relationships with pract itioners and reputation. Chapters 5 - 8 draw this out further, showing the importance of the practi tioner's reputation , perceived moral character, their interaction with patients during the therapeutic encounter, economic practices, and more broadly the si gnificance of relationships in establishing health. 105 Chapter 3: 'Plants are like People': the production of medicinal knowledge Introduction In this chapter, I continue the process of defining traditional medicine in Laos, focusing on knowledge form s and production : what and how people know about using plants as medicine . The previous chapter demonstrated the complexity of the medical landscape, and the healthcare seeking journeys undertaken by people experiencing states of sickness that include trad itional medicine. In this chapter, I dissect more closely the knowledge production of ya phuen mueang , primarily plant -based local medicines used by healers and villagers in Champasak . I analyse how knowledge is constructed and transmitted , emphasising how this relates to use and context. Firstly, I discuss 'thinking with plants'. What does the way in which plants are grouped and named reveal about the production of medicinal knowledge in lowland Laos? I explore how plants are classified, noting cross -cultu ral similarities in how plants are defined as medicine. With an emphasis on practitioners' engagement with plant forms, I suggest that a close examination of the nomenclature and organisation of plants, and of the material object of the plant itself, provi des insights into medicinal applic ations. Then, I examine how knowledge is applied in practice. The general term or category for medicine or medicinal , ya, is both flexible and functional. Wide knowledge of plant names which infer medicinal use s suggests t hat a level of tacit knowledge exists among rural lowlanders . Knowledge about medicinal plants is generated, negotiated and shared in social encounters involving plants . Rather than being fixed, this is innovat ed through people 's practical engagement with the landscape and each other . This collective knowledge may be subjective, gendered, and produced through non -linear means ; it can shift hierarchies and establish relations. 106 In contrast, the healer 's knowledge is specific , indivi dualised and based on a body of transmitted information . It may be is revealed, hidden, or shared according to the context and who is asking. This is shown through the process of learning traditional medicine, in which the healers transmit and record their knowledge through differe nt methods , but follow similar principles . Thinking with plants In rural Laos, theories of traditional knowledge production which intersect with plant use and ecological knowledge are particularly relevant. Modernised As ian medical systems now often separate the skills of practitioners, pharmacists and of plant cultivation or collection . However, the rural Lao healer must be adept at all aspects of medicine production. Whilst 'traditional medicine' may refer to a diverse range of practices ( as discussed in Chapter 2 ), plants are involved in all methods used by the healer s.24 The ability to recogni se and use plants effectively is crucial to success as a practitioner. So how do people 'think with plants', and why is this important? L\u00e9vi-Strauss 's famous assertion that \"animals are good to think [with]\", implies that an exploration of 'natural' lifeforms can provide insights into the ways in which people think; indeed, that a structure of human thinking might be found in common across all societies (L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1966 [1962]). The categorisation of lifef orms, or certain anomalies, can reveal information about societal preoccupations (Douglas 1957; Bulmer 1967). Certainly , in lowland southern Laos, practical engagement with plants is an easy way of generating i nformation . Interaction involving plants promp ts discussion about names, places where they are found, uses, edibility, and on illness and health. Relationships between and with plants emerged as a recurring theme in my field research. The organisation and naming of plants in emic perspective has long been a preoccupation of ethnobotany, related more broadly to structural anthropology. This has focused primarily on whether, as L\u00e9vi-Strauss suggested, universal principles of classification exist, and furtherm ore, whether indigenous classifications are re lated to the Linnaean system of nomenclature. As Ellen (2006) observes, the latter is significant insofar as it represents a necessary process of \"translation \", in order to render data analysable at a cross -cultural 24 Even methods which involve no ingestion of medicines, such as blowing, bone -setting or healing ritual utilise pla nts, as shown in later chapters. 107 level, especially when exploring concept s of efficacy in medicinal plants. Berlin (1973) demonstrated that, in many cases , there is relatively high correspondence in indigenous and Linnaean classificatio ns at the genus level. This is not surprising, as it is likely that the 'Linnaean grid' was based on pre -existing systems of classification (Berlin 1973; Atran 1998). However, beyond this, the equating of Latin binomials with local names is not of great conceptual intere st.25 It should be remembered tha t the use of this Latin -based classification system is not necessarily based on phylogenetic closeness (as demonstrated by recent advances in plant genetics) , and is a product of specific historical circumstances (Hunn 2006 ). These common conceptual simil arities between 'folk' and 'scientific' taxonomies thus also point to questions about whether there are universal cross -cultural features of classification schemes. Using insights from evolutionary science, Atran proposes t here is evidence for universal m odes of cognition, and that \"such taxonomies are products of an autonomous, natural classification scheme of the human mind \" (1998: 567) . Berlin (1973) ma kes a convincing case for universal schema, drawing on a wide range of case studies . These show ed to wh at extent people worldwide \"recognise the same discontinuities in the natural world, particularly at the level of something analogous to 'species' \" (Dwyer 2005: 12). In contrast, Bulmer focused on language universals and morphological similarities among higher order categories within local taxonomies. These higher order categories are, he argues, the level at which culture most determines taxonomies , such as in the case of the cassowary which is not defined as a bird (Bulmer 1967). Bulmer differentiate s between general and special classifications, with emphasis on the cultural significance of certain types , a distinction also made by Ellen (2003) . This latter category include s functional purposes such as medicine. My data on medicinal plant classification, as I will show in the following section, demonstrates that plant naming and grouping follows a common pattern . It also shows that 'medicine' is a clearly defined functional category . From a classificatory perspective, the results thus appear to concur wit h these aspects of both Berlin (1973) and Bulmer 's (1967) theories. These classification methods are useful in providing a conceptual structure for the researcher to organi se their ideas, or 'think with plants' . But, what can they tell us about knowledge i n use? 25 Therefore, I have not attempted to explore the similarities in local and Linnaean nomenclature in my data from a quant itative perspective . 108 At this point, my analysis diverges from Berlin & Bulmer. As Ellen argues, whilst it is clear that cultures worldwide tend to categorise the natural world in similar ways, structured methods of ethno -classification which focus strongly on nomenclat ure may ignore the social contexts of classification, and concurrent variation in knowledge (Ellen 2006: S6 -8). This \"classificatory f allacy\" may stem from the assumption that categories ascribed are based on underlying cultural structures rather than the result of a n often spontaneous \"classifying act\" (Ellen 2008 ). Classical ethnobotanical approaches perhaps fail ed to acknowledge that people's knowledge of the natural world is derived from their engagement with their local environments (Dwyer 2005). In ot her words, knowledge is contextual; in order to interrogate how and why plants are grouped and used in specific ways, it is necessary to understand what this means in practice. Classi ficatory processes can thus be understoo d as: \"...situationally adapted and dynamic devices of practical importance to their users, reflecting an interaction - though in a by no means self -evident way - between culture, psychology and discontinuities in the concrete world; a lexical and semantic field firmly embedded in a wider c ontext of beliefs and social practice s (Ellen 1993 :3). Moving beyond the structuralist approach to explore the phenomenological aspects of knowledge production, the concept of T raditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) provides an alternative perspective . TEK explor es functional relationships, rather than static systems, between people, and people -environmental interactions . To counter the problematic notion of traditional knowledge as static, Ingold & Kurttila (2000) propose two contrasting but connected conce pts: \"traditional knowledge as enframed in the discourse (MTK) , which refers to the transgenerational transmissio n of a particular body of 'cultural' knowledge including recipes and prescriptions, in parallel with the metaphorical movement o f bodily substance (blood) through genealogy. The other, \"traditional knowledge as generated in the practices of locality\" (LTK) is \"continually generated and regenerated within the contexts of peoples' skilled, practical involvement with significant compo nents of the environment\" (Ingold & Kurttila 2000 :184). The fundamental difference, they argue, is the distinction between think ing of tradition as either \"substance \" or \"process \"; of the person as a \"container \" of knowledge, or as the one who knows throug h the means of practice. The first type isolates the intergenerational transmission of knowledge from environmentally situated experience. The second approach to knowledge stemming from 'doing ' is rooted both in the phenomenology of Merleau -Ponty (1962), who emphasised 109 the significance of the body as the mediator of habit, as well as Heidegger, who conceptualised the self -environment relations (Hsu 2010). In exploring an ecological approach to knowledge, Ingold has also described this practical knowledge as \"enskilment\", which is associated not just with the \"biophysical entity\" of the human body, but \"the total field of relations\" between the person and their environment\" (Ingold 2000:353). From a research perspective, doing ethnography is thus necessary to show the rela tionship \"between knowledge and enskilment\" (Ellen 2006: S8; Ellen 2003 ). This demonstrates the relevance of interlinking approaches from ethnobotany and anthropology in exploring traditional medicinal knowledge. Although I would suggest that Ingold & Kurtt ila over -emphasise the distinction between MTK and LTK, their framework is useful in encapsulating the range of perspectives on traditional knowledge. In describing medical traditions, especially in Asia, a dichotomy is commonly drawn betwee n locally -created \"folk\" knowledge, and a body of textual knowledge and specific teachings based on a formal diagnostic system , often referred to as \"codified \" (Bodeker 2010; Leonti 2011 ; Spire 190 7). These are associated with oral and textual patte rns of knowledge transmission. The reality, I propose, is rather more fluid, and even these formalised systems are constantly in a process of adapt ation. Through the application of textual knowledge, practitioners generate new techniques and methods by practical experience, as I will show in Chapter 4 . Csordas (1993) argues for the importance of understanding the body as the means by which culture is created, rather than a vessel upon which it is inscribed. Taking this as a starting point, we can argue then that e ven these 'bodies' of cultural knowledge are exp ressed through bodily actions. In the Lao context, as I have discussed, it is difficult to define 'Lao traditional medicine ' according to a shared body of textual knowledge. Therefore, these discussions are particularly relevant. Rather than relying on stereotypes of non-literate folk medicine as espoused by Spire (1907), it is then necessary to take a deeper look at epistemologies in practice. 110 Medicine In the previous chapter (2), I outlined the medica l landscape and a diverse range of practices which can be roughly classified into ya phuen mueang (traditional medicine) and ya luang (biomedicine) . In defining 'medicine', an examination of terminology thus reveals one broad category with flexible connota tions which cuts across these distinctions : ya. The term ya is used to refer to a potent substance, something which has the ability to enact a noticeable effect on the body or mind. This may include pharmaceuticals, injections, IV solutions, vitamin supple ments, herbal medicines, animal or mineral products, illicit drugs or tobacco. Ya refers to a material substance which enters the body in some way . The term would not be applied to substances used only for ritual purposes, or magical plants used for protec tion through being concealed on the body. Thus, ya must be p rocessed in some way in order to enter the body and effect change, even if simply through the act of chewing bitter leaves. When encountering an unfamiliar plant , an often -asked question is \"pen y a bo?\" \" Is it/can it be medicine?\" 26 The question is not \"is this a plant -medicine?\", but by using the simple term ya, conceptually place s it in the same category as other potent substances. Similarly, a common request, especially from the elderly, or thos e in poor health, was \" mi ya bo? \" (have any medicine? ), without reference to a particular type. This perhaps implied that increas ing the quantity of ya would lead to a better outcome; it was always desirable to possess more ya. Thus, in characteris ing med icinal plants in Laos , we can approach and describe t heir categorisation from different perspectives. Firstly, plants which are described as ya are part of a broader category of substances considered to enact noticeable effects when entering the person's b ody. Secondly, the category of medicinal plants can b e distinguished from other categories such as food and magical plants ; however, a plant may fall into more than one category. This has implications for the way in which knowledge spreads, as opportunitie s for sharing medicinal ideas may arise whilst eating together or during use of plants in other activities. 26 Ya, like many Lao terms, does not function solely as a noun (see note on languag e). Depending on its position in the sentence, ya may also be descrip tive or a qualifier. The use of the adjectival term pen also implies a dynamic quality or future potential, so pen ya bo also can be understood as 'can it become medicine?'. See Enfield ( 2003) for a full discussion of the flexibility of Lao grammar accordi ng to word order. 111 Thirdly, plants defined as medicine follow certain patterns, shared qualities or names which give clues as to their use. As I will show, the se patterns of plant naming and classification are widely known , suggesting tacit knowledge of medicinal uses. Specific therapeutic applications and individual ised knowledge sets, such as herbal prescriptions, are known primarily by those define themselves as traditional healers \u2014 mo ya phuen mueang . How ever, this category of ya is also functional, flexible and circumstantial. A plant becomes ya when it is used as medicine , or if it has the potential to be medicinal after a process of trans formation . Therefore, a plant is medicinal due partly to innate qualities but also to its use as medicine. As Vilaysack told me , when I asked him about the species in his garden , \"Every plant is a medicine, if you know how to use it.\" Medicinal p lant names The names of medic inal plants in my fieldsites, as given by interlocuters, were consistent with each other, other than instances where a plant was known to have more than one name .27 It is said by healers and traditional medicine experts that the same plant names are used by Lao speakers within the three regions of Laos, the northern, central, and southern areas, which roughly correspond to the three kingdoms of the 18th - 20th centur ies.28 The names I recorded were those commonly in use in the southern part of the country, in Champasak and neighbouring provinces (Sekong, Attapeu, Saravane ). The patterns I will discuss were also partly described by the French botanist Jules Vidal in the 1950s, with some variation according to location , suggesting that plant names have not chang ed since the French colonial era at least (Vidal 1959 ).29 On first glance, characteristics of emic Lao plant classification appear to be similar to the system proposed by Berlin (1973), in which classification of plants is closely allied to nomenclature. Plants which are considered similar or to have some shared quality also share the same generic name. Similar to Berlin's \"primary lexemes\" , these names may be 27 The data I examine is drawn from plants which were used for medicinal purposes, and I do not attempt to extrapolate this to all plants. However, I did not discern any noticeable difference in the naming structure for plants used for oth er purposes. 28 See Chapter 5 for a fuller discussion. This does not of course include the rich variation of plant names among other language speakers. 29 The same plant name may also refer to different species which share similar characteristics in different parts of the country - see later discussion of van hom. 112 analysable (i.e. have a translatable meaning) or not. The individual plant name usually (but not al ways) follows a binomial format, in which an adjectival term is added to the generic name . This gives distinguishing details about the individual \"generic species\" (as defined by Berlin), usually morphological qualities. Figure 14: Medicinal plant name structure in Lao language Figure 14 and Table 4 show the structure of Lao medicinal plant names , and a more detailed table showing how plants are grouped according to the generic name is shown in Appendix 9. The generic name is combined with one, or some times two modifiers which give descriptive detail - these are placed after the generic name, crea ting a binomial. Before the generic name there may be a prefix which describes the lifeform of the plant - but, if this comes after the generic name it will be a modifier . Additionally, if it is written as part of a medicinal prescription, t he plant part used (e.g. root) is added at the beginning. The naming structure is thus cumulative - the position of each term can alter the meaning , and e ach additional word adds more detail, making it easier to more precisely identify the plant .30 This is a common feature of analytic languages such as Lao (Enfield, 2003). Therefore, the length of a plant name is dictated by how much information the namer wants to convey, rathe r than being fixed. In the example given in Table 4, the name of the plant is (hak) ton ka kuang khao: (root of) tree eye deer white. The generic name is ta (eye) - this is a group of trees in which the knots in the bark are said to look like eyes. It is t wice modified - kuang (deer) describes the size of the 'eye' (deer eye), and khao (white) refers to the colour of the wood when the bark is peeled away . The term ton (tree) refers to the lifeform type, and the term hak (root) infers that this part is used for medicine, but is not part of the name itself. However, this plant might also be referred to simply by the generic name ta kuang if additional detail about identification or use is not needed. 30 From a linguistic perspective, the generic name is the superordinate and the modifiers are t he subordinate (see Rosch & Lloyd 1978). 113 Example (Lao name ) Example (translation) 1 Part used Part of plant used in medicine e.g. root, leaf, bark Hak Root 2 Lifeform Type of plant e.g. tree, vine , grass Ton Tree 3 Generic name Ta Eye 4 Modifier Descriptive term e.g. colour, size, location Kuang Deer 5 Modifier (optional second) Khao Whit e Table 4: Lao p lant naming structure with example However, not all medicinal plants follow this pattern. There are some plants with stand - alone names which do not follow the generic name - modifier pattern , for example sam phan hu ('three thousand holes', Hydnophytum formicarum Jack) . More examples are shown in Appendix 9. Lifeforms There is no generalised word for 'plant' in Lao, although the term phuet31 or kok (mai) may be used. Vegetal types are delineated into different life forms, whic h are summarized in Table 5. The lifeform term describes the shape of the plant ; the use of this lifeform term a s a prefix to the generic name denotes the physical qualities of the plant, and/or its use . As a classifying term,32 kok is used for s omething tall and straight; dok for flowers and other rounded objects, and mak for swollen shapes. These terms are combined with mai to show that they describe a plant form. The term mai, when used alone, means 'wood'. It can also be descriptive, so a tree which is commonly used in const ructing houses would be named mai. Plants named phak (vegetable, herb) are usually edible . Van are used for their specific properties (pungent underground parts) in both medicinal and magical applications (see Chapter 5) . 31 Phuet comes from the Sanskrit/Pali for seeds/seedlings . 32 There are numerous specific classifiers in Lao, which usually reference the shape or type of thing. 114 Lao term Meaning/description Kok, kokmai General term referring to larger plants (trees, large shrubs) or to reference that something is a plant Ton, tonmai Tree Nya Grass, herb33 Phak Vegetab le, herb Khuea Liana, vine an underground 'head' such as rhizomes, tubers or bulbs as opposed to simple roots Het Mushroom, fungi Dok, dokmai Flower, flowering plant Mak, ton mak Fruit, p lant which has fruit/fruit -like organs Van Some, but not all, monocotyledonous low-lying plants with rhizo mes, bulbs or tubers , often with pungent odours when the rhizome is cut Table 5: Lao plant and fungi forms Khuea khao ho (Tinospora Crispa) When plants are used as medicine, the lifeform may also denote the part which is used a s medicine . For example, khuea khao ho ('vine at the gate', Tinospora crispa L.) is a widely used 33 According to Vidal (1958), nya applies to herbaceous as well as subligneous or even woo dy species up to 2m tall. 115 plant whose bitter -tasting woody liana (khuea) is chopped into pieces and boiled or soaked in alcohol for use against fevers, taken as a tonic, or rubbed on t he breast when a mother wants the child to stop feeding. Table 6 shows names of the parts of the plant which are used as medicine. When mentione d for medicinal uses, such as in herbal prescription s, the plant part may be added as an additional prefix - for example , bai mak nao (leaf of lemon tree) . This denot es that the leaf is the part to be used as medicine in this prescription . Thus, when recording medicinal plant names, it is not always clear whether the prefix refers to the type of lifeform, or the par t used for medicine.

In other words , it may be named descriptively according to characteristics or use , or have a name whic h cannot be easily translated . Examples of commonly used groups of medicinal plants s hown in Appendix 9 include the root names toum ka seng, nang, sama t, khai, tin tang, kapuk . Plant groups are named according to a shared quality, as shown in Table 7. 116 Grouping principle Explanation Example (s) Physical aspect Plants have an observable morphological similarity Toum ka ('swelling') . All toum ka group have distinctive sphe rical fruit and oval - shaped leaves with vertical lines, representing 'swelling', and characteristic for Strychnos species. Toum is also a term for spots or swellings in the body. Function Plants are used in the same way Kapuk and Kabuk , which are used in same way to treat malaria (slice the rhizome, boil and drink until lips itch). Disorder Plants are named and grouped according to or resemble the disorder they are said to treat. Padong , the name of both a category of plants and a category of disorders affecting the structural parts of the body which the plants named padong are used to treat. The plants also resemble the different forms of the disease in the body. Body part Plants resemble a body part. Nom ('breast ' or 'nipple '), used for post - partum and milk production. The name also refers to the spiky protuberances on the trunk said to resemble breasts, nipples or udders. Smell/taste Plants have a similar smell and/or taste Si khai - all have a lemony smell e.g. hua si khai (lemongrass). Resemblance Plants show resemblance to another lifeform Ta (eye), such as eye of chicken (ta kai) or deer (ta kuang), where the fruit looks like an eye. Ien (eel) has long thin roots that resemble an eel. Metaphorical/ symbolic meaning Plant name has a metaphorical/symbolic meaning Plant names representative of strength which also give strength or have a powerful effect - kamlang sueakhong (tiger power ), pa nya (king of plants ), sang nao (elephant pulls bamboo), seng buea (poisonous weapon ). Relationship Relationship to another lifeform Ngua sang (cow hates it ), because it is too spiky for the cow to eat, ling ngo (monkey can't reach it ), because the fruit is high up on a long branch . Table 7: Plant grouping principles according to generic name 117 These categories of generic name frequently cross over , especially when considering their relationship to medicinal uses, as discussed later. Where the generic name gathers several plants together with different classifiers , the groups ma y or may not be similar in terms of Linnaean classifications. Plant groups which have similar morphology include species all from the same genus (e.g. toum ka - Strychnos genus (Table 8), khem - Ixora genus, ien - Eurycoma genus) . Groups with quite differe nt lifeforms, such as si khai, where the unifying factor is the smell, show greater variation in botanical classification (Table 9). Likewise, plants which from a botanical perspective would be grouped similarly are named differently in Lao classification with no unifying lifeform. An example of this is bamboos , for which there is no generic term. As Vidal (1963) observes, very often this naming is utilitaria n, i.e., based on use. Appendix 9 gives more examples.

Roots of ien dam (indet.) & ien don (Eurycoma Harmandia). Roots look like eel (ien). 119 Modifiers Plants which have the same generic name are further differentiated within groups with between 2 an d 10 (usually 3 - 5) types, with one or more modifying terms , which come after the root name , as shown in Tables 8 and 9. These are predominantly morphological, easily observable differences which enables the person collecting to easily identify the differ ence between types . Table 10 shows common modifiers (for more examples see Appendix 9). The term thammada (ordinary, medium) may also be used to define the most commonly used types. The white form of the plant is usually considered to be the 'ordinary' o ne, such as ya nang khao (Tiliacora triandra (Colebr.) Diels ), commonly found in the garde n and used as a food plant. Use of modifying terms are also relative and may not correspond to botanical differences at species level. For example, leaves from the gu ava tree (bai mak sida) are used to treat dengue when they are considered to have a reddis h colouring (bai mak sida deng), differentiated from the green guava (bai mak sida kiao), but both are identified to the needle -like quality of the flowers. In this example, the colour distinction is very clear, but may be less obvious if a tree bark must be peeled away or the roots cut open. 120 Table 10: Common modifying terms for p lant names 34 Vidal (1962) also notes the following locations included as modifiers: b\u00f4k = terrestrial, d\u00f4ng - dense forest, kh\u00f4k = open forest 35 Some plants in Laos may be described as male or female according to their morphology. However, t his does not correspond to notions of plant gender such as in Amazonian societies (Freedman, 2010), and is, as Vidal (1963) observes, a less common method of specification compared to other classifie rs. Modifying term Explanatio n/examples Colours The colour (red, yellow, white, green or black) refers to the colour of the trunk after the bark is peeled away, of the root after it has been cut, the fruit after it is cut open, or a combination. In some cases, it can also refer to th e colour of the flower, leaves or wood. Size The relative size of the plant compared to others in the group, including large, small, short, tall, long. Shapes The shapes made by plant parts, including: Protuberances found on stem - curved, hooked ngo (curved padong ), padong kho (padong and shape of nodules/spikes e.g. nom ngua (cow nipples), nom ngu (mice nipples). Leaf - described as large, small, long, round, having many strands e.g. khuea pu san bai mun (betel peppe r with round leaves), khuea pu soi (betel pepper with many leaf strands). Flower or fruit e.g. ta kai (chicken eye), ta kuang (deer eye) - different size fruits. Quality Another quality such as shiny, poisonous e.g. seng buea (poisonous weapon), seng suem (shiny weapon). Flavour Usually contrast of sweet and sour e.g. mak kham wan (sweet tamarind), mak kham som (sour tamarind). Texture Such as the skin of fruit e.g. mak mi nang (jackfruit with tough skin), mak mi fai (jackfruit with soft skin). Lifeform When lifeform term (see above) is used as a modifier it denotes plants placed in the same group but different forms e.g. si khai ton and si khai khuea (the tree and vine types of lemon -smelling family). Location The place where the plant is found, such as at the house, in different places in the forest, by water, on the mountain; e.g. mak kham nam (tamarind tree by water), mak kham kok (tamarind tree found in open forest), khi lek ban (khi lek cultivated or growin g near house), khi lek pa (wild khi lek found in the forest).34 Gender Male/female forms (pu/mae). The root name is modified with pu (male) often with spikes on the stem, or mae (female) with bulbous hanging fruit or flowers.35 121 'Plants are like People' \"Phuet khe kan khon ! Plants are the same as people!\" Phaiboun, the pharmacist from CRH TM department said th ese words to me as I puzzled over a mysterious -sounding concept I'd heard the healers talk about , phitsanu .36 Was it found in plants, or in people? \"It's in both - they're the same\" , he answered . Similari ties between plant and human bod ies also emerged when I asked questions about classification . Phaiboun and Simon the gardener arrived one day with the hospital t ruck filled with woody tree parts to make post -partum decoctions, one of their most popular medicines. All had the generic name nom (meaning sw elling), with the animal terms as a classifier : nom ngua (cow), nom ngu (mouse) and nom sao (woman). Finally, aft er much laughter at my failure to understand, they pointed at the external protuberances on the bark. These, they explained, looked like a breast or nipple (another meaning of nom), shaped like those belonging to a woma n - nom sao (Pterygota alata (Roxb.) R. Br or acuminata Benth.) . Nom ngua (cow's breast) has long thin nodules, like a cow udder - it is also called ngua sang (cow hates it ) as it is too spiky to eat. In post-partum, th is mixture is popularly given to women used to s timulate milk production - easily remembered because of the resemblance to the milk -producing part of an animal or human. This section thus explores how plants are 'like people ' from the perspective of medicinal uses and their classification as medicine. Medicinal uses The exa mple of the 'red' guava given earlier demonstrates another grouping principle when plants are defined as medicine. In some groups with a generic name such as padong, toum ka and ya nang, every member is used as medicine . In other groups , certain individual plants have medicinal uses, whereas others do not, such as khem, kadon , mak kham, mak mueang . Although there is no rule for this, certain patterns are noticeable based on the modifier . For example, in fruit trees (e.g. tamarind, ma ngo, star fru it), the sour rather than the sweet type is used as a medicine against toxicity (mak kham som, sour tamarind; mak mueang kaso, sour mango). Popular Lao sayings such as khom pen ya (bitter is medicine) imply that certain tastes are associated with medicinal qualities . 36 Phitsanu can be understood as the active principle of the healers' medicines - this is discussed in detail in Chapter 5. 122 As the following chapter show s, there is a tendency for two or more plants from a group with the same generic name to be used together in herbal prescriptions. Medicina l uses within a group are usually similar , making it easier to recall and understand the use of each plant . The modifier gives clues about more specific uses of each. The colour is perhaps the most consistent ly used modifier , as it infers that the plant wi ll be effective for the same coloured body part. As a general rule, the white type can be used for gynaecological disorders , the white fluids and also as a general tonic ; the red type is the most powerful and used to strengthen the blood ; and the yellow type is used for disorders of the liver, bile, digestive system a nd jaundice , and to remove toxicity from the body . This is shown in the ya nang group (Table 11) , which has three types, all distinguished by colour: white, or ordinary (ya nang khao/ ( ya nang deng). The colour is determined by a combination of the flower colour , the colour found inside the root (the used pa rt), and the leaves (see photos below) . All are used for women's health, as implied in the name ya nang (women's medicine) . Grouping principle Name Modifier Used for Species Family Part used Uses (women's disorders, fever, tonic), bitter, morpholo gy (liana with alternate leaves), found in the garden Ya nang khao White Tonic, improves appetite, detoxification, fever, uterus/ pregnancy, to harmonise prescription lueang Yellow Fever, detoxification, improves appetite, for phit kam (post partum illness) Limacia triandra Miers Root Ya nang deng Red Malaria, fever, improves appetite, strengthens blood , detoxification Bauhinia strychnifo lia Craib nang Limacia khao (leaves and liana), Tiliacora triandra 124 Colour may also be the unifying factor of a group with similar medicinal uses, such as the khi min (turmeric) group , which are yellow -coloured and treat yellowness or the 'yellow' parts of the body, such as the digestive system, liver, and fever with yellow eyes and skin (Table 12). Of those identified species, there is little botanical commonality - the most widely used is khi min with a 'head' (hua khi min , Curcuma Longa L.), and khuea, Combretum latifolium Blume ), which has a bright yellow colour when cut . Table 12: Khi min (turmeric) group Grouping principle Name Modifier Used for Species Family Part used Yellow colour Khi min khuea Vine Fever with yellow eyes and face, jaundice Combretum latifolium Blume Combretacea e Root, of stoma Longa L.

Si khai are warming aromatic plants often used in sauna , treating cold disorders in the body , or used to repel insects . Morphological qualities such as the shape of certain parts may also give clues as to use. One example of this is the category of padong plants, which are used for cases of general body pain (padong, buad) or sometimes paralysis (loy). Padong is an illness category stemming from an internal bodily weakness, often in the blood, which affect e the structural portions of the body such as bones, sinews or fluids. It is also the generic name given to a category of medicinal trees (including Dalbergia and Artabotrys sp.) that treat padong, using the root, wood or liana (Table 1 3). Modifiers include the colour seen inside the bark, or shapes made by the thorns . These differences are linked to the type of padong treated, and in some cases, mirror the body pa rt or shapes made when affected by padong . For example, padong kho (hooked padong) treats disorders that cause the body to create 'hooks', such as arthritis (see photo below). The medicinal use of p lants which show physical resemblance to a body part or di sorder is found in other cases. In the example given earlier of the nom plants , the thorns are said to look like nipples, and the plant is thus used to stimulate milk production in post -partum. In another example, the plants called sam phan hu (Hydnophytum formicarum Jack) and fi mob (Vitex sp.) are used to treat the condition of fi, where there are internal furuncles with or without pus. Sam phan hu (three thousand holes) has a rhizome which is punctuated by long narrow channels showing as small holes on i ts surface, mirroring the shape made by fi in the body (see photo). 127 Grouping principle Name Classifier Used for Species Family Treats padong in body.

It is mentioned both by western herbalists such as Culpepper in the 16th centu ry (Bennett, 2007), and in contemporary ethnographic work on indigenous medicine use (Etkin, 1988 a). Often called the \"Doctrine of Signatures\", it is, as Bennett (2007: 246) suggests, \"a much -maligned theory that purportedly explains how humans discovered medicinal uses of some plants\", based on this often -reported resemblance between morphology of the plant and body part. The theory that th ese resemblance s can explain why plants are medicinal has been widely dismissed by medical botanists, described as ps eudo -scientific or primitive, and studies demonstrate little systematic correspondence between name, morphology, and use (Bennett, 2007). However, as Etkin (1988 a) points out, from an ethnopharmacological viewpoint there may often be a biological basis for this type of plant selection . Etkin notes, for examp le, that commonly occurring components of red plants (antimicrobial and haemostatic red quinones) are used in the treatment of epidermal disorders. Symbolic and material lin ks between the plant and human bodies are also described as contribut ing to medicinal efficacy by the Lao healers, as I discuss in Chapter 5 . But here, rather than focusing on reasons why a plant 'works', or was 'discovered', it is more relevant to consider what these principles of nam ing and classification i mply about the sharing of knowledge. What does the concept of 'like cures like' tell us about how people 'think with plants'? As I have already discussed, the ways in which plants are grouped by generic names may or may not be simil ar to the Linnaean method of deciding how plants 'go together'. Vidal (1963: 446), speaking from a botanist's perspective, comment s that: \"The Lao popular botanical nomenclature is simple in principle with its binary or terna ry system. However, it is not always easy to perceive the common bond that sometimes brings plants together in the same group, under the same main name, species that scientific systematics consider to be very different...Conversely, in a fairly homogeneous b otanical group, radically diff erent vernacular names can be found.\" However my data shows that the grouping principle is not as difficult to discern as Vidal suggests , as this is generally based on some easily perceived similarity between the plants in the group. If we look, for exam ple, at plants included in the si khai group ( Table 9), the lifeforms (grass, tree, herb) and corresponding botanical determinations appear decidedly unsimilar. But after stopping to smell each of these plants, which each have a distinctive 130 lemon -like scen t, and observing their use (often as sauna plants to create aromatic steam), the rationale for their group ing is easy to grasp. Furthermore, when we consider plants within the category of ya, these patterns are very easy to discern, as they are defined functionally, i.e. through the plant's use as medicine in specific ways. In fact, medicinal uses are frequently the root of grouping principles and naming patterns, such as the padong plant group. The representation of body parts or illness categories in the se plant groups shows how associations are made. From the perspective of classification, as L\u00e9vi-Strauss sugge sted, this can point to deeper principles about mental structures: \"...the real question is not whether the touch of a woodpecker's beak does in fa ct cure toothache. It is rather whether there is a point of view from which a woodpecker's beak and a man's to oth can be seen as 'going together'( L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1966: 6). \" If we address 'thinking with plants' in terms of understanding categories of illness, and how it is treated, this gives us an insight into how plants are 'like people' - how they 'go together '. The names of plant groups also act as a type of mnemonic - if one remembers that one type of padong can treat pain in the joints, it is intuitive t o include more plants named padong in a treatment . Just as plants are collected together into groups, so are varieties of illness, a topic which is explored in more detail in the next chapter . Likewise, if a tree which has a reddish colour when the bark is peeled off is reputed as a tonic for the blood, then it is \"common se nse\" (Atran, 1998) to find another which looks similar. If names are widely known, this would therefore suggest that a certain level of medicinal plant knowledge is tacit and shared. In other words, people know - but without knowing they know. Naming patt erns which imply medicinal purposes may suggest, also, that these species have a long history of use. Of course, this assumption may be biased, as I have discussed plant groups which wer e recorded during research into medicinal uses . However, many of the species discussed were in common use for other purposes, such as food or construction, and yet still known by names which referenced their medicinal use. For example, when ya nang (women' s medicine) is used in bamboo soup, it is still called ya nang. Classi fication according to utilitarian purposes also suggests an adaptive strategy, in which in which people name the natural world based on past and current uses, revealing what is important to them 131 (da Silva et al., 2017). As Hunn (1982) argues, focusing on t he practical significance of plant use is thus vital in understanding the logic behind how plants are grouped and perceived. Plants and social relations 'I don't know anything about t raditional medicine' For rural people in Laos, the first step in possessing traditional medicine knowledge is to be able to name and recognise plants . For most, especially the older generation, this is not a problem - names of common ly used medicinal plant s are widely known am ong lowland Lao speakers within a particular region. As these names may correspond to disorders, such as padong, this suggests that a certain level of medicinal knowledge is implicit. In other words, plants are named according to medic inal uses , even when used for other purposes (e.g. if the wood of padong is used for building) , so people 'know' simply by naming the plants. Th is association of emic plant and illness classifications is explored further in the next chapter . However, in response to open q uestions like \"what plants do you know that are medicine?\", or, \"do you know anything about traditional medicine ?\", the interlocuter would often not immediately offer information. A common answer , when asked directly, was \"but I don't know anything about traditional medicine !\" In Phamuk village, 20 (1/5) of the households surveyed said they had a family member over 50 who knew something about traditional medicine, including herbal medicines (all 20), massage (3) and blowing/mantras (4). Villagers would usually suggest consulting somebody with more specialised knowledge, such as a healer. But, during general conversation or daily tasks, they would then show medicinal plants in their garden or demonstrate a simple technique . I found that one h as only to sit with a bag of plants to generate discussion about plant naming and uses, which would be debated with vigour. \"Pen ya bo? Can it be used as medicine? \" So what is 'knowledge ' (khuam hu ) in this context?37 The difficulty of asking in an abstrac t manner, \"what do you know?\" prompts a more phenomenological research approach which includes different modes of perception, and relationships between plants , people, and their 37 In Lao, it is difficult to ask abstract questions about 'knowledge' as a concept. The term khuam hu is used to refer to a specific type of knowledge e.g. khuam hu kiao kap ya phuen mu eang (knowledge of traditional medicine). Satipanya may refer to more scholarly knowledge. Other terms are explored in Chapter 5. 132 environment. The ethnographic examples b elow show how knowledge is generated through ' doing'; collecting plants, eating, travelling, gardening. Encounters with plants show how they act as objects for inter rogation, and open up discussions about other local experiences of health, illness and cult ure. Much of this involves a bodily en gagement with the landscape, which, returning to Ingold & Kurttila's definition of \"traditional knowledge as generated in the practices of locality\", can be a process by which innovation in traditional knowledge is ach ieved. This occurs as part of a field of relations; \"whatever practitioners do to things is grounded in an attentive, perceptual involvement with them\" (Ingold 2000:353). Traditional knowledge is generated in socially specific ways; \"enskilment\" is shape d, also, by forms of sociality (Gowlla nd 2019). Knowledge about uses is spread through social encounters that involve plants; ideas are exchanged and created. As Geissler & Prince (2010) observe of the familial use of plants for children's illnesses among the Lue of Kenya, this type of knowled ge production is embedded in shared everyday life, through practice rather than specific teaching. The plant at the centre is both a material object which generates information, and a social being with wh ich one engages. Here, I examine the practical means by which medicinal knowledge is produced, focusing on the plant itself as the nexus of knowledge generation. 133 Collecting plants Figure 16: Map showing the location of plant collection points in and around Phamuk vill age One morning in June, I go on a trip with Po Nueang to collect plants in the patches of forest around Phamuk village. He especially wanted to find mak mo , a tree whose bitter -tasting wood is used for liver problems, among other things - he'd run out. However, we cannot find the tree - it is not in the last place he saw it at the side of the road heading north, parallel to the Thai border on the western side of the Mekong. As we drive down the road out of the village, we stop to ask villagers along the way if they have seen it , including at one house of an old friend. Most people already know this tree - for those who don't, Po Nueang describes it - the mottling on the trunk, the colour and shape of the leaves and so on. They ask me what it can be used f or. I tell them, boil the wood to treat the liver; they are curious that a foreigner clearly considers this tree important enough to search for. Some say it can only be collected far away into the forest, difficult to access in the midst of the rainy seaso n. Eventually, we find a family who are taking a lunch break from planting rice. They say that they've seen mak m o not far away, on the path through the forest on the way to their ricefields, and give us a lift there on their small tractor. They help P o Nueang to 134 harvest some parts of branches, chopped into large chunks of wood with a machete, which he carefully places inside a sack and carries back to the village on his old motorbike. The next week, in the company of doctors Sipha and Somphian from the pub lic health office, Nueang and I visit the district medicinal plant garden . This is a small patch of forest located a few villages south down the Mekong, on community land but administered by the public health office. P o Boun Jan, a healer from that village comes too . He says the garden is natural (thammasat) , they didn't plant anything ( bo puk), the plants came by themselves (ma eng ). We search through the dense vegetation for plants which can be used for medicine, and eventually my plastic bags are f illed with 16 specimens to take back, press, label and transport to the herbarium for identification, even if in the midst of the hot dry season they are mostly brown and leafless. The doctors are also involved in looking for plants (far more actively engaged th an I've ever seen them at the public health office), asking the healers questions and sharing th eir own ideas - everybody has something to add. At lunch, joined by more elder village men, and lubricated by plenty of beerlao, Dr Somphian says \"we're all ai-nong [brothers]\". These exercises demonstrate how the collection of medicinal plants is bound u p with relations , between people, and between plants and people ; and , how knowledge is shared and negotiated. Ideas about mak m o (Rothmannia sp.) are exchanged; I share what I have learnt from Po Nueang about using mak mo as medicine, and we learn about its current location from others. The process of searching for mak mo with Nuea ng is both a reason for a social visit and the impetus for new interactions. His re spected status as a village elder and healer is demonstrated b y the assistance offered to him by villagers, and the interest they take in his (and my) activities. The plant is shown to be an activating factor in creating and changing relations in certain contexts. During the visit to the medicinal garden, the assume d hierarchy between government staff and rural healers is shifted - the healers take on a role of authority as knowledge -holders, and the health staff take on a new mode of heightened activity. The medicinal plant garden is the catalyst for the establishme nt of temporary 'kinship' relations between those involved in the activity of finding plants, as shown by Dr. Somphian's assertion \"we are all brothers\". The effect of introducing plants into ce rtain situations in changing hierarchical relations was one th at I observed often. For example, during meetings with government officials, the mention of traditional medicine would cause those present 135 to visibly relax, and the conversation would then often turn to their own favourite remedies in a less formal mode. The location of the plant is also important. As Hsu suggests, \"Since plants grow in places to which people are related, their materiality can modulate social relations ( Hsu 2010: 6).\" The discu ssion around where mak mo can be found elucidates relations wi th different locations. The family have seen mak mo because it is close to their rice fields - although not on their land - and it is the planting season so they pass it daily . The loss of mak m o in the place where Po Nueang last saw it may be due to development efforts (as the road heading north to Sukhoma was gradually being constructed), to logging by villagers, or other reasons that might not be explained by human actions. The used part, the wood, is harvested with the us e of a machete and is not easy to bring back, especially during the rainy season in which dirt tracks are flooded. The changing relationship between human settlements and the forest is, as I show in later chapters, also signif icant in thinking about illnes s and healing .38 According to the healers, both the method of plant collection and the difficulty of collecting a plant affects the medicine's effectiveness (Chapter 5). Although specific examples vary, usuall y, the more effort required , the better the med icine.39 Finally, these stories illustrate something about the nature of plants in rural Laos . Plants move - they may have died, have been cut down or gone somewhere else of their own accord, and are often not where they are exp ected to be. This suggests t hat the plant has agency; not that it is attributed personhood, such as in Amazonian contexts (Descola 2013), but that it may act in unpredictable ways. Human engagement with medicinal plants is mediated by the spirits who dwell in or govern the places where they are found (Sprenger 2016), but the plant itself is not sentient. It is only when plants cross the boundary of medicine and magic that they are considered to have the power to enact effect, or have an intrinsic moral qual ity, even if this is still closely associated the actions of both humans and spirits (see Chapter 5). 38 As shown in the example of the medicinal plant 'garden', which in reality is just a piece of forest which has been fenced of f, the distinction between wild and cultivated plants is a continuum according to how much they are influenced by the actions of humans. 39 The idea that valuable medicinal plants are difficult to find has also been common to bioprospectors searching for n ew pharmaceutical cures. However, as Voeks (2003) points out, the most used medicinals worldwide are weedy plants from disturbed habitats rather than rare species in distant forest . 136 Getting a lift to the ricefield to find mak mo with P o Nueang Collecting plants with Po Boun Jan and Munlapamok public health centre staff in the medicinal plan t 'garden' 137 Bitter is medicine: food , drink and gardens Medicinal knowledge is also elucidated and produced in social situations involving plants such as me altimes . Plants which are eaten may fall into more than one category; it can be difficult to distinguish between food and medicine . For example, when talking with the father of one of Vilaysack's patients one day, he points out a tree and gives me a recipe : \"Take the bark, crush it, add red ants and eat with salt and padek [fermented fish sauce ], to cure stomach aches\". This blurring of distinctions between food and medicine has been described by many ethnopharmacologists worldwide (Etkin 200 6; Etkin & Ross 1982; Leonti 2012), and is also a source of debate in the marketing of manufactured remedies in the west (Heinrich 2016). As noted elsewhere (Shikov et al. 2017), the part of the plant used may affect whether it is defined as food or medicine . Easily dig estible aerial parts such as leaves or fruit are used as food, and roots and woods are ascribed more strongly medicina l uses .40 For example, whilst the root of ya nang khao (T. triandra ) is a common medicine, the leaves are a key ingredient of bamboo soup . In Laos, similar to other parts of Asia, sensory aspects of food such as taste, smell and the methods of preparation are also closely associated with medicinal properties (Elliott et al. 20 20). Bitterness, in particular, is reputed to be good for health . The enunciation of common sayings such as khom pen ya - 'bitter is medicine' - facilitates the exchange of ideas. One scorching April day in Phamuk village, during a break in visiting patients, P o Nueang and I stop at the house of his nephew for lunch. Dee and his family are rice farmers, and live in a small wooden house surrounded by paddy fields , which are currently dry . We eat lunch together, a wild bird lap, a vegetable soup , and various wild greens including bitter phak kadao . This is the leaves from t he kadao tree which grow s at the edge of the ricefield , providing shade in the heat of the day. Dee encourages me to try it and tells me it is also a medicine for fever. N ueang agrees, and adds that a decoction made from the wood of the kadao tree is effec tive against malaria. With their help, I find the tree and take a sample, noting the entry in my herbarium book like this : EE025 : Phak with Nueng and nephew 'Dee'. Tall tree in the middle of dry ricefield , exposed area. Opposite leaves, bright green 40 The logic behind using the root and woody parts as medicine is also conn ected with notions of potency, discussed further in chapters 4 and 5. 138 (younger leaves purple), small white flower with 4 petals, green flower buds. Leaves are food, very bitter t aste. Use the wood - boil to treat malaria. After carefully pressing, labelling and transporting the sample to the university herbarium in Vientiane, the sample is later identified as Azadirachta indica A. Juss., the Neem tree, well-known for its use acr oss Asia as a kind of cure -all (Subapriya & Nagini 2005). The next month, in colle ct kadao again, from healer Vilaysack's garden . He tells me that you can make a decoction from the root or woo d to wash the pelvic area , for women's dis orders such as long khao (leucorrhoea) and aksep modluk (inflamed uterus). During this time, I have been sleeping in the office at the nearby rural hospital, and one evening I eat dinner with some of the nurses, auxiliary staff and visitors. It's a soup mad e from a type of wild mushroom I haven't tried before, and I notice phak kadao , along with other bi tter green leaves. We talk about bitter plants. A man tells me he has a lot of khuea khao ho in his garden - he thinks it's good for health because it's bitt er, but is not sure what it's used for. One woman has spread yellow hua khi min on her hands because of toum [spots , rash] . She got it from her garden. \"What else is khi min good for?\" she asks? \"Also the stomach\", somebody answers - they ask me what the b est pasom [plant mixture ] is for this. I remember the capsules made in the hospital in Pakse, and start to list them, \" khi min, van zhod...\" I forget the last ingredient and a man tells me it's van fai . \"Oh yes, there are two different types of van fai ,\" ano ther woman says, \"black and yellow. You can get it from over there [pointing to the garden opposite] - it's also good to put into bamboo soup.\" She asks me if I know any plants good for bao wan [diabetes ] - I remember lasabi and another man present tells me there's some in the garden opposite. He goes to collect it and comes back with a handful of leaves - I'm not sure if it's really lasabi but we taste it and agree it's very bitter, \"like khuea khao ho\" another says, \"what can you use that for?' \"Malaria\", I tell them, \"and as a tonic if you add alcohol.\" \"Yes, bitter plants are medicine\", says another. 139 Drinking, as well as eating, can be the source of medicinal knowledge. In Phamuk village, groups of old men often sit together outside the shop in the c entre , drink ing homemade medicinal alcohol (bong ya ), which they say will \"make you strong and help your blood to run smoothly \". They would never fully reveal the contents of this when asked, but just comment that it contained \"many types of medicine \", whi ch had soaked in alcohol for 2 -3 months . Grandfather Pon, who is in his 80s, can often be seen cycling around the village on a rusty old bicycle. One afternoon he stops to chat with P o Nueang at the small marketplaces in the village. Slung over his handleb ars is a plastic bag filled with plant roots, which N ueang looks through, and selects a few to take home with him. The roots include kamlang seuakhong (tiger power ), and samsip padong (30 padong), both used to strengthen the body . Grandfather Pon says he p uts these into bong ya with other plants and then drinks it as a tonic. On another occasion at his house, he shows me the medicine in a large plastic jar, offering me some. It tastes bitter and pungent. A typical Southern Lao meal of bitter greens together with Mekong fish (lap, grilled, soup) and papaya salad 140 Grandfather Pon in the centre of Phamuk village with his bicycle, and at his house showing his homemade bong ya (medicinal alcohol) During the social situations described above , the concept of khom pen ya (bitter is medicine) arises in different forms, as a basic idea from which more specific information is elicited. Recurring bitter plants kadao (A. indica ), khuea khao ho (T. crispa ) lasabi (A. paniculat a) appear in various forms . Different parts are u sed as food, as medicine for different conditions, as shade from the heat. Various versi ons of medicinal plant knowledge are elucidated, depending on the context. At the edge of the ricefields in the lowlands of the far south, where malarial fevers are an ever-present threat, kadao wood is spoken of as a febrifuge. In the garden of Vilaysack' s home, where women often come to seek treatment for irritating conditions such as long khao, the root is mentioned for gynaecological purposes. When eating dinner, the bitter leaves of kadao add a distinctive flavour to the soup, providing the sensation o f eating a health -giving food. The discussion about lasabi (A. paniculata ) shows both how bitter tastes infer medicinal use, and how interactio ns with and about plants also prompt the exchange of information about health or illness, such as in the discus sion about diabetes. The plant is engaged with on a sensory level; it is picked from the garden, smelt, tasted, ground into paste, boiled in 141 soup .41 The bright yellow of hua khi min (rhizome of C. Longa , turmeric ) both colours food and is visibly spread on the skin, with a distinctive aromatic scent. The men who sit drinking the bitter and pungent bong ya together participate in a shared materialit y, experiencing its intoxicating and strengthening effects. As I discuss in following chapters, the principle of bitterness , the use of recipes in combining plants, and the active and sensory engagement in medicine prepar ation are crucial aspects of how medicinal effectiveness is conceptualised and experienced.42 Journeys , women and plants Knowledge -sharing situati ons spontaneously arise again and again, often in surprising ways and situations. People seem to insist on telling me things. The origin of their knowledge and ideas may come from diverse sources, but certain themes , types of diseases that preoccupy them and ideas about staying healthy keep recurring. Sometimes the information is freely given, other t imes partially, and often my ideas are requested in exchange. Women's knowledge, in particular, is uncovered in non -linear ways. When people say, \"I don't kno w anything about traditional medicine\", and defer to the specialised knowledge of the healers, th is references a predominantly male domain of knowledge which requires transmission through a process of initiation (see the following section and Chapter 5 ).43 People tell me their ideas during the act of travelling, in which conversations and casual meetings may turn to the subject of plants. On public transport such as the song ti ao journey from Pakse on the long straight road 100km south to the village, people ask me what I do, and excl aim, \"Oh, you study traditional medicine! Let me tell you about this plant in my garden, it's good for high blood pressure, I drink it as a tea... Let me show you this leaflet about medicines from Thailand, you take them if your bo dy feels heavy... My grandfath er was a healer, I kept his notebooks at home but I don't know how to use them...\". On the night bus back to Vientiane, I share a sleeping compartment with a woman, Nali, who after learning about my research is keen to discuss the health challenges of wom en, 41 From a bio -cultural perspective, this sensory engagement may also be associated with plant selection (Shepard, 2004). 42 The association of bitter foods and health also has an evolution ary and chemical basis, as shown in the domestication of the potato (Johns 1990). 43 This is in contrast to some non -Buddhist upland groups, in which women are the primary kn owledge holders of medicinal plants, such as the Hmong (Dubost et al. 2019), and Ak ha (Ongaro 2019 ). 142 showing m e some manufactured pills she takes as a tonic ( bamlung ) and for a weak liver ( tab on pia ). She asks me if I know any remedies for the liver, and I tell her about collecting mak mo with P o Nueang. In the village, wom en grow plants and treat gynaecological ailments as home remedies, a domain of knowledge which is shared with the male healers, but may be approached differently. Gynaecological ailments (panyad sao) such as leucorrhoea (long khao) are a constant source of annoyance to rural women. In Phamuk village, M ae Chanta offers medicine made from van plants44 which she grows in her garden, or others found around the villag e - in contrast to the male healers who primarily use woody species found in the forest. This dif fering domain of plants is associated both with gendered knowledge (see Chapter 5 ), and practi cal issues of collection . Vilaysack says in the past it was dangerous for women to go to the forest , presenting a barrier to becoming healers , but now with the us e of motori sed vehicles this is less of a problem. Mae Chanta describes how she began to treat women: \"One day, a woman had a problem with her intestines and then after treatment at the hospital, she had long khao with a bad smell and no one wanted to sit by her. I had some plants in my garden - I didn't learn about them, but a Ta Oi45 person from Paksong came to Munlapamok, and brought the van plants with them. They used it for healing wounds and I took the van and planted them in my garden. I gave her bai phai and van zhod to boil and drink, but it didn't work, so I tried van di kabun and van di long khao as a decoction. I told her to make 3 to 4 pots, then drink and wash with them - then she was cured. So, more women started coming to ask me for medicines. \" The process of \"trying out \" described by M ae Chanta is typical of the way in which women might experiment with plants in the home (Geissler & Prince 2010) . Indeed, her use of the plants was quite different from her observation of the visitor. When talkin g with M ae Thao Pong, the 82 -year old traditional birth attendant of the village, she tells me that she learnt how to assist with delivery by herself (hian eng), not from her mother, not from a teacher.46 This emphasis on self -discovery was also expressed by men in certain situations . Grandfather Pon explains that he learnt about herbal medicines from a traditional healer 44 See Chapter 5 for a full discussion of van 45 Mon-Khmer ethnic group found in upland areas of Southern Laos 46 This is similar to self -descriptions of traditional midwives in southern Thailand given by Merli (2008), who consistently deny any type of training, but mention the experience of witnessing a nd closely following an older relative who was a traditional midwife. 143 when he was in the army in Sam Neua during the 1950s - 60s.47 After that, he read tamla ya [herbal prescriptions ] by himself, which he al ways found very interesting, and then came up with his own ideas. Sometimes, he has tried treating people - he made a medicine for one woman with long khao, and she got better. The healers, too, use their own ideas to adapt tamla , or incorporate suggestion s from others, including their wives. This is demonstrated when I ask Nueang about herbal prescriptions . His wife, M ae Pe, often interjects suggestions or produces plants she has cultivated in the garden. When I have a problem with itchy and peeling skin o n my fingers, she makes me an ointment containing the rhizome and leaves of van zhod (E. bulbosa ), khi min (C. Longa ), van hang ke (Aloe vera (L.) Burmann ), and the leaves of kadao (A. indica ), all of which were found in or around the garden. This pattern is repeated among other healers I speak with whose wives are present, who correct or fill in the gaps in their husband's explanations. Another woman from Phamuk village who was married to a healer (who studied with the same teacher as Po Nueang , now dead), describes how she and her husband produced medicine: \"In the past he used to fak [cut with machete] many medicines, like this, fak [makes cutting motion] . I know some tamla as this one for stomach: khuea hoon, kok pak kud, ken tan, ken du, ken khoun, ken lam phuk, ya hua, oi dam - boil and drink. We would find the medicines in the forest, fak, and boil and drink it by ourselves (tom kin eng). I can't aways remember, but then fak, and then I'd remember. These days, I'm too old to collect the plants, but I tell people the plant names, and they find themselves and make the medicine.\" In this narrative, she emphasises the action of cutting with a machete (fak) as the trigger for her memory of the plant uses. This knowledge thus ar ises through a commonly used -action that she would watch and assist her husband undertake. Another woman who says she has some knowledge about traditional medicine says that she learnt from other people in t he village. She listened while they were talking, and remembered (ju vai). She collects some plants in the garden for me , and I notice that she and others tend to count ingredients on their fingers as they remember them. A third woman in another village wh o used a plant from the forest to treat her diabe tes describes how she watched some Vietnamese people collecting it - she didn't ask them about what they did, but copied their use of the plant. These practical methods of learning and remembering are simila r to those described by Craig (2002) in Vietnam . \"Familiar \" medical knowledge is transmitted orally, often through mnemonics involving a literal \"rule of thumb \" in which formulas are counted on the fingers 47 An area of northeastern Laos where many Pathet Lao troops were stationed during the war. 144 and elsewhere, the \"practical embodiment of traditional medical knowledge\" (Craig 2002:107). As Con nerton (1989) discusses, this is an \"incorporating \" memory practice, which is communicated through bodily activity, often unconsciously, in comparison to \"inscribing \" practices . As shown , gendered domains of medicinal plant knowledge are not always separa te, in contrast to practices which incorporate the manipulation of spiritual forces ( Chapter 5 ). The more specific difference is perhaps not in what women know, but wha t they say that they know , and what they wish to and feel able to share . In the present day, women's learning may involve different and new formats. Ajan Vilaysack plans to teach his youngest daughter , who is currently studying to be a biomed ical doctor in Vietnam, so that she can practice both types of medicine . The woman on the night bus, Nali, tells me about her own study of traditional medicine, showing me photos on her phone of her teacher, and some medicinal formulae she has recorded fro m him for diabetes and stomach complaints. Sharing secrets: h ow to study traditional medicine Durin g the visit to the medicinal plant garde n, healers Nueang and Boun Jan compar e ideas and recipes , discuss ing their patients and treatment of certain diseases . Nueang mention s a man with mouth cancer that he'd been unable to treat and who had gone to the ho spital in Ubon. Once Nueang is sure that Boun Jan is a reputable practitioner after learning about his educa tion and practice, he copies down a few of the other healer's herbal formulae into his notebook, adding them to his own repertoire. They refer to ea ch other respectfully as ajan (teacher /scholar) , and \"we are traditional practitioners \" (phet phuen mueang ). They complain about medicine sellers (mo khai ya ), who they regard as inferior - and discuss how, even within that district, healers tr eat diseases differentl y. This demonstrates the distinction between negotiated and flexible knowledge w hich is produced and shared through social interaction involving plants , and the khuam hu (accumulated specific knowledge) of the healers. Although Nuea ng and Boun Jan exchange ideas, they differentiate between practices which they consider correct (thuek), or incorrect (bo thu ek), such as selling medicine (see Chapter 5) . Likewise, a lthough Vilaysack and Nueang have never met, they know of each other, an d ask me questions to ascertain whether the other practise s correctly . The question of sharing knowledge is thus highly contextual . 145 Between the healers, plant use is a vehicle for establishing hierarchies, rather than shifting them . A typical approach to traditional knowledge differentiates between 'secret' and 'open' (Young 1976 b; Hsu 1999). However , a more nuanced argument is that knowledge is kept hidden, partially uncovered or shared in specific ways, according to who is asking, the consequences of obt aining knowledge, and the motivation of the respondent (Haetta 2010). The Lao healer's knowledge includes a mixture of the following elements: Knowledge type Level to which it can be shared 1 General knowledge about medicinal plants and other remedies which follows certain principles . Commonly shared in social and therapeutic settings, and within families. 2 Transmitted body of knowledge made up of specific information about herbal prescriptions and their use. Safe to share, but protected unless concer n about loss of transmission is stronger than concern about loss of status. Usually shared in partial amounts (such as one herbal prescription). 3 Transmitted body of knowledge about the use of mantra, blowing, and magical plant use. Dangerous to share - the p erson receiving it must be initiated for their own safety. The first knowledge type may, as I have shown, be shared with the non -initiated and often represents a type of 'tacit' knowledge. This is demonstrated both through the common practices of p lant naming which reference medicinal uses, and the ways in which knowledge about plants is shared and created through social situations. It exist s in oral forms, through the actions of naming plants, searching for trees, discussing ideas, suggesting remed ies, eating together and so on. The second type is a more specific knowledge set which is unique to each practitioner, although with some shared principles. The main body of this knowledge is medicinal prescriptions (tamla ya) , containing plants, animal p arts or minerals , which may be wr itten down. Knowledge is usually acquired from more than one source , including male relative s, 146 other healer s or monk s. Some healers, especially those who had been or had studied with a monk, had palm leaf manuscripts (baila n) in their possession, but I found that these were rarely used in practice. More often, prescriptions were recorded into old exercise books, as described below. The extent to which this knowledge set is 'open' or 'secret' is dependent on the will of the p ractitioner - whilst t here is little danger in sharing information , it might threaten their livelihood and reputation. It was sometimes said that a healer would purposely keep out key ingredients of a prescription when revealing it to another, in order to guard their secrets. The th ird type is entirely secret unless specific conditions for knowledge transmission are fulfilled. It includes practices which accentuate the therapeutic power of the practitioner, explored in Chapter 5 . This knowledge, although f ocused on spiritual and magi cal concepts (vetmon ), also incorporates techniques with plants . In order for this potentially dangerous knowledge to be made shareable, the person who wishes to learn must go through a process of initiation and become a healer' s apprentice , as well as observing certain taboos and protective methods. Failure to follow these rules is dangerous to both the practitioner and those around him (see Chapter 5 ). My own learnin g with the healers focused primarily on the second knowledge type described above; their personal canon of herbal prescriptions, which are analysed further in Chapter 4 . This was considered a safe topic, as well as one that was important for my research ab out the treatment of certain conditions such as fever (Elliot t et al. 20 20). They were mindful of how and when to reveal certain aspects to me, both for my benefit and theirs. An important part of the learning process was the ability to collect and recogni se plants, although this was not considered any kind of speci al skill, falling into the domain of general knowledge. This was a pre -requisite for any serious medicinal study .48 The descriptions below show key elements of studying traditional medici ne. Whilst the acquisition of knowledge follow s common theories, the process of learning differs greatly according to the particular teacher and student's perceptions of knowledge, and to their intentions behind its application (Hsu 1999) . Indeed, choosing to study medicine is not just the acquisition of knowledge; it may al so imply certain responsibilities and the adoption of a particular social role (Haetta 2010) , as I explore in the f ollowin g chapters. 48 Unfortunately, I had already failed at this, as my ability to recognise plants was far below that of village children. 147 A page from a book of herbal prescriptions belonging to Po Khampud, Phontong district Palm leaf manuscripts (bai lan) containing herbal prescriptions kept at the hospital TM department 148 Po Nueang reads through his books Ajan Vilaysack demonstrates how to take the pulse 149 Both Vilaysack and Nueang conceive of learning in a structured manner , and f ind my approach of spontaneous ly asking questions somewhat haphazard . Nueang has a practical approach to learning medicine , taking me around the village to visit his patients and explaining their conditions. However, t he focus of my education is to hian tamla ya,49 study the prescriptio ns, and he often arrive s at the small house next to the Mekong where I stayed bearing one of his notebooks. He then reads the prescriptions aloud to me whil e I struggl e to write them in Lao script into my own notebook, causing him to laugh uproariously at my spelling mistakes. The action of writing, as w ell as reading, is important to his notion of learning.50 A good healer, h e tells me, is one who ha s \"written many prescriptions\" (mo di khian tamla ya lai) . When speaking of another, less popular healer in t he village, Nueang comments rather disparagingly that he did not write many tamla ya . Writing down - and thus owning - herbal prescription s denoted to P o Nueang that a healer was effective. At his house, Nueang keeps a number of old notebooks, each carefu lly written with distinct handwriting, contain ing lists of formulae, instructions on gathering plants and other information that I have yet to read. He tells me about the books; they each belonged to one of his teachers. The slightly newer notebooks writte n in Lao language are from Po Thao Jen Deng and P o Thao Souk (who were from Phamuk village ). The oldest belonged to Po Thao Muey, from Sanon village (8km away), and is written in a mixture of Lao and Tham scrip t, suggesting it ha s been copied from palm le af manuscripts . Nueang claims it is 200 years old, but it looks to be written in a French colonial era exercise book, perhaps from the turn of the century. I often catch him leafing through these books, reading them to himself under his breath, as if a sto ry book, taking the opportunity to reflect on how he could use them, writing some down in his newer personal notebook, selecting a few to read out to me . For Po Nueang , these notebooks are living documents which guide his ideas and approach to treatment . In contrast, I never see Vilaysack refer to any written documents, other than a battered manual on physiology which is written in Thai language . He tells me that he doesn't have any need for written texts; the knowledge is in his head. He describes the lea rning process like this: 49 The word hian means both to study and to learn - they are not differentiated. 50 As Tambiah (1968a) observed in Isan, literacy has traditionally differentiated diff erent types of practitioner - the traditional healers and others who utilize texts such as the mo pon (reciter) and mo du (diviner), but not mo thiam (mediums), and others who do not draw on religious texts, who are usually female (see chapter 5). 150 \"In the past, the knowledge of Lao healers came from the palm leaf manuscripts, the temple and from the Buddh a. Whils t in other countries there is a textbook, in Laos there is not a good book, so people learn partly from texts, pa rtly from teachers and partly from their own experience. If you only learn from a book your knowledge won't be complete. \" For Vilaysack, knowl edge is not primarily produced through social interaction or writing by rote . The most important factor , as he de scribes, is learning to concentrate and to be aware of what is around, and to draw on one's own experience. As appropriate for his title of ajan, he titles our discussions as 'lessons', often based on the patients who are staying at his house, and encourag es me to ask focused questions about what interests me, asking \"what do you want to learn?\" . In some cases, people who were cured by his treatm ent have come back to learn from him ,51 and he has also taught some herbal prescriptions to foreigners like me. However, he emphasises that learning must be without haste. \"You cannot learn too fast . If try to study everything you'll be confused , and your brain won't work well . You should choose three symptoms - if you learn how to look, observe, and treat then you'll be a good healer. For example, if you learn to treat fever, you should learn the symptoms, each type of medicine, about people's birthda ys and where they were born, about how to collect plants and how to correctly prepare medicines . You should study only this at one time. You need to spend at least one year to know the diseases, one year to know the medicines, and one more year to become e xperienced ( khuam sanam ). But to know how to cure people, it takes 10 years.\" Despite these claims, I find that when I ask him a question , it usually le ads to an outpouring of ideas and examples that I struggle to keep up with . I record these conversations and often spend days transcribing and translating them. A typical entry from my fieldnotes from one day in June rea ds: We spend more than an hour talking, and as usual Vilaysack spans a wide range of subjects at high speed, d rawing accurate anatomical features and reciting medicines and formulae from memory. This time, the discussion covers the digestive system, the h eart, use of animal products, diagnostic methods, the blood, the history of Lao medicine and its similarities a nd differences to other Asian medical systems, the role of the government in helping TM, methods of study , and hierarchies of healers and the rol e of women. In comparison, Po Nueang 's lessons tend to c entre on more predictable themes, and focus on what he th inks it would be appropriate for me to know, rather than directly answering my questions. 51 I met one of these practitioners in another district, where he is now the village chief. He explained that in 1999 he came to see Vilaysack because he could not eat or sleep and had body pain. After recovering, he decided to come back and study with him. 151 At the root of these learning experiences is thus t he issue of what c an be shared, and why. Indeed, there are always reasons for sharing, hiding, or partia lly revealing knowledge, and this might change according to context. The flexibility of this is particularly illustrated at the current time . When Nuean g and Boun Jan discuss their knowledge, they bemoan the fact that Lao people don't want to study traditional medicine these days - only foreigners ! Likewise, Vilaysack says he has little time to teach people , and besides there are few who want to learn . With little or n o transmission, c oncerns about knowledge preservation, for the most part, now outweigh those of protection. Thus, certain prohibitions (for example, revealing information to women, and to foreigners) may lose their significance. Among the l owland healers, there is less financial motivation to keep knowledge secret in comparison to other medical traditions such as the Hmong (Dubost et al. 2019), although the healers also mentioned investing substantial sums of money in their education ( see Chapter 5 ). This variation in secrecy may also be associated with more contentious relationships with government officials in other ethnic groups, especially the Hmong. Indeed, learning and knowledge production, even among the rural healers, are not independ ent of state influence. In Chapter 8 , I further examine how studying traditional medicine has been impacted by governmentality and science in revolutionary Laos . Conclusion This chapter shows how the categorisation of plants as medicine follows distinct p atterns; at the same time, this is flexible and functional. This demonstrates both that naming and classification are strongly utilitarian, and that a level of tacit or shared medicinal knowledge exists among rural lowland people. However, this contrasts w ith specific and individual ised medicinal knowledge, which may be revealed, hidden, or shared according to context . When studying traditional medicin e, the healer encounters , collects and ut ilises various types of medicinal knowledge, the most visible of w hich is their collection of herbal prescriptions. The importance both of these classification patterns , and the forms in which knowledge is learned , transmitted and adapted will become apparent in the following chapt er, which focuses on the practical appli cation of medicinal knowledge. 152 Chapter 4: Making a medicine, treating a fever Introduction This chapter examines the process by which illness is defined, diagnosed and treated with herbal medicines , using the example of fevers in rural southern Laos. The previous c hapter explored forms in which knowledge about plants is produced and transmitted ; here I examine how these patterns influence the creation of medicine. Fevers are a broadly significant illness category cross -culturally, especially within the sub- tropical world regions . In the biomedical system, it is necessary that fevers are clearly and statically defined according to a biological origin (e.g. Plasmodium falciparum, the most common malaria type worldwide), as pharmaceutical treatments are bas ed on a 1 -1 strategy (active ingredient - causative agent). Attempts at describing emic classification systems such as the taxonomic model of illness may also describe conceptually distinct, mutually exclusive categories (Frake 1961). As an alternative, Kleinman (1980) proposed \"explanatory models\" as a method of understand ing how the person affected explains their illness . However, as Young (1982) argues , this still works on an assumption of the \"rational man\", in which cognitive models necessarily lead to a related action. Looking at local fever categori sation and its treatment with traditional medicine may reveal a more dynamic landscape , and as a way of local ideas about contagion and causality (Green 1999 ; Winch et al. 1996 ). Good 's (1977) model of \"semantic networks \" is composed of symbols, experiences and feelings which typically \"run together \" for the members of a society. He propose s that researchers should shift from an emphasis on creating classificatory categories towards a de eper understanding o f how illness and disease are integrated within the structure of a society. Thus, similar to knowledge about plants , definitions of sickness can provide insights into cultural ideas and practices; a way of learning about what is important to people within particular contexts. Illness categories can also be interpreted in the light of how they are treated, focusing on what people 'do', rather t han what they 'think' . Indeed, Davis (2000) proposes that the diagnostic categories people use are actually just th e starting points of intervention. Nichter (1996 a:115) differentiates between \"denotative\" (illness signs and symptoms) and \"connotative\" (ex periences, cultural meanings, feelings) aspects of how an illness is locally defined. He argues that the taxonomic method results from a biomedical framework of 153 searching for the cause of the disease in the past . Instead , Nichter ( 1996a ) proposes the model of \"taskonomies\", in which an illness becomes defined by the 'tasks' needed to tackle it; thus, the method of trea tment itself determines the label of the illness. Likewise, exploring biomedic ine use in resource -poor settings, Street (2014) shows how rather than making disease visible through diagnostic accuracy , medical practitioners find locally adapted ways to deal with unknown illnesses, often through a process of trial and error. Furthermore, the singularity of a disease has been questioned, as it may be shaped by interaction with different medical practices (Mol 200 3). Others explore experiences of \"multiple bod ies\" (Scheper -Hughes & Lock 1987), also emphasising that the bodily experiences and meanings given to illness pathologies emerge from multiple contexts. This points towards an issue for anthropologists working in public health . Parker & Harper (2006) argue that, in creating categories for disease, there is a danger that inve stigation into cultural aspects may be reduced to discrete, quantifiable beliefs . It is important to be aware that perspectives on illness and health have been shaped by overlapping ways of thinking and seeing embedded in complex social processes (Parker & Harper 2006). In this chapter, taking the example of fevers, I explore these approaches .52 Similarly to the previous chapter, I begin with classification and then move to a more dynamic perspective when exploring the practical application of knowledge. Firstly, by differentiating fever types and exploring the lexicology of fever terminology used in southern Laos, I seek to discover what the discourse on fevers tells us about the causes of disease, the functioning of the body and the Lao person's relationship to the world around them. Secondly, I examine the process of making a medicine through th e use of herbal prescriptions, which share common qualities, and their preparation methods in r elation to fever types. I show how this is also associated with medicinal plant naming patterns. Thirdly, I explore the relationship between treatment and diagnosis, arguing that diagnosis may occur retrospectively, through a process of experimentation, an d show the significance of personali sing treatments. Following the argument of the previous chapter, I demonstrate that among southern Lao healers, fever treatment is based on a shared conceptual foundation, with commonalities in medicinal plant use but in dividuation at the level of particular healer's plant combinations, prescriptions, and treatment approaches. 52 Whil st fevers provide a particularly fertile ground for exploration due to their prevalence and importance as an illness category in Laos, other pathologies or body systems could also have been used as an example . 154 Fevers in southern Laos Pen k hai, khon k hai: fever and sickness In Lao language, the term khai refers to fever . As a prefix , khai also denotes a t ype of fever. One can pen k hai (be fevered ), chap khai be feverish) buad k hai (to ache with or be attacked by fever), or so khai (be sick with fever). In the modern medical lexicon, the word khai has come to mean pyr exia. However, the original usage denoted a flexible range of categories, including both hot and cold symptoms, so the term khai hon (hot fever) may be used more specifically. Researchers writing in the last century about illness in Laos (Pottier 2007; Spi re 1907 ; Vidal 1956; Souk -Alou m 2001) all noted that khai is a general term for a group of diseases which can then be broken down into several categories based on specific symptomatology. More recently, w here biomedical terminology has been adopted, khai is added to make a composite word, for example khai malaria. In Champasak, one of the hottest lowland areas of Laos, fever is a constant presence . 'Hot' disease, as P o Nueang explains, is more common in this climate. It particularly affect s those in a vu lnerable life stage such as children, old people, pregnant and post -partum women; but can attack anyone. Almost two -third s of surveyed households in Phamuk village had recently experienced a case of fever in a family member. It is interesting that khai is (to the non-native speaker) easily confused with a term for inflammation or swelling, khai (pronounced with a higher and flatter tone).53 This term is used for the state of inflammation or disease, such as khai modluk (uter ine disorder ). This usage is often interchangeable with a term adopted from biomedical terminology, aksep , and is also connected with the concept of toum (spots , inflammation ), pointing to the significance of excess heat or fire. Being too hot, or to have an excess of fai, the fire element , is considered a pathological condition and is associated with both types of khai. The moderation of body temperature is an important aspect of counteracting khai, both in terms of the thermal properties of medicines, and also in social -symbolic terms. Southern Lao cuisine is famed for its liberal use of hot chil li, and it is common to hear women, whilst eating sour papaya salad in the afternoon commenting that \"I know this is bad for my insides, it's too hot, but I can't stop!\" . The same desire for 'heat ' is also applied to married men's 53 = fever = swelling, inflammatio n 155 sexual indiscretions. Heat is associated with damaging mental -emotional states ; yen (cool) is its balance , such as keeping a cool heart (see chapter 7). However, yen should be distinguished from nao (cold) , a dangerous s tate in which the person is, conversely, vulnerable to fevers, such as during the post -partum period. 54 At this time, cold must be counteracted by warming practices described as yu fai (on the fire). The woman drink s warm ing herbal decoctions, l ies on a bed heated by a charcoal fire beneath and wash es with warm water . People also creat e heat through social gathering at the mother's resting place. The term khai (fever) may also refer more generally to the state of being unwell . This linguistic tendency is also noted by Brun & Schumacher (1994: 143) in Northern Thailand: \"[khai] is also used in a more general sense for being sick as in khon k hai (a patient) and pen khai (be sick, have a fever) \". This demonstrates the conceptual importance of khai as a categor y of illness; to be sick is to have a fever. The concept of khon k hai also extends to what Street (2014) has termed \"generally sick\" . Without access to, or importance given to precise diagnostic categories, people \"constitute variations on a si ngle spectru m of sick\" (Street 2014:111) . The state of khai can transcend a purely physical ailment; for example, one can have khai chai, a fever of the heart - to be sick with love. Whittaker (200 1: 2) recounts how an Isan woman described her state as khai bo mi ng uen: to have the sickness of being without money. Use of the term khai may then refer to the sense that the person's bodily, emotional, social or economic equilibrium has been disturbed. Fever patterns Fever types were elicited through conversations with h ealers, people's descriptions of their own ailments, and the naming and indication of herbal prescriptions. These are recorded in Table 14, showing the Lao name of the fever and its translation. Appendix 10 has a more detailed version of this table, showin g the symptoms, aetiology, cause and treatment methods, as explained by interlocuters. Where issues were unclear, I discussed them with Po Nueang , Ajan Vilaysack and Dr. Outhai, alth ough not all fever types were known by each. It can be seen from this list that there was some crossover between types, which I have placed into 14 main groups. Figure 1 7 shows the relationships of these fever types with each other, symptoms, affected body parts, place of origin (including external and internal 54 To describe oneself as nao (cold) may also mean to feel lonely, which can be counteracted by the 'heat' of company. 156 causes), and repr esents how severe they are perceived to be. This is represented on a continuum from more to less severe, and to what extent fevers arise from internal or external causes. The size of the text used shows the relative significance of different places and bod y organs in fever. I t demonstrates how wide -ranging khai is as a disorder, connected with different body systems and life -stages.

An imbalance result s from the actions of this invasive substance inside the body, which may take a variety of forms . In the healers' conception, fevers can mostly be described as what Young (1976 a) termed an \"internalizing system\", which implicate s internal body relations, ra ther than an \"externalizing system\" in which pathogenic agents are purposive, such as in cases of witchcraft. As the majority of fevers are considered to be organi c, this may represent a shift over time towards internalizing systems, possibly due to biomed ical or Ayurvedic influence - or as Young (1976 a) argues, to increasing social complexity. Fevers stemming from the weather, especially during changes in the sea sons or 'unnatural' weather ( akat bian ladu, akat bo as the common cold (khai wat ) are usually not serious , and are also described as ordinary fevers (khai thammada) . The wind can enter through the skin, nose or mouth, a condition described as lom chap (wind grasps ) which occurs when the person does not have enough strength to withstand it. A person's strength is said to come from good blood (lueat di). Vilaysack explains that: \"When a person does not have good blood, they are weak (khon on ae) and cannot fight against the wind; they will be cold easily from the wind and rain, and hot from the sunshine .\" The strength of the blood is partly inherited from parent s, and partly due to the person's lifestyle (diet, exercise, following correct p ractices e.g. in postpartum). Bad blood (lueat bo di, lueat phit) is at the root of many disorders, and when the blood is implicated in fevers they become much more serious, such as khai lueat ook (fever with the blood coming out, used to describe the haem orrhagic form of dengue). Whilst this causes the blood to leak from the body, there are also fevers where the blood becomes too sticky, due to heat inside, and so does not come out (khai lueat bo ok), and where the blood clots and become stuck (khai lueat kam). A related disorder is khai tin meu dam (fever with black hands and feet). Ordinary fevers which do not leave the body can create internal heat, which goes to the head, causing red eyes and face - or in severe cases, convulsions or loss of consciousne ss. Although more often of the hot type, fevers can also create cold inside (nao yu nai) , such as khai nao sat san (fever with cold and shivering), and khai huea bo ok (fever where the sweat does not come out). High internal heat can cause the heat to move out into the skin, causing spots, such as khai ok toum (fever with spots coming out) and kai mak deng (fever with red 160 spots, measles) . These toum can also be inside th e body and invisible (toum yu nai), as in the case of khai mak mai (fever with swelling) . Colour is also used in differentiating fever types . Acute, hot fevers manifest as redness in the face or body , and dark colouring indicates that the heat has affected the blood. Chronic and alternating fevers are characteris ed by the presence of yellowne ss in the hands, face, skin, eyes or nails, such as fevers associated with the liver/bile, forest fever (khai pa) and chronic fevers (khai sam huea ). Khai tam tan is a chronic alternating fever in which the person becomes like the snake known as tam tan , with red, white and yellow stripes on their hands and feet, and a flickering tongue. Chronic fevers may occur when acute fevers have not been treated properly, leading to a hot bod y and diseased liver and intestines with toum. Fevers can originate inside th e body, due to inflammation in the internal organs such as the liver, gallbladder, spleen or lung; disorder s of the blood ; or the presence of toum/mak mai (spots, swellings) and fi/nong (furuncles/ pus inside). 55 A category of fevers described as toxic (phit)56 are associated with body toxicity stemming from the ingestion of toxic substances through eating, with symptoms including high fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Khai tulaphit is said to refer to the biomedical category of typhoid fever. Fevers with a non - digestive cause can also descend in the body and enter the stomach and intestines, causing diarrhoea with black vomit and faeces (khai khi dam hak dam). Post-partum fevers are another category . At this time a woman is particularly vulnerable to invasive forces, due to the ingestion of something 'wrong' (phit), or not observ ing traditional post -partum practices . This affects the uterus , causing pain, dizziness and fever (khai mae nying phit kam, kabun), possibly representing the biomedical category of purpureal fever. Fever can also arise during pregnancy, when the woman is in a vulnerable state. Similar categories were described by Spire in the early 20th century , taken from manuscripts in the area of Xi eng Khouang in northern Laos. He noted that although the clinical description of disease is usually brief, emphasis is placed upon fever differentiation according to s ymptoms, such as fever with heat, cold, shivering, shaking or coma (Spire 1907). Vidal, writing on characteristics of Lao medicine in the 1950s, also use d fever as an 55 The terms toum and nong are also mentioned in a study of Northern Thai disease concepts . \"Tum = An isolated macule, papule, vesicle, pustul e or bulla...pustules may be specified as tum noong (with pus) \" (Brun & Schumacher 1994: 151). 56 It should be noted that phit may refer to on e of two different words, with different initial consonants: (wrong) and (toxic, poisonous). A fuller discussion of phit (poison) is given in chapter 5. 161 example, explaining that it shows how diseases are classified according to symptom patterns (Vidal 1956). Similar fever terminology is used by healers in Northern Thailan d in the 1980s, recorded by Brun & Schumacher (1994), who note a distinction between fevers with or without sweat (the second type is more dangerous), fevers where the patient feels hot, or cold, and the frequency of the fever attack (s udden, chronic, inte rmittent). Pottier (2007) explains how the healer he worked with in northern Laos in the 1960s group ed fevers according to opposing principles, based on symptom patterns . The four main criteria he mentions are cold or hot, sweating or t he absence of sweat, intermittent or continuous, and the place where symptom s are found in the body (hands, feet or torso). In Figure 1 7, I have included many of these principles, but have also attempted to show connections betwe en fever types and body sy stems to represent how khai is understood to move and evolve in the body. For example, fevers with high internal heat are related to fevers where the blood clots because heat inside the body makes the blood sticky . Toxic fevers are related to post -partum f evers as they may be associated with ingesting phit (things that are toxic) or phit (things which are 'wrong'). B oth very hot and very cold fevers can cause convulsions, and are thus the most severe type s of fever . The healers ' explanations of constantly e volving symptoms patterns show how they perceive diseases as dynamic. This is significant in considering treatment with herbal medicine, as the dis order is not conceived as static but is apt to mutate into different forms. Indeed, healers descri be how fev ers also change with time . As Po Nueang comments : \"There are less cases of fever now compared to the past, but they are more difficult to treat. There didn't use to be so many different types, such as the black vomit and faeces kind which some people in th e village get now and is very dangerou s.\" Forest fevers Figure 1 7 also shows how fever origins and pathologies are related to place. Ordinary fevers which originate in the village (khai ban thammada ) are not difficult to treat, in comparison to the more s erious category of forest fevers (khai pa) , affecting those who spend time in the forest . Forest fevers include fever with yellowness, fever from insects, and fever from spirit attack . These explanations emphasi se the place of the fever and associated envi ronmental factors . Indeed, the most widely -used 'old' name for malaria is khai pa (forest fever), denoting that the fever's origin is the forest. 162 People in Phamuk village rarely mentioned the specific cause of fever during household interviews . Indeed, the insistence on identifying caus ality may be affected by the preconceptions of interviewers familiar with biomedical models of cause and effect (Hsu, 2005:170) . However, public health campaign s, represented by large banners with photos of mosquitoes, announ cements by loudspeaker and regular visits by NGO workers to 'count cases' have been mostly effective in bringing information about mosquito -borne illnesses such as malaria and dengue . When pe ople were not sure, Dr would helpfully interject \"because a mosquito bit you!\". Instead of providing a linear cause -effect model, villagers explain ed at length where and through what activity the fever had entered the person. For example, Mae Song , a village woman in her 40s , described the fevers in her family th us: \"My husband had khai nyung [noting symptoms as alternating hot and cold fever, headache, diarrhoea, sweating, aching, headache], this was a fever from the forest, because we work hard in the forest and there are mosquitoes there.\" As Po Nueang notes, pragmatically: \"In the past they didn't ask whether the mosquito has bitten you or not, because the mosquito bites Lao people every day, so they're not thinking about whether it comes from mosquitoes. They knew that they got malaria when they entered th e fores t. So w hen people a re ill, with fever and yellowness, I think 'this is the disease that a western medicine doctor calls khai malaria , but a healer calls it khai pa or khai mak mai '.\"57 Here he demonstrates how the healers are able to think about di sease from different perspectives. Indeed, h igh alternating fever (khai ba), shivering cold fever leading to convulsions (khai nao san sat) , chronic intermittent fever (khai sam huea ), gastro -intestinal issues such as vomiting and diarrhoea which may be a dark colour ( khai nyung long lamsai thokthong, khai k hi dam hak dam), or with skin and nails (khai piu lueang nang lueang ) are al so described by healers as fevers which may be due to malaria. S imilar terms were noted in northern Thailand by Brun & S chumacher (1994), with the additions of khai chap san (shivering fever) , pang (fever with swollen abdomen) and khai weng wan (fever every second day). Despite the shift in explanations and names, the spa tial and social significance of forest fevers thus re main relatively unchanged. Conceptually, this emphasis on environmental origins 57 Mak mai means to be shaped like fruit, and this is said to refer to internal swellings, or inflammation inside the body; in these incidences, eating fruit is said to be dangerous . 163 links to what Singh (2012:43) has described as the \" mueang-pa dialectic\", in which the dangers inherent in the forest are juxtaposed with the social order of the village, and t he 'deep forest' (pa dong) becomes progressively more threatening the further it is from the village. These dangers are associated both with attack by spirits and the loss of souls .58 For mild cases this considered quite an ordinary problem; one can catch a spirit (phi) just as you would catch a cold; and is usually a case of headache, withdrawal, mental confusion and sometimes a low fever59. Indeed, division between naturalistic and personalistic aetiologies (Foster, 1976) is not useful here, as phi (spirits ) are considered just as much a natural phenomenon as insects, when they are encountered in the appropriate place.60 As Ratarasarn (1986) argues in an analysis of Thai medical theory, the historical tendency towards emphasising the supernatural causes of il lness in anthropology may reveal an ethnocentric bias about what is viewed as 'natural'. In fact, a closer correlation can be drawn with European miasmic disease theories, in which the environment and climate are associated with the spread of illness ( mal-aria). Forest fevers are also connected with perceptions of lawlessness, even though forests officially belong to the state (Singh, 2010).61 Different types of forest activities may lead to catching fevers; daytime trips e.g. to collect mushrooms in patch es of forest near the village are described as less dangerous than during the night (when the Anopheles mosquito i s most active). Due to a new decree banning illegal logging , night -time activities have become more common, as it is easier to evade forest o fficials in the dark (Elliott et al. in press). The illegal but lucrative harvesting of rosewood is associated with cross -border mobility in the far south (Singh 2014) , and fevers from the forest plague soldiers sent to guard these areas (Elliott et al. in press). Rather than reflecting a belief -based model of cause and effect, the category of 'forest fevers' is therefore representative of how villagers orient themselves and negotiate both 'old' and 'new' dangers. 58 See Chapters 5 and 7 for fuller discussions of the spiritual significance of the forest. 59 Phi can however, also intentionally attack humans, although often when the person has put themselves in a spiritually dangerous position such as learning magical practices without following the correct prohibitions. These cases are much more seri ous (see Chapter 5). 60 There is a complex taxonomy of phi, based often on specific geographical locations such as places in the forest, water sourc es, village boundaries, rooms in houses. 61 See Chapter 8 for a fuller discussion of the political significanc e of forests. 164 Fever medicine Fever plants In Chapter 3, I discussed how a plant is defined as medicine within a general category (ya) as well as more specific categori sation principles. However, as I pointed out, this is also defined by use; a plant is medicine when it is used as such. But in order for plan ts to be used as medicine, they must go through certain processes . It can be argued that plant medicines are not natural herbs, but drugs, as their use entails particular cultural practices. Indeed, the use of plants for medicine can be understood as mater ial culture, in which through specific preparations they become cultural artefacts (Hsu 2010). However, p lants in medical practice are frequently examined in a decontextuali sed manner which is based upon the idea of a plants as a natural product containing an active ingredient with specific anti -disease properties . This may not take into cons ideration the practices of collection and preparation that create a medicine. Therefore, f ailure rates of bioassays are high; as Mgbeoji observes in Nigeria, \"...the hea ler does not rely on the so -called 'bioactive' part of the plant, but conceives of the p lant as part of a complex and holistic regime deployed towards the alleviation of illness\" ( Mgbeoji 2006: 6). The importance of transforming the raw plant into a medic ine is well -known by the Lao healers . In the treatment of illness, they almost always use plants in combination in the form of tamla, herbal prescriptions or formulae . They emphasise the importance of knowing how to combine, prepare and adapt remedies in s pecific ways. Vilaysack explains : \"One plant does not treat something alone; you must know how to combine it. One tamla does not necessarily treat one disease type - you must look at the person individually and understand their symptoms, and treat the per son according to the symptoms, using different prescriptions for different people. If you use the wrong medicine it will not be effective - you must understand which type of fever it is.\" In total, 40 unique prescriptions for the treatment of fever, each containing between 1 and 13 ingredients, were recorded, from 12 different healers in Champasak province. Each treats one or more particular fever pathologies (Appendix 12).62 The highest proportion of these prescriptions (more than half when combined) belong to Ajan Vilaysack and P o 62 A detailed analysis of remedies specifically for malaria is given in a related publication (Elliott et al . 2020) 165 Nueang , and they provided most of the explanations about their actions . However, each healer has a unique style and perspective on herbal formulary. These prescriptions contained a total of 88 plants according to Lao names (of w hich 6 1 could be identified to species level and eight to genus level from collected samples ), nine animal and two mineral products. A further 28 plants were more generally indicated for use against fever during plant collection, conversation or indica ted in lists, making a total of 116 plants (of which 70 were identified to species level and a further 11 to genus level). The most commonly cited plants are listed in Table 1 5, and the complete list of identified species cited in prescriptions is shown in Appendix 11. More information on use is given in Appendix 12. Furthermore, when asking people during the household survey \"do you know any remedies to treat fever?\", nine home -made remedies were men tioned by villagers, including 11 ingredients in total (as th ey were mostly single -ingredient remedies), as well as the use of ya luk kon , manufactured herbal pills (Table 1 6). Most of these were cultivated in home gardens, or, if wild, collected close to the village. 166 Table 15: Most commonly occurring plant in gredients in herbal prescriptions for fever Total number of citations for fever Numb er of healers cited Lao name Scientific Name Family Part used to treat fever 16 2 Ya nang barbata Miers 4 2 vomica L.

Meliaceae Leaf Boil leaves for malaria 168 Fever treatment principles Medicines used for fever (ya ke khai) are specific to the type of fever - although as I will discuss later, the treatment strategy may also define the disorder. Fever treatments primarily addr ess the symptom pattern , rather than the underlying cause. Symptoms may vary within fevers which are considered to have the same cause, according to what happens when the invading force (external) interacts with the person's constitution (int ernal). Prescriptions are named descriptively according to the illness symptoms, and can be used for one or more type of fever, especially if adapted. When these are written down, they usually do not contain detailed inf ormation about specific usage . This, as Brun & Schumacher (1994) observe, is a more speciali sed knowledge set which is passed down orally as part of the process of learning (as discussed in Chapter 3 ). The main principle in the case of fever is to cool dow n excess heat and expel toxic substances from the body. When fevers are not easily treated and do not leave the body quickly, they will often cause heat inside, which may create what are described as spots or swellings (toum) within the person's organs; af ter time these may also manife st on the skin. As Vilaysack explain s: \"If the toum are inside, you won't see them but the person will have a fever, maybe for a week, and they feel very hot, then the spots will come out onto the skin (khai ok toum).\" In these cases, he proposes using a cooling medicine to draw the heat outwards to the skin, which will help to reduce the person's fever. If these toum enter the intestines and digestive system, they may rupture, causing blood in stools or vomiting. As outlined in the differentiation of fever types, the symptom picture can be variable, including cold fever types . Therefore, prescriptions must include the right balance of warming -cooling ingredients in combination with those used for connected symptoms e.g. diarrh oea. Every plant or animal/mineral product has specific qualities that interact with others in the formula. It should be noted that not every ingredient within a fever prescription is considered to treat fever, as some may have other purposes - treat ing ot her symptoms or helping the ingredients to work together. As a general principle, there are four main parts to the formula , each of which may be represented by one or more ingredients . A 'chief' ingredient for the primary function, an 'associate' to assist its function, a third to provide 169 the taste and smell, and a fourth to harmonize the formula and assist in absorption .63 Extra ingredients may also be added to treat additional symptoms such as digestive issues or pain. However, prescriptions may also be co mposed of quite varying structures. As is common in Asian medical systems, and similarly to Thai medical theory (Salguero 2016), medicinal substances are attributed certain qualities . These include thermal properties (relative levels of hot and c old, and c oncurrent warming and cooling actions in the body); tastes/flavours (sweet, bitter, salty, astringent, pungent, sour, aromatic), and particular effects such as heaviness, wind -expelling, sweat -inducing. Some of these qualities are empirically obs ervable (t aste, colour), although still open to subjective interpretation, and others ( hot, cold ) less easily perceived in initial examination. However, the hot -cold spectrum is culturally familiar, as it is widely applied to food plants, although, it shou ld be emph asised that these properties are relative, i.e. in comparison to other substances and body condition, and so they should not be categorised on a binary hot/cold scale. Qualities may be inherent in the plant itself, often associated with symbolic body relat ionships (Chapter 3); and also may also be created through the use of different preparation methods. The overall effect of remedies is usually to cool the body , although this is dependent on the type of fever . Very hot fevers will need prescriptions with s trongly cooling qualities, and cold-inside fevers will include more warming ingredients to induce sweating. In Chapter 3 , I explored how bitterness (that khom) is a recurring theme in depictions of medicinal plants in Laos . The healer's fever remedies always have some bitter ingredients, which help to expel fever and heat from the body . Indeed, i t is notable that bitter plants are used cross - culturally across the world to treat fevers including malaria (Vigneron et al. 2005; Philippe et al. 2005). However, they should be used with caution as too much bitterness can cause toxicity and reactions like a headache or vomiting , or anaemia . Ingredients with a sweet taste are used to offset the bitterness, and to tonify the body; thus it also said that fever remedie s are khom-wan (bitter and sweet). Another common property is yellowness, used to treat yellowness in the body (skin, eyes, or nails) . There is crossover with remedies to treat the liver and gallbladder for which plants with the same properties (bitter/swe et/yellow) are used. In overall, a formula must be well -balanced between different flavours and properties to create the desired effect. 63 As described in Tamla pedsat phuen mueang lao , an anonymously -authored book of herbal prescriptions kept at the ITM. 170 In these prescriptions , the selection of plants can also be linked to their grouping from a classificatory perspective . For example, the toum ka (all Strych nos genus ) are all described as bitter . Toum ka seng/ seng buea (S. nux -vomica ) is said to be extremely bitter, hence toxic if improperly used . The toum ka also have broad rounded leaves with parallel veins , and large yellow coloured sphere -shaped fruit , indicating the treatment of yellowness and swelling . Furthermore , the name toum (swollen) indicates that they are used to treat toum inside the body (see Table 8). This genus has been widely cross -culturally recorded for toxic and bitter properties, such as in Amazonian contexts (Schultes et al. 1990), although more rarely for use against fevers. These principles can be extended beyond the use of plant medicines, especially among healers with some exposure to biomedicine. For example, Po Nueang explains that : \"The correct medicine for khai malaria would be bitter - we use plants with the bitter element ( tad k hom), suc h as kok seng, kok toum ka . Likewise, quinine, which we used when I was in the army, is bitter - bitter tas tes treat malaria . Every medicinal plant has a flavour in the formula. For example, when you have a high fever, hot body, you must take cool medicine - it's the same in western medicine, they also use cooling medicine .\" Likewise, Vilaysack compared the use of certain plants to popular drugs , such as nao duean ha ('cold for 5 months', indet. ), which has a strongly cooling action used to lower fever which he described as being \"like paracetamol\". Thus , it can be seen that principles from traditional medici ne like flavours may also be applied to biomedicines where they are adopted. Medicine preparation methods The method use d to prepare medicine affects its properties . Ya fon is prepared by rubbing a small piece of the plant (most often root, or woody part /bark) against a rough -textured stone (hin sa) directly into cool water . This grind s it into a powder which dissolve s into the water, making a raw solution which has not been heated at all. It is then kept in a bottle and drunk 'like water'. This technique is also the one always used for animal and mineral products, including shells, bones, horns, stones and tee th, which may be mixed with plant parts in ya fon. This preparation method is considered to be cooling and thus useful for fever; it is especially p opular in the southern lowland areas, the hottest part of the country . It is also popular in nearby Cambodia , and may be linked to ancient Khmer influence in 171 Champasak (Vidal 1958) . During pregnancy, the parts are dissolved in coconut water which is easily available and said to give strength to the woman. Decoctions, ya tom (boiled medicine) use a larger quantity of the plant part, which is sliced into pieces, and boiled in drinking water for 15 -20 minutes . It is then drunk warm like tea, or cool like wate r. This method is considered more warming, and is especially useful when treating cold state s such as the post-partum period . However, it is also used in treating fevers. Many of the formulae can be used with either method . The two methods may be combined , usually with ya fon used first, especially where the person is diagnosed as having interna l inflammation which needs to be cooled. As ya fon is considered easier to tolerate than ya tom and with a less bitter taste, it is the method predominantly used for treating children. Ya fon is also a popular method whe n plant ingredients are more difficult to collect or there is concern about conserving the plant, as a small amount will last for a long time . Po Nueang is specialist in ya fon - he rarely prescribes decoctions , although he may give people recipes. Using the ya fon method also means that he doesn't have to collect large quantities of plant materials, lessening the number of collection trips he must take as he gets older. Vilaysack uses both methods , but regularly replenishes his store of plant materials for making decoctions, involving a substantial amount of physical labour. The 'soaking' method (ya sae), in which plant parts are steeped in water is considered to be a very cooling and gentle method, us eful for bringing out the sweetness of certain ingredients . After steeping the ingredients in water for a few hours, the water is then drunk, or used as a cooling wash for the body, especially in cases of skin eruptions. Body washes can also be m ade from c ooled decoctions. Where a treatment needs to be applied externally in the form of a paste, such as for swellings or abrasions on the skin, a concentrated version of ya fon is used (ya tha). Another method which requires less input from the patient, but mo re from the practitioner, is the manufacture of ya luk kon, small round black pills which are made by crushing the ingredients together, rolling into balls and drying in the sun. In this tech nique, the plant is directly ingested, and the practitioner must thus be precise about ingredients and dosage, particularly when using pl ants with high toxicity such as toum ka (Strychnos genus) . There are some exceptions to the rule of combining products in tamla. Two plants widely known to treat fevers, and especially khai malaria, are usually (but not always) used alone 172 in specific preparation methods . Khuea khao ho (vine of T. Crispa ) is cut into pieces, dried and soaked in alcohol, then drunk. Hua Kapuk (rhizome of A. macrorrhizos ) is sliced and boiled, then drunk a s a decoction until the person's lips begin itching . These bitter plants may also be combined with a sweetening ingredient such as oi dam (black sugarcane) to make them more palatable. Among villagers' plant use for fever, as well as decoctions and teas, p opular preparation methods include medicinal food and drink , and steam sauna. The leaves and s tem of phak nok (Centella asiatica (L.) Urb .) are used to make a cooling drink or jelly in the hot seaso n. Homemade herbal steam infusion is a popular cure for co lds, and p ungent/aromatic species are used as a steam bath as well as culinary purposes, such as ginger and lemongrass . Coconut water is easily sourced from the village and used to cool and strengthen the body. 173 Ya fon inc luding woody plant parts, shells, horns and bones.

Furthermore, I argued that while a certain level of knowledge is shared, the specialised use of plant me dicines occurs in heterogenous forms . The exact composition of p rescriptions is dependent on the healer's personal knowledge set, received knowledge transmission, additions from their own experience or replacement ingredients, or even the invention of new prescriptions . These are reasons ascribed by Bru n & Schumacher (1994) for what they observe as a surprising lack of overlap between ingredients in prescriptions . Similarly, Elkington (2001) found quite a low level of crossover in plants found in prescripti ons from palm leaf manu scripts and individual he alers against symptoms of tuberculosis. This is a major issue in any attempt t o systemati se traditional medicine knowledge or to a ttribute properties to one plant alone without considering its use in combinat ion. However, in my research , fever remedies showed a higher overlap in ingredients compared to the examples above. Certain plants appeared frequently (see Table 15). Within 40 prescriptions , the most -used plant, ya nang khao was cited 16 times, the next toum ka khao, 11 times , and mo noi , 9 times - although this is still not enough of an overlap to locate one particular plant as a cure -all fever remedy. The exception to this is perhaps single -plant remedie s shown in Prescriptions E (Table 22 & 23), such as such as khuea khao ho (vine of Tinapsora Crispa A. macrorrhizos ) and lasabi (leaves of A. paniculat a). These are widely used both by healers and as household remedies against fever and malaria, and easily found ( kapuk grows in h ome gardens, khuea khao ho, 'vine at the gate' is a climbing shrub easily found in forest around the village or in gardens, and lasabi can be cultivated or grows wild as a 'weed' ). They are also mentioned for use against malaria in Phetsouvanh 's (1990) compilation of herbal prescriptions , and a small clinical trial on kapuk (A. macrorrhizos ) at the then Traditional Medicine Research Centre in Vientiane showed promising results in inhibiting the actions of Plasmodium falciparum (Phetsouvanh 1991) .64 64 Commonalities in use may extend more widely, pointing perhaps to links between the healers and Asian medical systems. A comparison of the most cited spec ies specifically for malaria fevers examined whether each species was in common use against malaria (o r fever), and if their antimalarial activity had been assessed though in vitro and/ or in vivo testing, or clinical evaluation. Interestingly, this showed that the species which occurred the most often in the healers' prescriptions were also the most used elsewhere (63% of the species with 4 or more citations were traditionally used against malaria according to the literature), thus displaying a higher use consensus for the most cited species (Elliott et al. 2020). 184 Beyond m erely counting ingredients , the pattern of prescribing is significant . For example, the combination of mo noi (C. barbata ) and ya nang khao (T. triandra ) to harmoni se the formula is common among the healers of Champasak - when these two ingredients are com bined, they are said to be a tonic. Particularly within prescriptions from the same healer, certain patterns are evident , suggesting individual style s. In Chapter 3 , I explored principles of plant grouping , with differentiation according to modifiers such as colour, shape and size . Combining plants from the same group within herbal prescriptions is said to enhance results, as each one is given a slightly different indication (yellow types for jaundice, red for the blood and so on), and may also perhaps hel p to lower the quantity of each plant in the mix. Here I show how these principles appear in practical form within herbal prescripti ons. Prescription A (Table 17 & 18), a decoction , is very typical of Vilaysack's prescriptions, in which he uses groups of plants with the same generic name (three toum ka and three ya nang), perhaps in order to maximise their effect. As Vilaysack explains, the red toum ka (Strychnos wallichiana Steud. ex A. DC. ) is strongest, followed by the vine ( Strychnos axillaris Colebr.) and the least strong is the white type (S. nux-blanda ). The ya nang (women's medicine) family are used for fever as well as gynaecological conditions . Similarly , the red ya nang (Bauhinia strychnifolia Craib. ) is stronger, followed by the yellow one (Limacia triandra Miers ), useful against yellowness in the body, and the white or ordinary has the mildest effect (T. triandra), which is also used as a general body tonic. When combined with mo noi (Cyclea barbata Miers , 'little doctor'), it has the effec t of harmoni sing the ingredients . Mo noi is a cooling remedy (the leaves and stem are also squeezed to make a kind of jelly to be eaten in the hot season), which is contrasted with the warming action of lasabi (A. paniculata ), commonly used for colds with a sore throat and als o diabetes . This balances the prescription between thermal properties; it could also be hypothesised that it relates to the hot and cold stages of malaria. In a later version of this prescription, Vilaysack added three more plants, ma king the formula more strongly cooling, bitter and anti -inflammatory (for aksep , khai, and ien don (Eurycoma harmandiana Pierre ) are considered a pair due to their similar appearance and indications in removing internal heat and inflammation. Nao duean ha ('cold for 5 months' ) has a very strongly cooling action to reduce fever. Prescription B (Table 1 8) is a pill recipe by another practitioner, Konmilit from Khong district . It shows a similar combina tion of the three bitter toum ka plants from the Strychnos 185 genus , the hite shiny -type (S. nux-vomica ). This last is described as poisonous (buea) and is known to be a highly toxic plant ( Ponraj et al. 2017). As the seed is used , it is added in very small amounts (just 1g in comparison to 1kg of wood for the others). Kan lueang ('yellow cut bark ') (Gonocaryum lobbianum (Miers) Kurz ) is used for the liver and to remove yellowness . It is a hot m edicine, as are ling ngo (T. crispa). The latter is a widely used vine (Chapter 3) which has shown effective ness against P. falciparum (Bertani et al. 2005 ). Overall, t hese ingredients make the remedy hot and bitter, so it can be hypothesi sed that it would be most effective against khai malaria manifesting with chills and shaking ( khai nao sat san). This is also a prescription with high toxicity ; the preparation method m eans that the ingredients can be taken in carefully controlled amounts. Another grouping principle is the concept that certain types within a group are medicinal, such as sour fruit varieties. This can be seen in Prescription C (Table 1 9), a 'soaking' recipe (ya sae) from Nueang , which contains a combination of leaves from different fruit trees steeped in cool water. Leaves are better suited to soaking , sauna or making tea rather than boiled in decoctions where they are likely to disintegrate . Mak f ueang so m (Averrhoa carambola L.) is the sour form of starfruit. The red guava (mak sida deng, P. guajava ) is considered to affect the blood, and is thus useful for stopping haemorrhaging . Of a preliminary study on 20 Lao plants tested against the dengue virus, gu ava leaves showed the highest level of inhibition (T . Vial, pers . communication pila , Punica granatum L.) also cool the body and act against toxicity. Overall, t his is a gentle, slightly sour and very cooling formula due to the properties of the plants and the preparation method (soaking), which is then used as an external wash to draw heat from the skin in cases of khai lueat ok, dengue fever which may be haemorrhagic. The composition of plants or other materials within a formula is also affected by the preparation method . As shown in Prescription D (Table 20), ya fon typically has quite a long list of ingredients ( this prescription has nine ), mostly tre e roots used in small amounts . The prescription includes two minerals - stones and sand from the Mekong , whose h eavy and watery qualities denote them as cooling. Similarly to the last prescription, sour fruit trees mak kham som (sour tamarind , Tamarindus in pila (pomegranate , P. granata ) are used to remove toxicity from the body. Kadon nam 186 (Barringtonia acutangula (L.) Gaertn. ) is cold and astringent, and removes internal heat and spots, and the grass nya khat is also cooling for fever. It contains the typical combination of mo noi (C. barbata ) and ya nang khao (T. triandra ) to harmonize the formula. Overall, this is a very cooling and slightly sour and astringent formula . The preparation method of grinding the ra w ingredients into cool water accentuates its cooling qualities and is said to be easier to tolerate for a person who is vomiting. However, use of a cooling remedy seems surprising for a person who is already feeling cold . An explanation may be that in ord er to expel phit from the body , an initially cooling remedy must be used. Retrospective diagnosis, personalising and 'trying out' These example s of fever remedies show how specific prescriptions relate to fever differentiation. Indeed, the process of 'naming' a fever includes an examination of the sick person's symptoms in comparison to the healer's own stock of herbal prescriptions. In order to treat the person, a healer will first diagnose the type of fever by looking at their face, skin, eyes, feeling their temperature, observing their behaviour and asking them about their symptoms and history. Whilst the stated diagnosis may be quite simple , for example 'fever with spots', treatment may be more specific than the name suggests . 'Fever with spots' will be treated differently case by case. In what Hsu (2005:166) has called the \"sameness of diagnosis\", a condition which is named quite generally is differenti ated clearly only through the method of treatment, in which she argues there is a \"synchronicity of d iagnosis and treatment\". If the diagnosis and fever name mentions the invasive agent, such as insect, weather, toxic substance or spirit, this may influen ce the treatment . However, as described earlier, fevers arise from and occur within certain environme nts. Diagnosis thus focuses on the person's dynamic state rather than the proximal cause, a well -documented concept in many Asian medical therapies. For example, in Chinese medicine, if a person is said to be suffering from 'damp', this may imply possible causes (weather, food), but more specifically to the body state of 'damp'. Unschuld describes this as \"patterned knowledge\", which is \"bas ed on a concept of health that reveals itself through its usefulness. A knowledge is true when its application leads t o a desired end\" ( Unsch uld 2010 : 58). A person who is suffering from khai phit (toxic fever; in state of toxicity) is treated for the state of phit, regardless of ideas about its origin. Restoring equilibrium is the primary aim of the treatment, rather tha n targeting specific pathogens. 187 Returning to Nichter's concept of \"taskonomies \", it can be argued that the definition of the fever diagnosis is revealed by the matching 'tasks' used to tackle it . If a very cooling medicine is effective in helping a person to feel better, this confirms the 'heat' of the fever. One example of this is the well -known use of kapuk (A. maccrorhizos ), which is taken when khai malaria is suspected, by slicing the rhizome , boiling and drinking the warm decoction . If, and when, the person's lips begin to itch, this proves firstly that they had khai malaria , and secondly that it is now cured. If there is no itching, there was no malaria - or, the treatment was ineffective, meaning that the process of diagnosis and treatment must begin again. This principle can also be observed in attitudes towards seeking treatment; as people try multiple methods, the one which is perceived to be effective determines the label of the illness. For example, in M ae Song's story , she explains how they tri ed different treatment methods after it her husband's illness became a chronic fever. \"After treatment at the health centre for khai nyung he was feeling better, but then after working hard it came back again. It be came khai sam hu ea, not so serious but i t kept coming back. We tried many different treatment methods, including the district hospital for song nam [IV fluids] , Dr. Sipha came to give us medicine , and he also took ya hak mai , ya tom which I made for him from my own knowledge of plants based on m y parents' knowledge - I collected the plants in the forest. We also visited P o Nueang for blowing and he gave us some ya fon to treat fever with yellow eyes and skin. Slowly his condition imp roved.\" The healers' approach to treatment demonstrates the pro duction of medicinal knowledge through experimentation (Chapter 3). Indeed, this method can be crucial to the success of the treatment, and may be facilitated by daily visits for people suffering from severe illness episodes . The healer will carefully asse ss their symptoms and improvement, or lack of, in order to adjust their treatment strategy. Vilaysack explains that a skilled healer can take a generic prescription and alter it accordin g to their needs : \"There are more than 100 types of medicine to treat fever, but 5 - 10 types can treat all of them. One type of medicine can treat many fevers, if you have the ability to know how to use it .\" Thus , it can be seen the skill of treating fever lies not just in knowing many plant uses and prescriptions that treat different symptom patterns, but also how to skilfully adapt a formula by understanding how to combine or replace ingredients and match it to t he person. Creating a treatment which fits not just the particular pattern of symptoms, but also the person' s constitution was emphasised by the healers as a sign that a practitioner fully understood the use of traditional medicine. Vilaysack described it thus: 188 \"If one person t akes kok lin mai their fever may be cured, but if you sa y 'kok lin mai is good for fe ver', it's not correct. But if you t ake kok si siad, it could be good for fever. It's the same for western medicine - if using ya ke buad [painkillers ], some people might take aspirin, others take paracetamol . You must use the prescriptions differently fo r different people .\" This demonstrates the difficulty in attributing measurable medicinal actions to specific plants, and also how concept s of personalised treatment were extended into the adoption of pharmaceutical medicines. Conclus ion In this chapte r, I hav e explored the landscape of sickness through the perspective of fevers, and the process by which illnesses are locally defin ed and treat ed. I have shown how illness arises in the body due to invasive factors which penetrate weakened bodily boundari es, or from internal dysfunction. Fever is a fundamentally important illness category, especially in the hot southern lowlands. It may be associated with the idea of being 'generally sick', loss of equilibrium in bodily, social or spiritual spheres, or rel ationships with certain environments such as the forest. Drawing on the principles of plant classification and medicinal knowledge discussed in Chapter 3 , I have shown how plant medicines are formulated and prescribed for maximum effectiveness , and emphasi zed the complexity involved in differentiating disease types and creating a personalized treatment . I have demonstrated why identifying the cause of illness is less important than the methods used to tackle it, and how diagnosis may occur retrospectively t o treatment, In the following c hapters , I will further address the question: what makes medicine effective ? I discuss the effects of principles stemming from astrology, religion, and magic , and how the interaction between practitioner and patient affects s atisfaction with the outcome. 189 Chapter 5: Power , Protection & Phitsanu Introduction This chapter is about therapeutic power . The previous chapter examined how illness is diagnosed, and medicine is created , using plant materials which are given to the sick person to boil, grind, drink or apply in personalised formulae. However, this is only part of the picture. As the healers explain, not all the effect of their medicine c an be attributed to the potency of the ingredients. In order to maximi se the eff icacy of his medicines, a healer must also pay attention to aspects of his practice which can be described as spiritual or magical .65 Efficacy is a contentious subject in medical anthropology (e.g. Etkin 1988 ; Waldram 2000) . The predominant criticism of mos t biomedical definitions of efficacy are that they don't account for subjectivity - specifically, with in the mind -body of both the practitioner and patient . It is now well -understood that the patient's subjective experience and understanding of efficacy is important in assessing healing outcomes . However, there has been less consideration given to what the practitioner actually does in his treatments to intentionally achieve a favourable outcome (Laplante 2015) . In this chapter, I examine efficacy from the healer's perspective , showing that he follows a clearly defined system which incorporates loca l cosmologies . As well as utilising his skill in herbal formulary and diagnostics, he also draws on sources of therapeutic power which cause his treatment to have a more profound effect and are embodied and transferred through his own practices. This chapt er outlines the techniques used by the healer to ensure his medicine is effective , and thus touches on knowledge which may be classed as secret, or not widely kno wn. The vitalising aspect of the healer's treatment is phitsanu (also spelt phisanu), which incorporates Buddhist, Brahm anic and animist elements , and is reflective of the complex cosmologies of southern Laos. Phitsanu is both the activating element of the medicine and the origin of the healer's therapeutic power. In the present d ay, practitioners also draw on modern pharmaceutical ideas which re -conceptualise phitsanu as a quantifiable material 65 'Magic' is the most commonly used translation for Lao language terms such as sanyasat, vetmon and visa which describe the manipulation of spiritual potential in various forms by a practitioner. Although using the word 'magic' may be subject to different i nterpretations, I use it in this chapter simply as a translation for the purpose of writing in English. It is not my intention to give a theoretical discussion on its meaning in anthropology. 190 substance, or the 'active ingredient' of the medicine. The relative presence or absence of phitsanu is under stood to have a distinct effec t on the treatment outcome . The healer's own t herapeutic power and the ability to use phitsanu is transmitted through the initiation process, in which he enters into a teach er-student relationship. During this process, he receives another body of knowledge ; healing mantra. The words are kept secret , and are specific to each teacher and illness treated. T o activate phitsanu, these powerful words are blown in the breath of the healer onto the body of the person and the medicine , connecting them. However, gain ing power can also be dangerous, and the far south of Laos is known to be a particularly potent place . When practitioners attempt to harness these forces there is thus poten tial for harm as well as healing . Misuse of power can leave the healer vulnerable to spirit possession or madness - so he must carefully regulate his own behaviour. In order to protect himself and augment the level of phitsanu in his medicine, he should keep Buddhist precepts, food and behaviour taboos, display moral action s, and is prohibit ed from formally asking for payment for his services . Although he draws on power which may originate from eclectic sources, his Buddhist practice legitimises his work and demonstrates his morality , which also assists in his popularity as a healer. These principles apply equally to his relationship with the plants he uses as medicine. Power is drawn from natural forces, such as by collecting plants according to astrologica l principles to ensure that the phitsanu remains intact . The p ower inherent in nature must be controlled in order to be beneficial rather than malevolent. A specific plant family, van, have innate magical power . Their roots are thus used to guard against s pirit attack or sorcery - or, they can be used to harm others . The healers use the fragrant variety of van as protection, as part of the treatment process, and to assist in creating phitsanu. 191 The potency of the south In Chapter 3 , I showed how knowledge about using plants as medicine is closely associated with the locality in which both the plants and healers originate. Concurrently, this situated knowledge is placed against a backdrop of the broadly intersecting medical systems o f southeast Asia, includ ing influences from Indi a (see introduction) . The same is true for the healers' utilisation of therapeutic power. Natural forces in the form of specific plants or talismans, healing incantations that are said to have been passed dow n by powerful monks, priests or magicians from the distant past, and the condition of becoming phipob, possessed by a malevolent spirit, are all particularly characteristic of the deep south. In order to better understand the origin of this power, and the background to phitsanu, it is necessary to first delve into the religious and political history of this region. The far south of Laos , including Champasak p rovince, has a widespread reputation for being a spiritually dangerous place . Magical practices are said to be widespread a nd everyone ha s stories of miraculous cures, sorcerous attacks, or people who had gone mad due to improper use of magic. My neighbour in Munlapamok public health dormitory, Bee, was the lone northerner in the district , and spoke frequently of missing his h ome, a Hmong village in Xaysomboun province . His friends warned him about coming to the south and t old him t o be careful of harmful magic - especially from Cambodians and the Lao thueng.66 At Wat Ong Teu, a scholarly temple in Vientiane, I met a senior monk who had grown up in the village neighbouring Ban Phamuk, and attended the temple training school in Munlapamok district. With typical southern vigour and humour he complained, \"When people hear where I am from, they always ask me to perform magic!\" The south's r eputation for potency is thus associated with dan ger. This, as Goudineau describes, represents a fear of the 'other': \"For someone from Vientiane or Luang Prabang, people [of the south] do not only have particular accent s or food. They live in dan gerous regions, or even are dangerous themselves . Lao residents in the southern provinces share these prejudices, but they locate the danger zone further to the east\" (Goudineau 2008:640 , trans . E Elliott). This 'othering ' is strongly associated with eth nicity - the eastern direction, towards Vietnam, includes a number of Vietic and Austro -Asiatic ethnic groups . People Theung 'midland dwellers' refers to indigenous Austro -asiatic populations, who populated the area before the Lao . 192 Champasak speak with fear of Khmer powerful magic coming from over the southern border and amon g the et hnic Khmer people in Champasak . The Isan region of Thailand to the west, containing both ethnic Lao and Khmer, also has a reputation for sorcery and spirit practices (Golomb 1985) . But from where d id this reputation for magical potency and danger originat e? In order to understand this, it is necessary to reflect on the religious history of modern -day Champasak province. From a geographic and political perspective the province is on the periphery and, as discussed in Chapter 2 , has historically been both resistant to centralised power and outward -looking. I n comparison to central and northern Laos it is likely that Theravada Buddhism , and with it the dominant Tai -Lao culture , was relatively late to arrive. Although, as Grabowsky (2007) describes, popu lar Lao narratives suggest that the fir st wave of (Mayahana) Buddhism to arrive was in the south, via the Khmer empire67, shortly after the founding of the Lan Sang kingdom by Fa Ngum in the 14th century, this story has been mostly debunked by historians ( Lorrillard 200 6; Stuart -Fox 1997). Accor ding to accounts by European explorers in the 17th century, at this time the south showed little sign of adher ence to Buddhism, and was still dominated by the presence of indigenous people s. An alternative narrative suggests that Theravada Buddhism was spr ead with the southward migration of the Lao -Tai, reach ing the far south not earlier than the late seventeenth century , furthered by the founding of the kingdom of Champasak by Lao dissidents from Vientiane in 1713 (Gr abowsky 2007:126). Stories from the Cha mpasak Chronicle describe a charismatic monk, Pha Khu Phon Samek , who may have had a Khmer ethnic background, and was known both for his pious observance of Buddhist precepts, and his possible magical power s, and of two reputedly powerful female governors of Champasak. This may go some way towards explaining the reputation of the south for powerful magic , often associated with the Khmer . Whether these stories are historically accurate or not, they are perhap s reflective of what Grabowsky (2007:134) describe s as the \"hybrid\" origin of Champasak - the late arrival of the Lao -Tai, and the presence of indigenous Austro -Asiatic people in the lowland plains as well areas (M. Lorrillard pers . comm unication , 2020). 67 However, the influence of earlier forms of Buddhism in Laos should not be underestimated. Archaeological remains discovered in Vientiane show that Mahayana Buddhism was present in Vientian e in 12/13th century (but probably not in the south) - and Hinayana as far back as 7th century. Tablets such as the Phrabang were written in Sanskrit, not Pali, reflecting their Indic/Mayanana origins (Lo rrillard, pers. comm.). 193 Indeed, the creation myths of Champasak describe the south as more unrefined than the genteel northern Tai kingdom of Luang Prabang, including stories of the dangerous sexual immorality of women (Archaimbuilt 1971) . Prince Boun Om, one of the last descendants of the Champasak royal f amily, descri bed a sense of bad karma through generations and turning to rituals to free them of evil influences (Archaimbult 1971: 48). The association of the South with impurity may also stem from astrological principles and the direction of the Mekong's flow - meani ng, for example, that monks should bathe upstream (north) from where women bathe ( Gagneux 1975). To understand the potent r eputation of the south it is necessary to look further into local cosmologie s. Like many major religions worldwide, Buddhism did not arrive to an empty space, but into an already rich spiritual tapestry. Animism emphasises the vitalizing forces which exist in nature . 68 In Laos, a complex taxonomy of phi (spirits) are felt to be a presence in peoples' everyday lives. These dwell in dist inct locations in the environment, or are ancestral ghosts, and may be benevolent, malevolent, or neutral. Particularly in (but not limited to) rural areas, much attention is devoted to ensuring that the phi are content and do not stray across the boundary into the human world and cause trouble, such as in cases of spirit possession. Relationships with phi emphasise hierarchies and alterity; Sprenger describes animism in Laos as: \"...the ever unfinishable project of socializing humans and non -humans in the project of life -producing difference (Sprenger , 2016: 44)\". Other than for certain exceptions, such as the bang-bot who takes human form (Kleinod in press), the phi are said to be usually non -visible, unlike Amerindian animism (Sprenger 2016).69 Belief in s pirits remains widespread in southern Laos - although this is perhaps, as Sprenger (2016: 43) argues, less based on their \"absolute ontological status \" but on the potential for relationships with them. The most ubiquitous method of maintaining g ood 68 The use of 'animism' to r efer to spirit entities in Southeast Asia is contentious. This contestation stems from the fact that, firstly, the term 'animism' contains historical evolutionist connotations (e.g. Tylor 1903), and secon dly, Southeast Asian animism does not mirror the Ame rindian contexts where it is more commonly applied, in which all living beings may be attributed agency (e.g. Descola 1996). However, Arhem & Sprenger (2016) provide a model of Southeast Asian animism whi ch has different characteristics - for example, the hierarchical nature of human -spirit relationships as opposed to the association of animism with egalitarian social values. 69 This does not, however, prevent attempts at representation. Indeed, when I aske d people whether they had ever seen the phi, they an swered, \"yes, on television\" (often appearing as stereotypical ghosts draped in white sheets in Thai dramas). 194 relatio ns is the spirit house (huean phi), found in most gardens, through which people take care of the spirits (liang phi), by leaving them food, drink and other offerings . For the people of lowland Champasak, who describe themselves as follow ing the Buddha, relations with spirits also have a powerful impact on health and disease (as shown in the previous chapter ). There is no apparent conflict in this approach - as Sprenger (2016) points out, it is only when animist practices come to be identifi ed as a religio us system that they are placed in competition with doctrinal religions. I n 1970s Isan, T erwiel even proposed that \"Buddhist and non -Buddhist is a meaningless distinction for villagers \" (T erwiel 2012: 3) . Whether or not in contemporary Laos we can make this claim , it is clear that daily life revolves around a ritual calendar which pays attention to the needs of the village temple and local spirits equally. As it arrived in this area of the world, rather than replacing local beliefs, Buddhism absorbed and ad apted to local practices . Rural Buddhist practices are intimately connected with the life of the forest and spirits , and have incorporated many animist elements (Hayashi 2003) . And, frequently, animist pract ices in Laos have begun to include Buddhist symbo ls as a means of legitimisation , such as among the upland groups of the Bol aven plateau in Champasak (Sprenger 2017). However, whilst Buddhism has historically been associated with state legitimacy, and has been utilised for nation -building purposes (Stuar t-Fox 1988 ), animist practices are outside the bounds of state control , prompting periodic attempts at reform. King Photsirath issued a decree in 1527 prohibiting animist worship, ordering shrines to be destroyed and altars thrown into the river . This may also be the basis for distinctions made between 'folk' Buddhism and scholarly urban meditation -focused tradition s (Holt 2009 ; Hayasahi 200 3). Since the establishment of the Lao PDR in 1975 , some animist practices were suppressed as part of the modernizing projects of the emergent Lao state ( Endres & Lauser 201 2), which included state -sponsored promotion of Buddhism (Stuart -Fox 1988). However, the politici sation of Buddhism w as never as extensive as , for example, Mynamar, where the state has led influential purification movements to establish power over minority groups (Coderey 2020). The religious reforms of the 1980s allowed slightly more freedom for popular religious practices such as spirit mediums (Evans 2008) . In the present day there is little taboo in speaking of spirit practices in public, except perhaps among marginalised ethnic groups who have recently adopted Buddhism , such as the Pu Noy in the north of Laos (Boute 2018 ; Evans 1998 ). In post-revolutionary Laos , animist practices are described as satsana phi 195 (spirit religion) , perhaps to provide legitimacy, although this remains notably absent from the options for religion in the most recent census (Lao PDR Population and Housing Census, 2015) . To add to th is complexity , another religion has histo rically been present in this area of Southeast Asia. Although the arrival of Buddhism may have been partly associated with Khmer influence, the Khmer empire followed Hindu as well as Mahayana Buddhist practices before the gradual shift to Theravada Buddhis m.70 The name Champasak is said to have both Siamese and Khmer ori gins. 'Pasak' or 'Basaac' is used for other Khmer sites in Cambodia, and 'Champa' is believed to refer either to a Siamese word meaning the 'power of Champa', or the Khmer/Sanskrit term of 'S hakti' referring to the feminine energy of the god Shiva, who was worshipped at the site of Wat Phu (Lintingre 1972) .71 This left visible marks in the southern landscape; as Archaimbault proposes, rather floridly : \"Whereas the Laotians of the North settled on a site where they met no significant trace of a former civil ization which might have impelled them to feelings of modesty, the Laotians who came into the South discovered to their astonishment the vestiges of a grandiose past \" (Archaimbault 1971: 3, tr ans. E Elliott). The material remnants of this are still visible in southern Laos, such as in the trio of Hindu deities carved into the stone at the Khmer palace of Wat Phu (see photo). Across the western border from Champasak, archaeological remains in present -day central Thailand from the Dvravat period from the 6th - 11th centuries show many representations of Hindu gods, especially Vishnu, alongside images of the Buddha (Terwiel 201 2). As Buddhism spread in southeast Asia, it incorporated Hindu gods as deities, most notably Vishnu, the pr eserver, who in Sri Lanka was mythically appointed as the guardian of Buddhism ( Gombrich & Obeyesekere 1988 ). Many deities found in Hinduism are also evident in present -day Theravada practices in Thailand (McDaniel 2013) . A province of central Thailand whi ch still 70 The two most widespread forms of Buddhism in Asia today are Theravada and Mahayana. Whilst T heravada pre-dated Mayahana overall, in Laos, Thaila nd and Cambodia, archaeological remains show that Mahayana was present prior to Theravada as part of the Khmer empire. Although there are distinct differences between the practices and philosophy of these schools (see Gellner 1990), some scholars argue tha t such distinctions are artificial and indeed the Lao themselves do not use the term Theravada to distinguish their 'type' of Buddhism (Kourilsky pers. communication, 2020). 71 However, Champa is actually likely a modern addition to the name. The previous n ame of Champasak was just Bassac, as described in early account by European travellers such as Van Wuystoff in 1641 (Krieken - Pieters, 2010). 196 has many signs of Khmer Hindu influence is named Phitsanulok, usually translated as 'Vishnu's Heaven'; the importance of this will become apparent in the next section. In the Thai courts of this era, Hindu Brahm in priests, inspired by Khmer influe nce, had specific roles , especially in relation to astrology (Terwiel 2012: 15). In contemporary rural Isan, the Brahm in priest (pham) still carries out village rituals ; the Thai reusi, hermit or ascetic , who traditionally wanders from place to place, dra ws on Brahmanic techniques.72 During fieldwork close to the border with Laos in the 1960s, Tambiah (1970: 252) described how, at that time, Brahmanic practices were dynamically integrated into village ritual life. Rather than being antagonistic, the roles o f Buddhist monk and Brahm in priest co -existed, and could be fulfilled by the same man as part of their life -course. The ritual of calling souls, the su khuan, or baci, which is described in Chapter 7 , is traditionally performed by the pham, usually a respe cted village elder who would have been a monk at some point during his younger years.73 Knowledge of esoteric practices in Laos is usually associated with the pham ; indeed, as Pottier (2007: 168) describes, magical knowledge was said to have been taught to hermits and ascetics by Brahma himself. Often, animist and Brahmanic practices are classed together under the term sanyasat (magic), which is used to manipulate elements in the natural world according to human will, whether to cause healing or harm. As I will show later, those who utilise these powers in healing practices must also demonstrate their pious Buddhist faith, as a means of legitimising their use in the modern context. 72 I did not hear of the existence of present -day Lao leusi (Thai: reusi), but a number of statues reference them, such as in caves or on Phousi hill in Luang Prabang. In Thailand reusi are still celebrated in Thai healing traditions (Salguero 2017b). 73 It should be noted here that the term pham does not refer to Brah man in the sense of Indian castes - rather it refers to the Southeast Asian version of the Hindu Brahmin priest and associated Brahmanic rites. 197 Stone carvings at Wat Phu in Champasak. Top: the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Shiv a. Bottom: Buddha's foot and elephant The efficacy of Phitsanu Phitsanu and local cosmol ogies The previous section briefly sketched the complex spiritual backdrop against which the work of the healers of Champasak can be set. The various religious elements can be described as interlinked, syncretic or hybrid; but even this may fail to accoun t for such diversity (Fox 2018) . Indeed, as Davis (2015) argues, there is really no such thing as non-syncret ic Theravada Buddhism. \"Layered religion \" (Nelson & Wright 2017) may be more appropriate to describe how material representations of religious prac tices appear in layers within the landscape. Therefore, whilst they may be encompassed as \"practical religion\" (Hayashi, 2003) in localised medical pr actices, there is still differentiation. A s I will show later, the juxtaposition between sources of potenc y is important in understanding the way in which therapeutic power is controlled. The Lao healers , beyond their use of material medicines , utilise these layer s in healing practices, such as in the soul -calling ceremony described in Chapter 7 . The use of b irth data in diagnosing and treating illness, for example, draws on astrology, numerology, cosmology and the natural elements , with both Buddhist and Hindu systems in evidence (Conway 2014: 112) as well as Chinese influence ( G. Kourilsky pers . communicatio n, 2020 ). For the healers, this source of magico -religious potential is not an abstract or nebulous concept, but can be manipulated to create a desired effect. In Phamuk village all the villagers , when asked , described their religious orientation as thue satsana phut (to follow the teachings of the Buddh a). However, this in no way precluded other practices, which might necessitate the use of multiple practitioners. During discussions in the village, people described this simply. \"Lao people are Buddhist, but also pham, who believe in phi. So, there are a lot of mo in the village - as well as the mo ya (traditional healer s), there is a mo du (fortune teller/diviner), a mo thiam (spirit medium), and a mo tam nyae (traditional birth attendant) . Po Nueang also knows how to use du (divination).\" It is against this backdrop that I introduce the concept of phitsanu , the focus of this chapter and the source of the healers ' therapeutic power. The healers would often speak of the importance of phitsanu in their prac tice, with their own interpretations and perspectives o n its significance. Phitsanu has been mentioned in only a few English or French language texts on the medical traditions of Laos and Lanna (northern Thailand) (Pottier 2007; Brun & Schumacher 1986 ; 199 Baird 1995). The term does not appear to be found in texts from central Thailand, or in mainstream Thai medicine. From a linguistic perspective , phitsanu is a cognate of vitsanu (Kerr 1972), the Tai language term for the Hindu deity Vishnu who has a particul ar place within Buddhism (Holt 2004) . Vishnu is important within Northern Thai medical traditions . In their work on Northern Thai medicine Brun & Schumacher (1986) explain that Vishnu is considered to be the tradition's original teacher, whereas other prac titioners have proposed that phitsanu is actually the term for the deity Ganesh, through whom Vishnu can be accessed . Baird (1995), in southern Laos, gives an explanation more in keeping with animist principles, describing phitsanu as the name of the spiri t who controls the healers' use of medicines, although also admitting the word may have originated from Vishnu. This linguistic context also suggests a link to Indian medical traditions , as the deity Dhanvantari , who is important in Ayurveda, is often depi cted as Vishnu (Madhavan 2019). Pottier, from his research with Lao healers in the 1960s, gives a somewhat different explanation which draws more on Buddhist origins. He argues that, despite the linguistic similarity, the name phitsanu is not connected wit h the Hindu god . Instead, in the Lao oral tradition, it links to Kummanalaphet (in Pali, Jvaka Komrabhacca ), the Buddha's personal physician, important in Buddhist healing traditions across Asia (Pottier 2007 ; Salguero 2016 ). In a translation of text used during the initiation ceremony to become a healer, Pottier records how invoki ng phitsanu calls on Buddhist sources of power (the dhamma and kamma tthna) the doctor Kummanalaphet, Indic deities and refers directly to phitsanu as a 'master' of medicine. The power of phitsanu, as described here, is such as to cure even 'cold fevers', which, as d escribed in Chapter 4 , are the most difficult to treat, and those who have become mad. \"Today, Lords, Phitsanu , Masters and talismans, this one comes to you to become your pupil, your disciple. He has the sacred knowledge, the occult science which concerns the art of healing people; he asks that the power of Phitsanu, masters, precepts of Dhamma and kamma hna b e revealed to him. May he be a good man according to the precepts of the Dhamma.... Phitsanu, my masters Kummanalaphet and Phiphek, come all three to help me, bring me luck and make me invulnerable .....Phitsanu, master of remedies, is the most clever at treati ng people, he even heals cold fevers. There are no more diseases thanks to his powers and the power of Kummanalaphet, when he deigns to come down from the heavenly paradise. Even epileptics and people who have lost their minds, he is able to heal them with his powers.\" (Words transcribed and translated by Pottier 2007: 167 -70; trans lated from French by E Elliott ). 200 Phitsanu as activating substance According to these scholarly descriptions, phitsanu is a spiritual source of therapeutic power drawi ng upon Buddhist -Hindu potency. Po Nueang tells me that phitsanu originated from the Buddh a, but he thinks that it also has something to do with the Hindu religion. He shows me the section of a book of tamla which belonged to one of his teachers, P o Thao Jen Suai. It gives instructions and incantations for healers to invoke phisanu, which are discussed later . Vilaysack, however, ha s a different explanation. I asked him if the word phitsanu meant vitsanu (Vishnu) . but they're different. Vitsanu is the name of a person, a Hindu god in heaven who built the world, the rivers, the women and men, for the pham [Brahm in]. But phitsanu existed before vitsanu, it's older . When you go to India, you can see where the Buddha w as born and his history; there are statues we can see and touch . Phitsanu is just a word for medicines - it refers to phit, which makes the medicine work. If you want to be good at Lao medicine, you must be good at phitsanu. But this is knowledge that come s when you are a luk sit [initiated apprentice] - if I tell you about it , you may not be able to hear or understand it .\" In his explanation, Vilaysack gives a different linguistic interpretation of phitsanu, and denies any connection to Vishnu. Instead, he focuses on just the first syllable of the word: phit. This syllable alone means 'poison', or 'toxic', the same term use d in the word for snake venom. So, according to Vilaysack's explanation, phitsanu gives a medicine phit, or 'poison'. In other words, i t is a potent substance which can cause an effect in the human body. He e lucidates further, describing how phitsanu can be understood both as a healer's source of power as well as a n ingredient of their medicine: \"There are two types of phitsanu - found in plants, and in people. If you study phitsanu, the medicine will work better - 50% of the effect of the medicine comes from phitsanu . In fact, you could even do a test - go, take a plant, boil and drink it, but it won't cure you. But, if a person with phitsanu takes it whilst uttering mantras, then it will have the right effect on th e person who drinks the decoction .\" In this description, Vilaysack describes phitsanu as having a measurable effect on the treatment outcome . If a healer has or studies phitsanu, and follows certain actions, his medicine will be efficacious. Phaiboun, the pharmacist from CRH TM department explained it like this: \"It comes from the earth, I think it's from the Buddha - I don't know about Vishnu. It's the same as the dose - like, if I know my medicine contains 1 00g of khi min (turmeric ). I notice the difference in treating people - a disease that would usually take four days of treatment can be cured in only one if the medicine has phitsanu.\" 201 Drawing a direct parallel between th e medical efficacy defined in his pharmaceutical education, and ideas encountered whilst studying medical manuscripts with a local monk, Phaiboun did not see any contradiction between these old and new ideas. To him, and the healers, phitsanu was something quite material and measurable , which gives the medicine its potency. To borrow from the language of pharmac eutical evaluation, t he phit (poison) is thus the 'active ingredient' of the medicine . This explanation, which contrasts with the idea of phitsanu as a medicine -spirit, or the power of Vishnu, suggests the influence of modern medical ideas in explaining an arcane concept. Indeed, the link between poison and medicine can be traced back to t he ancient Greek term pharmakon , a precursor to the modern term pharmacology (Calabrese in press). It's noticeable also that the older spelling phisanu , such as that written in Po Nueang 's old book , does not contain the syllable phit, which suggests that this interpretation may be relatively new.74 This also denotes the flexibility of usage in the Lao language , in which one morpheme may have many meanings (Enfield 2003).75 Regardless of whether the explanatory framework of phitsanu is based on Brahm anic, Buddhist, animist or even pharmaceutical concepts , it is understoo d as exerting a noticeable effect on the outcome of a treatment. Far from being an abstract or esoteric notion, phitsanu is conceived by prac titioners as the tangible manifestation of the adherence to certain principles originating from local cosmologies. A volatile substance, it can be created, augmented, de pleted or destroyed through the healer's actions. Therefore, in defining phitsanu , I propose that it is the materialisation of spiritual potency, said to exist inside both medicinal plants and the body of the healer. As described in the following sections, this means that the healer is guided through the process of creating and administering medicine according to the rules of phitsanu. So what is the significance of phitsanu in thinking about efficacy i n traditional m edicine use? It is not the aim of this analysis to determine , from an objective viewpoint , whether phitsanu really does cause medicine to be \"50% more effective \" as Vilaysack proposes . Instead, I demonstrate here that the healers act accordi ng to a clear logic of action and effect , according to the framework of phitsanu . This is close to Young's definition of efficacy, as : 74 In Thai, the spelling is still phisanu 75 This type of semantic shift is also found, for example, in Lao religious t exts, in which a Pali word may have been replaced with a Lao word which is phonetically similar, perhaps shifting the meaning of the text (Kourilsky 2018:31). 202 \"The ability to purposively affect the real world in some observable way, to bring about the kinds of results that the ac tors anticipate will be brought about\" ( Young 1976 b:7). The re-interpretation of traditional ideas according to pharmacological principles is also significant in understanding how the healers view themselves, and are viewed by others . Since the explanatio n given by Vilaysack and Phaiboun contrasts with Pottier's data collected in the pre -revolutionary era, it can also be hypothesi sed that their post-revolutionary understanding has been influenced by Marxist materialism , compulsory study in the Lao educatio n system and for government staff .76 Embodying power The primary effect of utilising phitsanu is to create therapeutic power - and secondarily, to enhance the healer's reputation, an important factor in patient choice (see Chapter s 2 and 6). Although not classed as secret knowledge , phitsanu is not generally known to those outside the healing tradition s in Laos . To his patients, and others who observe his practice, the healer displays the virtues of power, eff ectiveness and morality - only the healer himse lf knows this is due to phitsanu. Vilaysack gives the impression of embodying power. This is n ot due to his physical appearance , as he is often dressed in old clothes, with dirt ingrained in his feet and fingernails . However, t he sureness and speed with w hich he moves around, directing coffee production, chopping roots , examining patients, attending local meetings, switching from therapist to farmer to village official is remarkable. When I follow him to the forest to collect plants - an activity conducte d in his old truck, on motorbike or by foot, I am frequently left behind as he surges forward, crossing rivers or plunging into plant thickets without hesitation, wearing an old pair of flip flops and bearing a machete. In convers ation, he speaks at speed also, yet in a calm and measured tone . I ask him how he does it. \"Well - you can see that I'm strong!\" he says, a moment after complaining of tiredness. \"You have to use the power, force inside you ( palang ). A healer must learn how to cultivate his energy and balance his elements (that) . The Lao healer will be better, more powerful than the foreign healer, because his elements are balanced. It's easier for him to summon mental power ( kasaechit ), and easier to study. The ele ments come from the place you wer e born, where you live, the weather.\" 76 The political aspects of traditional medicine and the influence of scientific develo pment in La os, including the viewpoints of the healers, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8. 203 I ask him what he does to cultivate his strength and maintain his own health, especially when he is so busy. \"Nothing special - I don't take any medicines, just eat ordinary food ( kin thammada ); everything should be natural ( thuk yang thammasat ).\" In his description, power originate s both from the healer's inherited constitution, connected to his place of birth , and his work in cultivating this power. The ability to heal, and to use medicines effectively, he tells me , come from phitsanu, but are embodied by the practitioner in the qua lity of khetyam, which suggests that he has acquired power due to his spiritual work.77 \"If the person can learn the phitsanu of the medicine, we call them khetyam - this is the language o f magic and mantra ( phasa vetmon ). In scientific language ( phasa vitanyasat) this is memory (songcham). They will have a good memory of the names of plants ; they remember and don't forget . If the person has phitsanu , they will know which medicine is effect ive, even if the medicine comes from Thailand or France, even if they close their eyes .\" The process of acquiring this ability also follows certain steps. As described in Chapter 3 , knowledge may be revealed in varying degrees. In order for a healer to be able to access knowledge classed as secret, and m anipulate therapeutic power, he must have taken part in a ceremony to honour his teacher (wai k hu) and become his apprentice (luk sit ). Initiation is important for several reasons. Firstly, it facilitates th e acquisition of a specific body of knowledge (healing mantra). Secondly, it helps to protect the practitioner against harm, or harmful actions towards others. Thirdly, it allows the teacher to test the moral character of the student, and the serious ness o f their intent. However, the fourth and most important reason is, as Pottier (2007) argues, the transmission of power , which the person receives the ability to use, even before having learnt the techniques.78 As Salguero (2017 b) observes in Northern Thailan d, taking part in a wai khu is felt to be crucial to the safety and effectiveness of practitioners. However, with low levels of transmission, initiation ceremonies are rare these days, and I was not able to observe this process. Instead, Vilaysack describ ed to me his own process of becoming initiated to several teachers. 77 Khetyam is an old and rarely used word, not known by Lao speakers in Vientiane I asked. According to Kerr (1972), it means redoubtable or efficacious. In t his context it can be understood to mean a quality attributed to a renowned practitioner, whose medicine is considered to be efficacious as they live a correct life. Vilaysack said the meaning was similar to saksit (sacred, effective, very powerful). 78 In the 1960s, Pottier attended several initiations, including his own. He states that initiation is one of two routes of acquiring power - the second is to receive it directly from spirits, who may choose to reveal knowledge according to their own will, witho ut being invoked by a third party (Pottier, 2007). 204 \"For a person to have phitsanu, he must be a good person . He should follow the precepts, and have a good monk -teacher (mi sin, mi kuba -ajan ti di). He will become a pu seuptod [the person who receives transmitted knowledge ]. It's not the same as studying in the temple school - you must have a teacher and become his apprentice . I've been a healer for 30 years now. My main teacher was a po thao nyai (esteemed grandfather) from Saravane - he was powerful and famous. When I went to study with him, first we did a ceremony to honour the teacher (wai k hu), with candles . I studied a lot - with nine teachers in total. Three were relatives, and I became apprentice to three . From three others I learnt a little. The teacher gives his student good vetmon and khetyam. Some people sell vetmon and the tamla - especially in other countries like Myanmar and Thailand, but this is not correct. If they do this, they won't have khetyam. \" He continues to explain to me that, although knowledge must not be sold, an aspiring heal er must pay their teacher to study. \"When you study to be a healer , if you want your medicine to have phitsanu, you must spend a lot of money, give your teacher 5 -10 buffalo, or up to 20 mi llion kip ($2,200). We used this kind of money [shows me a large c opper coin with French writing, dated 1915]. You should pay for each disease that you learn to treat - for example, you could pay a million kip to learn to treat fi nom [disease which makes pus-filled channels in the body]. I spent a lot of money to become khetyam - some teachers are very expensive to study with. It's not the same as buying tamla. If you haven't paid to study, then you are not a healer, you won't have phitsanu. My luk sit did this - a bun khun ajan [ceremony to show gratitude for the teacher ]. It would be the same if I were to teach you about vetmon and van. If you become my luk sit , then I can teach you happily - I can speak and explain straightforwardly.\" This demonstrates an apparent contradiction: althoug h the healer should not sell his knowledge, students must pay to study. Pottier (2007) suggests that this is because what the master transmits to the student is the \"spiritual capital \" of a lineage of masters79 - a power which will become part of him, which can be differentiated from the transaction of buying information. \"From the Buddhist point of view, the master is supposed not to sell knowledge to profit from it, but to train a disciple whose morality is above all sus picion, so that after his death the disciple continues his work by relieving the suffering of others \" (Pottier 2007:239, trans. E Elliott). As the director of the ITM tells me, in the past, learning was expensive - sometimes people would pay a buffalo fo r just one prescription.80 This accentuated the important social status 79 This is similar to accounts of wai kru ceremonies in no rthern Thailand (Salguero, 2017b) , although in Laos this ceremony is not used for massage practitioners. 80 Water buffalo in Laos are valuable commod ities, and are traditionally used in lieu of monetary gifts, such as in the dowry payment made to the woman's family. 205 of the healer, who might have been one o f the few in the village with education, having studied at the temple school, and the secrecy of his knowledge. Nueang emphasises the importance of paying to study, which also makes it difficult to transmit knowledge to children. As he has five sons, I ask if they have learnt with him. \"My eldest son has learnt some tamla (prescriptions) . It's important that somebody has the right character - for example, that they don't drink a lot of alcohol.\" Indirectly, he seems to express concern about the moral suitability of his son, a soldier on the Thai border , who in the past has been arrested for dealing methamphetamine s.81 The initiation process, and concurrent transference of power, as shown in Pottier's transcription in 3.1, draws on multiple spiritual sources: phitsanu, Brahma, the Buddha's physician, the dhamma, medicine spirits and so on. Within their practices, the healers also made a conceptual divide between the use of material medicines (ya), associated with Buddhism, and magical practices (sanyasat) associated with Brahm in and spirit s, linked with Khmer influence in southern Laos . Vilaysack explained this simply; \" sanyasat is from the pham; being a mo ya is from the Buddha.\" However, all the healers with whom I spoke de scribed themselves as following Buddhist doctrine (thae satsana phut) and as I show in the next chapter, utilised Buddhist symbols during the therapeutic encounter. Whilst the Lao healers draw on eclectic sources of power, these are mediated and legitimised by Buddhist practice. Indeed, Vilaysack described th is shared relig ious basis as the link between medicines across southeast Asia. Among Burmese healers, Coderey (2017:239) a rgues that although the spiritual sources that underlie their practices may be complex, they are dominated by the practitioner's Buddhist orientation , providing a \"common grammar of healing\". Likewise, in Cambodia , Davis (2016: 216 ) points out that Buddhis t methods are used to assert \"both moral and technical superiority\" over the world of spirits and Brahmanism . Textual sources often state that Theravada Buddhist monastics are prohibited from practising medicine .82 But as Fiordalis (2017 : 105 ) points out, the restriction s may have been primarily to differentiate them from other types of practitioner, such as Brahm ins. 81 According to Pottier (2007), there is an additional spiritual danger in transmitting knowledge to a son. Because a father has already gi ven his blood to his son, by making him his 'spiritual son' as well, the spirits he calls on may become confused and attack him, as they can only have one master. 82 In Mayahana Buddhism, a Medicine Buddha is often depict ed and medical practice is more obvi ously associated with religious practice (Kalra et al. 2018) 206 For the healers, emphas ising their Buddhist orientation ha d the additional effect of showing their political correctness , and establishing t heir reputation as being vitanyasat - scientific, knowledgeable .83 This association of Buddhism and science is likely due both to the historical association with temples as sites of education and literacy - and also the attempts to integrate Buddhism into the machinations of a Marxist state (D. Wharton per s. communication , 2020 ; Stuart -Fox 1998). Certainly, the healers s ought to define their work in line with, rather than in opposition to science (see Chapter 8 ), as shown in the interpretation of phitsanu as an 'active ingredient' . This d id not prevent them from incorporating magical practices into treatments , or providing them when asked - indeed, th is was important to the creation of efficacy. Howeve r, Buddhism provide d a framework in order to regulate the ir use of power, as I will outline. The power of words The morality of mantra During the initiation, as well as the ability to use power, the healer receives another set of transmitted knowledge: the use of mantra o r incantations , mon, also called khatha. As Pottier (2007) points out, these terms have different roots; whilst mon is from Sanskrit, khatha is from the Pali term gth. Therefore, mon is said to be primarily orally transmitted between the pham (Brahmin), whereas the khatha may be verses wri tten down in Buddhist texts. In Isan, Tambiah (1970: 197) described the use of mantra as the \"secret sacrificial formulae of Brahmanism, frequently referred to as 'spells'\", which he claims were historically more developed in Hinduism and Mayanana/ Tantric Buddhism in comparison to Theravada Buddhism . However, the principle of magical words is found throughout Asia , and is the most widespread form of Buddhist healing practices . Their particular form is reflective of local cosmologies and healing traditions. For example, Salguero (2017 a) describes medieval Chinese \"spell -texts\" (dhra) that contain Buddhist, Taoist, Indian and common Chinese understanding of health and illness. 83 The juxtaposition of vitanyasat with sanyasat is thus probably a modern one - the original Sanskrit terms suggests more of a continuum of knowledge types (se e Chapter 3) - indeed, sanyasat is also translated as 'occult science'. The assumption that there is an opposition between science and magic dichotomy has been a major source of contention for anthropology of the 20th century (see Tambiah, 1990). 207 Utilising powerful words in southern Laos may also be termed visa, which is used similarly to sanyasat, as a term for magic. Visa is derived from the Pali vijj, referring to power which stems from accumulated knowledge, rather than from spirits, as in some other magical forms . However, this is differentiated from more general knowledg e (khuam hu ), or wisdom (panya). \"Visa (knowledge) is a power which is absorbed and matured in the body of the user...its source is written words and symbols \" (Hayasahi 2003:217) . In practice, I found that the healers generally use the term vetmon (magic -mantra ) to refer to their use of powerful words, which they remember by heart or sometimes read from texts. As part of a holistic approach to dealing with illness , vetmon is utilise d during the treatment process. Studying vetmon is said to be necessary for the production of phitsanu. Just as there are herbal remedies to treat different illness manifestations, particular mantras are used according to the person's condition. Incantations can be said for various reasons - in the treatment of specific ailment s, during rituals for spiritual purposes, or in the preparation of medicine or harvesting of plants, as in the incantation for phitsanu below. Therefore, in creating a treatment for a patient (such as the fever remedies described in the previous chapter), hea lers include a 'word prescription' together with the herbal prescription. The words are usually spoken in the Theravada Buddhist language of Pali, and written in tham script , the written form of Pali u sed in palm leaf manuscripts (Finot 1917; Elkington et al. 2013) . However, they may also include Sanskrit, Khmer and Lao words, reflecting the multi -dimension al origins of healing power. These words are understood to have specific power and agency, which in order to be utilised must be repeated aloud (Fox 2018 ). The healer, through recitation, is able to a ccentuate his therapeutic power. I saw this in evidence one night whilst staying in the house of P o Nueang and his family. As I was sleeping under a mosquito net in the open central area of the upper floor, I was woken around 11pm to hear Nueang chanting mantras, sitting at his small altar. The room was in darkness but for one lit candle, which gently hissed as the wax dr ipped into the bowl of water underneath . He was kneeling with his head bowed, a length of cloth placed over his right shoulde r. He spoke quite audibly, even loudly - quite differently to when using mantras during treatments . I don't know how long he continued for , but I fell asleep again as he was still chanting. 208 The next day, he showed me th e book he was chanting from , which belo nged to his teacher, Po Thao Jen Suai. \"This is visa tham\", he says, \"I have to remember many types.\" As with his herbal prescriptions, he seems to regularly return to his books to read and read again . On one page, a khatha to be said for phitsanu is written. He reads some of the words aloud to me, musing on their meaning as he does so. Although i t includes ancient words such as the syllable Om, it is written in Lao script rather than Tham . At the bottom is the instru ction : say this brightly/clearl y (va ni heua le ). It is written as follows (Figure 18): Phisanu ya va Om sit om thong Om sit om thong Om sit om thong Khu leo leo khu bo dai pama t kh hu Om sit om chap Om sit om chap Om phisanu chap kok ya Om phisanu chap chap Om chap , Figure for Phisanu and transcri ption 209 The words repeated in this formula are not directly translatable. The repetition of the sacred syllable Om, originating from Sanskrit and used in both Hindu and Buddhist religious contexts, is said to have a powerful effect when repeated aloud ( Moebus & Wilke 2011 ; Monier -Williams 1899 ). In saying these words, the healer invokes spiritual power, asking for it to be transmitted (sit) and administered (thong). This is an incantation to be said whilst collecting plants, inviting phisanu to be channe lled and to grasp or enter the tree and the roots which are used as medicine (Om phisanu chap kok ya, Om phisanu chap hak ya ). Nueang says that this must be utter ed (chom) during plant collection in order for the medicine to have phitsanu : \"Before taking a plant for ya fon, utter a khatha, utter the mantras for planting .\" For Po Nueang , utilising the power of words both strengthened and necessitated his Buddhist authority. Certain moral qualities are needed to correctly harness the power of incantations; when a person can do this, they are said to possess vetmon, which differentiates them from ordinary people. Just as the healer should speak correctly to the plants , as Vilaysack explains, vetmon must also be used in a pol ite, or well -mannered way during the healing process. In Vilaysack's description, using words directed at certain bodily parts enables him to cause effects in the human body : \"An ordinary person (khon thammada ), and one who has vetmon are very different. It's very important that a person who has vetmon also has a good nature, good intentions (khuam di ), and can spread this good to others. He should be Buddhist, but he can treat people from any religi on - Buddhist, Christian, Muslim - whether they are a friend or an enemy. If a healer talks about another behind their back, or criticises their religion, then they are not a perfect healer. We must always be polite, never rude or unkind, make others fee l bad or speak harshly when we use vetmon. The vetmon we blow is good -natured and polite (suphap). If I blow on you, I will always speak politely, beginning with kho [please , I am asking for ]. For example, I might say \"fat, blood, fluid, please go the rig ht way\" ( tam thang khong than ).\" 210 Blowing words So far, I have described the healers' system of creating efficacy through phitsanu and utilising the healing power of mantra. In order for phitsanu to be broug ht into effect, connecting the bodies of the practitioner, patient, and plant, it must also be activated. This happens through the act of blowing (pao), in which the healer blows softly onto the body part, into drinking water, onto the medicine after prepa ration or the plant itself. Blowing is a common practice which may be used with or without incantations, usually by a mo pao (a specialist in blowing) or mo ya who uses it in his practice. The exact form it takes may vary. Nueang blows very simply, just p ursing his lips into a circular shape in order to catch the air, making a soft hissing sound as he expels his breath. Vilaysack uses a glass of water and a lit c andle. He takes the candle, and swallows the flame by closing his mouth over it, then immediate ly takes a gulp of water and sprays it out onto the person in an explosive manner, followed by gentle blowing. Some mo pao also use alcohol in this manner. After blowing, p eople may report an immediate sense of relief, or a cool sensation. Vilaysack explai ns that: \"If you are a good healer, the person is crying when they come, but after blowing they will stop crying immediately .\" Blowing removes heat, which is usually undesirable (see Chapter 4 ). It is considered especially effective for removing phit (poison) from the body, such as in the case of snakebite. In fact, it is commonly said that blowing is the only way to effectively t reat snakebite - when I meet P o Nueang 's nephew, Dee, he shows me the marks left in his hand from the fangs of a yellow poisonou s snake ( describing it by making a swaying motion like a cobra), saying he was saved by his uncle's blowing. As Tsumura (2016) o bserves of the blowing doctors in north -eastern Thailand, for conditions where phit needs to be removed, the healer will blow from the central part of the body outwards in a motion of expulsion. When a healer blows, he also mouths a mantra, usually inaudi bly, or says the words in his mind - it would be impossible for anyone listening to know which words he is using. The power and efficacy of these words is associated both with the authority of transmitted knowledge and the expertise of the person using them (Tambiah 1970). It is not necessary for the person receiving healing to understand what he is saying, unlike the words said du ring the soul -calling ceremony (Chapter 7 ), but t hey must know they are said by a person of 211 moral authority. A similar use of blowing is found in magical tattoo ing, in which the power of a specific Buddhist lineage is activated (Cook 2012: 43). The importa nce of blowing words thus lies in both the power and morality of the word themselves, and the sensorial effect and embodied power of the healer's breath. Each can be used separately but are much more effective when used together. Vilaysack tells me that blowing and mantras are responsible for half of the efficacy of ordinary treatment - for bonesetting , 70% . I ask him, when you blow, do you blow differently? \"Yes, you can pao toum (blow on spots), pao fi (blow on furuncles), pao phit (blow on poison), pao cheb buad (blow on aches and pains) - they are all different .\" Phaiboun shows me his notebook from his time studying with a monk in a temple close to Wat Phu, the Khmer temple of Champasak . It has a lis t of specific incantations to be blown when collectin g plants, cutting them, grinding ( fon), onto a bowl of medicines ( yu tuai ), and onto patients , with water, a candle, alcohol or just simple blowing (pao sue sue). Blowing thus activates the effect of the mantra . Or, as Nueang explains, \"blowing makes phitsanu\". Blowing making it \"sensuously real\" (Hermanns 2015: 103) in the felt sensation of blowing and being blown on, in which the healer's breath touches the person. Experiencing the sensation of coolness brings the person into a realm of shared sensory experience (Tsumura 2016). I ask one of Vilaysack's pa tients how he feels afterwards . He replies, \"It's cool, and I have strength and kamlang chai [good morale ].\" In the action of blowing, the words become materialised. Swa llowing water, alcohol or the candle flame gives an additional material element in which to convey the power of mantras, and the \"vital energy\" of the healer (Pottier 2007: 213). Buddhist texts describe how consecrating water in this manner through the us e of mantra \" call upon the transformative powers of the Buddhas, bodhisattvas , and other deities\" (Salguero 2017c: 26). This notion is found elsewhere: for example, certain Islamic sects pr actice \"drinking the Koran\" in which the holy text is washed and th e water is drunk by those wishing to gain insight (El -Tom 1985). 212 Top and bottom: Po Nueang blowing 213 Controlling natural forces, protecting the boundaries Regulating the self The healer receives the ability to use phitsanu during his initiation, and uses the power of words and blowin g to help his medicine work . However, this does not come with a guarantee of success. Phitsanu is described by the healers as a volatile substance which can be created, augmented, depleted or destroyed according to their actions , which have a direct impact on the presence and level of this substance. Neuang explains that: \"If you do something wrong , the phitsanu will not take hold /enter the medicine (phitsanu bo chap).\" It can be said that phitsanu creates responsibility, and moderates power; \"...whatever [the healer] thinks or does, he will receive according to his tastes and his hopes \" (Pottier 2007: 181). It is important, therefore, that the healer regulates his behaviour. As well as increasing the effectiveness of his treatments by enhancing phitsanu, this also protects the practitioner and others from harm. Possessing p ower can be of ambiguous morality. M anipulating visa (magical knowledge) for purposes other than healing without following certain taboos is frequently cited as a source of madness or po ssession by phi po p (malicious spirits who take over the body of a human) . Its wrong use may have perilous effects for others . Therefore, healers who use visa in combination with their medicines must demonstrate their own proper behaviour , in order to alla y any suggestion of immorality or questions about their status. I ask Vilaysack what happens if you study to be a healer and you don't observe these regulations . He answers: \"If you don't follow taboos ( kalam ), then you will regress (sueam), and lose your power and abilities. You should be careful - if you study too much too quickly then you may become mad (ba) or possessed (pop). There are many people in the village doing magic (sanyasat) who have become pob, especially if they are bad people who practise visa man [evil magic ]. We shouldn't ask who they are, it's dangerous - sometimes they pass this bad magic to others . Some of them become phi phong, who only have a head and internal organs - you see them sometimes in the ricefields at night, as a light at the top of a tree, where they feed on toads and frogs, chicks or even sick people.\" 214 Although he seems to enjoy sharing such alarming tales, and does so with a certain amount of humour, whenever I press him for more details he warns me firmly about enquirin g further. \"You should study medicine, not van, not mon. If you don't get rid of bad luck first (sia kha), your study will be wrong ( phit), and you are in danger of becoming phi pop.\" The association of sanyasat and becoming phi po p is very common. M ae Chanta, who treat s women in the village for gynaecological ailments, explains that : \"The phi po p like to enter people and consume them . It's people who study magic (sanyasat, visa ) and don't follow taboos (bo kalam ) who become pop.\" The regulating princi ples necessary to enhance phitsanu and guard against harm include four main aspects : behaviour taboos (kalam) , gender , not selling medicine , and c ollecting plants correctly . Vilaysack explains that a good healer cannot live an ordinary life. He must live virtu ously (mi sin), and be aware of what is forbidden (ham). These include, firstly, the observance of the five fundamental Buddhist precepts, which are to refrain from killing, stealing, wrong sexual conduct, l ying and alcohol.84 The most important of the se for practising medicine, he says, is to speak truthfully (vao khuam ching). If you lie, and then try to mend a broken bone it will not work. However, there are about 21 additional taboos. The healer must not urinate, defecate or spit in water, hunt anim als, have a mistress, rape, eat food out of the pot, or eat 'like a pig'. Prohibitions may vary according to the specific uses of power . For example, to be a mo thod, who takes things like nails out of the b ody, you should not hammer for 3 months, or eat a nimals who have had their head cut off. If you want to remove poison from the body by blowing (pao phit), then you cannot eat animals who died from unknown causes. Nueang emphasises taboos related to consumption. Firstly, h ealers should not drink alcohol (even though, he admits, some do) . He explains that : \"If you have been drinking, when patients come you can't examine or treat them. If you drink a lot of alcohol, you will lose your knowledge. \" 84 Terwiel (2012: 179) suggests a more nuanc ed English -language translation of the precepts which is less prescriptive: \"I undertake to observe...the rule of abstinence from taking life, from taking what is not given, from wrong sensuous pleasure, from false speech, from intoxicants which cause a ca reless frame of mind. \" 215 Secondly, they should not eat without paying attention, especially the meat of certain animals such as dogs and snakes. And thirdly, they should not eat food in the houses of people who have died recently. Pottier (2007: 221) similarly noted that between different healers, the taboos varied ( recording about 30 in total) . The taboos most mentioned were walking under women's clothes drying on the line, or eating - in the house of someone who had a non-Buddhist ritual performed, the meat of animals found dead, the food offered to spirits before they have taken a share , or leftover food and alcohol. Prohibited meats were dog, elephant, snake, crocodile , tiger, turtle, monitor lizard , bear, goat and monkey . The most important rule, universally agreed upon by healers, is about charging money for treatment. A healer with a good reputation will never ask directly for money , relying o n donations presented respectfully (busa) , similarly to monks (Fiordalis 2017 ). Po Nueang often comments rather disparagingly about those he saw as taking advantage of sick peoples' vulnerability . \"If you ask for money, your medicine will not have phitsanu . Medicine sellers are not the same as healers , who cure peopl e. Some practitioners , like mo sanyasat [magical practitioners ] tell people that if they don't pay them, they won't be cured . If you believe them , then you'll go for that kind of treatment - if not, you'll go to the healer, who will focus on the disease .\" Gender is a more complex issue. The initiation of women is problematic because of the rules around 'pollution' related to menstrua tion and other bodily aspects (Pottier 2007 ; Douglas 1966). People have different opinions about whether women can practice medicine, especially using power ful words and blowing . Po Nueang is adamantly against this : \"Women can't have vetmon , it's not corr ect - if people saw a woman using mon, they would be shocked. Teachers , especially monks, will not transmit this knowledge to them . Women have many taboos - they cannot practi ce if they are menstruating, pregnant, or have had a baby recently - it's not cle an. Anyway, they have too much family work to do. Women can lie in order to sell medicine, but if they do, the medicine won't work.\" It's true that I did not come across any female mo who admitted to using vetmon . Mae Chanta says that she never studied i t - and anyway, as she treats gynaecological problems, you can't blow onto this area of the body ! In lowland Champasak , women fulfil other roles such as traditional birth attendants (mo tam ny ae), mediums (mo thiam , nang thiam ) and sometimes fortune -teller s (mo du). In these roles they are conduits for other forces (ancestral spirits, 216 fate, birthing), rather than possessing specific powers of their own .85 The exception may be Buddhist nuns, who mitigate the effect of their gender by observing precepts and by not marrying or bearing children. Some nuns have been known for their medicinal knowledge such as sauna plants (Tomecko 2009) , but this is rare now. However, Vilaysack has the opposite viewpoint , saying that not only can women practi ce mon - they are bett er at it. The most important thing is the personal qualities of the person . Women have a pleasing nature (khuam tong chai), and a good mental -emotional state (chitchai di), which are good for helping patients. And indeed, Nueang 's opinions do not necessar ily seem in conjunction with his actions; his acceptance of me as his pupil, for example . I only ever see him treat women, whether family, neighbours or patients, with a sen se of equality and respect, and he is particularly affectionate to his grand -daught er, 'Honey'. Another set of rules crucial to maintain phitsanu are the methods of plant collection according to astrological principles. The healer, when harvesting plants, should take only one part at a time, depending on the day of the week and time of day, particularly when preparing ya fon, which needs only a smal l amount of vegetal material (see previous chapter). Po Nueang says that: \"For ya fon, we must follow the tamla, pay attention , look at the sun, and take different parts of the plant at differ ent times of day. This means you may have to spend a lot of time to collect plants. The way someone with phitsanu collects medicine will be different from ordinary people. For example, if we pull out the root of the wild tomato , it will not be medicine, bu t if the healer takes it at the right time, it's medicine. \" Phaiboun the pharmacist explains it like this: \"The phitsanu enters different parts of the plant at different times of day , just like a person - if they eat breakfast in the morning, the food e nters the stomach and then moves down to the intestines at lunchtime .\" 85 The principle of women as a host or conduit for spirits is found in other ethnic groups such as the Akha, where women are shamans (Ongaro 2020). However, in non -Buddhist contexts, women are often medical practitioners and may be t he main knowledge -holders, such as among the Hmong (Dubost et al. 2019). 217 Page from Po Thao Souk's notebook detailing plant collection practices according to the days of the week to create Phi tsanu Figure 19: Page from Po Thao Souk's notebook detailing plant collection practices according to the days of the week to create Phitsanu 218 Nueang explains that roots have the most phit, especially if you take them at the right time. He shows me the instructions for collection in the notebook which belonged to another of his teachers, Po Thao Souk ( Figure 19 ), and reads them out to me. \"On Monday morning, the ya is in the tree (ton). In the late morning, the ya is in the leaves (bai). At lunchtime, the ya is in the roots (hak) . In the afternoon, it's in the bark (pueak). On Tuesday, it follows a different order.\" It must be difficult to do this, I comment . \"Yes, very difficult!\" he says, laughing , \"More difficult than Western medicine. You have to pay attention every time.\" Collected together, all of these r ules, although variable in form, follow a similar logic. Firstly, there is a real fear of the consequences. The danger of acquiring power without following regulating principles is a widely known concept in Buddhist southeast Asia. For example, among the S han in Thailand , the most powerful magical tattoos also require that their bearer follows food restrictions - if not, they may become mad. As Tannenbaum (1987) argues, the perceived consequence of misusing power is precisely what explains the use of Buddhi st symbols in otherwise magical practices. The process of regulat ing the self through moral action - and, by extension, spiritual forces, is close to Foucault's idea of \"care of the self\" (Davis 2016: 217; Foucault 1988), which may also be understood as th e ethical transformation of the self . The use of visa/ sanyasat calls on potentially amoral natural f orces; however, these are never fully controlled, only temporarily harnessed (Sparkes 2005 ; Terwiel 2012). Whilst power can be d rawn from nature, this al so makes the practitioner vulnerable to intrusion across the boundaries of the self (Cook 2012), such as invasion by malicious spirits (becoming phi po p). Sparkes (2005: 114) points out th is delicate balance - whilst the healer must observ e taboos, to util ise magic he must evoke the same natural potency which should be avoided. He must therefore avoid contact with certain polluting natural substances, such as menstrual blood (by not walking under women's clothing) or e ating certain wild animals, and avoid upsetting the spirits, by taking sustenance that has been given to them. In the example given by Vilaysack, the practitioner who wants to remove nails from the body must avoid using a hammer - in a case of 'sympathetic magic' in which an object is considere d to exert a matching effect (Frazer 1922 ; Smith 1925 ), this would put him at risk from harm. By regulating the time of plant collection according to astrology, the practitioner also demonstrates his respect for natural forces. 219 Indeed, behaviour proscripti ons which are apparently Buddhist may, as Terwiel (2012 : 112 ) argues, actually stem from magico -animist concepts. For example, the restriction on women practising medicine may also be because menstrual blood is associated with dangerous magical power . To c ounteract this danger, men, in particular, must carefully control their boundaries by regulating desire, as in the Malay Muslim context (Tsing 1993).86 Following the risks associated with wrong practices, the second, related reason for observing taboos is to display morality . The framework provided by phitsanu ensures that the practitioner is shown to have khetyam - his medicine is considered to be efficacious because he lives a 'correct ' life - for example, by the observance of Buddhist precepts. As Cook (2012: 38,42) explains in the case of powerful amulets an d tattoos, these forms of moral observance are the same as those used by Buddhist renouncers. A shared morality stemming from religious principles provides the basis for protective power through the m ediation of relations with others. Indeed, the associati on of charisma and morality has long been present in Buddhist movements (Cohen 2017). In Champasak, the dangers of believing claim s of absolute powers from charismatic religious leaders have a relativ ely recent history in the Phu Mi Bun rebellion , even if there is little memory of this the present day (High 2006). This display also ensures his popularity. Pottier (2007:181) observes that the healers with the most clients were also those who had the rep utation of being devout Buddhists - not just because it enhanced their effectiveness , but because this ensured they would not misuse their powers. Pointing out the abuse of power by others also presents opportunit ies to discredit them and thus augment one' s own practice (Golomb 1985). \"If you don't behave correctly, new patients won't come\", Vilaysack tells me. As I wil l show in the following chapter, which explores the therapeutic encounter from the patient's perspective, this perception has a strong impac t on treatment choices. The rule around charging fees, for example, was well known, and taken as a sign that the healers did not exploit their patients for money. Asking for money is connected with oaths the practitioner takes during the initiation ceremon y, which include the promise to treat anyone who asks, without expectation of return (Pottier 2007: 181). T herefore , the threat of destroying phitsanu, and thus the effectiveness of the medicine, prevents the practitioner from asking for payment - although , as I explore in the next chapter, the logic of offering and exchange is more complex in practice. This habit also enhanced the healers' credibility 86 In the story of Ong Keo, Pholsena (2006:131 ) describes how contact with women's clothing was the only thing which made him vul nerable and co uld affect his power. 220 at a state level. Po Nueang describes how he was recently visited by an official from the Food and Drug de partment of the Ministry of Health. \"She kept asking, 'how do you treat people, do you sell medicine? ' When I said no, she was pleased and kept saying, 'yes, correct, correct'. \" The same was true for the collection of plants. Even if I never saw these r ules strictly observed, being somewhat complicated to put into practice, the principle of mindful harvest - taking only a small part of the plant at a time - mean s that the tree or herb suffer s minimal damage when harvested , making large -scale collection f or sale difficult. Fundamentally, the healers emphasise that phitsanu is associated with the right motivation, and the careful regulation of the self. As Vilaysack explains, most problems enco untered by those who tr y to cultivate healing powers stem from the desire for rapid progress. He frames his words of caution through the Buddhist notions of calming the mind and avoiding extremes. \"To live the life of a healer , you must not think too much, or have too many desires - if a person yak mi, yak dang, yak d i, yak lai [wants to have things, to be famous, to improve their situation - they want everything ], they will have problems in their body, or go mad . I often treat people for this problem . You should be patient (chai yen), control your mind, and not think about your status or your famil y. Practicing meditation (het samathi) is useful if you feel confused and want to rest your brain . You should be quiet and peaceful, relax your body, control your senses and find nothing, just be there . You should do this for at least five minutes per day. If you are learning how to use medicine, koi hian, koi pai (study softly, go softly ). You must try to increa se your confidence slowly, and keep good morale (kamlang chai ).\" 221 Sweet and dangerous plants One afternoon in February, a young man and his mother arrive to see Vilaysack , having travelled from Attapeu by motorbike, a long and dusty journey. The man, in his early twenties, appears withdrawn and listless. Vilaysack explains that his condition is due to his impr oper use of dangerous plants for magical purposes, without follo wing the correct taboos . As a result of this he has been attacked by harmful spirits and become phi pob, possessed. Vilaysack digs up a plant which looks like ginger from his garden, and slic es the tuber into small pieces, which has a fragrant smell when cut. He tells me it is called van hom , and places the pieces in a glass of water . He then repeats a mantra, somewhat more audibly than usual . Taking a sip of water from the glass, he blows it onto the man. Next, he takes a piece of wood shaped like a pen, and dips it into the water , using the tips to trace letters onto the man's skin. He writes all across his naked back, covering every part, then across his chest and forehead. This is khian bon gan, he says, protective writing - it stops the spirits from entering. He blows the mantra again. After this, he takes some more pieces of the tuber, blows on them and gives to the man to chew, telling him that if it tastes bitter he can eat it with sweet things. He takes the bank notes that the man's mother is holding, and climb s up to his ritual area , placing them on the altar and lighting a candle. He recites a mantra again - first in Pali, and then in Lao, whilst dripping the lit candle into a glass of water. He puts some slices of van hom into the candle water, which is also full of wax, and then pours it over the young man and his mother as they stand below , reciting the mantra again. In manipulating power, the practitioner draws on natural forces, b oth to assist him and to protect himself. These also manifest in a category of plants (introduced in Chapter 3 ) used for the purpose of generating power and pro tection. These potent plants are known as van, and unlik e most plants ingested as medicine are c onsidered to have an innate power of their own. They can be used both to generate a magical effect, or to protect the person against spiritual harm, and their use is subject to the same taboos. Their effect can therefore be ambiguous - beneficial or malevo lent, dep ending on the user. Vilaysack and Nueang were reluctant to tell me much about their use, placing this into the category of initiated knowledge. Conversely, van are also widely used by ordinary people , both for protective use and as medicine . 222 Nam e Transla tion of name Latin name Family Use Van fai Fire van Zingiber cassumunar Roxb.

Botanically, they can be described as some, but not all, monocotyledonous low -lying ledonous plants with rhizomes, bulbs or tubers, with a pungent odour when the rhizome is cut. The majority belong to Zingiberaceae , the ginger family, including Zingiber, Curcuma and Kaempferia genera. Vidal (1958) records a more extensive list, noting 22 plants with the prefix van. These include the genus Zingiber , Kaempferia, Curcuma, Anaphora, Neolourya, Orchidee, with the majority of uses lis ted as ornamental or as a drug. In Thailand , this plant group is also named van, and is described as having underground storage parts or stems, including species from the Araceae, Zingiberaceae, Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, and Orchidaceae families. Uses ar e recorded as love charms, protection against people, ghosts and sorcery, and rendering the body invulnerable to attack by weap ons (Picheansoonthon & Koonterm 2008 ). as Vidal notes, \"These u nderground parts are exploited by magicians or doctors to prepare mixtures which are said to be deadly, or on the contrary, used to heal and protect against disease, poison and injuries (Vidal, 1959: 554, trans. E Elliott).\" However, not all plants defined by the prefix van have magica l purposes. Others I heard mentioned were named functionally, to treat simple ailments - for example, van di chep hua (van good for headache), van di chep ta (eye pain), van di saduang dang (blocked nose), van di chep buad kho (joint pain), van ke buea (infection), van ke phit ma/ngu (dogbite/snakebite ). Van are used all over Laos - especially within the Hmong pharmacopoeia (Dubost et. al. 2019), characteristically boiled to make pungent decoctions. For example, van fai (Zingiber cassumunar Roxb.) is a pla nt commonly used for digestive issues, and van zhod (Eleutherine bulbosa (Mill.) Urb) is used for gynaecological issues. Women h arvest them from the garden or buy them . A woman in Phamuk village described how she bought van zhod from a Hmong woman in the l ocal market for pain after she gave birth . Mae Chantaa grows van zhod in her garden as well as the van she acquired from a Ta Oi87 woman , van di kabun (van good for the uterus , Curcuma amada Roxb. ) and van for leucorrhoea ) (see Chapte r 3). 87 Mon-Khmer ethnic group found in upland areas of Southern Laos . 224 Van di kam (van good for post -partum), plant and rhizome 225 Van fai ( Zingiber cassumunar ) Van di chep (van good for pain) 226 However, van are also said to be phit, toxic . Indeed, van fai (Zingiber cassumunar Roxb .) is used to treat the effects of ingesting other toxic van, also known as van ke van (van against van) (Vidal 1958: 609 ). The healers disapproved of casual use of van. At Nueang 's house one day, a man seeking treatment for his daughter also produced a bag of van from his pocket, saying it is for diabetes and kidney problems (van di baowan k hailang). A few neighbours gather to question him about it, and eventually he s old one bag for 15,000 kip ($1.60). Nueang made no comment at the time, but I ask him about it later. He comment s that: \"It's not correct to sell van - it can be phit, and cause allergic reactions or injury to the stomach and intestines\". His wife interjects, saying that she took some van for her diabetes, but it was phit and made her sick. Vilaysack cautions against using van carelessly: \"Using van is not the same as using herbal medicine (ya hak mai) - it's very dangerous, especially if you don't use it correctly . It's toxic, chemical , and very strong ( ya phit hai heng , ya san khemi). People like to use van, but they don't understand that it's dangerous if used in the wrong way, especially if they have toum (spots, inflammation) or pe (allerg ies). It makes people very tired and doesn't cure their diseases - if you have cancer it can even kill you . An o rdinary pe rson should not use van - he must be a healer , and he must understand how to use it .\" It's notable that Vilaysack uses the word phit to describe the strength of van in the same way that he described the phit in phitsanu, suggesting it is poten t, and must be used with care. This may perhaps also infer that van can assist phitsanu, as shown in the discus sion of van hom below. Other types of van are specifically used for magical and ritual purposes. Pottier (2007: 203) observes that the use of van for protecti on is characteristic of southern Laos, in comparison to the north where other types of \"natural talisman\" are used, usually those which resemble other objects. However, the acquisition of van from upland ethnic groups may also suggest that its magical potency (and danger) is associated with this 'otherness'. In Laos and Thailand, protective talismans take the form of amulets (such as Buddha figurines ) and 227 tattoos.8889 Amulets are worn openly, usually by men. In comparison, van is usually concealed on the body, although children may sometimes wear it as a locket around the neck. As Terwiel (2012:69 ) not es, a mulets and tattooing provide protection both due to the associ ation with powerful things , and the transference of power . To maximise effectiveness, they must be charged through incantations by somebody with power, usually a reputed monk. Similarly, van are much stronger if used together with vetmon . Vilaysack says: \"The vetmon of van is transmitted , usually in the family. This gives a reputation - like, if I knew your father had a particular van, and then I met you, I'd be afraid. Each van has its own mantra. I can only teach those who have been initiated about van, and they must have studied dhamma and mon with a monk, for their protection. Then, when I teach, I must te ll everything at once, I cannot just give a little. This is the visa of van. Many p eople use van for protection , but there are good and bad van - some feed on blood, weak and sick people . If bad van is used, the vinyan (soul) is afraid.\" Vilay sack explain s that both danger and power are inherent in the van itself, as well as the effect of using vetmon to activate it. The specific effect is, however, associated with the morality of the user. This is similar to other accounts of using plants for magical purposes. Evans -Pritchard, in particular, emphasised that among the Azande, the \"materi al element of the magic\" is crucial, and is also the part which is kept secret. \"Usually this consists of strange woods and rare roots. Indeed the Zande word for magic is ngwa , which generally means wood , and only in special contexts refers to magic (Evan s-Pritchard 1929: 626).\" In Malinowski's description of the plants used by the Tr obriand islanders for magical rites, natural substances were selected on the basis of metonymical association, though the symbolism of qualities such as colour or hardness in association with the desired outcome; these were then 'charged' through the utter ance of spells close to them (Malinowski 1935). In Cambodia, Davis (2016: 156) describes a category of plants , pradala, which have innate power - in order for this potency to be reali sed, they must be either gathered from the forest or stolen. 88 Tattooing is less common in Laos than Thailand, and it is now rare to see magical tattoos, although some healers still bear them. Tattoos were disapproved of in revol utionary Laos, and indeed visible tattoos are prohibited for any kind of government work, although their popularity is slowly increasing again (G. Kourilsky, pers. communication 2020). 89 Amulets from Thailand include those bearing images of Vishnu, and named Phra Phitsanu, said to protect the nin e orifices of the body (Lefevre -Pontalis, 1926, \"Amulettes siamoises\"; M. Lorillard, pers. communication, 2020). 228 As shown in the description of Vilaysack's treatment of the young man said to be phi pop , the healers may use van during the treatment process, especially when the cause of the disorder is said to be related to magic or spirits. In this context, it may be ingested, by chewing or boiling, or placed into water to be drunk or poured over the person, and thus its effect is multi -sensorial. It is used in combination with mantra and blowing, or other techniques, to assist their protective effects. Hayashi (2003: 110) similarly describes the use of van in Isan, as a source of curative power through their immersion in water - their \"natural properties\" are transferred to the 'charged' water, in co mbination with the recitation of Buddhist texts whilst a lit candle bu rns above the water. The type of van usually used for healing purposes is van hom (fragrant van). It is also widely used by people in Champasak. In Phamuk village, I collect van hom from M ae Chanta's garden , along with van di kabun and van zhod (discussed in Chapter 3 ). It grows close to the ground, with a small white and purple flower, sweet and pungent -smelling rhizome and leaves. Mae Chanta tells me that van hom is used to protect ag ainst phi po p. \"Phi pob enter people who are learning magic (sanyasat), but don't follow the taboos (kalam). To protect yourself, you can take the hua [bulb] and put it in your hair or clothes.\" Later, I take the plants I collected from her garden, with s ome others, and put them to dry in the sun outside the dormitory of the public health office where I am staying. The director stops by to see what I'm doing, and I remember that I wanted to ask hi m about health statistics. Although he appears confused by m y questions, he sees the van hom, and tells me how to use it to protect against sanyasat: \"You can take a piece of the van, make it into a locket and wear it around your neck, or keep a piece in your shirt pocket. Most men do this. Wearing it helps your dreams; it gives you a good feeling and boosts morale ( hai kamlang chai).\" 229 Mae Chanta and van hom collected from her garden 230 After the van hom leaves and flowers have been dried, pressed and taken to the herbarium, this sample is identified as Kaempferia galanga L. (Zi ngerberaceae) an aromatic plant in the ginger famil y.90 In Thailand, the plant named van hom is also identified as K. galanga and used for food, medicinal and spiritual uses, widely cultivated in home gardens (Picheansoonthon & Koonterm 2008) . The ritual us e of K. galanga has been noted elsewhere, such as in Pap ua New Guinea where it is said to be a mild hallucinogen (Schultes et al. 2001) , and Nuaulu in eastern Indonesia where it aids shamans entering into trance states (Ellen 2019) . In Laos, van hom has al so been recorded for wound healing (grind and apply on wound), and as an ingredient of bamboo soup . According to Lao botanists , several species of Zing iberaceae may also be called van hom in different p arts of Laos (V. Lamxay, pers . comm unication 2020 ).91 Regardless of bota nical determination, the distinguishing factor of van hom is its sweet smell . The fragrance (hom) is associated with the word hak hom ('sweet love' , adoration ). Using van hom helps maintain good relations with others, whether humans or t he spirit world . The sweetness of van hom is especially useful for young children who are considered vulnerable to invasion across the boundaries of the self, and thus need to be protected. The elder ly mo tam nyae (traditional birth attendant ) Mae Thao Pon g tells me how babies and young children can wear van hom to protect them against attack by spirits . I often see small lockets on cords around the neck of children in the village (see photo). Whilst women usually cultivate van in the garden, van hom is mor e commonly worn by men, perhaps because it is usually men who study sanyasat and visa and are thus more at risk .92 Po Nueang describes how nam hom, fragrant water is made, by slicing the rhizome and soaking it in water. This water is used for pouring in the temple or house ; in particular, it is used during the soul -calling ritual, described in Chapter 7 . Unlike the dangerous types of van, this sweet van appears to be entirely good, and there is no stigma about its use.93 90 Vidal (1958: 609) made the same determination for the plant named van hom in Laos. 91 Similarly, in Indonesia, different but closely -related l ocal species of the Kaempferia genus may be used for the same kinds of treatments - Kaempferia galanga appear s in most official lists but in pract ice other species are also used locally (Ellen & Puri 2016 ). 92 Terwiel (2012: 54) observes how, among children in Isan, most protective objects seems to be reserved for boys, worn on a cord around their neck, such as figurines of the Buddha, small scrolls with magical drawings, beads made from tamarind seeds - or sometimes a cord around the waist with small phallu s to make the spirits recoil. 93 As shown in Table 24, van hom was thus the only magical van I collected, as I was otherwise prohibited from learning about potentially dangerous van. 231 A young boy with van hom in a locket around his neck with his grandmother 232 Conclusion In this chapter, I have outlined the layered religious -spiritual landscape of Champasak province , and its historical relationship to medical practices. I have discussed what the healer does to maximise the effectiveness of his medicine, showing that there is a coh erent system of logic which governs how and why he acts in certain ways. Phitsanu is the framework which dictates these actio ns. Whether it is interpreted as a reflection of these local cosmologies, or according to modern pharmaceutical ideas , phitsanu is understood to be the form in which therapeutic power is manifested. Whilst natural forces can be harnessed, power and protection are interlinked . The implementation of certain techniques such as the use of magical words or plants carries with it a level of risk, which must be mitigated through methods of self -regulation. The principle of phitsanu also influences the healer's reputa tion as moral and efficacious, and how he interacts with those who come to him seeking care . However, the concept of phitsanu is known only to the healers. In the following chapter, I explore how effectiveness is understood from the patient's perspective , focusing on peoples' subjective experiences during encounters with the healers. 233 Chapter 6: The Therapeutic Encounter Therapeutic landscapes Why do people use traditional medicine? Thinking beyond the reasons I have outlined so far, it is an intuitive truth that when sick, you would prefer to feel comfortable, not afraid, have your concerns listened to and the belief that th is person or therapy is able to help you. This has an effect beyond just personal satisfaction - there is evidence from a wide range of studies to suggest that the practitioner -patient interaction influences the patient's future therapeutic c hoices , their likelihood to follow the instructions of the practitioner , and even directly impact s the healthcare outcome (Kelley et al. 2014; Shahin et al. 2019). Therefore, examining what happens during the interaction with healthcare providers is fundam entally import ant. It may explain preferences for certain treatment modalities and practitioners, and the sick person's perception of their effectiveness. In this chapter I explore the therapeutic encounter . I argue that, in this context , patient satisfaction is usually highe r when treatment is given by traditional healer s in comparison to rural hospitals, two of the most commonly used therapies in my fieldsites. However, the common characterisation of traditional medicine or complementary therapies as being typically mo re patient -centred does not fully explain this. Indeed, the unethical exploitation of people's worries and fears may be as widespread, if not more so, among 'alternative' practitioners as within institutional biomedical sett ings. Therefore, rather than foc using on the therapeutic modality, this chapter explores specific patient encounters with traditional healers working at home, and in state-run hospitals. It analy ses the experiences of rural people in Champasak seeking treatment in both places, and consid ers the factors behind the differences . In Chapter 2 , I introduced the 'medical landscape(s)' of rural healthcare, outlining modalities of care which cross and intert wine in various ways. I showed how rural people seek care, and that popular healthcare mod alities , including the traditional healers, are often associated with social proximity . In Chapter 5 , I showed how the healer's reputation and moral character assist in attracting patients . But within these landscapes - both the physical and human features - which characteristics are associated with greater success? In this chapter, I examine how much, and why, a particular setting, encounter or relationship can 234 be de scribed as therapeutic. Whilst the previous chapter described how the healers explained th erapeutic efficacy, this chapter examines why therapies are perceived as effective from the patient's perspective. What does it mean to be therapeutic? Therapeutic ( from the Greek therapeutikos ) is simply a descriptive adjective used for something which ha s a beneficial effect on treating disease, accentuating health, or contributing to well -being. A therapeutic (noun) is a term for a treatment, therapy, or drug aimed at curing a specific problem . Within medical anthropology and the humanities, the notion o f places, people or relationships being therapeutic, or having a therapeutic effect has taken root in various ways. Drawing on studies in medical geography, the conc ept of \"therapeutic landscapes \" was originally proposed by Gesler, defined as an environmen t \"where the physical and built environments, social conditions and human perceptions combine to produce an atmosphere which is conducive to healing\" (Gesler 1996: 96). Gesler (2003:7) identifies four different but inter -related environments that contribut e to the creation of a therapeutic landscape; the natural, built, symbolic and social , each affecting the person's sense of wellbeing and connection to place on a different level. Applied predominantly in Euro -American settings, a smaller number of studies have explored Asian landscapes, such as Huang & Xu (2018) in a study of a \"longevity village\" in China . Serbulea and Payyappallimana (2012) examine healing practices in hot springs in Japan, showing that this therapeutic landscape has an important role in maintaining health and wellbeing and in building social cohesion in local communities. More broadly, the notion of features of natural landscapes affecting human inhabitants is widespread in Southeast Asia (Allerton 2012). Originally used to describe natu ral landscapes such as pilgrimage sites, healing waters , or more recently 'green' and 'blue' spaces, the term \"therapeutic landscapes \" has also expanded to include institutional health settings. Hospital design has been shown to embody social relations and to reflect and create complex power hierarchies (Gesler et al . 2004), and to affect the outbreak of doctor -patient conflict (Zhou & Grady 2016). A nother area for research has been landscapes of care beyond the institutional, as in work on \"affective sanct uaries \" such as cancer support centres (Butterfield & Martin 2016). These are places where people can seek respite and allow personal reflection on their sickness experiences together with others experiencing similar challenges, described as \"havens of soc iabilit y\" in a \"place apart from home and hospital \" (Glover & Parry 2009: 98). They thus become a \"third space \" which, as Bell et al. (2018: 126) suggest, can provide opportunities for non -235 demanding social interaction and emotional refuge outside the bodil y surve illance which is habitual in medical institu tions. These therapeutic environments may include the presence of \"therapeutic networks \", which are informal support networks provided by those linked by familial, social or therapeutic relations (Smyth 20 05:489) . There has thus been a shift away from the notion that landscapes are intrinsically therapeutic - to an emphasis on the relational nature of people's experiences with and within these landscapes . They become therapeutic due to how people view, i nteract with and attribute meaning to them. Indeed, Conradson (2005: 338) proposed that therapeutic landscape theory should include \"a relational outcome, as something that emerges through a complex set of tr ansactions between a person and their broader so cio-environmental setting \", a phenomenological approach similar to Ingold's (2000) perspective on self -environment relations (Ch apter 3). The person's sensory engagement with the setting such as their relationship to specific scents (Gorman 2017) thus has an effect, as does their culturally mediated experience of the symbolic landscape, such as Native American relations to place (Wilson 2003; Richmond et al. 2005). Concurrently, as Conradson (2005: 340 ) suggests, rather than focusing purely on psychosocial forms of relation when exploring therapeutic encounters, the dynamics of interaction with the bio -physical environment should also be explored, pointing to the web of relationships involving both peop le and place. Interactions between people occur within and are mediated by the physical and symbolic landscape ; traditional healing, which tends to rely upon these relational dimensions in its encounters, is arguably an ideal territory within which to expl ore these patient -healer and person -environment interac tions (Bignante 2015: 698). In an analysis of therapeutic encounters during care -seeking by villagers in Champasak, I explore three interlinked perspectives of this landscape. Firstly, I examine the th erapeutic setting, which include s the physical features of the place in which healing encounters take place, including the presence of material object s which may hold symbolic value. It also includes relational features; between the person, others around them, and the place itself , including their sensory expe rience . I show that the setting of the healers' treatments has the effect of helping the sick pe rson to feel comfortable and reassured, in comparison to the more alienating environment of the hospital. When this includes a number of patients staying togeth er, it may include elements of what has been termed an 'affective sanctuary' or 'third 236 space', p roviding a place and period of time to share experiences and reflect on their struggles. Secondly, I explore the encounter between patient and practitioner. Whe n sick people visit the traditional healer, the interaction between them follows a number of def ined steps, each of which has a purpose . These include providing an offering, entering the therapeutic space and encountering certain symbols, giving a n illness narrativ e, and use of touch and empathetic listening. I show that the effect of this process is to build trust in the practitioner's expertise and to enhance previous connections. The encounter between the healer and patient is usually longer and more ela borate than encounters within rural hospitals, which do not include these trust -building element s. Thirdly, I examine the extent to which the sick person experiences a sense of agency, including their practical level of participation in the treatment itsel f. By coming to the healer of their own volition, voicing their opinions and negotiat ing a shared understanding of the illness episode , and participating on a bodily level in preparing medicine and collecting plants, they are more likely both to be satisfi ed with the treatment and to adhere to the prescriptions of the healer . This difference in encounters can also partially be explained by the level of agency experienced by practitioners working in varying institutional contexts. 237 Therapeutic encounters Nueang The home of Po Nueang is situated close to the centre of Phamuk village , directly opposite the temple where the gongs and chants of the monks mark the times of the day. A small piece of land lined by palm trees contains a neat fenced pl ot of vegetables and herbs , places for parking motorbikes and storing tools. In its centre is a simple but spacious wooden house on stilts, the upper area entered by steps at either end . In the space under the house , family members , neighbours or patients , who drop by intermittently , sit on the hard bamboo platform or recline in a hammock strung between the wooden beams . This lower area , which is cooler during the heat of the day, facilitates social activities and makes it easy to know one's neighbours. It is rare to pass a group sitt ing without stopping to engage in conversation, or to fail to respond to the calls of kin khao , come and eat. Po Nueang 's grandchildren move around freely, playing games in the road, riding bicycles and searching for fruit; many of the nearby houses contai n relatives and they are always welcomed. Gardens and public areas blend into each other, creating a dense internal network of dirt paths passing by chicken coops, washing hanging out to dry, and groves of banana trees. Frequent ly, villagers selling fish, snails, pumpkins, cucumbers or khao mao , the sweet yellow new season rice, will walk through these paths calling out to their neighbours to advertise their wares. It is usually in this area under the house that Po Nueang receiv es patients during the daytime, or as dusk is falling, after people have returned from th e ricefields , Villagers appear with their children perched on the back of a motorbike, or help elderly relatives climb onto the bamboo platform to sit by P o Nueang. One evening around sunset, a 6 -year old boy, who has fallen out of his house and hurt his elbow, is brought on a motorbike. Nueang applies sesame oil to the joint, gently manipulating it until it is straight to his satisfaction, then blows on it and carefull y binds it by applying splints. The family bring t he boy again the next morning, and Nueang puts some effort into explain ing the anatomy of the arm to the parents, knowledge perhaps gained from his time as a military physician. He takes off the bandage, bl ows on it again and rubs sesame oil on the elbow b efore re -binding, telling them they must come every morning and evening for 3 days. \"Everyone in the village has been blown on by him\" says the boy's father. 238 On the following day, Nueang receives five pati ents, halting in his labours on a new roof for the house to examine them. He does not appear disturbed by the need to switch between modes, carrying out all tasks with typical good humour . He sometimes tells me that he has few patients at present - \"they c ome more often for fevers in the rainy season \". However, simply spending time in the vicinity of his house reveals a constant trickle of local people seeking treatment, arriving in the early morning, at dusk, or in the quiet time after lunch as he tries to take a nap. He, perhaps, does not quan tify these encounters as true therapy, especially when people arrive for daily blowing treatments, or come for his first aid services due to household injuries. In the evening around dusk , two young women who both hav e ankle injuries arrive separately . One has a sprain from a motorbike accident, and the other was bitten by a small snake from the garden, leaving a puncture wound and swelling. One of their older sisters stays to talk for a while, and Nueang listens sympa thetically as she tells him that she wi ll return to Attapeu for the new year's celebrations, as she has few friends here in the village. \"If you found some boyfriends here then you would want to stay\", he teases her gently . For those who come after dark, o r for treatments involving the use of ritual items, the patient and their family members are invited into the upper part of the house . Here, the central open area is partially divided into rooms for sleepin g and food storage , as well as containing a small shrine . Next to it, Nueang 's collection of aging notebooks are carefully placed on cloths, and the small pieces of roots, bark and wood used for making ya fon are packed away into bags and plastic boxes. Although the ritual objects are neatly arranged, they are mixed up with ordinary household items - books, small packets of pills , clothes , an iron and a motorbike helmet . A television hangs at one end - in the evening, consultations may take place against the sounds of Thai boxing, popular with all generati ons. For more elaborate rituals such as the su khuan (Chapter 7 ) or the sia kho ,94 family members gather here to prepare the banana lea f offerings and knot strings. These visits increase in frequency at the time of Pi Mai, the Lao new year. On the evening of the first day, a young couple arrive at the house after dinner , climbing the stairs to enter the open room where we are watching TV. It seems at first to be a social call, but the subject of health is woven into the conversation from both sides . The you ng woman talks about her back pain (chep lang, chep iao), and Nueang discusses his recent foot injury , telling them how 94 Ritual to expel bad luck, invol ving the elaborate preparation of a katong, a box made from banana tree fibre and filled with ritual objects. 239 he went to have it examined in a clinic in Pakse [\"it cost 200,000kip !\" his wife interjects ]. Nueang offers general health advice; they discuss going to the hospital to measure blood sugar and cholesterol levels, which medicines are best and cheapest . Nueang brings out some bong ya , medicinal alcohol and we all drink a little - it's a tonic and good for aches and pains in the body (chep buad). Later, they present him with the ritual scarf they have brought, which he places over his shoulder and invites them to sit in front of his altar, gently touching each on the head as he offers a blessing for health and happiness in the year to come. He also gives suggestions for herbal prescriptions that people can prepare themselves . Whilst on a social visit to a neighbour's house, we meet a man with piu nang toum (skin lumps) on his face and head, and around his groin. The man asks Nueang for advice, who tells him it will get worse with hot weather, and that foods such as chicken or toad will exacerbate it. He prescribes the following formula : hak samsip ('30 heads root') , hua khi min (tuber of C. Longa ) and hua van fai (rhizome of Z. cassumunar ). The latter two plants are commonly cultivated in gardens , but hak samsip grows outside the village (yu nok ). The man is not sure where to find it, so Nueang describes it to him . He explains that these ingredients should be crushed together and added to pig fat (naman mu) , another easily acquired ingredient, and then applied to the skin. In another house in the village, Nueang calls on a grandmother in her seventie s, who has pain throughout her body (chep sen). He tells her the problem is that she doesn't have e nough oil in her joints, so they rub together, and explains about the dangers of brittle bones, showing me in her spine where the joints have degener ated. We massage her arms and legs together; Nueang shows me how to use my thumbs (deep and perpendicular), and works with his toes on the back of the thigh as well as manipulating the joints . The elderly woman has a very particular idea about how she want s to experience the massage; the precise location, strength and time spent on each area. This is a regular occurrence: Nueang visits elderly people nearby often - not only for the treatment of specific ailments but also simply to give them his care and attention, touching them gently as he listens to them talk. 240 Massaging a grandmother Massaging a grandmother Po Nueang examining and using bonesetting and blowing to treat the injury of a young boy who fell out of the window of his house A man from Phamuk village prepares ya fon for his wife in the area below Po Nueang's house 241 Vilaysack Vilaysack 's ho me compound contains a large concrete house , a vegetable and herb garden, a pigsty, and a number of wooden buildings on stilts for cooking, storage of food, rice and coffee, and his medicine hut. Leaving the compound and crossing over the dirt road leading to the village, there is small patch of land next to the Catholic church opposite his house. On it are two simple buildings, one new and concrete, the other older and wooden, each with just a low platform for sitting and sleeping. In the corners of the bu ildings are placed withered banana leaf cones , plates of flowers , small Buddha icons and piles of coloured strings . People who are chronically ill stay here whilst receiving ongoing treatment from Vilaysack, who visits them every morning and evening and fr equently in between . They come with their ext ended families, who stay or visit in rotating shifts ensuring that the person is never alone, bringing mattresses, mosquito nets, sticky rice pots, cooking utensils and snacks . The atmosphere is friendly and c onvivial . The patients, with time to spare as they sit waiting for the next blowing treatment or herbal medicine to drink, openly discuss their health problems . They sympathi se and compar e notes on treatments sought, discuss the trials of sickness, and the challenges it places upon their work and family; rarely is there any self - consciousness about speaking about problems in intimate detail . There is a sense of a suspension of time, of liminality; nobody knows how long they may be there, or when normal life will resume. Babies and children who have been brought to visit their parents provide some welcome comfort from the monotony of illness. Chickens and ducks peck periodically across the grassy area between the buildings; surrounding them are patches of forest where Vilaysack often goes to col lect medicinal plants, or sends the patients to find their own. Tuk -tuks selling fruit, plastic goods or sweets occasionally stop by on their way into the village . Duean , who is in her in her early 20s , has been stayin g for the past week in the concrete building. She has been suffering from intense pain in her intestines for more than six months and looks thin and pale . She lies on a mat in the corner, trying fruitlessly to get a mobile phone signal , and shows me photos of a baking course she too k in Thailand. Her mother and sister busy themselves cleaning the area, making a fire for cooking, and ensuring there is fresh water. Duean rubs herbal ointment (ya tha) into her abdomen, and her sister prepares ya fon for her to drink , grinding each root into a bowl of water. She shows me how it's necessary to strain it using a coffee bag - otherwise it will be dangerous for the kidneys. I 242 take a turn and am struck by what hard physical work it is . Her mother looks at the roots and identifies some of the ingredients in the prescription by sight . Later that day, more family members arrive to prepare food to eat after the healing ritual which Vilaysack will officiate that evening; fish lap, boiled chicken and sticky rice. Although Duean is unable to eat the food herself, the feeling of togetherness is very strong as they cook and talk together . Later, after conducting the ritual for Duean , the family sit together, eating the chicken and sti cky rice and drinking the alcohol . Vilaysack eats too, chatting and laughing with them. People talk about the price of coffee, and Duean 's plans to open an ice - cream shop. Duean will go back to her house now, taking two months' worth of medicine (ya tom, fon and ta ) with her. She's obviously still i n a lot of pain, but she seems calm and hopeful after the ritual. In the other building, a n older woman who has been diagnosed at the hospital with liver cancer lies under a mosquito net in the corner, surround ed by her nieces and nephews, sisters, brothe rs, mother and husband - about 12 people in total. A rice cooker, plastic bags of fruit and bottles of medicine are placed next to her. Her daughter sits on her bed, massaging her feet. Her teenaged nieces play on their phones and giggle, whilst her 3 -year old grandson is passed around and smiled at. Her brother says: \"It's very important for all the family to stay together when someone is sick ; this gives kamlang chai \". More in -depth consultations and ritual treatments such as Duean's take place in Vilays ack's medicine area, inside the compound but distinctly separate from the living areas . This is a large wooden hut on stilts, requiring a steep climb up a narrow ladder t o enter, which I imagine might be challenging for some visitors. At the top is an open platform which is covered by a woven mat; around the edge are piles of plant medicines on wooden shelves and spread across the floor . Barks, woods, roots, leaves, mostly in browns and greens with flashes of colour ; a vivid yellow head of turmeric, half sl iced open, or a red root. A door leads to an inner room with an altar contain ing Buddha statues of all shapes and mannerisms, one seated, fat and peaceful, another standi ng, slim and with a hand raised in reconciliation. Amongst the Buddhas are shiny offer ings bowls, banana leaf cones, vases of flowers, glasses of perfumed water, a wooden elephant and other religious objects, the altar lit with electric candles. On the flo or, on white fabric surrounding the altar are plates lined with striped cloths and clu sters of the thin yellow candles used to make offerings, fading white flowers, boiled eggs; placed next to them are bottles of Lao alcohol and gaudy 'candle trees', all 243 crowded together. The predominant colour inside the room is a soft yellow, and although a window lets in some sun, the light is muted and the atmosphere is calm, permeated by the smell of candle wax and the earthy scent of herbs. Vilaysack usually conduct s his consultation perched on a low stool next to the medicines, whilst the person and her family sit on the mat . At other times he will sit inside the shrine, cross -legged on a pillow, with his back to the altar, inviting the person to enter and sit before him when more complex divination is required. He is rarely physically elevated above the person, and he listens closely to their complaints, often remembering previous visits, despite not keeping any written records , whilst observing them carefully. To di agnose illness, he tells me, \"if you sit with people, listen, and look at the marks on their body, you'll know - even when they hide things\". At other times, I observe him staring intently at one of the objects present as they speak. A 78 -year old woman fr om a village on the road to Saravane arrives with her daughter. She gives Vilaysack an offering plate with candles, white flowers and a small amount of money (about 20,000 kip, $2.50), which he places at the altar, inviting the woman to come inside. Her pr oblem is lamsai ke (intestinal illness ), and her abdomen is a yellowish colour. She sa ys the pain is very bad, so she can't sleep. She went to the hospital in Pakse already, but the medicine didn't cure her. Twenty years ago, she says, she had a similar problem and came to consult Vilaysack, who still remembers h er. He asks which day of the week she was born, counting on his fingers and parts of his hand , and about her bowel movements and appetite ; then he gently palpates her abdomen. Inside the room, Vilaysack takes the plate with the flowers, candles and money and blows on them softly, mou thing a mantra as he does. Picking up the bottles of water that they've brought, he swallows the candle flame in his mouth and then blows directly into the bottle . He prescribes her ya fon (grinding medicine) and two types of ya tom (boiling medicine), to prepare at home , explaining that this will make 8 -9 pots , and should be boiled twice. He also gives some ya hom (steam medicine), made from aromatic pl ants from the garden. He recites a mantra over the medicines, and then blows on them. 244 Duean and her family preparing food in the patients' house Vilaysack's patients and their familes 245 Visiting relatives arrive by tuk tuk An elderly woman with liver cancer has her feet massaged by her daughter, while her nieces sit nearby 246 View through the open door into Vilaysack's shrine area, and ritual items left by visitors. 247 Hospital The Bajiang district hospital grounds contain a new public health office , behind which is the old wooden office on stilts , where I spend a couple of month s sleeping among dusty piles of paper . Two in-patient buildings , one concrete a nd one wooden, lie mostly empty . The main hospital is a run-down one -storey building, with an open area at the front for patients to wait. Like all rural health facilities, it has a petang court for whiling away time. Along the corridors, tattered posters outlining treatment goals adorn the walls, and a room for the on - call doctors is piled with mats for sleeping. Inside the hospital, there are rooms for pregnancy care, delivery, examination rooms, a laboratory, ultrasound room, pharmacy and vaccinations. N one of the rooms are very well-equipped or particularly clean, which seems mostly due to age and lack of care . The delivery room has the most implements, although the beds look hard and uncomfortable and are pushed close together, allowing for little priva cy. It's been raining hard , causing mud to drift inside, and the bedraggled appearance of many of the patients, the women wearing simple woven sin and old flip -flops covered in mud, is in contrast with the smart clothing and white coats of the staff. Patie nts and their families congregate on the hard benches, whilst doctors and nurses sit around staring at their phones, watching TV, chatting, counting money . One group of nurses sit to gether filling in yellow forms for blood tests. Most of the activity happe ns early in the morning; after 10am, the stream of patients, already very few, seems to have halted . By 10.30am activity is winding down , and by 11am the staff drift away to eat , cha t, occupy themselves with paperwork, or play petang . As in most public hea lth facilities, some staff members operate their own private clinic or pharmac y over lu nchtime or in the afternoon, leaving the hospital unstaffed for these hours . Vilaysack's daughter, Da, is a nurse there - she tells me that she works much harder at hom e, cooking, cleaning or farming , than she does in the hospital. At the front desk, a heavily pregnant woman who appears to be in the early stages of labou r sits on a wooden chair filling in forms. Another woman has come to have her blood checked; she think s that she has the malaria parasite, and it's making her tired. A man is suffering from dizziness, and a child comes with chep buay ba - pain in the mouth with a white coating. The child is treated with oral amoxycillin , which, the doctor say s, \"treats man y diseases \" - and some type of ointment. The doctor says the cause is either bacteria ( seua), or eating too much sweet food . 248 The beginning and end of life are particularly evident among the patients present; in the ward is a young woman who has recently given birth, her two-day old infant lying on a bed opposite in the care of her relatives. She has come because she is tired and cannot drink, so she isn't undertaking yu fai traditional post -partum practices . Her and the baby's wrists are wrapped in knotte d white strings, and she looks exhausted and ill, as does her baby . The room lacks any extra comforts, is dirty and smells of the toilets. Inside the main consultation room, a man in his seventie s lies on an old trolley, not covered by a sheet or curtain . Half-naked , he is wearing an adult nappy and is attached to an IV drip . His wife sits holding his hand - they both look confused and distressed. The doctor tells me he's suffering from abdominal pain and diarrhoea, and they want to send him to the regional hospital in Pakse because his condition hasn't improved, but are waiting for his relatives to come with some money. Eventually , about eight people a rrive, together with the ambulance, and they transfer him onto a newer and cleaner trolley whilst the hospi tal staff watch and give directions. 249 The delivery room of Bajiang hospital The waiting area of Bajiang hospital 250 The therapeutic setting The landscapes of care described above include various therapeutic settings, both informal and institutional environments in which short visits and longer stays occur . The set ting include s the physical features of the place in which healing encounters take place, including the presence of material object s which may hold symbolic value. It also inclu des relational features; between the person, others around them, and the place i tself, including their sensory experience . What effect does th is setting have on patient experience? Comforting spaces, therapeutic communities The healers' treatment area, although differing somewhat between Nueang and Vilaysack, shares common characteri stics. Whilst Nueang receives people in the familial spaces of his home, which itself is situated in the heart of the village, Vilaysack has dedi cated therapeutic space s, both for patient visits and longer stays . Within both, there is some crossover betwee n social and therapeutic space; however, more complex ritual treatments always take place in a specific area . These spaces are, to varying degree s, places which are comfortable for the person by containing the paraphernalia of everyday life, whilst also ma rking therapeutic purposes through the presence of objects which may hold symbolic value . Unlike the experience of the hospital, in which the pro fessionalised space of the doctor is clearly separated from the patient's space, the healer invite s the patient to enter and share his private space after certain conditions have been fulfilled to mark this transition. In Nueang 's house, consultations usually take place in the lower area, which allows access to the outside whilst protecting against the elements. In rural Laos, a common bodily pose is to sit on the floor, or a flat raised surface, with legs crossed or folded to one side. It is considered a comfortable way of positioning the body, as well as allowing space for as many people as needed to join, as it is always possible to shift one's own legs into a more compact position, as opposed to a finite number of seats. This is how people sit beneath their houses and talk or relax during the hot times of the day, or when eating at a low bamboo table, which will usually take preference even if chairs are available. When this everyday space becomes therapeutic, this positioning al so allows the person to sit at a similar level to the healer, and facilitate s physical touch. Although the area may contain varying item s, the presence of familiar household objects is reassuring , and it is usually clean and tidy . As a space within the bou nds of the home , it is subject to the same standard of cleanliness (sa at), a valued aspect of health (Lundberg 200 8). It has the feelin g of being protected or protective, 251 a quality often described as important for patient comfort (B ignante 2015) , due more to its familiar ity than being a confined space with clear boundaries. Within this area therefore is enough space for more people to j oin the sick person without being physically separated, such as family members who will undertake caring tasks (preparing medicine, ritual items, providing emotional support), and others who may be present during the encounter, creating a sense of inclusiv eness and safety. The pathways leading to and from the home provide a link to neighbours and extended family, who may also take on the role of patient from time to time. In this context, the therapeutic space does not have defined physical boundaries, allo wing the incursion of extra bodies into the encounter; even when the person enters a more defined therapeutic space such as Vilaysack's medicine area, there are no prohibitions against others being there. However, in contrast to the hospital setting the ot hers sharing the space are rarely strangers - their presence is accepted as long as they are socially linked to the patient or practitioner. In Laos, s ociality tends to be valued over privacy as a means of creating health (Lundberg 2006) . But in a less protected setting like the hospital , which contains few of the comforting elements of t he healers' spaces , others may pose a threat to wellbeing .95 At Vilaysack's house, as well as treating people who travel to visit him, he has an area especially for patient stays. This rotating community of patients , which I describe here as a therapeutic community, bears similarities to concepts of \"affective sanctuaries \" (Butterfield & Martin 2016 ) or \"third spaces \" (Bell et al. 2018 ). In this setting, the sick person has t ime and space to reflect on their illness experience away from both the duties of life at home, and institutionalised medical settings, in the company of those experiencing a similar state of liminality. Arriving from their homes, which may be a nearby vil lage or a longer drive from the upland areas, they encounter and create familiar surroundings through the transfer of objects and family members from their home . There is ample space for the family to be present with the sick person, and for them to underg o caring activities; although outside the home, everyday life activitie s can continue. The setting lends itself to human contact without any pressure to compete with others for medical attention or resources, and has the capacity for chosen social interact ion with others . Those present participate in creating a shared narrative of seeking health, comparing and substantiating each other's experiences, particularly for those who suffer from chronic illness. Situated within a small forest 95 As discussed in the previous chapter, risks posed by association with 'others' who are not previously connected by kin, social or ethnic closeness are also exp ressed through fears of magic and sorcery. 252 containing medicinal plants, this setting is descri bed by patients as natural (thammasat ), a quality which as in ' green ' and 'blue' therapeutic landscapes is understood to have healing properties, especially when combined with sociality (Harris 201 7; Conradson 2005). Senses a nd symbols When entering the therapeutic space, the person engages with her surroundings both through her senses and by unconsciously attaching meaning to objects which may act as therapeutic symbols. This is particularly apparent when patients move from c ommunal areas and are invited into the more private space of the practitioner, requiring a change from the everyday to the rituali sed, during which the practitioner will transform his state by taking on the symbols of healing. For Po Nueang , whe n more form al ritual treatment is required he invites the person to sit upstairs, where he lights the candles in his altar and places a white cloth over his left shoulder before beginning his work . This demonstrat es his transition into a different state wi thin the bo unds of the home. For Vilaysack, the transition is to move inside the shrine area, placing a coloured cloth over his shoulder and sitting on cross -legged on a cushion with his back to the altar . As has been extensively discussed in ethnographies of healing encounters, the sounds, colours, noises and smells of the area all influence the sick person 's experience It has been argued that this can directly affect the person's physiological state, and the use of sensory stimuli such as touch, smell, sight, sound and imagery act on the patient's cognitive and perceptual faculties (Desjarlais 199 2). Recent research into the effect of sensory stimu li on the nervous system, such as the biochemica l effects of smelling types of incense (Moussaieff et al . 2008) or listening to certain sound frequencies (Koike et al . 2012) in countering depression suggests a similar outcome. In Vilaysack's shrine area, after climb ing the steep steps and pass ing through the small doorway into the ritual space, the soft light, muted colours, earthy scents and sense of quiet seem to have a calming effect on the person's state of mind. Sounds from outside are predominantly those of chickens, pigs, children's voices, and the gentle putting of tractors. In contrast, the hospital has often jarring noise s and overly -bright or dim lighting. As one of Vilaysack's patients described of his contrasting sensory experience of a stay in the hospital: \"It was confusing, dirty and no isy, it smelled bad and I couldn't sleep . When I took the medicine I felt confuse d. Here it is more quiet and natural.\" 253 Plants are also engaged with on a sensory level through their us e as medicines. In the patient community, preparing and drinking ya fon is a common activity, producing a distinctive pungent scent as the plant part is slowly grated into the water . When consumed , it usually has a bitter taste which is associated with the quality of being medicinal ( Chapter 4 ). The medicines also have symbol ic value. The freshly gathered plant parts that are visible to (and smelt by) the patient and their colours symbolise different bodily parts . The deep red of padong d eng represents the blood and flesh , and the bright yellow of turmeric for the digestive sy stem , correspondences which are familiar to rural people (Chapter 3 ). Furthermore, material objects present within the area can also be understood as therapeutic symbols (Turner 1967; Dow 1986; Kleinman 1973). Predominantly, these are from the local relig ious-spiritual cosmolog ies outlined in Chapter 5 , and thus hold meaning for the patients, as well as conferring a sense of morality to the healer's work. Vilaysack's shrine area is the most elaborate portrayal of this, with an eclectic combination of icons . On the altar are placed several Buddha figures in varying styles (Lao, Thai and p ossibly Burmese), and statues of the 'fat monk' Gavampti, popular in the Mon/Tai pantheon.96 In front are Chinese -style Budai or laughing Buddha figurines.9798 Ther e may also be vases of flowers, offering bowls, and the remnants of rituals; banana -leaf cones (suay) , candles, and plates with dok phout, the 'Buddha flower' used in offerings.99 The objects s pread out on the floor around the altar are further ritual parap hernalia, such ngun), offerings plates with cloths and candles, and sometimes alcohol, boiled eggs or string from the su khuan (see the following chapter). 96 Gavampti (Pali: Kacc yana) is said to have been a disciple of the Buddha, who caused him to be ugly to avoid temptation and is thus portrayed with a big belly (Lagairde 2019). 97 The Chine se fat 'laughing Buddha' is popular in Mahayana traditions, said to be the incarnation o f Maitreya (future) Buddha. 98 Salguero (2017b) notes a similar religious complexity represented on the altars of TTM practitioners in Chiang Mai. 99 Dok phout, the 'Budd (Aponaceae), also known as Crepe Jasmine, is used in all floral rituals in Lao (Vilayleck & Strobe, 2011). 254 The altar in Vilaysack's ritual area 255 The items shown here are also similar to th ose noted in Po Nueang 's book (Chapter 5), which explains how to create Phitsanu , suggesting they have specific meanings within the therapeutic encounter. On the same page, after detailing the incantations, it lists the following objects (Figure 20): \"[For] this medicinal phisanu , prepare these items when you learn : 1. 5 khan [the 'five groups' of ceremonial offerings on a small tray] 2. 4 baht candles [larger candles about a foot in length] 3. 4 pairs of small candles 4. 4 pairs of 'twinned' candles [candles made as a pair] 5. 4 round suay [banana leaf container for candles, incense, & flowers] 6. 4 flat suay 7. White flowers 8. A slice of meat, an arm span of cloth, a bottle of alcohol, a whole egg 9. 24 Baht coi ns When you have prepared all the items , light the candles in the 'five groups,' raise them upon your head and say the incantations for phisanu ya.\" (Trans. D. Wharton, 2020). Figure 20: Section from Po Neuang's book detailing ritual objects required for Phisanu 256 Offering plates at Vilaysack's house. Top: Plate with 5 khan (slim candles i n pairs with douk khoun flowers). Bottom: Plate containing thicker candles, douk khoun, 2 round suay (banana -leaf cone), a length of cloth and a bottle of water or alcohol for blowing. Money is usually placed o n these plates in combination with the ritual items. 257 However, a lthough their use in a healing context is known by the healers to assist in creating phitsanu , there are no symbols which are specific to medical practices only . For example, there are no representations of Jvaka100, the Buddha's personal physician , as is common in urban Thai medicine (Salguero 201 7b). Instead, the ritual objects make up part of the landscape - or \"grammar\" of healing (Coderey 2017), which is rooted in local lifeworlds. The majority are encoun tered by people on a frequent basi s, during visits to the temple and interactions with the monks, or within the context of their homes. Visitors know how to place the flowers, money and ca ndles on the plate, and how to behave in front of representations of the Buddha. The presence of these things gives comfort; it is a symbolic languag e which does not need to be decoded. Even if people may not explicitly interpret their meaning as such, these objects reinforce the assertion that the place draws on the prote ctive and therapeutic power of the healer ( Chapter 5 ). Their use in a therapeutic context may also cause the items to become sacred (Ellen 2019). As Bignante (2015) observes, fami liar symbols in the healing encounter can also create reassurance by strength ening the person's sense of cultural belonging , in contrast to the more unfamiliar symbols encountered in the hospital. Furthermore, m any of the objects in the ritual area have be en given by those who visit the healer, have been handled or made by them. Th e withered remains of banana -leaf cones with jasmine flowers and marigolds, and katong boxes made from banana fibre have often been constructed within the space by their families. The presence of these objects creates a sense that many people have passed t hrough; they are a material represent ation of the therapeutic network of which the healer is the centre. Plates with flowers, coloured strings, candle - trees and banana -leaf cones have also been placed in corners of the patient's room, emphasising the prote ctive quality of the place. In mirroring the objects placed within the ritual area , this suggests that the healer's domain is extended . The knotted strings displayed by the patients in the nearby hospital show that the protection assured through such encou nters may extend to the more risk -filled hospital atmosphere, during sometimes complex in other contexts, withered remains of gifts may be a function of overt destruction representing disrespect of patients, as in the case of Nuaulu ritual paraphernalia in eastern Indonesia (R. Ellen, per s. communication 2 020). 258 Protective objects and ritual objects left behind in the patients' house 259 Grandmothers makes suay (banana leaf cones) at the temple 260 Trust in the encounter The therapeutic encounter is based primarily in the relationship between the practitioner and pati ent, but may include others such as family members. When visiting the healer, the therapeutic encounter typically follows a number of stages including the provision of offerings, a consultation, diagnosis, prescription of medicines and contact -based and ri tual treatments, and a post -therapeutic period, although the order and inclusion of these is flexible. In the hospital, the encounter is usually much shorter. Here, I focus on the patient's subjective expe rience of the encounter. This, I argue, is signifi cant in determining the level of trust between patient and practitioner, influenced by a number of interpersonal factors. Trust in the medical practitioner is instrumental in establishing rapport during the encounter, and can be defined as : \"...a set of ex pectations that the healthcare provider will do the best for the patient, and with good will, recognising the patient's vulnerability\" (Rasiah et al. 2020). This recognises the power differential between physician and patient, and allows for the existenc e of \"beneficial power\" in healthcare (Hall & Berenson 1998). To trust the healthcare practitioner is also to be willing to \" leave our bodies in the custody of health professionals \" (Grimen 2009: 18). Trust has been shown to influence patient management of illness, and even to have a direct therapeutic effect on the outcome (Chipidza et al. 2015). Facilitated by the spatial layout and atmosphere of the treatmen t area, trust is created by building relationships between the healer, the sick person and h er carers. Here, I identify three main aspects in the establishment of trust during the encounter. Firstly, the action of presenting an offering to the healer, and a state of reciprocity thus created between the practitioner and patient, which is also experien ced on other levels. Secondly, the process of active or empathetic listening by the healer and the ensuing dialogue between practitioner and patient, both for therapeutic purposes and to ensure good understanding of the treatment strategy. Thirdly, the use of touch, bodily contact and positioning during the encounter to put the patient at ease. 261 Offering and exchange In the timeline of the therapeutic encounter, the first stage is to present the healer with an offering - as previously described , this in cludes a small nominal donation in banknotes presented with a number of other items. The money is placed on a plate (either an ordinary china plate or the metal one typically used for temple offerings), together with a small bunch of dok khoun , which are u sually picked from a tree in the garden , and 5 - 10 slim yellow candles (sometimes in the format of 5 khan described earlier). If patients come without these items, the healer will provide them; it is the action of presenting them to him which is significa nt. The person holds the plate to their forehead whilst bowing their head before presenting it to the healer, who then places it on or nea r the altar. At other times, and especially when more complex ritual intervention is required, the person will arrive bearing 'candle -trees' (ton tiang) , folded cloths, bottles of water to be blown into, food items, small bottles of alcohol, Buddha figurin es and other ritual items, which will added to the already crowded space, becoming part of the healer's armoury of rit ual objects. The amount of money given is usually somewhere between 10 - 100,000 kip ($1 - 12), although rarely more than 20,000 ($2.20) for ordinary consultations. As explained in Chapter 5 , the healer cannot charge money due to the regulatory principle of Phitsanu, which, from the perspective of the patient, also demonstrates the healer's good moral character . But, although theoretically a donation, o fferings are given in proportion to the scale of the treatment - and according to the wealth of the pers on seeking care (Pottier 2007 ). As Morris (2000 ) points out in the case of Thai spirit mediums, e ven though the price of consultations ha s become standardi sed, character ising this as an offering can be understood as an attempt to escape the general econom y. Despite appearances, gift-giving in a Buddhist context does contain reciprocity (Tambiah , 1970 ). In the case of alms giving, w hilst it is theoretically without the expectation of return , an increase in merit is the desired outcome ( Fishel 2005 ). On the o ther hand, because a return is not explicitly requested, this provides the giver with appearance of spontaneity and generosity; thus, both gain from the exercise. This may also influence perceptions of the healers' effectiveness, as Coderey argues of heale rs in Myanmar : \"The healer's good karma combined with the increased karma of the donor contributes to heightening the efficacy of the healing. Thus, the social logic behind the exchange (the necessity to reciprocate), combined with the Buddhist logic ...is consonant with and contributes to ...the logic of therapeutic efficacy\" (Coderey 2015: 15). 262 Furthermore, the timing of providing an offering at the beginning of the encounter has the effect of marking the following time period as being therapeutic, and the ex istence of a transaction or pact between practitioner and patient. This is in comparison to the hospital encounter, where paymen t occurs afterwards, to a third party. In Western psychotherapy, for example, it is commonly said by therapists that the act of patients giving money, however small, makes the treatment more effective .102 Furthermore, as Coderey (2015) argues, the healer, having received an offering, may feel under social obligation to reciprocate . Likewise, it creates the idea in the patient's mind that the practitioner is now committed to assist them to the best of their ability, contributing to a sense of trust. In practice , this exchange does not always occur, particularly in the more casual and frequent visits to Nueang 's ho me by local people. I ndeed, as Coderey (2015 ) observes in Myanmar, healers frequently receive other types of support from the community to enable them to provide free services, such as gifts in the form of rice or other goods. Reciprocity may also occur outside the period of i llness. At the time of the new year, as described in the case of the young couple, people give offerings of cash and r itual items, receiving a blessing in return. Others who have been successfully treated may also return to offer a more substantial financi al gift. When I heard that Nueang had been ill and returned to visit, offering a small contribution to his expenses, p eople in the village commented favourably on my actions. Reciprocity and exchange are also present in a broader sense during the encounter . This is shown in the tendency for the encounter to contain both social and therapeutic aspects. During these exchanges, the healers share information about their own health issues or other problems, demonstrating that they are not invulnerable to the str uggles experienced by their patients. Although they expect others to listen to their advice, they will also accept or even seek it from others, particularly if this relates to biomedical therapies in which they maintain a keen interest. 102 This notion, based on cognitive dissonance theory, has never really been proven (Shipton & Spain 1981). However, recent studies suggest that more expensive treatment might actually have a more powerful effect (Espay et al. 2015). 263 Narrative, active listening and dialogue In Chapter 4 I described how, in diagnosing illness, the healer ask s questions in order to differentiate the particular syndrome. The verbal part of the consultation, and the language used to name symptoms is, as Pottier (2007) discu sses, a method of refining the healer's understanding of the illness aetiology. This includes a history, in which the healer listen s carefully to the person's illness narrative, often an extensive story of symptoms and treatments encountered over the cours e of years . The dialogue between patient and practitioner also has a therapeutic function beyond the diagnosis of disease. Much has been writte n on the significance of empathetic listening within medical consultations . Although difficult to define, this ca n include the ability to understand the patient's situation, perspective and feelings (and their attached meanings) , and to confirm and act on that understanding with the patient in a helpful way (Mercer & Reynolds 2002) . Alternatively it has been defined as \"physician kindness \" which stems from a sincere desire for connection with the patient (Buetow 2013). Providing reassurance and support to enhance patients' expectations has been widely shown to influence health outcomes (Di Blasi et al . 2001) . It has e ven been demonstrated in clinical settings than an expression of empathy during the encounter significantly affects subsequent duration and severity of illness , and is associated with immune system changes (Rakel et al. 2009, 2011). As Golomb (1985: 136) describes in the case of rural Thai healers, \"psych ological encouragement\" is considered to be the most important element for patients to heal, and \"therapeutic conversation in which the patients are permitted to voice their frustrations\" is the recipe for diseases associated with stress. The healers are good listeners. During encounters with patients, Po Nueang often takes the role of active listener , visiting the elderly simply to listen to their complaints, or providing counsel to those who bring their p roblems. He demonstrates his empathy by sympathisi ng with the person's issues whilst providing pragmatic solutions, advice, or humorous suggestions designed to lift the spirits of the person who is confiding in him. Vilaysack tends to listen with an air of intense concentration, relaying the person's prev iously shared history back to them : reassur ance that he has been listening, both now and in the past. At the same time, they also discuss the successful cures of others, inspiring confidence in the person t hat she will be cured. Dialogue is also important. As the person shares their illness history, the y then enter into a process of negotiation over the d efinition and cause of the illness with the healer. When 264 more than one person is present this may take t he form of finding consensus. The healer does his best to convey his explanation and treatment strategy in a language that the person will understand, a llowing room for their own requests and suggestions, and acting on the information he has gained through a careful process of observation and listening. He shares with the patient the parts of his own knowledge that he feels he can, keeping aside more specialised or secret concepts which may be judged dangerous to reveal (Sieler 2014) (Chapter 5 ). Mol (2002) proposes that the process of diagnosis is always, to some extent, formed as part of a shared vision between practitioner and patient: it has a performa tive element. Strategies of traditional healing are more obviously suited to flexibility and negotiation , as diagnosis may come retrospectively to treatment (Chapter 4). However, I rarely observed a hospital consultation in which the person was given the space to provide a full narrative, or the doctor attempt ed to explain the diagnosis and treatment in unde rstandable language to the patient.103 During the encounter, the dialogue moves easily between discussion of health and general conversation; a process of verifying the social connection usually precedes any healing episode. Nueang 's consultations are parti cularly interwoven into social visits and everyday encounters, whereas the usually more formal methods of Vilaysack still include these aspects. Both demonstrate extensive knowledge and memory of the health of their patients, and use social connection to e stablish trust. Indeed, in observing e ncounters within these spaces, it may be difficult to know w hether the visit is for therapeutic or social purposes, as the conversation flows between both - such as the visitors received by Nueang at Lao New Year. The offering of medical complaints may occur upfront, or almost as an afterthought. In these interactions, the line between social and medical engagement is blurred; the purpose of the visit is unclear as it encompasses both without a pronounced focus. The the rapeutic aspects of Nueang 's role include pastoral care, as shown by his visits to elderly people in the village, and in offering advice to younger people like the sister of the snakebite victim. In his role as an esteemed po thao (grandfather), he us es kind-hearted humour to raise the spirits of those who seek his counsel. 103 This may also be a literal issue of language. In Champasak, as Lao is the most wide ly-used language, translation is not usually a big issue . However, in other parts of Laos it is com mon that medical staff may not speak local languages and women especiall y are not able or not confident in speaking Lao (see Elliott et al., in press). In contrast, traditional healers are likely to speak the language of their patients if they come from the same area. 265 Just as the initial offering phase is important to establish trust in the practitioner, the period of time following the encounter is also of significance . It is rare that the patient w ill immediately leave, placing further demands upon the practitioner. During this time after the encounter , the healer mov es beyond his focus on the particular ai lment . He will strengthen his relationship with the person and provide further advice as neces sary, taking on the role of counsellor or guide. Often, the conversation may meander to include wider issues; the shared problems experienced in the realm of heal th, economics or the spirit world, or simply what is on the television, including all those wh o are present, helping the person to feel that the healer is inhabiting the same lifeworld as them. Despite the focused concentration of Vilaysack's encounters wi th his patients, this is not incompatible with social interaction, such as after Duean 's ritua l treatment. The person will leave with a sense that their concerns have been listened to , and that they have forged or strengthened their social ties with the he aler. In comparison, during hospital consultations, there at times seems to be a mutual susp icion between practitioner and patient, which is born e out by the complaints made by each against the other. Conversations between medical staff reveal a poor view of the intelligence of patients . At my dormitory one day in Munlapamok district, I listen to a visiting health worker discussing women's birthing with the local staff. She critically describes the actions of women who give birth outside the hospital : \"She kept saying, I'll go tomorrow, I'll go tomorrow, and then there she was in a vehicle and th e baby was nearly coming out \". Concurrently, there is often a conception among patients that staff in Lao facilities are negligent, and do not pay attention to their complaints. In a discussion among market sellers in the centre of Phamuk village one aft ernoon, a woman complains that: \"...the medication in Lao hospitals doesn't change your condition, and sometimes when I tak e it, my legs and hands swell up. In other places , they care more about the patients - they try to cure the disease, not just manage i t, so they ask people to come back and take medicines. But in Laos, doctors are careless.\" Touch and physical contact Physical contact is an integral part of the encounter , and much has been written on the therapeutic significance of touch. As Leder & Kr ucoff suggest, in contrast to the \"objectifying touch \" of the physical examination, the healer's touch contains a combination of attention, compassion, and skill and \"can serve to re -establish human connection and facilitate healing 266 changes at the prelingu istic level\" (Leder & Krucoff 2008: 322). Different uses of touch also reflect cultural values, power structures and the type of therapeutic context, as well as personal emotional responses ( Van Dongen 2001). The p ractitioner 's use of touch can show accept ance of the person as worthy and valued rather than stigmat ised (Kohn 2008). The healers incorporate touch into different aspects of the encounter, to demonstrate empathy and provide comfor t. Touch may be, as in many therapies incorporating manual aspects, both diagnostic and therapeutic, emphasising how bodily ailments are also understood through the healer's body (Hinojosa 2004). Nueang will hold an elderly person's hand as he listens to them talk, or ge ntly stroke a child's back as he blows on an injured joint, calming them. When performing massage, he uses touch both to feel the body and to treat, using his hands, thumbs, elbows and feet to apply pressure . Vilaysack will gently palpate the person's abdo men, or feel their lymph glands, gauging the extent of a pathology whilst simultaneously instilling confidence in his diagnostic skills. The healers also 'touch' the person through the act of blowing onto the affected area . People common ly report that this creates a cooling sensation, causing them to feel i mmediate relief. When touch is employed as therapy, there is an expectation that the person will feel a change in their condition ; a \"felt phenomenology of therapeutic touch\" (Paterson 200 7). Bodily positioning also affects the relationship between patien t and practitioner. As Hsu (2005: 164) argues, when the healer sits beside the patient, this creates a \"certain closeness\" between them . In comparison , the distance created by the doctor's tabl e has the effect of both demonstrating his authority, but also the linear progression from diagnosis to treatment. In the therapeutic setting of the healer , the practitioner is in close proximity to the patient, sitting at a similar level, either facing th em or to one side, without any physical barriers between. This emphasises that all parts of the encounter are therapeutic. Furthermore, this spatial positioning makes it comfortable for family members to be part of the encounter and to relay their own thou ghts and concerns to the healer. In contrast, at the hospital t he person is physically separated from the practitioner , emphasi sing the power differential. Whilst patients are dressed in simple rural clothing, the nurses and doctors wear smart Lao skirts, polished shoes, white coats and are generally well -groomed. 267 Po Nueang treats a elderly woman in Phamuk village with massage and stretching People gather and chat upstairs in Po Nueang's house after the therapeutic encounter 268 Therapeutic agency Agency Agency can be defined as the \"socioculturally mediated capacity to act\" ( Ahearn 2001 :112). In healthcare , agency may refer to the level of involvement and control th at patients experience with r egards to their treatment , and the actions undertaken by the person in order to improve their own health . This is affected by the type of healthcare on offer, the person's familiarity with it, the level to which the practitioner involves them in treatment choices and shares information, their capacity to make choices (affected by income level, education, social connections, access to different modalities), and their own preferences. A greater sense of agency is said to lead to a better healing outcome, as t he person is in an active state and will feel empowered to help themselves rather than being a passive recipient of what may be done to them ( Fischer & Ereaut 2012). During the therapeutic encounter, agency is ena cted in various ways. Firstly, there is th e decision to use certain types(s) of treatment. As shown in Chapter 2 , healthcare seeking trajectories can often be complex and involve multiple methods, which, as discussed in Chapter 4 , do not necessarily relate to ideas of causality. This is significan t in understanding the reasons for seeking care. In the experiences of Thai /Lao villagers, as Golomb (1985: 152) points out, patient agency has typically been underestimated in the assumption that illness explanati ons involving karma, astrology or divinati on represent a fatalistic view of illness. Quite the reverse, he argues, is true - such attributions are more likely to be a retrospective explanation in response to misfortune . If misfortune is predicted, the y are also likely to react by taking practical steps to ward it off ( Chapter 5 and 7 ). Furthermore, the possibility of utili sing multiple methods with differing approaches to manage illness is a pragmatic way of increasing the possibility of a cure . People comm only seek explanations until they discover what feels to be an acceptable interpretation of their suffering (Golomb 1985). Discussions of agency also go beyond the matter of treatment choice. Indeed, 'choice' may not be an accurate representation of the constraints of seeking care ( as discussed i n Chapter 2). Keeping this in mind, recourse to traditional healers may be less a preference than a response to scarcity, viewed within the context of limited rural healthcare options. With often limited agency and capacity to act in cases of illness, due to socio -economic factors which leave them at a disadvantage, rural people make do with what they can. However, 269 the assumption that traditional medicine is utilised only because of a lack of accessible biomedical options is a rather simplistic perspective, albeit it one commonly found within narrative s of public health. As shown in Chapter 2 , Phamuk village was relatively well - positioned in terms of various healthcare modalities, so we cannot necessarily say that visiting Po Nueang was more convenient than other options. Vilaysack 's house , far from being a more accessible option, was difficult to reach in the rainy season, and people would frequently travel from other provinces to visit him. Furthermore, patient agency can be explored on a more nuanced leve l. Agency is enacted within certain constraints. As Mol (2008: 8) proposes , whilst the \"logic of choice\" may be erroneous, and assumes personal autonom y, this does not mean that people are simply passive recipients of medical authority. I nstead, patient a gency may be implemented by what people do in their own treatments, and through their relations with those who care for them. This is demonstrated during the therapeutic encounter, in which , through dialogue , the patient and healer create a negotiated sha red understanding of the illness event, so that the receiver feels a sense of control over the ensuing treatment . Here, as Fischer & Ereaut suggest, in addressing complex medical issues the consultation involves a \"...joint explorati on and 'co -evolution' of a course of actio n - how together the patient and doctor might work out what best to do\" (Fischer & Ereaut 2012: 12 ). In the healers' consultations there are often lengthy discussion s of histories and treatment possibilities with patients and their family. Indeed, I observed how t he person arrives with a specific concept of what therapy they should receive (such as blowing or string -tying), or asks for their treatment to be adapted to their needs ( such as when receiving massage). The healer will respond to their request, and also propose his own remedies according to his interpretation of the problem. As discussed in Chapter 5 , the healers tend to incorporate multiple methods into their practice and will usually offer what is asked, even if they do not fully believe it to be necessary. For example, Po Nueang told me that he did not really think that kam (karma) was a significan t reason for illness, considering organic causes more important, but he would undertake the necessary steps to dispel poor karma if the patient felt it was necessary. People also demonstrate agency in their practical engagement with the task of preparing their own medicine P atients can spend substantial amounts of time and physical effort undertaking actions such as grinding ya fon, and even in the process of collecting their own 270 plant medicines. Healers sometimes provide a prescription, leaving the process of collecting the ingredients to the patient. I experience this when I ask Vilaysack for t reatment for a skin rash. Instead of pre scribing medicine, he writes a list of four plants in Lao, and t ells me they can all be found nearby. Seeing that I am as usu al, confused, he summons several children from his extended family to help me find them, leading to an enjoyable but ultimately unfruitful hour spent searching the riverbanks and back gardens of the village. The implementation of patient agency is not limited to traditional medicine. In the house of healthworker and official Dr. Sipha in Phamuk village , people often appear seeking treatment , seeming to prefer this familial setting. She doles out pills for stomach problems or colds, or antibiotics, one or two at a time, from a small medical box. Injections (sak ya) are particularly popular, and seem to be conceptualised as a general panacea wit h almost magical curative properties. People frequently express their conception that medicine which is injected into the blood is more powerful than medicine taken orally. It is common also to enter a house and see a person hooked up to an IV, for the described purpose of bamlung (tonification) through infusion of 'vitamins'. Patient agency is also evident in the more formal hospital setting. Looking through the register of medicines prescribe d, I observe that most people receive several prescriptions at once. The doctors tell me that patients have an expectation of receiving multiple medications, and complain if given only one . Perhaps based on experience w ith traditional medicine, a more extensive combination of therapies is considered preferable. However , the patients who arrive for treatment appear confused , and unsure about expressing their needs, which is in sharp contrast to the active engagement with which they consult the healers. During consultations in Bajiang hospital, I observ e little effort mad e by the staff to inform the patients or involv e them in the treatment process . Later, at home, people would often show their medication to me, with labels in Thai, French or English, and ask me what it was, what is was used for, and how to take it. 271 Duean's sister prepares ya fon Vilaysack's patients collect medicinal plants for their own use 272 Modes What accounts for this difference? As described above, there are important facets of the encounter with traditional healers which allow the patient to feel a sense of security and control. However, the broader assumption that alternative healthcare modaliti es empowe r those seeking care whilst biomedicine alienates them is a stereotypical characteris ation, not accounting for the non -homogenous nature of these encounters, which has been deconstructed within medical an thropology (Sieler 2014). The way in whic h one operates in and interacts with the world, as Merleau -Ponty (1962) observed, occurs through the use of \"practical knowledge \". This is tacit or embodied knowledge that is expressed through everyday actions. Mo re broadly, the habits and bodily skills of certain groups that are acquired through cultural means has been termed habitus (Mauss 1973[193 5]), and is shaped by the person's positioning within a social structure . As Bourdieu (1977) proposed, habitus both structures actions and is reproduced through the expression of agency. Rather than being fixed, the habitus has generative potential as the person deals with changing life situations. If we apply this theory to the provision of healthcare, we can see that a practitioner operates through certain modes which are constructed through his acquired and tacit knowledge, social positioning, place within certain groups and power structures, and motivation. These structuring factors influence the ways in which he enga ges with the sick person and undertake s the actions of caring for them, his availability and the priorities he gives to his time. The term \"therapeutic mode \" has also been used within occupational therapy and psychotherapeutic settings to describe a practi tioner's use of specific interpersonal modes according to the needs of his patients (Taylor et al. 2010). Including modes such as empathy, collaboration, instruction and problem -solving, they each suggest a dynamic interaction between practitioner a nd pati ent. In comparing the modes by which different practitioners operate, marked contrasts can be noted. The healers are frequently in high demand and expected to be always availabl e during the day or night, and to be dedicated to patient care without expect ation of material reward . Their motivation stems from a desire to help, the social expectations placed upon them and the obligations of their position as initiates (Chapter 5 ). It is common for p atients to visit on a daily basis for treatment, or to stay w hilst receiving ongoing treatment, which helps to build confidence in the practitioner. As they receive little monetary compensation for their work, healers are often engaged with other work such as farming, or the business of everyday 273 life. A heale r may b e required to switch to his therapeutic mode at any time, requiring a constant state of concentration. In contrast, patients have the perception that hospital practitioners do treat them as a priority, their extra efforts being directed elsewhere such as into their own private clini cs. At the time of my research, numbers of patients attending rural hospitals were relatively low.104 However, whilst the staff rarely seem to be under time pressure105, they also have limit ed availability for their patients and rarely provide a detailed consulation or follow -up care. Other studies suggest that it is common for patients to make multiple visits to rural healthcare facilities , but still feel unsatisfied with the results (Buchner 2011) . It is notable that the distincti on between these encounters is not only one of different healthcare modalities, but also between staff at government -run institutions and individual non-regulated practitioners situated on the periphery . Each ha s differing m otivations, choices, systems of recompense and social status. In the rural hospital setting, many doctors express struggles with motivation in a context where there is little likelihood of professional progression or reward for work well done. During the t ime I spend living in the public health centre dormitory with rural doctors and nurses, we discuss the challenges and frustrations of their job often. It's very difficult to remain motivated when , without connections, staff have no choice over the location of their job (those who receive government scholarships must work for a set number of years in the institution they are assigned to) . Even by Lao standards, their salaries are very low,106 and they also face a lack of good equipment and facilities to treat anything but the simplest proble ms, and patients who they feel don't follow instructions. It is little wonder that they direct the majority of their energies elsewhere. Younger female healthworkers in particular often fe el marginalised - underpaid, without opportunities for career prog ression, forced to live away from their families whilst also encountering social pressure to marry and take on extra domestic work. Being newcomers or temporarily post ed to an area mean s that they d o not have the same network of familial 104 Since 2017, and the move towards universal health coverag e in Laos, many doctors complain of extra workloads, confusion over paperwork, and the diversion of their private patients towards public healthcare. 105 It is however worth noting that health staff, particularly in rural health centres, are responsible for all the administrative and management aspects of their work as well as outreach campaigns, vaccine delivery etc - all of which is very time -consuming and can take attention away from seeing patients in facilities . 106 At the time of research, typical salarie s for rural doctors were 1.6 million kip per month ($185USD), and for nurses, 1.1 million ($125USD); additionally, some was deducted as compulsory contributions towards events such as Lao new year c elebrations, and, as was usual for government workers, the ir salaries often arrived late. 274 and social connect ions as the healers, unless they be come part of that community themselves such as by marriage. As one of the young doctors commented, \"It's difficult - I didn't choo se to come here, but if you get a scholarship from the government and you don't have conn ections, then you have to go where they send you. I specialised in emergency medicine but we just don't have any facilities here so we have to send people to Pakse - it's difficult to learn anything new . I don't feel that patients respect me because I'm yo unger, and my salary is low so I can't move out from the dormitory.\" Whilst the healers also voice their dissatisfaction with their position from an economic perspec tive, and like the doctors are forced to diversify their income sources in order to manag e financially, they ha ve other means of recompen se. Despite the disadvantages that come with the absence of state support , the unregulated nature of their profession means they can operate with relative freedom in the familiar surroundings of their homes , in close contact with extended family networks. They thus ha ve a sense of control over their lives, and of personal agency , and emphasise that they ha ve chosen to live this way. Their behaviour is also partially dictated by the regulatory framework stemmin g from phitsanu . For the healers, this is a personal self-cultivation process, as well as affect ing the way in which the y interact with people seeking care . The person thus experiences this as \"physician kindness \" (Buetow 2013 ), even without know ing the ra tionale behind it. Conclusion The therapeutic encounter - including its sensory, social and symbolic setting, the interaction between patient, practitioner and others, and the capacity of the patient to enact agency - has a powerful effect on satisfaction with care. In understanding why and how traditional medicine is used in Laos, it is thus cru cial to think about the temporal space of the encounter, and how the physical and relational qualities of the space and interaction are experienced by people who m ay be suffering from illness. As I have shown, without drawing broad generalisations, there a re reasons for the ongoing popularity of traditional healers that go beyond a preference for one type of medicine over another. The healers work in a comforting, f amiliar, protected space, contain ing therapeutic symbols which may hold meaning for their patients and inspire confidence. The space allows support from family members, and for the visit to incorporate social interaction, creating a relaxed atmosphere. The encounter follows a common pattern, each aspect of which (offerin g and exchange; empathetic listening and dialogue; touch and bodily contact) helps 275 to build trust in the healer and his treatment . This is important to ensur e the likelihood of a positive ou tcome, whether as a direct therapeutic effect or the future follow -up and management of illness. The sick person is able to e nact personal agency, both through their active participation in the treatment process, and in being able to voice their ideas and needs. The therapeutic encounter with the healer can be contrast ed with experiences of rural institutional biomedical settings such as the local hospital, in which patients often express feelings of powerlessness. In understanding this difference, it is n ecessary to think beyond dichotomies of traditional v ersus bio-medicine, towards the lifeworlds and agency of the practitioners themselves. The therapeutic mode through which the healers operate, influenced by their social position and conduct stemming fro m phitsanu, is thus experienced by the patients more positively. In previous chapters, I showed how traditional medicine is used as part of complex healthcare -seeking strategies, and how illness is managed with herbal medicine and spiritual techniques. He re, I have shown that the healing process involves more than just the treatment prescribed - it includes important relational factors between the person, practitioner, and environment. This discussion is continued in the next chapter, which explores the ef fect of wider social networks on health. 276 Chapter 7: Yu di mi heng : establishing health Introduction In this chapter, I examine the establishment of health. After receiv ing treatment, what is necessary to be considered fully well? In previous chapt ers, I have described how the person is vulnerable to invasion through the boundaries of the self; therefore, malicious influences must be expelled and their defences strengthened . This chapter explores what must be brought into, attached to or created wit hin the person : a process of addi tion rather than removal . This chapter broadens the perspective from the healer -patient interaction to include the person within their social and spiritual worlds. In the context of lowland southern rural Laos, there are co mmonly shared and well -defined notions o f health, which are understood, enacted, created and practised in socially and culturally specific ways. I use the framework of a commonly held ritual to explore notions of health. The ceremony of soul-calling or string-tying can , as Lundberg (200 8) proposes , be described as the ultimate performance of health in the lowland Lao context.107 Fundamentally, the ritual is about relationships, between people, souls, spirits and environments, and is rooted in the Lao person' s relationship with home and place. It is employed during transitional periods, such as birth, marriage, illness or before journeys, or times in which a person has undergone a traumatic experience and feels that h er souls have departed. The act of tying st rings both forms and strengthens relationships. It facilitates the (re)integration of the person, who may have become alienated, within h er family, networks and local community . It has the aim of calling the souls, who are said to have fled to the forest o r wild places, back to h er body and the comfort of home. In treating illness, t he healer may officiate the ritual himself, or take part in it . It is an important part of his 'toolkit ' - a technique which may be used either on its own, or as part of a hol istic treatment to help his patients recover their health. However, the benefits experienced by the person during the ritual are derived primarily from the presence of her 107 The soul -calling ritual, as I discuss later, is not unique to the lowland Lao, and indeed variants of it are performed both by other ethnic groups in Laos, and in parts of Thailand and Cambodia. However, in this chapter, I explore its specific importance in the lowland Lao context. 277 kinship and s ocial networks rather than through her interaction with the healer. In this chapter, I examine how the ritual achieves the effect of both creating and defining wellbeing from several perspectives. Firstly, I discuss notions of health and wellbeing in Laos , which include both a strong emphasis on sociality and the need to anc hor the souls in the body. I argue that the ritual is the performance of an ideal social state which represents good health, protecting a person from isolation and rooting her both spatially in the locus of the village/home and in a network of reciprocal s ocial relationships, as well as enacting some important aspects of Lao culture such as playfulness. Secondly, I explore the psychological and metaphorical aspects through the words whi ch are said in the ritual . I show that the ritual provides the sick per son with a method for strengthening her mental -emotional state during the recovery from illness through a process of 'managing the heart'. Soul loss may be both a felt sensation and a way of enacting psychological states; therefore this loss and retrieval can also be understood as an embodied metaphor . Thirdly, I examine the act of string -tying, showing how the ritual allows the sick person to directly exper ience care and support from others. This occurs through the tactile engagement with and expression of good wishes by others, and on a practical level, through monetary donations which may assist with the costs of healthcare . 278 Calling the souls Su khuan The soul -calling or string -tying ritual is ubiquitous among the Lao , and there are a number of va riants. The simpler mad khen or phuk khen , literally meaning to 'bind the arm ', and the more elaborate baci or su khuan , terms which are often used interchangeably . Su khuan means to call or invite the souls, whereas the name baci may come from the Khmer term bai si, meaning auspicious rice, also used to refer to the tray used in the ritual (Heinze 1982). Although specific forms may vary, there is also a certain ambiguity and flexibility to the ritual which makes it difficult to define each variant separate ly. Indeed , contemporary commentators (Lundberg 2008; Singh 2014 b) have argued that they are essentially the same. The ritual may be large, elaborate and formal, involving hundreds of people; or , it may be held for a small group of relatives in a family ho me. The following ethnographic vignette describes a medium -sized gathering, held for a young girl who is recovering fro m illness . The ritual has been described as typically Lao (Abhay 1959; Zago 1972), but as Evans (1998) points out, it is practised by bot h Tai and non -Tai groups, suggesting a ritual linkage between ethnic groups which pre -dated contemporary religious developments.108 In central Thailand , the ritual may be called tham khuan (to do/strengthen th e souls) (Heinze 1982), but it has not been eleva ted to become a national custom to the same extent as in Laos (Evans 1998 ). Descriptions of the rituals from the pre -revolutionary era (Abhay 1959; Pottier 2008) as well as in Northeastern Thailand, an ethni cally Lao area (Tambiah 1970), show continuity with the present day . As Evans (1998) records, during the early years of the revolution the ritual proceedings and objects used were significantly pared down, and it could only be conducted with government per mission. However i n contemporary Laos the ritual, which can be \"flexible, sacred and secular\" , is also commonly used by government representatives in their interaction with citizens . This can be understood as state legitimisation through the production of a national identity (Singh 2014 ). In post -revolut ionary Laos, the term satsana pham is also now used to refer to the practices of su khuan , perhaps in order to denote this as another system of religio n from a Marxist perspective (G. Kourilsky pers . communication , 2020 ). 108 For example, Ongaro (2019) reports a set of soul -calling and string -tying practices among the Akha which bear a striking resemblance to the Lao, despite the very limited contact and lack of com mon language between the Akha and the lowland Lao until quite recently. 279 The calling of the khuan is perhap s the most visible representation of the rich religious landscape which underlies the practices that make up life for the lowland Lao (Chapter 5). As Heinze (1982: xi) points out, even if people know which elements are apparently Brahm anic or Buddhist, dur ing the ceremony, \"nobody insists on such differences.\" Here, as described in Chapter 5 , a focus on local practice is the key to understanding the remarkably flexible use and form of the ceremony , in which Buddhist monks and local officials alike may play roles in a ritual which incorporates Brahmanic and animist principles .109 The word khuan is often translated as 'soul'; other definitions include 'spirit suggests, \"a metaphor for one's vit ality and energy in this life\". It can be theoretically differentiated from the Buddhist concept of winjan (soul, consciousness), which is said to only leave the body at death, bearing the karmic legacy of the person . However, most people, even the ritual officiants, tend to conceptualise them as the same. The khuan are not the same as the phi (spirits or ghosts who usually live outside the body), but they are in relationship, and can be affected by them, especially in cases of spirit attack. After the pers on's death, the khuan may transform into phi through the transformation of the person , as in the case of ancestral spirits , or into thevada, angelic beings. This type of animating life -essence or souls that are contained within, but not limited to, the person is mentioned across Southeast Asia , and cross -culturally. However, as Heinze (1982) suggests, this non -dualistic and fluid interpretation of the khuan in which they can transform their state distinguishes them from other more static soul concepts such as the Chinese hun. The khuan are distinct from the chitchai, the heart -mind or mental -emotional disposition, but the stability of the khuan is important in maintaining mental -emotional balance. There are 32 khuan normally present in the body, each one r esident in a different body part (referred to by the Pali word akara ), which they are said to animate (Pottier 2008: 497).110 The khuan belong to the person, but are also separate entities with agency, at least from the 109 The ceremony can also be performed for non -human beings, especially elephants (J. Dubost, pers. communication 2019). Khuan are not limited to humans: other beings such as farm animal s, ricefields or even buildings a re said to possess khuan (Radjhadon 1962). String -tying can be performed for motorised vehicles even, and it is not unusual to see strings around the handlebars of motorbikes on certain auspicious days. 110 Kourilsky (2015: 50) states that the notion of the khuan is \"shared by all Tai populations, whether Buddhist (Lao, Shan, L\u00fc, Kh\u00fcn, Phouan, Yuon, etc.) or not (Tai Dam, Tai D\u00e8ng, Tai Khao, Sek, Yang, etc.) \". However, these groups predominantly have more than 32 souls. Potti er (2008: 497) suggests that the reason the number of souls among the Lao is less than other Tai groups is to correspond to Lao medical concepts of the body. The number of body parts is also the same as in canonical Buddhism (Salguero 2017b). 280 moment that they leave the body (khuan hai), which occurs when the person is sick, frightened, shock ed or has a mental disturbance; then they must be recalled before they become lost . The khuan are thus both part of the person and yet not them . This \"independent nature \", Heinze (1982:42) sugge sts, is the most striking feature of khuan - the propensity to disassociate is precisely what makes the khuan both the root of, and threatening to the wellbeing of the person within which it resides. In practice, the 32 souls tend to be understood and refe rred to in the singular. As Hermanns (2017:256) argues in the case of the Luangan of Borneo, th e division into parts can be understood metaphorically, \"...pointing to the evasiveness and inherent instability of human souls, and the multiple and repeated eff orts needed to contain and integrate them.\" The ceremony is officiated by a ritual specialist (mo phon), a layperson, usually a village elder, although Buddhist monks may also conduct a blessing (as in the following description), or even the full ritual. The healers may also conduct smaller ceremonie s for patients and their families. A baci can be held for almost any occasion - it is always good in the sense that it holds the promise of greater cohesion and integration on many different levels (spiritual, personal, familial, social, political). Although the ritual is ostensibly usually held f or the benefit of one person , a couple, or family , it includes active participation by all present without particular focus on the individual, unlike accounts of soul r etrieval undertaken by shamans.111112 Charismatic mo phon with a talent for recitation are much sought after, but, unlike the therapeutic potency of the healers (Chapter 5 ), the effectiveness of the ceremony is not reliant on one individual's accumulated spiri tual power . In examining the ritual here, my emphasis is on the aspects which are associated with health and wellbeing. I use the form of the ritual (s) to think more broadly about what it means to be well in Laos. In the context of treating illness, the ri tual tends to have an all -purpose nature; even when no particular diagnosis has been made, it can still be used in establishing health (Pottier 2008). 111 In shamani c traditions, the shaman may enter the spiritual world to seek the person's lost soul, or to make a divination about the causes of their sickness, for example in Native American healing (Hultkrantz, 1989), in Amazonian contexts (de Castro, 1992) , or in wes tern neo -shaminism which may draw on contemporary psychological theories (Lindquist, 2004). 112 This may not always hold true: Heinze (1982) and Pottier (2008) propose that in some cases where the purpose is to address a particular problem, the ce remony may be oriented more towards mediumistic or shamanic principles which draw on the individual's psyche, but I did not see or hear of it used in this way in present -day Laos. Evans (1998) further proposes that in urban contexts the ritual has become b oth increas ingly individualised and commercialised, in comparison to more egalitarian expressions in rural areas. 281 The following ethnographic vignette describe s a ritual held in in Phamuk village in February 2016, in the home of Noy, a two-year old girl who was recovering from illness. The ritual It's 10am on a Saturday in Phamuk village, one of the most important villages of Munlapamok district nestled on the western riverbank in the far south. Po Nueang arrives at the small house next to the Mekong which is my home at that time. He is dressed smartly in an ironed shirt and polished shoes, and tells me to put on a sin, a traditional Lao skirt, as we will attend a phuk khen at a neighbour's house. We walk the short dist ance along the Mekong road, which lined with palm trees, small and neatly tended vegetable gardens, punctuated by wandering cows, and contains occasional stalls selling fried bananas, pumpkins or plastic goods. We pass the central area with the village off ice and a cluster of market stalls , which acts as a gathering place to hear the village gossip, joke, relax and discuss current affairs . It is particularly popular with the older people of the village, some in their 80s or even 90s, who sit together chewin g betel, chatting and observing li fe. Po Thao Pon, a sprightly figure, often stops by on his ancient bicycle - he goes everywhere like this, even after a road traffic accident from which he recovered with P o Nueang's help. Mae Thao Dai, wizened and slightl y shaky, always immaculately dress ed in a sin, likes to walk over from the small house nearby where she lives with a daughter and grandchildren. From here, one can watch the new ferry arrive, and the small passing boats containing fisherman casting handmad e nets, or families from neighbour ing villages or islands. When Po Nueang and I arrive at one of the few concrete houses in the village, it is full of people, predominantly older women, sitting on mats on the floor . Each is adorned in temple clothing and h olding a silver offering bowl and candles. The focus is a two -year old girl, Noy, wearing a frilly white blouse and a tiny blue sin with intricate woven patterns , her hair carefully tied into pigtails, sitting on her father's lap. P o Nueang immediately si ts down and enquires after her health. I realise that she is the same little girl we had visited together in the district hospital, about 3km away, three days earlier. There, she had been admitted with acute diarrhoea, and was one of the onl y in-patients p resent in a long row of empty beds in the new but scantily equipped hospital ward, lying prone attached to a saline drip and surrounded by concerned family members. Now, she appears to be full of energy and undaunted by being the centre of a ttention. Later , I ask Po Nueang about Noy's treatment: 282 he tells me that she has been taking the hospital medicines at the same time as some ya fon he had prescribed. On a low platform to one side of the room, five orange -robed monks from the local temple are sitting cross-legged , including the elderly abbot, who is smoking a cigarette. A large and elaborate pha kh uan, the banana -leaf ritual centrepiece festooned with o range flowers and entwined white threads, with lit candles burning inside, has been placed in front of h im. Several male village elders including P o Nueang make up the first row, with approximately 60 more people s itting on the floor behind. The monks begi n proceedings by reciting texts in Pali, each holding the long white string stemming from the pha kh uan between his thumb and second finger . As they chant, the girl's father slowly drips wax from a lit candle into a bowl of water, his left hand held at his chest, his head bowed. Low bamboo tables of food prepared by villagers are placed in front of the monks . They continue chanting, this time in Lao, calling for health and happiness, asking for the girl's illness to be resolved and for her khuan to return to her body. The monks pause to eat, and the ceremony is continued by laypeople . The candles are lit again and an elder takes up the chant, as Noy, her mother and father move close to the pha khuan; other children are called to sit nearby. The bundles of white cotton threads are taken down and distributed around the room, whilst the adults present produce pri stine banknotes, in Lao kip or Thai baht, rolling them up carefully and knotting them into the threads. Still sitting or kneeling on the floor, moving forward one by one, they place these threads around the wrists of the girl . Before tying the string , they gently sweep the ends over and then firmly rub the point where her pulse can be felt, softly murmuring wishes for good health , or khuan eu, kh uan ma, kh uan khao euy!, calling the souls to come back into the body, whilst looking into her eyes. Physical con tact is maintained throughout; participants join themselves together in a chain by placing a hand on the next person's arm just above the elbow, and sit closely huddled together, creating a sense of intimacy. Noy's wrists and arms quickly become fat with w hite threads and banknotes . In a short time she has accumulated a significant amount; the notes range from 10,000 kip ($1.20) to 500 baht ($1 6). After f inishing their meal, the monks begin to chant again . One walks around the room, sprinkling the attendee s with perfumed water . Noy's father visits each monk in turn, holding one palm in front of his chest as each ties a thread to his other wrist with a blessing. The tables are moved to the floor, so that the rest of the food, dishes of grilled fish, chicken soup, 283 beef lap (minced meat salad with herbs) , phak som (sour pickled vegetables), sticky rice, jeow (a spicy dip) , mak mo ban (jackfruit mixed with fish), and a sweet coconut dessert, can be eaten together . The villagers cluster in small groups around the tables , chatting and laughing. I sit with a group of grandmothers, who ask me whether I can eat Lao food, about my age and marital status, and comment appreciatively on my 'beautiful ' (ngam) pale skin and Lao skirt. A bottle of beer and bong ya (medicinal alcohol brewed with rice wine and herbs) are produced and passed around with a single glass, each person emptying it before passing to another. Like every Lao ritual I have attended, it combines the solemn and joyous, the sacred and the profane, the reli gious and the secular, with no break in proceedings. The loudspeakers are connected and raucous molam music creates a party atmosphere . Some of the older women begin to fon, the traditional dance style with intricate lotus -like hand gestur es, and Po Nueang joins them for a short time, laughing as he imitates their gestures. Although he has not played an official role in the ritual, he has been prominent throughout, guiding both the family and me in appropriate behaviou r; in my case, assessing my position an d gently reprimanding me if I sit in the wrong place in the house, whilst constantly urging me to take photographs. We leave when the party is in full swing to visit another of his patients nearby. 284 Dripping candle wax during t he ceremony Monks chanting a blessing in Pali 285 Noy and her father after her wr ists have been tied with banknotes in the strings The party begins: a woman begins to fon (Lao dance) whilst drinking Lao rice whisky. Eating food together after the ceremony 286 Social wellbeing Being sabai In this chapter, I examine health, and the ritual's role in establishing it. But what is health, in its fullest sense? The concepts of disease, illness and sickness have been much decons tructed within medical anthropology (e.g. Young 1976 b). However, less attention has been given to examining the social construction of health as a broader idea than the absence of disease . Whilst the discipline has historically examined the suffering subje ct in states of sickness (Kleinman et al . 1998 ; Robbins 2013), it has become evident that questions about what constitutes wellbeing in varied and changing contexts are crucial in understanding the priorities of contemporary life. Defined as \"being well, p sychologically, physically, and socioeconomically\" acco rding to the person's own judgement, wellbeing is both personally subjective and culturally mediated (Mathews & Izquierdo 2009). Health is not the only marker of wellbeing, but, as Baumeister (1991) pr oposed, it is \"how you feel about your health\". How is wellbeing defined in Laos? In the rural southern lowlands, health , or its absence , is a matter of constant discussion. The term sukhaphap is used to describe the state of bodily health. A desirable st ate is sukhap hap kheng heng (strong health). This means that the person is free from illness, but also that they have the strength to carry out their daily duties. T o be strong is valued; physical labour is a normal part of rural life, even for those with other means of employment. Older people who have lived through the revolutionary era speak with pride about their abilities to withstand tough conditions, and express their concern for the younger generations who ride motorbikes everywhere and seem to valu e convenience over effort. However, whilst notions of s ocialist masculinity still have impact (Creak 2015), most health maintenance practices are strongly rooted in traditions which pre -dated the socialist era. The often -heard phrase yu di mi heng (to have goodness and strength ) is both a description and an invocation, spoken to another who is unwell, or as a blessing. Primarily, health is maintained through lifestyle factors related to the regulation of diet, exercise, rest, and work. In Phamuk village, activities often mentioned as benefi cial to health , especially by the older generation, include rice farming, fishing, riding a bicycle, going to the forest, looking after buffalo, dancing, and gardening, incorporating connections to nature and to others. Most of these activities are carried out without the specific intention of creating health, making up the habitus of everyday village life . As in many farming societies , work, exercise and socialising may all be encompassed by the same activity. However, 287 although working in the rice fields is described as both enjoyable and healthy, too much is damaging to the body. Excess in work or exercise is considered bad for health, a trait which often sees the Lao described as lazy by their neighbours. For older people , a slow early morning walk through the village is a popular form of exercise. Grandfather (po thao ) Pon, who is 82, is often seen on a rust y old bicycle riding around the village and sometimes further afield. I ask him how he maintains good health into ol d age, especially after a road traffic accident that left him unable to walk for a time . He answers , \"I always ride my bicycle up and down, up and down, to visit everyone.\" The term sabai suggests a wider concept of wellbeing. In contrast to sukhaphap, sabai can be defined as \"how people experience their illness and health\" (Lundberg 2008:74) .113 Health in Lao society is created and experienced in culturally specific ways that are deeply enmeshed in the lives of others; an embodied \"somatic mode of attenti on\" (Csordas 1993) which is the everyday lived experience of rural people. T o ask someone if they are sabai is to ask whether they are well in a broader sense, including their happiness, familial and social relationships, spiritual state, economic status a nd place in society. T o describe one's state as chai sabai , to have a heart which is well, is to be content. Being sabai is also cultivated through personal effort, especially through the avoidance of damaging emotional states such as worry and an appreci ation of activities which are muan (fun, to be enjoyed). The mental -emotional state, chitchai (mind -heart ) must be well -balanced, especially when reflected outwardly in one's dealing with others . T o be sabai can even be understood as a virtue, as these qua lities have a direct effect on those in close relationship . It is possible to be sabai even if suffering from illness or injury , if the person feels they are supported by their family and living in the correct social and spiritual balance. As Wansai , who w as staying at Vilaysack's house for treatment of his weak an d immovable legs, described, \"I am sabai di [in a state of wellbeing] but my sukhaphap [physical health] is not good \". Whilst from an objective viewpoint his health was poor, Wansai's sense of wellbeing derived from the presence of his family, having the right foods to eat and the treatment he was receiving, including spiritual re -orientation through healing ritual - as well as perhaps the interest by a foreig ner in his wellbeing at that moment . Likewise, in the case of Duean 113 Both sabaai and sukhaphap are from Pali - sukhaphap has a Sanskrit root, sukha - meaning happiness or pleasure. This contradicts Lundberg's ( 2008) claim that sukhaphap is a more modern term for health. 288 described earlier, despite her physical pain, she was encouraged to take part in social activities through the efforts of her family members. This emphasis on being with others and the avoidance of being alon e was frequently expressed by people and their families seeking health. Blood which is not good, extreme emotions and lack of familial harmony all weaken the body and render its boundaries more permeable . As well as allowing invasion by malignant factors (Chapter s 4 and 5), thi s weakness means that the khuan may temporarily flee the person in times of stress . Anchoring the khuan firmly in the body is thus a crucial part of being sabai. A person is particularly vulnerable to soul loss at certain times of life, such as wome n after giving birth . As Mae Thao Pong, the elderly traditional birth attendant of Phamuk village explained, women can lose their khuan very easily if it takes a long ti me for the baby to arrive . Young children, such as Noy, must be treated with particula r care after periods of illness, even if the physical symptoms have resolved. Whilst strong khuan are a sign of health, disrupted physical or mental health may cause the khuan to leave, as the internal balance of the person is very delicate and the khuan are easily startled. This, in turn, can cause sickness. Therefore , in cases of ill health , as Tambi ah (1970:227) suggests, the ritual is both prophylactic and therapeutic, used both to prevent and treat sickness . The utilisation of the soul -calling ceremon y is thus \"additive \"; a way of positively creating wellbeing by unifying the fragmented parts of th e person , in contrast with \"subtractive \" methods, such as expelling bad karma or malicious spirits (Pottier 2008: 500) . The aim of the ritual is to revitali se the person by strengthening their bond with beings at varying levels of alterity . The closest of these is their khuan, followed by immediate family members and then a gradually widening circle of kinship and social networks, depending on the size of the ritual. Unlike shamanic methods which may take the person on a personal journey to better understand their illness (Laderman 1993 ), or psychological techniques which seek to make the person responsible for their emotional state , the ceremony moves the foc us away from the individual's personal problems, helping them to see themselves in a wider perspective .114 114 As I discuss later, the khuan may also be understood as embodied metaphors - however, by attributing agency to them, this interpretation still moves focus away from the person themselves. 289 The performance of social health Within research on Laos, is it notable that of the few ethnographic studies incorporating health and social science, well-being and sociality emerge as key issues, suggesting that this is a primary concern of respondents. Social relationships were described both as generative, in producing health among female weavers (Lundberg 200 8), and protective, ensuring appropriate care when sick (Buchner 2011). Each provides a framework for how wellbeing is defined which draws strongly on adherence to core family and societal values. In examining subjective -objective descriptions of wellbeing, Thin ( 2009) contrasts \"feelings\" with \" evaluative meanings\", but also proposes a third route of enquiry into \"motives\". T o analyse motive, he suggests, \"...include[s] not only the desire to feel good but also the desire to have a life which is 'good' in the sense that it is meaningful and judged well by other people in accordance with social principles \" (Thin 2009:30) . Extending perceptions of wellbeing to define whether a life is judged well by others imputes an additional moral and socio -political subtext which can provide a deeper insight into the motivations behind certain principles of peoples' lifeworlds. In other words, h ealth is not just experienced; it is performe d. A notion of wellbeing which is defined by relations with others is thus reflected and enacted within the ceremony. The ritua l can be understood as the performance of social health, emphasising sociality, normativity and reciprocity. Relationships are necessary to hold the ritual, whi ch, usually conducted in the home, materially constructs the extended family. The grandmothers c reate the beautiful pha kh uan centrepiece, a complex structure made of folded banana leaves and flowers collected from village gardens, and wind the white cotto n threads together to hang on the top . The food, which is an offering first to the khuan, and then to the monks, is brought by attendees. Dishes such as grilled fish, lap, sticky rice, jeow and papaya salad , common markers of Lao identity (Singh 2010 ), are placed on low bamboo tables to enable the monks and then the participants to eat together. Food offered to the khuan is ideally from the village . Wild meat is generally excluded - this can perhaps be attrib uted to the symbolic qualities of the animals which oppose the purpose of the ritual, the re -integration of the person into their community (Sin gh 2010; Tambiah 1968b). Whilst forest foods are valued for their health -giving and natural (thammasat ) qualities , when harnessing natural potency t his potentiality must be balanced against possible 290 dangers. 115 When eaten, as in this case, as the leftovers from monks, the food is considered especially auspicious (Heinze 1992) . The consumption of this food together by the sick person and their family is thus beneficial to establishing health due to its nutritious and symbolic value. Although the beauty of the pha kh uan and the deliciousness of the offerings aim to tempt back the khuan, ultimately social interaction is more important than the scale and expense of the ritual. The significance of social con nection is demonstrated by the involvement and physical closeness of village members, including other children, during the ritual . Although Po Nueang sometimes conducts rituals, in this event he was there as a participant to demonstrate his care for the fa mily, as well as to mark his high social status in the vi llage, as shown by his position at the front of the room . The ceremony was officiated first by the monks who lived in the temple less than 500m away, and then by a village elder , all of whom would ha ve been well -known to the family. More broadly, participa tion in the ritual is demonstrative of appropriate social behaviour which ensures a healthy society. Ritual attendance is considered thuek, meaning to be correct, right, polite, to conform to or be subject to; it can also mean to run into or hit something solid. Thuek is commonly invoked in relation to everyday actions; there is a prescribed way to do everything from cooking to fishing to washing , and an y variation is cause for discussion.116 To be thuek is to act in a way that is morally, socially and politi cally correct and conforms to religious requirements . To be described as khuam khon lao (to be like a Lao person) is a compliment, and implies that the person knows how to behave in a way that is in accordance with societal norms. During the ritual, Po Nueang constantly monitors my behaviour, making sure that I am dressed appropriately (the Lao skirt tha t must be worn for any religious or state occasion and confers a sense of morality to the wearer); that I sit in the correct place in relation to gender and social importance; that I take photographs to demonstrate my appreciation for the situation. The qu ality of being polite (suphap) is one that is strongly equate d with Lao -ness and concurrent Buddhist symbols. When I tell Vilaysack that I'm interested in Lao culture (vathanatham Lao), he answers: 115 It is notable that the taboo about using non -domestic foods in the ritual is partly similar to dietary prohibitions adopted by apprentice healers, who are at risk as they begin to enter the world of magic and spirits (see Chapter 5). 116 As I frequently discov ered during my life in the village ! 291 \"Well you've come many times now. You see how Lao people are - they are polite (suphap), kind (chai di), have strength (mi heng), they wear a Lao skirt (sin), and a cloth over the shoulder (pe), and they go to th e temple.\" In my research in Phamuk village, being able to take part in everyday village life and activities was the most commonly mentioned sign of good health - any absence from social, religious or political events is considered abnormal. In a context of increasin g mobility, especially in border area s like Champasak province , many younger people, including mothers who leave their children in the care of grandparents, may leave to work in Vientiane or Thailand . It therefore involves extra effort to ensur e their pres ence at the ceremony . The common phrase kap ban (return home) is generally accompanied by a sense of pleasure and relief, and considered essential for any festive or religious occasion. It is rare for a person not to have a strong connection wi th their village of birth; lowland Lao matrilocal tradition s mean that women are particularly attached. To miss home, khit hot ban is a very common and socially acceptable form of melancholy that seems to affect people even when they have been gone for a matter of days. Like the khuan , the person should not wande r too far away from their home. Social togetherness also has a political aspect in the term samakhi (solidarity ), brought into usage under communism and used to express a sense of shared common pur pose. This may not always be from choice . The state penetrates all aspects of life, even in the countryside, and it is normal to be called to 'volunteer' labour for village projects, to attend political meetings or indeed, string -tying ceremonies that mark significant occasions, regardless of one's other d uties and plans. This enactment of wellbeing was described by young urban volunteers as \"the way to be happy is to be a good Lao person\" (McMellon 2015) , incorporat ing notions of citizenship , nationhood an d associated behaviours such as sammakhi that can b e observed by others. As Singh has argued, the baci ritual may to some extent also represent the maintenance of social order, use d by government representatives as a way of legitimising their presence and the idea of the Lao state as \"a source of benevolent patronage \" (Singh 2014: 1071) . Just as the family is constructed through their presence at the ritual, the contemporary village emerges through such everyday representations and participation (High 2006) . 292 Fun and playfulness Other cultura lly valued qualities that are performed within the ritual include muan (fun, enjoyment) and lin (play, playfulness). Muan is commonly translated as 'fun', but this does not really encompass the brea th and significance of this idea . Other meanings include enjoyable, joyous, happy, amusing, diverting, satisfying, lively and entertaining. If an undertaking is not muan then it is not really worth doing. In contrast, bo muan (not fun) is a state to be avoided, even if it co uld confer longer term benefi ts in the future such as a more demanding but financially rewarding occupation. It is often used in comparisons and decision making, by determining which place or activity has the potential to be most muan. Commonly mentioned s igns of a person being in goo d health were \"they like to/know how to have smile lot\" . Muan may seem to conflict with thuek, correctness, but in fact they are related, as there are specific ways that things are and are not muan. Being alone is never muan, no matter what the activity, and can frequently be dangerous, leaving a person vulnerable to feelings of bo muan and to attac k by people, animals or spirits. A n often heard phrase is kin lai khon kin saep - the more people w ho eat together, the more delicious the food is. Festivals, which involve loud music, drinking and dancing, are always muan. As described in previous chapter s, one must avoid that which is phit, wrong, whether in diet or social behaviour . However, in the Typical meal with food from the village, including fish found in paddy fields, home grown vegetables, and coconut dessert 293 case of activities such as drinking alcohol, the values placed on sociality outweigh the importance of moderating excess . Indeed as one woman in her 80s said, \"to be sabai, you must dance and drink!\" 117 The word lin, to play, is incorporated into many verbs. Including lin gives the action a suggestion of playfulness, a lack of intentionality or to do something for the purpose of enjoyment rather than a particular outcome. It implies a certain relationship to time in which the emphasis is not on productivity. To nyang lin is to go for a walk for pleasure, rather than to exercise or to arrive somewhere; visiting neighbours spontaneously is pai lin, (going to play); at the house, visitors will nang lin (sit playfully, often eating or drinking). To non lin is to r elax in a hori zontal position somewhere between asleep and awake; to vao lin is to 'play talk', the art of making jokes and double entendres which is much enjoyed by both men and women. I n order to achieve a balanced and healthy state, the quality of lin should be incor porated as much as possible into everyday life.118 This atmosphere of 'fun' and 'play' can be observed within the ritual, both during the party - like atmosphere and the way in which the khuan are conceptualised. In the ritual held for Noy, proc eedings move easily from religious solemnity to frivolity, culminating in eating, drinking, music and dancing. It is important that the string -tying ritual should be muan for the participants: indeed, the proceedings before and after are as significant as the ritual itself in establishing and defining social health. As Turner (1974) has written on the ludic nature of ritual, it has a tendency to be both earnest and playful, cycling between the sacred and secular. The khuan must be called back in a way that appeals to their perceived playful quality, entreating them not to \"go away and play\" but \"come and stay with grandfather, aunt, uncle, grandchildren, brothers and sisters\" (Iida 2017 a:325). Although correct behaviour is valued, this must take into account the delicate nature of the Lao psyche which is easily disturbed by undue pressure and alienation, reflected in the movements of the khuan. 117 The strong Lao enjoyment of such activities is not just a modern tendency - in his unpublished diaries, colonial explorer Pavie in the 19th century remarked upon the volume of and accompanying noise of alcohol consumpt ion, especially by women - far more than their neighbours the Siamese! (M. Lorillard, pers. communication, 2020). 118 In some contexts, lin can also have a more hedonistic or immoral connotation. For example, lin pu sao, to play with young women, is a euphemi sm for the widespread practice of married men who take mistresses or visit prostitutes, altho ugh it can also refer to flirtation. 294 Managing the heart The second way in which the ceremony helps the sick person to re -attain wellbeing is by helping them to attend to their psychological state. Soul loss is described as a felt sensation which impacts the person's mental -emotional wellbeing. I explore this from two perspectives . Firstly, I show the relationship between the khuan and heart termin ology us ed for emotional states , in which the ritual aids the process of 'managing the heart' and regaining morale. Secondly, I explore the idea of embodied metaphor. From a psychological perspective, the behaviour of the khuan as it is described in words of the r itual can be said to represent unexpressed desires . Calling the souls back to the body can be understood as a metaphor for the socially -determined behaviours considered necessary for wellbeing. Ethnograph y can provide insights into people's emotio nal expe rience , even though this is very difficult to capture in text (Beatty 2019). Anthropological studies of emotions in southeast Asia tend to emphasise certain aspects. These include, firstly the socio -cultural nature of emotional states, which is pri vileged above individual psychology ; secondly, the somatisation of psychological distress on a bodily level (e.g. Kleinman 1980), and thirdly, the outward control of emotions in the public sphere, in which a positive 'face' is encouraged (e.g. Geertz 1973). As I s how in the following discussio n, exploring wellbeing through the idea of 'managing the heart ' and the embodied metaphor of the khuan provides a nuanced perspective on psychological states which can go beyond these common stereotypes . As Good (200 4: 437) ar gues, \"rather than juxtaposing the individual to the social or cultural, linked to a series of binary oppositions\", a focus on the lived experience of the person and particular terminology for mental -emotional states can assist in understand ing how the rit ual helps them to negotiate sickness. Kamlang chai The presence of the khuan is closely associated both with the person's psychological and bodily health . Soul loss is a felt state affecting the physical, mental and emotional aspects . People who are stro ng have khuan di , good souls, whereas those who don't are weak. When the khuan leave the person , they may experience the effects on a bodily level : as one person explained, \"If the khuan leave your body, you cannot eat or sleep .\" 295 The sense that the khuan are embedded in the body is essential for the person to consider themselves well. A person who is socially withdrawn, doesn't eat regularly, is in conflict with others or is experie ncing what are considered abnormal emotional states is likely to be suffer ing from (and putting h erself at risk of ) both soul loss and spirit invasion. The association of khuan and emotions is also shown in commonly used vocabulary . To bamlung khuan (tonify khuan ), is to increase morale. To sia khuan (lose khuan) is to feel hope less. To have 'soft' or 'tender' khuan (khuan on) is to be a delicate person who is easily frightened; this is also the state of the khuan in early childhood when they have not yet become strong (Radjadon 1962). Khuan are also associated with receiving : a khong khuan ('khuan thing') is the general word for a gift, including items presented after the ceremo ny.119 When asked the main effect of the ritual, the most simple and common answer was simply hai kamlang chai . Kamlang can mean strength, power, energy or force : chai kamlang is to have a powerful heart. To give (hai) kamlang chai is to encourage, boost morale, to show concern or help for another person. To have kamlang chai is to feel strong and stable, and can be gained either through experiencing care or through one's own actions, such as in playing music, dancing or exercising. Kamlang chai can be described as a positive state which is strongly derived through supportive relations with others. It is a significant factor in health, particularly for the el derly: Lundberg (2008: 208) records a grandmother describing how experiencing kamlang chai made h er feel warm, gave her comfort, involved her children and relatives looking out for each other and not having disagreements; this helped her to live longer. Wh en I asked So, a nurse with whom I lived in the health centre dormitory for a time, how kamlang c hai was experienced, she told me , \"It's like when you're ill and people look after you, offer you food and drink and ask you if you need anything - or if you'r e alone and people are concerned about you and invite you to eat or spend time with them .\" The heart is found at the centre of much Lao vocabulary to describe mental -emotional states, often grouped together under the term chit chai, which can be directly translated as mind - heart .120 There is not a strong conceptual divide between thinking and fee ling: the term khit, to think or reflect, can also be used in apparently emotional terms such as khit hot (to miss somebody or something) . The heart, more than any o ther body part, is spoken of as having 119 Heinze (1992) provides a list of 32 Thai language vocabulary items involving khuan; Radjadhon (1962) also provides a more ex tensive reflection on Thai language khuan terminology. 120 This is similar to other Southeast Asian terms for mental -emotional states, such as the Balinese Keneh (feeling -mind) (Wikan 1989). 296 its own khuan, the khuan chai, which is said to be vulnerable to magical kidnapping (Heinze 1992). The khuan and the heart are thus closely interlinked. There are a number of other heart terms associated with kamlang chai. Heart term inology may include direct reference to the heart, by placing it before the adjective, such as chai di (to have a good heart, be kind) , or afterwards, to describe a state , such as di chai (to be happy ). Un chai is the sense of warmth which comes from being with others ; and sabai chai is to be content. Contrasting characteristics are also described in heart terms, such as chai noi (to have a small heart, be mean), nyak chai (to have a difficult heart, be troubled), sia chai (to lose heart, be sad) and tok chai (to be startled). A disturbance in the heart such as chai tok (a falling heart) is likely to frighten the khuan and must therefore be avoided. However, although the sensation of warmth is to be desired, a h ot heart (chai hon ) is not, as this signifies a tendency towards anger and impatience which can cause extreme social embarrassment. As frequently observed in many Southeast Asian societies, explicit expressions of 'hot' emotions, at least outside a familial context, are subject to crit icism (Boellstorff & Lindquist 2004) .121 In the lowland Lao context, it is rare to see aggressive or critical assertions expressed in public. This is important not just in terms of maintaining social harmony, but in the regulation of the sel f and protection against illness (see Chapter 4 and 5). Instead, a cool heart ( chai yen ), a publicly calm and cheerful state is to be strived for at all times. Keeping 'cool' on a level of both body and mind is a pursuit which requires effort, from the ordering of one's da y to avoid excess movement in the midday sun, to consciously controlling one's relationships with neighbours or government officials . Coolness is not, however, equated with quietness (niap), as seen in the boisterous cooling rituals of throwing water and w ashing the Buddhas during the Lao New Year, but with equanimity and self -control . The term thammada can refer both to natural phenomena, or to the quality of being ordinary, usual or medium. This is a desirable state; the weather should be thammada - ideally not extremely hot or cold and appropriate for the time of year. Likewise, a person should be thammada in their emotional state and actions; to self -regulate in order to not go to extremes.122 To be ba (mad) is to live in a way which is sivid bo pokkati or bo thammada, not 121 However, we should be wary of generalizing \"southeast Asian\" - for a nuanced account of differing modes of emotional expr ession in Indonesia, see Beatty 2019. 122 The use of this word also has a Buddhist meaning, with its origins in the Pali Dhammat, referring to conformity to the dhamma , meaning fitness, propriety; a general rule, higher law, cosmic law, general practice, regular phenomenon or usual habit. 297 normal, outside societal norms; symptoms include excessive smiling, laughing, sin ging or crying, talking very fast, not eating and sleeping and a preference towards being alone . The association with phi ba (madness from spirits) shows how contravening appropriate behaviour is commonly associated with vulnerability to external threats ( Chapter 4 and 5). Excess, whether in work, emotions or the elevation of personal attributes is to be avoided; a playful aphorism that thinking too much is l ikely to send one mad is often levi ed on those who demonstrate too much critical thought. In exploring the phenomen on of \"bright faces \" in Bali, in which people maintain a radiant smile even in a situation such as bereavement, Wikan (1990) has argued that this is not a 'mask ' in which the person does not experience emotion, but a due to a process of \"managing the heart \". This requires conscious effort on the part of the person to manage their emotional state so as not to suffer furth er from societal judgem ents. This \"emotion -work\" (Hochschild 1979) is described as a collective concern, rather than a personal choic e (Wikan 1989). In Laos, the ritual aids in this process, both in demonstrat ing how to enact a state of wellbeing which inc ludes emotional control , but also through hai kamlang chai , receiving the care and concern of others . From a psychological perspective, participation in the ritual provides a practical method for managing the emotional and mental strain of illness. Embodied metaphor Another psy chological approach to the ritual is through metaphor. Metaphor is, as Lakoff & Johnson (1980) have observed, simply the act of thinking of one thing in terms of another. It is commonly used in psychotherapy to understand a person's inner struggles through their use of imagery and dreams . In a broader sense, metaphor can be a way of interpreting a person's bodily symptoms as a reaction to their socio -political environment, such as in the case of 'nerves' (Low 1994). As Kirmayer (199 3) has argued, metaphor p lays a crucial role in healing ritual, in which the underlying myth of the ritual can be understood as an extended metaphor. Although this myth may be based on archetypal patterns, it is made particular through the local context - in this case, the loss of the khuan . Here, metaphor is more than a mental construct; it \"goes beyond analogy\", affecting the subject on a sensuous and emotive level to b ring about transformation, shifting the m from one state to another (Kirmayer 1993:175) . Metaphor is therefore gr ounded in bodily -felt experience which is, as Csordas (1993) has argued, mediated and shaped on a pre -reflexive level by cultural and social factors. 298 In exploring the idea of extended metaphor, the words of the ritual are of significance. In Lao healing ri tes, spoken words are attributed power. In contrast to the use of mantras and spells described in Chapter 5 , or the Pali -language rites used by monks, the soul -calling ceremony contains predominantly the form of ritual language that Tambiah (1968 b) identif ies as the \"second type \". In this form , the words are spoken out loud in a language which is comprehensible to those present . The messages within are meant to be transmitted to or understood by the celebrant or patient, placing them within a mythical -religious narrative (Tambiah 1968 b). The recitation by the mo phon includes both Lao and Pali language; but it is notable that the Lao parts may be adapted and improvised according to the particular place, person and situation . The effect of this is that the wo rds seem to be directed not only at the person for whom the rite is held, but to the entire gathering . In the present day, the recitation is often amplified by electronic means, making it even more clearly audible. The words tend to fluctuate between thos e which mention the person and their life, and those with an allegorical quality, describing the life of the khuan outside the person. In fact, the words of the text are primarily addressed to the khuan , rather than their human host. Over and over, the ref rain khuan eu n (soul s, come ) is heard. Both in the words of the text and in Lao people 's descriptions the khuan, although part of the person, are attributed agency. Their movements cannot always be explained; when I asked Po Nueang why the khuan went out o f the body, he answered that the reason was not explained in the tamla, texts . \"They just go \", he says . As in the case of the Luangan of Borneo, \"The soul is an essential part of a person, yet it also has an other, a spirit -like being, prone to an unruly s ociality, and to feelings of longing, desire and fear. Perceived both as a n animating principle and with an agency and subjectivity of its own, it is both singular and plural, immanent and transcendental, more a quality than a thing, which nevertheless may take material form as it is caught in ritual and returned to the patient\" (Hermanns 2017:257). The unruly nature of souls is expressed in the ritual language, suggesting the khuan can be distinctly flighty and unpredictable. They must therefore be called back gently and kindly, with promises and encouragement . Just as mantras mu st be spoken politely to encourage the correct body function ( Chapter 5 ), the khuan must not be spoken to in harsh terms. Pottier records the officiant's words thus: \"Oh souls, come ! Today is a favourable day, a perfect day, a good day! I invite you to enter, I invite you, oh souls, to reside in the flesh, in the body...so they are healed, oh souls! \" (Pottier 2008:493 , trans. E Elliott) . 299 The metaphor is very apparent here: in hearing w ords spoken kindly to the khuan , the person experiences a sense of compa ssion in the midst of their suffering, as well as shifting blame away from their individual actions. The felt sensation of losing khuan is a bodily metaphor for psychological distress, similar to the location of emotions within organs in Chinese medicine (Ots 1990). By attributing non -normative behaviour to the khuan, and encouraging them to behave correctly, the ritual is an acceptable way of gently encouraging the person, and the part icipants, to fulfil their social duties (Tambiah 1970) . In the case of ceremonies held for young children such as Noy, the participation of adults, particularly elders, helps to demonstrate appropriate behaviour . Social and familial obligations are certa inly a significant part of rural life. There is, for example, a commonly expressed expectation that the extended family will support members without criticism, even in cases of wrong -doing, such as in the case of Nueang 's son's arrest . This might also sug gest potential conflict with internal experiences of wellbeing, as in a recent network study of social capital and health (Kim et al. 2018). Contrary to expectations, Lao women with larger social networks reported poorer heal th; the authors hypothesised t hat due to the high cultural value placed on social harmony, knowing more people may actually cause relational burden and stress. In other words, the effort needed to fulfil one's social obligations and maintain the status qu o outweighed the benefits gain ed from such relationships. Pottier (2008) makes a strongly psychological analysis of the ritual words, suggesting that the khuan are described as unfaithful, inconsistent , impulsive, lazy, greedy, flirtatious and frivolous. He proposes that these charact eristics ascribed to the khuan can be interpreted as representations of suppressed desires in the person, and that the idea of wandering souls is a metaphor for the fragmented ego . When the person is overcome by a \"narcissistic urge \" which is outside socie tally sanctified behaviour, his souls become strangers to him, and leave the body (Pottier 2008:498) . By attributing such states to the khuan, who are given human - like characteristics, the person is able to objectify their feelings and thus find a practica l strategy for dealing with th eir behaviour. Although this explanation may be overly interpretive, I agree that the restoration of khuan can be understood as an embodied metaphor for societal expectations and the behaviours considered necessary for the cre ation of health. It touches perhaps on the tension in modern - day Laos of personal desires and aspirations which may conflict with traditional n otions of wellness (High 2006). If khuan can be a metaphor for suppressed desires, wanting material 300 wealth beyond one's means can cause them to flee . To desire too much , or to attempt to progress too rapidly is considered spiritually dangerous, as described in Chapter 5 . The behaviour of khuan, as it is described in the words of the ritual, has much to say about wellbeing in Laos. For the person to be well, the khuan must be well -manner ed, stay in close contact, and conform to societal norms. Khuan are adversely affected by change. The khuan have a connection with the person's home ; but if he embarks on a journey, hi s souls must be bound tightly to his body so that they follow him, rather than remaining in his pl ace of origin. Like people, the khuan exist in relationship with phi, who may take advantage of weakness . The khuan should not stray too far , and especially n ot to the wild places inhabited by phi. As Tambiah comments , \"...the spirit essence is thought of a s having gone to that part of the external world which is the very opposite of society and human habitation (village) - the forest, cave, mountain and river... In other words, the escape of the spirit essence from an individual is suggestive of the escape of a person from his village and community members\" (1970: 243). In the words of the ritual, the khuan must be called back from these places to return home: \"Come, kh uan, if you have hidden yourself in the jungle, come back today. Come , khuan, if you have gone to grow taro in the forest, return today. Come, kh uan, if it rains don't go any further; if it thunders don't go away too far. When the sun shines don't go in search of water near the buffalo's track...don't drink water near the elephants' track. Khuan, if you are conversing with your lover in the jungle, come back today. Khuan, if you have gone hunting deer in the jungle, come back today. Khuan, if you are away from your home, come back today. \" (words transcribed and translated by Tambiah 1970: 250) . As in the case of diseases that originate in the forest ( Chapter 4 ), and the location of dangerous magical forces (Chapter 5 ), calling the khuan highlights the tension between the wild and domesticated, in which the elevation of the mueang (town or district) or ban (village) as the idealised centre of society is contrasted with the untamed quality of the forest (Singh , 2010; Kleinod ; Hayashi , 2003 ). It demon strates the somewhat ambiguous relationship of villagers with the forest, which they may encounter daily as the site of things which are desirable (food, wood, profit), whilst simultaneously reproducing fears of its dangers (Davis 2 016). The description of the khuan 's flight to the forest also suggests a historical political meaning - the hierarchy between the centralized urban loci of power, and the progressively difficult to govern w ilderness at the periphery (Sprenger 2016 ; Tooker 1996) . In considering t he contemporary usage of the baci as a tool of state solidarity , 301 especially in interactions with ethnic minorities (Singh 2014), the metaphor of the khuan may thus have additional societal resonances. Pha khuan, ritual centrepiece 302 Tying strings, binding reciprocity At the heart of the ceremony is phuk or mad (to tie, bind, attach or wrap around). Long white threads are attached to the pha kh uan and are placed in the space between the thumb and forefinger both of the officiant(s) and those who are the focus of the ritual, effectivel y attaching them together, wh ilst blessings are given. In a larger baci ceremony, hundreds of people can be bound together in this manner, creating a complex train of strings. The participants may also be joined by holding onto the elbow of their neighbou r, making a bodily chain whic h mirrors the thread . The shorter white threads hanging from the top of the pha kh uan have been wound together and knotted three times (to represent the three refuges of Buddhism) during preparation for the ritual . At the close of the ceremony, after the khuan have been called back, these are tied around Noy's arms in order to help anchor her souls into her body and prevent them from escaping again . The wrists are said to be the point in the body where the khuan leave and enter (in the case of very young children , strings may also be tied around the ankles). Often the right wrist is tied first, followed by the left ;123 but as the band of white threads becomes thicker, those tying on newer strings will choose the w rist where there i s the most space. The strings, although made from simple cotton and these days not usually hand -spun, are elevated to great significance within the ritual for their ability to bring back the wandering khuan. Pottier (2008) record s the wo rds thus: \"The mar vellous and precious cotton has come from paradise , I turned the spinning wheel to spin a precious wool . Just one thread alone is worth as much as a scarlet ruby, just one thread is comparable to an emerald of the highest value . I tie the precious cotton t o the left wrist, in order that the souls return . I tie it to your right wrist, in order that your souls are faithful to you like the rice is to the ricefield...like the fish is the water .\" (words transcribed and translated by Pottier 2 008: 493 , trans lated from French by E Elliott , 2020 ). Again, in the intentional act of binding, metaphor is apparent . The strings are tied 'as if', creating a state in which those involved can visualise the return of the khuan and thus the establish ment of good health. The wr ists are also the point at which the beating of the pulse, and thus the life and vitality of the p erson, can best be felt (Heinze 1992). Sweeping the ends 123 Heinze (1998) attributes this to the idea that binding the right wrist encourages the khuan to come, and binding the left encourages it to stay, but I never he ard this explanation. 303 of the thread over this point , a vulnerable area both anatomically and spiritually, is to brush away bad luck (sia kho) (Pottier 2008) . The healer also blow s on the strings \u2014 as described in Chapter 5 this manifest s his embodied therapeutic power, and is felt by the person on their skin as a cool sensation . The act of tying is thus multi -sensorial; it i nvolves touching and being touched, and the visual and audio experience of the ceremony (Iida 2017 a). Whilst tying the string , the person will speak directly to the receiver, wishing them well, often looking directly into their eyes. Most commonly the phr ase yu di mi heng is said, an invocation for wellbeing, or sukhaphap kheng heng, strong health. The exhortation khuan eu n, khuan ma, khuan khao euy (souls come, souls come, souls enter !) is repeated both in the words of the ceremony and during the string -tying, inviting the souls to re -enter the person. The blessing may also be much more personalised, addressing a particular life situation such as marriage, or wishing the person prosperity and fortune in their endeavours. After this, the person tying the st ring will firmly rub the underside of the wrist at the point where the str ing is knotted, emphasising tactile contact . The receiver will then place their palms together at the chest or forehead in the gesture of a respectful nop. Where younger people or fo reigners take part and may not realise the order, an elderly person will a ssist by gently guiding their hands into this position . String -tying therefore establishes the active role of all attendees in the ritual \u2014 both in the initial phase of holding the string which links them, and in the later phase of tying the string around the wrist. Although the person(s) for whom the ritual is held receive the majority of wrist -binding, it is usually expanded to include everyone present as a broader expression of good wishes for all. They are participants rather than audience, expected to take an active part in proceedings and becoming literally bound together. Thus , the emphasis is not on the individual therapeutic relationship between officiant and patient, but the entire network of connections among those present. The words have signifi cance, but it is their performance in the context of tying strings which gives power. It is said that the strings should be kept on the wrist for at least three days following the ce remony, providing a material reminder of the blessings given by others, an d to ensure that the khuan are well -anchored in the body.124 124 In reality people usually cut off the strings before, as they tend to get dirty and are not practical to wear when farming etc. However, children and babies especially will be seen with strings around their wrists often for many weeks until they fall off. This may be related to the common saying \"three days a phi's child, four days a human child\" - that the baby is at the most risk of being taken by phi for the first three days after birth, in which case the strings are worn to protect them. 304 The person is thus bound \u2014 to their khuan, to others, and also to what is expected from them (Tambiah 1970). Bindin g as a way to stabilise the essence is not unique to lowland Laos \u2014 indeed, t he technique of tying knots and binding is also found across Southeast Asia. In the Philippines , the Ifugao tie a knot from grass or rice straws to guard against dangerous influences (R emme 2017). In Borneo, the Luangan tie strings to fix the mut able soul -essence to the body and protect against spirits (Herrmans 2017), as do the Akha in the northern Lao highlands, whose soul is very easily frightened (Ongaro 2019). The Minangkabau of Sum atra tie strings for women in childbirth to prevent soul loss (Frazer 2002 [1951 ]), and the practice of tying the wrists for those who attend a cremation to prevent the souls of the living from departing is found among the Shan of Myanmar and in Isan (Raja dhon 1962). Heinze (1992: 77) suggests that the practice of binding the wrists has a South Asian origin \u2014 stories are recorded in the Indian Ramayana and the Visnu Purana in which when spirits tormented the baby Krishna in his sleep, his father tied protec tive strings around his wrists. Tying strings is also common practice for Brahm ins who travel from house to house for kalana (the Sanskrit for 'urging, compelling, tying') (Heinze 1992 ). In mainland Southeast Asia, binding people, objects or places may also represent how virtuous Buddhist potency is used to exert control over the spirit world (Davis 2016) (see Chapter 5) . However, in Laos, from the perspective of creating health, t his process of mad or phuk khen \u2014 tying or binding the arm \u2014 is also a body technique that has become routinised for sustainment of he alth.125 Children learn how to do this at an early age, imitating adults, providing a particular social vehicle for recip rocal touch and interaction with others. It should be emphasised that string -tying does not occur only in a ceremonial context . It is also integrated within daily life, and people keep some already knotted strings in case an occasion arises \u2014 an activity which is part of the rural Lao person's habitus . The appearance of one's wrists knotted with strings signifies that some type of health -restoring, transitional, or merit -making activity has been undertaken \u2014 a sign of good or appropriate action s. At Pi Mai, the Lao New Year and water -splashing festival which takes place during April , a week - long celebration during the hottest and driest month of the year, there are both planned and spontaneous events on a daily basis. 125 Iida (2017 a) also observes this in Northern Thailand. 305 Grandmother Dai, who is 75 years old, walks around Phamuk village holding a small bag of multi -coloured strings, waiting to offer her well -wishes to anyone willing to receive them. As usual, despite the frailty of age, she seems full of vitality, drinking a glass of Beer Lao and waving her hands elegantly to the mo lam music as I sit with her in the shade of the lar ge fig tree that dominates the centre of the village. She puts her arm around me and hugs me tightly, telling me how happy she is that I'm there. We each select a stri ng and tie it in turn around the other's wrist, offering wishes for a long life, good hea lth and from her, that I might find a husband soon! It is a reciprocal expression of affection between two people including touching in an intimate manner in a society in which physical contact can be taboo.126 We talk about her children, some of whom now li ve in Australia; when they came to visit she felt sad that her grandchildren couldn't speak Lao and so she felt distant from them. Holding a baci ceremony for their arrival helped to streng then the family bond. The action of tying strings is mediated by, b ut not limited to, our previous relationship in which as is common in Laos she refers to me as luk (daughter) and I to her as mae thao (grandmother) .127 These f amilial terms point to the significance of the extended family which may include members not relat ed by blood, such as the habit of 'lending' or 'adopting' children when it is mutually beneficial . However, it is notable that in this context of New Year bl essings, anyone who was present would also be included; just as those who are eating will always c all out kin khao (come and eat) to all passers -by, regardless of their connection, creating a shared materiality. Therefore, tying strings both sustains and c reates intimate relationships. If mothers have to leave their baby in the care of another, they wi ll tie strings around the baby's wrist to bind their souls together, and ensure that they will not cry or suffer in her absence (see Radjadon 1962: 134). The reciprocal aspects are also demonstrated in the phuk khen ritual for Noy, the young girl in Phamuk village, in which a significant amount of money is tied into the strings. This is most commonly seen in rituals held for young children or b abies, or, during the marriage ceremony ( D. Wharton, pers . communication 2020 ). Although not explicitly given as a contribution towards care, this money perhaps acts as a form of health insurance . The costs involved in holding the ritual vary - in a rural context it may range from 200,000 kip [$25] to 1 million kip [$120], depending on its size. In the medium -size ritu al held for Noy, this 126 Similarly to many Asian societies, public displays of tactile affection are acceptable with another of the same gender, but not between different genders, although this is gradually shifting. 127 It should be noted though that the use of kinship terms (father, mother, sister, brother etc.) does not necessarily imply any relationship, as they are are also used as pronouns - indeed, calling another, for example ai (older brother) if you don't know their name actually places them at a greater social distance. 306 cost would have been more than covered by generous donations from neighbours, including more valuable denominations suc h as Thai baht which show the social status of the giver. In the same way as a donation to the temple is never anon ymous (the monks will usually read out the exact amount given by each person at the end of a ceremony), giving specific amounts is noted for future reference . The phrase khoi suay chao (I help you ) is used as a metaphor for financial aid, implying that rec iprocity is expected at a later date. The inclusion of money also represents a blessing for wealth and the circulation of sociality. Here, again, the ritual mirrors life; as Scheifflelin observes i n an ethnography of the Gisaro ritual in Papau New Guinea, \"If...social life takes much of its form through processes of reciprocity, it is not surprising that reciprocity should be celebrated by ceremonies that express human concerns in deeply moving ways\" (Scheifflelin 1976:28). In the previous chapter, I explore d how acts of reciprocity were present within people 's interactions with the healers as part of the process of seeking care. This may also take the form of string -tying, through an expression of ap preciation in which previous patients return to tie money o nto the healer's wrists, receiving a blessing in return. I also showed how the experience of illness causes the reliance on extended family networks for financial support. Here, I demonstrate how, in the wider context of creating health, the soul -calling r itual can be the medium through which networks of care are brought into being. 307 A string -tying ritual for a family conducted by Po Nueang 308 Grandmother Dai tying strings and dancing at Lao New Year My wrist after taking part in a su khuan 309 Conclusion The soul -calling ceremony is an important part of the landscape of healing, both in assisting recovery from illness and in demonstrat ing what it means to be well. The loss of the khuan and restoration through ritual can be interpreted on various levels; as a method of helping the sick person to cope psychologically, as a metaphor for societal expectations , and as a means through which t hey can experience car e. The wellbeing of an individual is strongly dependent on th e ability and willingness of others to respond to their needs . Social wellbeing is thus both enacted and generated during the act of tying strings. Fundamentally, it emphasi ses that the pursuit of good health in Laos does not occur only through the individ ual act of seeking healthcare, but necessitates attention to the person's spiritual state as well as the broader involvement o f their familial and social networks. Furtherm ore, it shows how the healers utilise multiple methods to assist in their patients' recovery. In describing the both the use of rituals in the present day, and notions of health which emphasise social and political conformity, I have also shown ho w wellbei ng is not independent of state influence. This is continued in the following chapter which explores the political landscape and the interaction between traditional practices and governmentality. 310 Chapter 8: Innovation and Integration Introduction In Laos, I have demonstrated that traditional medicine practices are both syncretic and localised , drawing from its geographic, historical and religious context. In the far south , I also have shown that the province of Champasak's outward -looking and peripher al location locates heterogenous local medical practices in relation to neighbouring countries . The medicine I have described is thus 'traditional medicine of the place ' (ya phuen mueang) , rather than a national medicine. However, the constraints within w hich medical practices operate are determined by the political context. In defining what makes medicine 'Lao', it is also necessary to consider the impact of the state , development and national values . In this chapter, I move the analytical lens outwards to discuss the political situation within which traditional medicine in Laos operates. I examine which factors and issues influenc e past and future developments . Why does traditional medicine apparently have a high socio - political value, and yet little ded icated state effort to preserve it? Is an integr ated healthcare system possible, and if so, what would be the effect on traditional medicine in its current form? Using the perspectives both of the rural healers and staff working within the state health system, I explore traditional medicine in the past and present context of governmentality . I argue that Laos is a distinct case in comparison to neighbouring countries . A national or re - invented medicine was never created as there was no strong colonial medi cal system to resist, and little suppression during political changes . In the present day, traditional healers in Laos work separately and in parallel to the formal heal th system. However, their practices do not exist in isolation; during their lifetimes t here have been a series of interactions with governmentality , especially during the revolutionary period. Moves towards healthcare integration have therefore remained pr imarily at a localised level. In Champasak province, I show that the popularity of trad itional medicine is partially dependent on selective policy implementation by local officials and health staff who may have a more positive view than in centrali sed institutions . 311 In the present day, especially in the context of declining rural practices , there are continuing efforts to promote integrated medicine policy and create a new generation of practitioners. Due to the lack of state support, information disseminati on, and human resources, this is very challenging. Seeking outside assistance, especial ly from China, is thus deemed necessary . However, while this may ensure the continuation of traditional medicine practice in Laos, it further challenges the concept of a 'Lao' medicine as it affects the form in which it is taught and practised. The creatio n of 'scientific ' medicine is desired in the education of a future generation of practitioners, but this is heavily relia nt on external input. The future of medicinal plant conservation is also dependent on political ties and state regulation. This chapter , in reflecting on the broader picture of health policy and traditional medicine in Laos, also widens the landscape of in formants . It draw s on data collected between 2013 - 2020, from discussions and interviews with representatives of the Institute of Trad itional Medicine, the Faculty of Pharmacy, the National Institute of Public Health, the World Health Organization in Vien tiane, Champasak Regional Hospital, and Munlapamok and Bajiang district hospitals, as well as a number of non -Lao health researchers. I t includes data from a survey and discussions with students taking traditional medicine modules in Pakse and Vientiane. A dditionally, it includes the healers' perspectives and ethnographic data gathered from Munlapamok and Bajiang districts. Due to the mor e sensitive political nature of this chapter, and the fact that the majority of the in terlocuters held government positio ns, I have not used their names, referring to them instead by generalised job titles. It should also be noted that as many of the inter views for this chapter were conducted in English language (unlike other chapters in which quotes are translated from Lao) , I have quoted them verbatim. Historical intersections with the state First, some historical context. Constructing the political hist ory of traditional medicine in Laos is a difficult task due to the lack of available data, and not one that I will attemp t in detail here . When speaking of social and historical research on traditional medicines in Asia, the term \"re-invented tradition \" is commonly used . Popularised by Hobsbawm & Ranger (1983) , it argues that much of what we consider to be rooted in history is in fact a recent invention , often created through a process of formali sation and rituali zation in order to serve the nation -state. This, as Benedict Anderson (1983) famously asserted, can be understood as \"an imagined political community\" which citizen s feel they are part of because of a shared 312 identity . National medicines are thus paradoxically termed 'traditional' and representative of national identity whilst also attempting to become and be portrayed as modern, scientific, and systematic. This analysis has commonly been applied in revolutionary nations such as China, where, as Taylor (2005) and others have argued, Mao oversaw the c reation of a low -tech and inexpensive national medicine system . In Vietnam (as in China), medical collaboration between Western trained physicians and traditional medicine practitioners was seen as crucial in the process of creating a socialist state (Thom pson 2003: 130) . In fact, the revival of traditional medicine can be interpreted in the light of attempt s to mode rnise, industrialise and commercialise (Monnais et al. 2011 ). In countries which were part of French Indochina such as Cambodia and Vietnam, it has been argued that this revival occurred as a reaction against colonial power (Trankell & Oveson 2010; Wahlberg 2006). Likewise , in Myanmar, the aftermath of independence from the British prompted new integrated medicine policies from the 1950s onwards as part of nation -building rhetoric (Coderey 2020). In Thailand, in recent years traditional medici ne practices have been heavily regulated and commercially marketed as being representative of Thai culture (Iida 201 7b; Salguero 2017 b). In comparison, Sweet (2015) records the sparse interactions of traditional medicine with the Lao state since the French colonial era (1893 -1953). During the early part of the twentieth century , whilst the colonial authorities made plans to standardise and institutionalise bio medical health care, little attention was given to traditional medicine , whether local or imp orted. The description of traditional medicine cited in the introduction by Spire (1907) emphasises the colonial view that traditional medicine was composed of a fragmented mixture of practices without the potential to be understood as a viable system of healthcare . Whilst traditional medicine in various forms continued to provide much of the nation's care, it stayed on the periphery of the colonial health system: \"[Traditional medicine] remained in the informal sphere, unregulated and unlicensed by the col onial authorities. Colonial records provide little if any evidence of formal cooperation between imported biomedicine and local traditional medicine, or even Sino -Vietnamese medical services which existed in the major towns \" (Sweet 2015: 78 -79). As in other parts of French Indochina, the introduction of biomedicine can be understood as part of a larger programme to expand the influence of western colonial science ( Au 2011) . However, healthcare development in Laos lagged beh ind it neighbours, and influence was less marked than in Vietnam or Cambodia , without evidence of particular suppression of 313 traditional medicine practices. It appears that in Laos biomedicine rema ined more of a symbolic \"tool of empire \" than penetrating ve ry deeply (Sweet 2015: 70). I t is notable that in Thailand, which was never colonised by Europeans, the priority given to biomedicine still led to laws in the 1920s and 30s banning the majority of traditional practices within the health system . It was not until the 1970s that traditional medicine regained political favour (Salguero 2016 ). In comparison , there is no record of the French administration prohibiting the use of traditional medicine prac tices in Laos, even if such practices were not encouraged. This attitude of benign neglect persisted through the period of the RLG and NLHX (1947 - 75). In a mainly rural and sparsely populated society, in which biomedical resources were centralised, the maj ority of Lao residents continued to rely on the work of trad itional healers without incorporating many aspects of biomedicine (Sweet 2015:114). From the mid -1960s onwards, traditional medicine began to appear in official health policy, and in the Liberate d Zone, the inclusion of traditional medicine practitioners in the official health sector increased the number of health workers. In 1973, the NLHX health force had 134 traditional medicine practitioners, in comparison to only 196 medical doctors of variou s levels (Sweet 2015: 163, 174, 178). Especially in the far northeastern areas of Phongsaly and Houaphan, herbal medicine use was widespread ( WPRO 2013 :17). Where the Pathet Lao were hiding in caves during the conflict there are even accounts of traditiona l medicine being produced in 'factories ' in these c aves, which was then distribute d to hospitals at a subsidised cost ( K. Sydara pers . communication 2018 ). The association between traditional medicine and the military is still reflected in th e present -day status of herbal medicine manufacturing, which predominantly takes place within the military factory ( Factory number 2) and access is thus restricted.128 As Wahlberg (2014: 3) argues of Vietnam, the close ally of the new Lao PDR state, traditi onal medicine h ad amassed considerable symbolic capital due to the positive associations in supporting the military, and as part of efforts to build a new socialist nation.129 After liberation in 1975, the formalisation of traditional medicine and its integ ration with biom edicine became one of the priorities of the new government of the Lao PDR, following socialist policy in China, Vietnam and Cambodia (Sweet 2015: 195) . As Sweet (2015: 196) records, only the herbal aspects of traditional medicine were to be incorporated in to the government -managed health system , and opinions within the service were still divided as to 128 I was not granted permission to visit this factory. 129 Indeed, in 1994, the Vietnamese army published a book named \"Wild Edible Vegetables of Vietnam\" which included information on how \"to prev ent and treat variou s medical problems with the sources available to them in the wild\" (Thompson 2003: 115). 314 the merits of this policy, with some condemning it as \"superstition\". In 1976, the Institute of Traditional Medicine (ITM) was created , later changing its nam e to the Traditional Medicine Research Centre and then reverting back to Institute, governed by the Food and Drug department, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health. As suggested in its name (s), the p rimary aim of the Institute has been the identific ation, cataloguing and ethnobotanical study of medicinal plants (Sydara et al. 2005). Other facilities include a small laboratory for phytochemistry, a production unit for herbal medicines and a medicinal p lant garden in the ITM grounds and a larger one on the outskirts of Vientiane . They contribut e to training courses and the promotion of traditional medicine in conjunction with other ASEAN countries. The ITM also oversees a network of field centres (one in almost every province) , mostly acting as a place for the cultivation of medicinal plants (Elkington et al. 2009). Under the new Lao PDR government, there were also plans to establish traditional medicine hospitals in every province . By 1979, ten traditional medicine hospitals nationwide were listed in a government document, although it is unclear how extensive these facilities were (Sweet 2015:196) .130 The same document also stated that each district had between 5 -10 traditional medicine practition ers in government employment. As Sweet (2015: 194) comments, most appeared to be village healers who had been drafted into the official health sector, perhaps in order to increase staff numbers . Training initiatives, as recorded by WHO, apparently included sessions of 3 -5 days for a total of 520 people from all pro vinces, including young healers, herbalists, village heath volunteers and the heads of provincial traditional medicine stations (WPRO 2013 ). WHO documents from this time also state that traditiona l medicine began to be incorporated into the medical curricu lum ( WPRO 1976 a) and that in the 1976 -80 five -year plan, a key component was \"to encourage research on the value of traditional medicine, and, whenever possible, to incorporate it in the health se rvice \" (WPRO 1976 a:10). Traditional medicine was extolled a s a low -cost and self -reliant healthcare modality, as it was not reliant on imported ingredients . But, like other health policies, lack of infrastructure meant that integrated medicine remained mo stly in the \"realm of theory...with grand rhetoric but little follow -through\" ( Sweet 2015: 229). In contrast to the extensive network of hospitals and practitioners that appeared in China and Vietnam, deemed by WHO to now have the \"most integrated\" medical s ystems in the world (Wahlberg 2014: 7), the Lao PDR 130 The original document, cited by Sweet (2015: 196) is \"LNAD, Lao PDR/MOH, 23 for Comrade Souk Vongsak, Central Committe e member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, Minister of Health, for the First National Health Conference for 4 years (1976 -1979).\" 315 state wa s not able to bring this vision into reality. Whilst the drafting of a new national policy in the 1990s appeared to bring traditional medicines back into focus ( MoH 1996 ), economic reforms also prompted the rejection of much of the health policy instigated under socialism. As Stuart -Fox (1997:193) records, government stock -taking from this time showed that whilst the number of medical personnel had increased, the quality of training and serv ices had decreased. Thus, because traditional medicine had not beco me a formal system as in neighbouring socialist nations, staff working in this area were gradually lost, or continued to occupy a low professional role, often in more remote districts (Swee t 2015). Furthermore, this inclusion of healers in government heal thcare appears to be mostly short -lived. After economic reforms beginning in 1986 ,131 government staff began to be compensated according to their educational level, meaning that the healers' salaries were effectively slashed as many had not even completed pr imary school. This led to many leaving the health service after 1986 and returning to work at home - or, in some cases, setting up cooperatives, especially in urban areas such as Vientiane (K. Sydara pers . communication 2016 ). So, can it be said that trad itional medicine was ever really integrated into the state health system? Pottier (1979: 17 8-180) describe s the use of traditional medicine in a district of Vientiane from 197 3 - 78 as part of a public health study. He record ed 35 herbalists in action, and 14 Buddhist monks practising medicine, as well as a number of exorcists, spirit doctors and astrologers, but found no evidence of any working within the government health service . Inst ead, he remar ks that the number of village -based practitioners far outs tripped those in the formal health sector , painting a picture quite contradictory to official documents. In Champasak province, the healers I interviewed were all between the ages of 50 - 99, with an average age of 69, meaning that most would have been wor king during the revolutionary period. However, of 35, only three reported that they had or were presently working in local hospitals, including Simon who currently manage s the garden and harvest s medicines for the TM department of Champasak regional hospit al. Furthermore, according to descriptions from the healers and health staff, the presence of traditional medicine in 131 The New Economic Mechanism was announced in 1986, and was gradually implemented during the second half of the decade. In the health sector, as well as changes in the pay structure, this meant \"significant diversification in the international development agencies supporting the heal th sector, the increased localisation of health -related professional education and training , and a range of policies, regulations and legislation which formalised the partial privatisation of healthcare services\" (Sweet 2015:231). 316 (especially district ) hospitals did not result in medical practice which could be described as integrated. The healers occup ied a separate building or room, and continue d to offer medicines based on fresh plant products just as they would at home . People came to them primarily of their own volition, rather than being referred. The only substantial difference was that they received a small mo nthly stipend from the governmen t, including payment in cash, rice, cloth and other material goods. According to the ITM, at this time the healers did not in reality receive any medical training - more recently, there have been attempts to set up training courses based on ASEAN principle s of plant use, as an attempt to standardise knowledge. A booklet entitled \"Training Package for Traditional Healers\" from 1999 describes basic principles of hygiene and primary healthcare, with a few pointers at the end describing how to make plants and d ry herbarium samples. At the time of writing , there are small departments offering traditional medicine, mostly in the form of acupuncture, manufactured pills, or simply giving patients a prescription to make their own medi cine, in three hospitals in Vien tiane capital (Mahasot, Mitt and Oudomxay) (B. Dongdeuane pers. 2020). I found it difficult however to di scover whether there had really ever been a traditional medicine hospital open in Vientiane, receiving multiple different answers, even from the same people. I heard that there was one that opened in 1995, functioning until the director died; or that, one was in existence from 2000 -2011 , offering primarily Chinese techniques such as acupuncture, and later became a cancer centre. One account said that as it was based in a rather attractive historical building, it was appropriated by a high -ranking official a s his home (K. Sweet, pers. comm unication 201 3). However, i nteractions between traditional medicine and the state may take more nuanced forms. Whilst Nueang and Vilaysack both operate outside the health system and have n ever practised TM in a hospital setting, this does not mean that they have always worked in isolation. Before he studied to be a healer, P o Nueang joined the military in the 1960s o r perhaps 70s, where he was trained in basic healthcare and acted as a soldier's physician . I never asked what military side he was on, as this would have been a rather sensitive question, but his future village role suggest s it was the NLHX rather than RLG. He treated injured soldiers, giving injections for 'strength' , and quinine for malaria , which he says worke d better than medicine th ey have now. 317 Although he has never practised traditional medicine within the formal health sector, Po Nueang still maintains a keen interest in biomedical ideas . He uses techniques he learnt in the military , including some massag e and manipulation methods, and relis hes the chance to visit the hospital to discuss cases or offer advice to the young doctors , which is received with a mixture of mild irritation and respect. When he suffers with his own health, or his wife 's, he prefers to co nsult a private clinic in Pakse and to take Western medicine - there are few healers that he trusts to treat him. During the 1980s he also began to work in a local government office , after gaining a 'certificate' . He still occupies an honorary role i n the local administration, and is considered influential in settling disputes in the village as well as his role in caring for people. In Nonxay village, Vilaysack is the village head, and is frequently called to take part in meetings and projects which occupy his time. Whilst he has never formally studied any medical courses, he taught himself anatomy and physiology from a textbook given by a Canadian visitor and has a remarkable ability to provide anatomically accurate drawings, as shown by his depictio n of t he internal organs and heart pathologies below. A believer in an integrated medical approach, he plans that when his youngest daughter finishes medical school , she will study traditional medicine with him in order to have \"complete knowledge\". Howeve r, on my last visit in 2019, she had returned home after 3 years of study, lacking sufficient funds to continue, and was helping her mother and brothers on their coffee farm. She tells me that studying was quite difficult as she had to learn to speak Vietn amese, and the names of medicines are in French or English, neither of which she speaks. She says that traditional medicine is much more developed in Vietnam, as it's manufactured and used in hospitals. Integration, if it can be said to have occurred at all, thus remains primarily on a local or even personal level . In Champasak provincial hospital, TM department director Dr. Outhai is another example of this . Born in 1953, he is a similar age to many of the healers, and his father who died at the age of 90 also used plants for healthcare, which he began to learn about at a young age . His medical education, beginning in 1976 in Pakse in the period immediately after the revolution , prepared him for providing basic healthcare provision under the new regim e. He says that when he worked in the hospital during this time, he \"did everything\" - there were only 5 doctors working there. During the 1970s, he also studied herbal medicines with 'Dr. Tan', a Vietnamese and French -educated doctor . He says that there w ere 50 people in his class , and shows me a notebook he kept from this time, with 318 details of the use of various plants and animal products - including some remedies composed of gecko and human placenta . He later studied for a medical degree in Vientiane fro m 1997 - 2003 and then worked on the TB ward in Champasak hospital, but was eventually able to move to the TM department in 2005, his true passion. He has maintain ed a lifelong interest in using plants, and after retiring in 2017, he continues to grow and manufact ure simple herbal medicines at his house , where he lives with two children and four grandchildren . Before he retires in 2016, he writes down his life's work , a mixture of formulae collected from healers and his own experience. It's written in barely legib le handwriting on the back of old type -written documents and stapled together in three books totalling about 100 pages , which we pay the photocopy shop owner to type for him. At the end of many visits to the print shop to check on their progress and correc t mistakes, we finally produce a printed booklet. We return to ceremoniously distribute copies to the local health authorities and healers, although I'm not sure whether it will ever be used. However, on another visit about 18 months later, I find one of t he pharmacy students sitting in the office of the traditional medicine department, carefully copying down some of the descriptions. On the same trip, back in Phamuk village, I go to visit a man who is sick at home with fever and weakness in his legs, lying on an outside bed being tended to by his wife. Much to my surprise, I note the book on the shelf above his head, left there by Nueang . Grandfather Pon , who is related to the man, and has stopped by on his bicycle, picks it up and leafs through it, remarki ng enthusiastically on the contents and offering his own suggestions. Institutionalised and local knowledge forms are thus more fluid and interchangeabl e than they first appear. The relative hierarchy between hospital staff and healers is, as shown in Chap ter 3, dependent on the capacity for knowledge exchange and respect for the other's level of skill. Pharmacist Phaiboun, despite his university educatio n, often asks Vilaysack for advice, or sends him patients that he knows he cannot cure. When we visit th e healers together, Dr. Outhai delights in asking endless questions, and carefully records all of their herbal prescriptions. Despite his official status, he appears more at home in these moments than in formal situations, acting as a bridge between differ ent realms . He enthusiastically exchange s ideas, offer s suggestions, collect s prescriptions and share s jokes, with an ability to keep up conversation in his rapid Champasak dialect for hours at a time, squatting on the ground or sitting cross -legged in the back of the hospital truck. 319 Observers of the ITM's system suggest there is little conflict between th ose representing state medicine and the healers, and that traditional medicine in Laos is no t 'hidden ', but open and well -articulated (Riley 2000) . On the surface , especially regarding herbal medicine practices in lowland areas this is true , although rules regarding secret knowledge remain (Chapter 5 ). It is also noticeable that, despite official bans on using written minority languages (Pholsena 2006) , the ITM encourages ethnobotanical documentation with diverse ethnic groups, in comparison to the political emphasis on mainstream Buddhist medic al practices in Myanmar and elsewhere (Coderey 2020). Indeed, as I will show in the following section , those inv olved in traditional medicine at all levels suffer from a shared sense of marginali sation within government health structures. Although past and current policies officially support the inclusion and promotion of traditional medicine, this is far from the reality of practice. 320 Vilaysack's drawing of heart pathologies and internal organs from our 'lessons' With Phaiboun, Dr. Outhai and his book of herbal prescriptions at CRH TM department 321 Pages from Dr. Outhai's exercise book showing his study of traditional medicine from the 1970s, including notes in Vietnamese and recipes for gecko and human placenta 322 Policy and reality Traditional medicine occupies an ambiguous role in global health policy. In a shift towards the promotion of primary universal healthcare, and in tandem with China's re -admission as a member state (Kadetz 2012 ), in 1978 the WHO issued a declaration support ing the use of traditional medicine worldwide (WHO 1978 ). This has been associated with changing political attitudes towards traditional medicine in nation states such as Thailand (Akarasereenont et al. 2015) , and occurred soon after the new Lao PDR government had officially legislated for an integrated health system. Current traditional medicine strategy in global health strongly emphasises the need for \" appropriate integration, regulation and supervision \" of traditional medici nes ( WPRO 2013 : 7). The ASEAN member states took the decision to officially implement the WHO TM strategy in 2004 . This was partly motivated by the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98, and the desire to reduc e the cost of imported drugs and improve healthcare access by impacting especially primary healthcare systems (Akarasereenont et al. 2015 ). The Traditional Medicines and Health Supplements Product Working Group (TMHSPWG) was established , and five of the me mber states were assigned five key actions . According to the objectives of the WHO Regional Strategy for Traditional Medicine in the Western Pacific (2011 -2020 ), priorities include the promotion of traditional medicine within national health systems, incre asing access to \" safe and effective\" traditional medicines, improving the protection and sustainable use of traditional medicines, and strengthen ing cooperation in generating and sharing traditional medicine knowledge and skills (WPRO 2012 : vii) . Lao PDR was not assigned a specific role in this ASEAN programme, although its participation is gro wing. However, statements about traditional medicine policy and use in Laos tend to be somewhat conflicting, and lack data. A \"Decree on Medicinal Natural Resources\" was issued in 2006, but this has led to rather ambitious claims that Laos has effectively established \" regulations on traditional medicines covering manufacturing, import, export, registration, selling and biodiversity management \" (WPRO 2017 : 4). These claims contradict both the objectives of current traditional medicine policy, which include the implementation of herbal medicine regulation ( MoH 2013), and the viewpoints expressed by Lao staff and practitioners. They appear to ignore the fact that, even if this is true, it applies only to a small portion of herbal medicine practices. Indeed, repeated conversations with past and present directors of the ITM confirmed that in practice no regulatory system existed, other than for manufacture within large facto ries register ed with 323 the Food and Drug department, or for export within ASEAN, in which claims of medical efficacy must be based on scientific evidence or history of use. Quality control, as the report admits, is challeng ing, due to \"limited technical capa city and lack of testing standards \" (WPRO 2017 :5).132 Another report mentions that : \"Revised National Medicine Policy, based on an earlier decree in 1995 is at the implementation stage. The Policy defines the role of traditional medicine in national health care delivery systems and provides a basis for promoting the rational use of traditional medicine \" (WPRO 2012 : 51) . However, on further examination this assertion turned out to be based more on aspiration than reality. \"It was just a policy , with no strate gy - actually I don't even know what happened to the document\" an ITM staff member told m e, rifling through his cupboards to no avail. Likewise, claims that there are 18,226 rural traditional health practitioners in action providing healthcare for 80% of the population (WPRO 2013 ) as well as services provided in central hospitals and provincial centres ( WPRO 2017 ) were shown to be highly exaggerated by my field data . The loss of tr aditional healers in the current day is particularly profound. Although my d ata showed a proportionally high level of traditional medicine use in fieldsite s (see Chapter 2 ), this was likely influenced by the presence of a still living and reputed healer. D uring research in other areas of Laos , much lower levels of use were found where there was no living healer in the village (Bourdy et al. in press). The field stations of the ITM were focused primarily on maintaining medicinal plant gardens, and even withi n the ITM headquarters today there are no treatment facilities. Initiatives such as the creation of medicinal gardens in health centres tend to happen on a localised level, driven by the enthusiasm of particular health staff such as Dr. Outhai, rather than following any central directive. A review of current traditional medicine s trategic plans demonstrates similarly optimistic thinking. The 2012 - 2015 National Strategy on Traditional Medicine require s a budget of 1.5 million USD for implementation, and include s a wide range of activities including the establishment of traditional medicine units within hospitals, provid ing training and kits on traditional medicine, conservation programmes for medicinal plants and the establishment 132 For an example of the e ffect of regulating pharmaceutical practices on the work of traditional practitioners, see Blaikie's (2013) discussion of how Tibetan medicine in Ladakh, India is \"expressed, maintained, and transformed\" through changes in manufacturing. 324 of scientific research programmes. Again, it is difficult to find evidence that much of this happened. As one of the ITM staff members commented, th ere is nothing new about the idea of integrated medicine. \"That was the plan since 1970 \u2014 our president has talked about this, but in practice nobody understands how to do it, how to work with who! We had some integrated medicine in the past, a long time ago, but not now. Everybody talks about cooperation, about harmonisation, but where is the work together to m ake this? \" Staff member s from the F oP commented that, whilst integrated medicine had been government policy for a long time, it was difficult to encourage its use in mainstream health services. Questions as to why integrated medicine had never really been achieved in practice produced an uncomfortable silence. \"Doctors don't trust traditional medicine, t hey don't think it's safe.\" \"Even if pharmacists produce medicine, who will use it?\" \"We don't have traditional medicine practitioners inside hospitals - only Western medicine. We could have it, like they do in foreign countries, like Cambodia and Vietna m.\" However, staff in Vientiane point to Champasak province as a place where traditional medicine is more popular among doctors. In Pakse , the CRH director is enthusiastic about traditional medicine, and tells me that he would like to pursue an integrated medicine strategy. At least once a year, the hospital staff take part in a 'planting day' in which medicinal plants are transplanted around th e hospital grounds. The 2016 - 2020 plan for their traditional medicine department appears more modest and achiev able in comparison to national plans. It specifically mentions an annual acupuncture training, purchasing new equipment for making herbal medicine, creating posters and broch ures to advertise their work, and disseminating information to local hospitals. A list of equipment needed to make a fence for the medicinal plant preserve just outside Pakse is itemised. They have plans to invite the healers to the department for training on medicine production standards according to new ASEAN rules. But even these ob jectives, as Phaiboun admits, are difficult to put into practice. The herbal medicine secti on, which is under the Food and Drug department, receives very little hospital funding and is expected to generate revenue through the sale of herbal medicines. My fieldnotes from September 2016 detail the following: Dr. Outhai, Phaiboun and the other staff are having a meeting to determine how much profit the department has made in the last month, as they need to fill in a sheet of statistics for the 325 whole hospital. Phaiboun totals about 1 million kip [$120] altogether - but all of thi s money has been spent on buying materials, petrol, fixing the hospital truck and so on (they ask me for 500,000 kip towards fixing the brakes - they will pay the other 400,000 out of the budget from the TM centre). They seem to be expected to function as a self -sustaining unit - Dr. Outhai told me that he paid for the capsule -making machine himself, so he will take it home when he finally retires. The depiction of formali sed tradition al medicine in Laos found in official documents, and the lived experienc es articulated by practitioners are thus apposite. However, this type of contradiction is normali sed in interactions with the state - it seems that people have the capacity to adhere t o different variants of a story , depending on who is asking, and why. An often stark disjuncture between policy and reality has been observed by commentators of the Lao PDR state (Evans 1998; Pholsena 2006; Stuart -Fox 1997). As Singh (2012) observes, the implementation of polic y is often subjective. \"Policy is negotiable for those in positions of authority. Governance is not rule -driven but rather socialized, personalized, a nd localized \" (Singh , 2012: 8). Therefore, the promotion of marginali sed and under -resourced sectors such as traditional medicine is primarily dependent on local factors, perhaps explaining t he uneven development of services across the country. Scientific medicine Integration of traditional medicine into the Lao PDR sta te health system therefore exists in policy, if barely in practice. But whose and what traditional medicine is this? Official documents agree that traditional medicine should be \"f ormali sed\" through a process of integration into national healthcare services ( WPRO 2017 ), bu t this appears to be a reversed approach. Before reaching the stage of integration, health staff pointed out, there first needs to be a well -defined medicine to in tegrate. As Kadetz comments, \"[It is] imperative to differentiate not only how and where integration is occurring, but also... which practices and practitioners are being integrated \" (Kadetz , 2012: 292). In WHO's 1978 declaration, practices which are \"useful\" and resources which are \"possible\" were to be integrated (Mahler 1983: 7). Preferences for c ertain practices and the rejection of others shape the form in which traditional medicine is defined within health system s, and the level of benefit which may be gained, or not, by practitioners. Sources of h ealth care financing are also significant . For ex ample, in the roll -out of the new universal health care 326 policy in Champasak hospital from 2017 , acupuncture is included, making care easier and more affordable for patients , but herbal medicine is not. Decisions in healthcare policy which advocate the use o f some practice s over others are based on an assessment of what is scientifically valid , in theory at least . Indeed, anthropologists have long been critical of medical integration as being biased towards the \"structurally dominant scientific paradigm\" of b iomedical assessment (Janes 1999: 3). Studies of 're- invented' traditional medicines in China, Vietnam and elsewhere have emphasised the incorporation of socialist science in the creation of national and integrated medical systems (Taylor 2007). In Vietnam , traditional medicines have , \"...in recent times come to be appropriated as an object of expert scientific knowledge\" (Wahlb erg 2006:128). China, in particular, presents a rather bewildering quantity of studies in order to demonstrate the efficacy of its medical system. Much of this has occurred in response to the influx of biomedicine and the need to define traditional medicine in terms whic h make it equal to and able to resist 'colonisation' by western science which might have rendered it obsolete. As Wahlberg (2014) points out, in Vietnam, moves towards traditional medicine becoming scientific have actually been painted in diametric opposi tion to coloni alism , as a means of assisting national public health in the socialist era. In the past 15 years, ASE AN policy has pushed for the creation of scientific evidence supporting the integration of herbal medicines into the healthcare system, which has been differently applied in member states. Thailand, for example, has gradually shifted from single -plant stud ies towards full clinical trials ( Akarasereenont et al. 2015 ). In Laos, where biomedical development has been more haphazard, traditional medicine has not had the same level of interaction with science as in neighbouring countries. Stuart -Fox (1997:194) ar gues that, by the mid -1980s, the plan to implement the \"three revolutions\" - including science and technology as w ell as production and ideology - had been mostly unsuccessful. Sweet (2015: 194) records attempts to educate healers in \"socialist science\", arguing this did not result in any broad meaningful change - although, as I show, some individuals such as Nueang and Vilaysack have incorporated ideals of vitanyasat (scien tific knowledge ) into their practice. \"We are scientific now\" the head of the NIOPH ethics committee told me, mentioning the need for more research into traditional medicine use. Despite statements like this, the level of scientific training and development in Laos remains very low . Although the idea of traditional medicine becoming scie ntific is agreed to be 327 desirable, it is unclear how this can be achieved in action. Staff from the F oP, although allowed little time outside their teaching and administrative duties, express the belief that better validation of their work through research will bring results. They have a passion for their work but are aware of its practical limitations, a mindset common to those involved in traditional medicine in Laos. From their perspective, Laos lack s the development of its neighbours, and scientific vali dation of traditional m edicine practices, which affect s the willingness or likelihood of its use by medical professionals .133 \"People are very interested about research into traditional medicine, especially teachers in the university. Now people say that wes tern medicines cannot treat some diseases, like cancer, but see that some herbal medicine s can kill cancer. Lao traditional medicine became much more popular recently, especially among older people, because people think it has less side effects. In Laos, t here are many trees, in the mountains, but we don't know how to extract, into the capsules, the pills, the formula. So we have to go to learn overseas and bring the knowledge, the information about how to extract the trees, to make products commercially, t o treat the patients. They want the department to go faster and to be equal to international quality .\" \"I think traditional medicine is safe, but we need to do more scientific research, right now I can guarantee only about 30%. There are so many places wh ere you can find TM, w e don't know if the plants are contaminated with bacteria or fungus - we need to share information about this. In Thailand, I think the safety is better as they did research for a longer time - they know more about the traditional her bal products - in Laos it's a developing country.\" \"In Laos, there are lot of herbal medicines. In the future, if we have scientific information we will have products so then the doctor can use them for patients - we should develop products but we also nee d to know who will use them. Western medicine doctors in Laos are afraid it might damage the liver or kidney. I hope in the future herbal medicines will become more popular. It's very interesting to know about the compounds in plant samples and how to extr act them, to develop products from herbal medicine. \" Among medical staff working in other areas, perceptions of TM vary. Both t he WHO representative and ITM staff expressed the sense that doctors are reluctant to use TM. Most of the younger doctors from B ajiang, Munlapamok and Pakse hospitals I spoke with ha ve some reservations about its use : \"It's thammada [ordinary, medium, so -so] - but good for some diseases.\" \"I'm afraid it can be dangerous as it's not labelled correctly like WM.\" 133 However, recent research conducted by FoP staff members showed that manufactured herbal medicines used in L aos, especially those produced in Thailand, are often adulterated with steroids, or contain heavy metals - in comparison to the use of fresh plant materials (S. Pala my, pers. communication 2020). Furthermore, the use of whole plant extracts can mitigate th e toxic effects and over -dosing on single extracted ingredients . 328 \"TM can be used cor rectly or incorrectly - just like WM.\" \"It's not dangerous to combine it with WM but it's sabsun [confusing ].\" The post -partum practice of lying on a heated bed (yu fai) is often mentioned as risky for the woman, although this d oes not seem to affect it s widespread popularity even among women working in healthcare. Pharmacists usually seem to have a higher opinion of TM, perhaps reflecting the inclusion of module s on traditional medicine into their training. Older doctors and those from rural backgrounds frequently mention their own homemade remedies (Chapter 3 ). Until now, there has not been any way to become accredited in traditional medicine in Laos. Educatio n, like practice, has been widely dispersed and individualised ; methods by which learning and knowledge production occur on a local ised level are discussed in Chapter 3 . Recently, there have been moves to formalise traditional medicine education, mirroring other more established programmes across ASEAN such as in Thailand . A new addition to the ph armacist training programme in the University of Health Sciences in Vientiane is the \"Bachelor of Lao Traditional Medicine\" , although the degree follows primarily the same format. Students who choose to specialise in traditional medicine follow the pharmac y syllabus for 3 years, and spend the 4th and 5th (final) years focused on study of herbal medicines, including phytochemistry, pharmacology, \"herbal pharmaceutical technology\" and toxicology, emphasising the scientific aspects of the pr ocess, but with no modules on traditional theory. By 2019, there were 21 students enrolled (a number had dropped out), mostly coming from rural areas , who were the first cohort to enter the 4th year of study specialising in traditional medicine. University staff involved i n this programme ha ve varying perspectives on the process , and speak of the limitations they experience in trying to create a future generation of practitioners. They consistently mention the need to emulate and receive assistanc e from neighbouring countri es, especially China. \"Mostly the students a re not that interested in studying TM, because they're not sure where they c an get a job later on - do they sell medicine? So we try to explain to them. They could either make medicine, or be a practitioner . But, to develop traditional medicine, we need to have practitioner training - pharmacist is not the same as practitioner. If people want to study acupuncture, moxibustion, like in China , they need to do medical training. \" \"The studen ts only know a little bit a bout traditional medicine - they are interested but don't know much - as we bring in the new parts of the course they now have more information . I try to teach them about the value of using plants. When they 329 graduate, they could apply for a job in the phar maceutical factory no. 2 (military factory) or no. 3, or they could work in the hospital . I think in the next 3 years, or the future, the hospital will have some department for Lao herbal medicine, like China , so then it will be easy for them to get a job in the hospital. They might also go back to their hometown and become a basic doctor.\" \"It's difficult to create a programme as we lack human resources. We hope to get help from Thailand and China in setting it up.\" Outside the capital, attempts at tradit ional medicine education are less formali sed and variable. In Pakse, buoyed by the unfailing enthusiasm of Dr. Outhai, pharmacy students from Champasak College of Health Sciences t ake a short course in herbal medicines. I joined some of Dr. Outhai's classe s in October 2015, which consisted mainly of his anecdotes and personal knowledge of medicinal plants, engendering lively discussions , and monologues peppered with jokes and teasing, causing the female studen ts to giggle. The questionnaire I conducted with students revealed a generally more positive attitude than in Vientiane, perhaps influenced by the popular status of traditional medicine in the south, or Dr. Outhai's skill in inspiring his pupils. Students rated TM on average as 4.5 on a 1 - 5 scale of effectiveness , although more than half thought that WM was more effective, as it worked faster. Of the 64 students in his class, 59 had used TM themselves to treat dige stive issues, fever, skin disease, wounds, burns and during postpartum, gaining knowledge predominantly from their family, or to a lesser extent from local healers, doctors or reading book s. They thought that it was especially effective for chronic conditi ons such as liver disease, diabetes and digestive complaints. Nearly all the students tho ught that WM and TM could be used together, but most also said that traditional medicine could be dangerous if used incorrectly. Many students (59) said they would lik e to use traditional medicine in the future to treat some diseases, or to study it furthe r. Phaiboun, who trained in pharmacy, but also pursued his own education by studying with monks, has doubts about whether the approach of the new degree programme will be effective - as they focus on pharmacy rather than treatment, and the two years which include herbal medicines is quite short. Ideally, he thinks there should be some kind of school in which both healers and doctors teach - the problem with doing a degr ee in pharmacy is that it focuses only on the scientific use of plants - not the culture (vattanatham) of Lao traditional medicine. He is keen to continue his own education, having taken a short course in Thailand on the preparation of herbal medicines and cosmetics. For several years running he has also attended a training course in Beijing on a scholarsh ip offered by China to health professionals from developing nations. Although he does not speak either English or Chinese, he found 330 this a valuable experience in which he learned new techniques and interacted with people from around the world . Despite his enthusiasm for Lao herbal medicines, he thinks that with the increasing difficulty in sourcing plants, and the fact that herbal medicine is not funded by the hospital , acupuncture is a better option for the future. Like much higher education, it is perceiv ed that leaving the country is necessary in order to progress, such as in the case of Vilaysack's youngest daughter. There is a common perception that to become 'scientific' must involve input from outside Laos. However, whilst Lao medical st aff previously studied in France, the Soviet Union or Vietnam, depending on their age, the majority of scholarships are now given by China. One FoP staff member described his experience of a three -year master's degree at Guangzhou Chinese Medicine universi ty, including research on plant extracts. \"My dream was to improve my knowledge - I applied for many international scholarships - but it's very difficult. I really wanted to study abroad, and China gave scholarships for faculty so I went there. China has m ore power, and industry producing inside the country, so it's not expensive . It's quite different to study in China - China is like a rich country so they have more education than Laos. When you go to study abroad, you have to know more about everything th an in Laos, especially speaking Chinese and meeting people from all around the world.\" Indeed, both Vilaysack and Nueang have visited a conference on indigenous medicine in Yunnan , China with the ITM, the first time either had held a passport or flown. Nueang has a treasured photo album from this time, and Vilaysack describes how he was inspired by new ideas on how to produce medicines, such as methods of cleaning and drying plants correctly. However, aspirations to improve status through education might not t ranslate into dedication to what was perceived as a low -status and low -paying profession. As a member of the ITM commented, \"...our staff have a low level of training, and if they get a scholarship to study in China, Vietnam or somewhere else , they leave to work in a job with more money [the private sector].\" This l ack of scientific expertise inhibited the work of the ITM more broadly. He also tells me about a database of medicinal plant information in Laos, which I was until then unaware of, complain ing that the software had malfunctioned and they had potentially lost years of collected information . The same rather haphazard approach to knowledge I saw applied to the botanical identification of plants, in which googling the Thai name or checki ng a Tha i textbook was often considered sufficient. 331 It can be ascertained, therefore, that a standardised system of 'scientific' traditional medicine in Laos has not been created; nor is there yet any official accreditation system for practitioners. Conse quently, whether or not the production of medicines in Laos is regulated, there is no system in place for the regulation of people. Unlike Thailand, which has a strict licencing system for practitioners (Salguero 201 6; Brun & Schumacher 1986 ), which affect s the ab ility of traditional healers to work, there is no legal framework in Laos to decide who can or cannot offer treatment if they do not operate a medical premises (WPRO 2017 ). The ITM are aware of the difficulty of implementing a regulatory system fo r tradit ional healers . One staff member comment s that \"as they learn through generations, it would be difficult for them to see the benefits if they have to pay to get a certificate.\" Indeed, as I have shown in this thesis, the complexity of the healers' practices which involv e unique knowledge sets and incorporate spiritual ly-based methodologies do not lend themselves to standardised measures of competence. However, despite this, the healers often express ed their desire for better regulation and mirrored the gover nment staff 's complaints about marginali sation. For the healers , implementing regulation is primarily about status and the recognition of their work . Their vision of this is based on the competence -based hierarchy between practitioners that I described in Chapter 3 . Vilaysack comment s that : \"Lao healers are disappearing because there is no support. The government doesn't care about us - in the ministry, people know me, but in reality, they don't respect me. In Thailand, where a healer can have qualificatio ns, I could become an ajan nyai (resp ected teacher) - they care more about traditional medicine there, also in China. Many healers practice dangerously and incorrectly - it's hard to know who's good or not because it's difficult to compare methods, and the re is no office for the healers. The government should help more, to give money for research, make gardens, and conserve knowledge. We have many medicines in Laos, but there hasn't been much research - we need more, but there isn't any funding for research . We need more ajan to work on this - if not, we may lose traditional medicine in Laos. \" What then represented medical authority? A more regulated, supported and well -defined traditional medicine system is desired by those working in different capacities; both healers and government staff agr eed on this point. But it is unclear how moves towards systemising traditional medicine can incorporate the unique and heterogenous knowledge of the healers. In general, regulatory systems tend to preference practices a nd practitioners which most resemble biomedicine. This is perhaps because, as Cloatre argues , 332 \"...law and biomedicine have grown to share common understandings of the nature of knowledge and how it can be proven or attributed \" (Cloatre 2019:424). However, the healers are also keen advocates of science in order to verify the effectiveness of their practices. They criticise what they s ee as lack of rigour in the application of medicinal knowledge; whenever I went to check data with them, they would frequentl y point out and correct my errors. Their epistemologies are clear; plants must be treated with care and precision. Vilaysack often ask s me for the scientific names of plants and to translate the results of research for him. It is difficult, therefore, to p oint to a hierar chy between healer and government medicine which is based on scientific authority.134 134 As I showed in Chapter 5, the concept of phitsanu which appears to emerge from the distinctive rel igio- spiritual landscape has also been reinterpreted in terms of modern pharmaceutical idea s. In Chapter 6, I explored the interactions between patient and healthcare providers and the perceived level of detail in diagnoses from healers versus biomedical h ealthworkers. 333 FoP staff and students on a field trip to collect medicinal plants outside Vientiane CRH staff planting trees around the hospital ground in Pakse 334 Class on TM for pharmacy students at Champasak college of health sciences Phaiboun practices acupuncture in CRH TM department 335 Political plants One of the most distinctive features of traditional medicine in Laos is described as the fresh collection o f plant materials from the forest (ya pa) . The qualities of fresh (sot) and natural (thammasat) are used to depict Lao medicine in opposition to medicines of neighbouring nations , a difference which is characterised in terms of development (pattana) or pro gress (chaleun) . However, i n contrast to negative comparisons made about research and development , this quality is described by both practitioners and patients as positive . As Vilaysack describes, this is a reason why he views his medicine as superior. \"Lao medicine is fresh and from the forest . It still has its original colour ( si thammasat ), such as red and green, which is important, for example khi min (turmeric ) should be yellow. It also has a natural taste and smell (kin thammasat ) - unlike manufacture d medicine. So you can't keep it for more than 3 - 4 months. In Thailand in the past it used to be the same - but now it's become a business ( tulakhit) and they make medicine to sell, mixed with chemicals (san khemi) , whereas in Laos we collect medicine to treat people. In Thailand they take small quantities of medicinal products to make manufactured medicines, but in Laos we use large quantities of raw products to mak e small amounts of medicine. In Laos, being a healer is a lot of work because you have to go to the forest. This is not because of deforestation but because Thai people are lazy, and scared of the forest . In China there has also been a lot of development and progress, even more than Thailand .\" This quality of freshness has, as the ITM directo r points out, a pharmacological basis - if medicines are not processed, it's necessary to ensure a constant supply of plant materials as a long storage period may cause their potency to decline. However, in harvesting plants in the wild, the healers were i nevitably confronted with their lack of control over the availability of biodiversity. In Chapter 3 , I described how the use of medicinal p lants is intrinsically social; the collection of plants is bound up with social relations. Whilst plants may have age ncy, they are also acutely vulnerable to human action. Use of forest resources in the present day is affected throughout Laos by deforestat ion and over -harvesting, which has led to a rapid decline in forest area and quality (Singh 2012; Phompila et al. 2017; Koch 2016). So plants can also be political. Singh points out how: \"Ideas about forest are also closely linked to ideas about the state because the modern Lao state claims authority over most forest resources \" (Singh, 2012: 154) . However, if medicinal plants are harvested on state land, their regulation falls rather ambiguously between the jurisdiction of various government ministries, with no clear consensus on whose responsibility this is. Today, the office for Traditional Medicine, a 336 division of the Food and Drug department, occupies a small room on the 3rd floor the Ministry of Health in Vientiane . A number of staff sit at rickety desks with hardly enough space to turn, the desks cluttered with traditional medicine paraphernalia, plant parts, packet s of pill s and meeting documents. This symbolic representat ion of the marginalisation of traditional medicine within the ministry is echoed in the complaints of staff at the ITM, who resent not having their own department and express their frustration at l ack of power or autonomy to achieve objectives. Returning f rom a field trip in 2019, ITM staff tell me that the place they had collected plants for 21 years was now barren. \"There are no plants left!\" Phaiboun likewise told me rather dramatically on my las t visit to the hospital department in Pakse . \"We looked in places where they used to be, but they are not there anymore.\" The increasing distances travelled to find plants was also a common complaint of the healers. For those who were elderly, treks into mountainous areas were just not feasible . Vilaysack tells me that he drives long distances up into the elevated parts of Attapeu or Sekong, but the cost in petrol could sometimes be more than the donations he would receive from patients , meaning that he ope rates at a loss. According to official policy, med icinal plants are protected by the 2003 Decree No 155/PM on Natural Resources for Medicines, which applies to the use of animals as raw materials for traditional or modern medicine production. \"This Decree requires individuals or organizations who explore or hunt medicinal animals, transport, operate storage, process and make use of medicinal natural resources to have a permit issued by the relevant authorities (MAF, Customs and MOIC) and be strictly compli ant with the Law on Drugs, Law on Forestry, Law on Environment Protection and other related regulations ...The extraction of medicinal natural resources for direct export is prohibited and must be finished or semi-processed prior to export \" (Smith & Soukhaseu m 2018). However, in practice the regulation of m edicinal plants seems to be particularly loosely governed. The department member who helped to draft this legislation (which includes 196 medicinal plants ) spoke of his frustration about what he felt to be their inability to control the illegal export of p lants by prospectors from neighbouring countries - primarily China and Vietnam, but also Cambodia and Thailand. Emphasising th e 'weakness' of Laos and the permeability of its borders, he commented that: \"They have strong laws, but we have weak laws. They cannot take plants in their countries, so they come here. We have a long border that we cannot protect - they are coming from everywhere. Sometimes they have a licence from the ministry of trade only, and th en they run to the forest. They come and just give money to people - do you know this plant? One kilo, one thousand kip - something like that. 337 Very easy to pass our borde r. I pushed the Minister of Health to talk to the Minister of Forests, but they don't talk. The forestry people, they don't know whether plants are used for medicine or not. They take our list, but the cooperation is not good. I want to put this into fores try law, but they don't want to, they don't know. They just know about expensive wood. There are 196 plants on the list, but nobody knows this. For healers like Vilaysack, it's OK - they know how to protect the forest. It gives me a headache when I think a bout this. We keep talking about what to do about this, but nothing happens. \" The diff iculty he expresses presents a conundrum. Although recognition of the medicinal value of forest products is necessary for implementing regulation, this also makes them vulnerable to exploitation without strong enforcement. He contrasts this to the Lao heal ers' approach (as described in Chapt er 5, the principle of phitsanu as well as their physical limitations may prevent over -harvesting) . In Po Nueang 's words, the solution is simple: \"When we go to collect medicines, we should also plant them. We shouldn't take out the root, because then the plant will die.\" As I d emonstrated in Chapter 3 , a plant is defined as medicin al when it is used to treat illness . Here, there is an added dimension - a plant's financial value is also what defines it as a medicine for those seeking to profit from its sale . Since the market reforms of the 1980s, there has been increasing demand for medicinal plant export (MoIC & ITC 2006). As Singh (2012: 58) comments , \"forests can symbolize social identities and desires for development\" ; as natural resources become commodified, they also represent paths to prosperity for those who live in close contact. Indeed, forest resources in th e Lao PDR have been so significant in economic aspiration s that they are described as \"green gold \" (kham k iao) (Koch 2017). Although the ITM director does not state so explicitly, it is a widely acknowledged fact that control of illegal harvesting of any kind is challenged by state representatives' inclusion in the profits. Stricter controls have been placed on illegal loggin g as part of an anti -corruption campaign by the current prime minister , but this applies to woods used primarily for construction purposes .135 Another solution to preserving biodiversity is the creation of medicinal plant reserves. Whilst ex ternal powers mi ght threaten the survival of plant resources, staff also speak often about the need for help from outside Laos. Whilst Laos is commonly portrayed by the state and its citizens as poor, this does not account for the high p roportion of develo pment funding 135 MOIC, 2016. Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Instruction No. 1102/MoIC.DI MEX, dated 17 June 2016 on the Supplement of No.4 of the Instruction No. 1050/MoIC.DIMEX, dated 13 June 2016 on Enhancing Strictness on the Management and Inspection of Timber Exploitation, Timber Movement and Timber Business. 338 from multilateral organizations and foreign aid (Souvannaseng 2019). Indeed, the majority of conservation projects happen with external assistance. Allocation of donor funding, as Sweet (201 5) points out, consistently drives the implem entatio n of projects far more than the existence of official policy. An ICBG project implemented in conjunction with the University of Illinois in Chicago has helped set up a network of medicinal plant gardens across Laos (Soejarto et al. 2012). I n 1997, a six-acre medicinal plant garden was created outside Vientiane, and since 2000 more than 700 acres of medicinal plant preserves have been established throughout the country (2013 ). However, like many project s, as grant funding declines and is not replaced by sta te support, it is difficult to ensure ongoing maintenance. Ambiguity persists about the delineation of what constitutes the gardens, what happens there, and who pays for what. The garden just outside Pak se, from which the traditional medicine department ha rvest plants, is lacking a fence or any way of differentiating it from the surrounding land. I visit on multiple occasions with Phaiboun and Simon, and they point out the places where local people have c ut down trees for construction. They would like to bu ild a fence, and add some labels to trees, so that they are not reliant only on Simon's remarkably accurate recall of their location. In Munlapamok, the garden (or rather patch of forest) on land belongi ng to the public health office also has no fence. The y ask me to find some money to help them, but although I ask on multiple occasions for a n itemised budget, this never materialises, and eventually the matter is dropped. The ITM director said they gave t hem money to make a sign, but that was as much as the y could help. Searching online, I also find details of a grant of almost $200,000 awarded by ADB and IFAD in 2012 to create a medicinal plant reserve in Phatumphone district, to provide income for local villagers within the Xe Pian NPA .136 On one of our trip s around the province together in 2015, Dr. Outhai, Phaiboun and I stop to visit. It is deserted - it is not even possible to cross into what appears to be the garden as there is a river in the way, wi th no boat. I try visiting again by myself on other oc casions, but never find any sign of life. More recently, collaboration with China has led to plans to create at least two new gardens in Vientiane province, ceremoniously welcomed as an example of nati onal cooperation. One policy of the \"Belt and Road\" in itiative has been the promotion of TCM in included 136 ADB . Champasak Province - CPA/NRM/01: Conservation and Domestication of Traditional Medicinal Plants and the Promotion of Traditional Herbs Medication - based Eco -Tourism in Pathumphone distric t, Champasak province 339 countries, an example of what has often been described as \"soft power diplomacy\" (Hinsley et al. 2020). An English -language local newspaper reported in April 2018 that an MOU had been signed between China and Laos to construct a laboratory and a national medicinal plant garden, as well as conduct a medicinal resource inventory in Laos . The aim of this was stated as: \"To fully tap the economic and medicin al value of Laos' special botanical resources ...the two sides will jointly set up a traditional medicine research centre which will carry out comparative studies of Lao and Chinese medicinal plants, train Lao medicinal plant resource researchers, and effecti vely improve medicinal plant exploration and applicati on in Lao s\" (Vientiane Times, 2018). Whilst acknowledging that China represents the only feasible source of financial assistance, those working in the TM sector are ambiguous about its wider influence. Whilst t his might be viewed as a route to prosperity, there are doubts about the motivation s behind the Chinese state's involvement in plant conservation. Valuable plants such as ginseng are said to be sought -after. There are whispers that the planned medicinal plant reserves are actually located within NPAs - in order to harvest the remaining b iodiversity. Stories abound about Chinese bioprospecting companies (often with a Lao front in order to operate legally) who are said to recklessly harvest entire plots of medicinal plants without thoughts of sustainabi lity. One official covertly shows me some photographs of a chemical plant in Bolikhamsai which processes toxic run -off into the local water supply. Commonly used in the Lao ph armacopoeia, khuea haem is now on the ITM's endangered medicinal plants list, which includes ten species, and the danger of unsustainable berberine extraction has been warned of for a number of years (Sydara 2007). Wider concerns about the sustainability o f China's worldwide prom otion of traditional medicine point to the necessity of well -governed supply chains to mitigate the risk of illegal trade (Hinsley et al. , 2020).137 However, China's increasing power in the region has perhaps led to what has been term ed \"commodifying sovere ignity\" . In this scenario, due to debt and dependency the Lao state is forced to transform their sovereign control of natural resources into commodities for Chinese investors, whilst simultaneously depriving the rights of its own cit izens (Laungaramsri 201 4: 40) . Lyttleton & Nyiri (2011) 137 Large scale extraction of medicinal plants for profit by Chinese co mpanies is common elsewhere in Southeast Asia e.g. Mynamar and Bhutan. See Bannister 2002 and Laird 200 2 for fuller discussion of bioprospecting and benefit sharing. 340 have described this type of control over resources whilst operating essentially outside local law as \"soft extraterritoriality \". In 2019, a volume called the \"Lao Herbal Pharmacopoeia\" containing details of 160 medicinal plants was published by the People's Medical Publishing House , Beijing (Huang Luqi et al. 2019) . 26 Chinese authors are listed - with no Lao authors among them - and whilst the book is written in Lao and lists the Lao name of each plan t, thi s is where the link to Laos appears to end. Packed with scientific information drawn from Chinese pharmacological studies, and apparently arbitrary data on analytical chemistry, there is no description of plant use in Laos, photos, or any other infor mation that could be of use to the Lao reader. Even the list of tamla ya describes formulations according to chemical theories . Indeed, although ostensibly a collaborative effort based on joint collection of plant materials in Laos, when I ask the ITM abo ut thi s book in March 2020, they had not even yet received a copy, asking me what was in it. So who is this book for? The publication, I argue, perfectly exemplifies both the growing Chinese influence on traditional medicine in Laos, and the increasing que stion of ownership over resources. Medicinal plants are thus also entwined with politics. The future of medicinal plant conservation is not within the control of the traditional healers - despite their generations of experience - but with the policy mak ers, law enforcement and donors. The Lao PDR's burgeoning political relationship with China will undoubtedly have an effect on the availability of medicinal plants in the future - it remains to be seen whether this is for better or worse. 341 The sign for the medicinal plant pres erve in Pakse The entrance to the Phatumphone medicinal plant project - a river crossing with no boat 342 Top: Simon harvests plants in the Pakse medicinal plant preserve. Bottom: Dr. Outhai in t he CRH TM department medicinal plant garden. 343 An integrated future? What is the future of traditional medicine in Laos? As I have shown in this chapter, and earlier in the thesis, there are many reasons not to be hopeful. The history of political involvement with traditional medicine over the past c entury has shown a mixtu re of non - involvement and an emphasis on rhetoric over implementation of policy. Official reporting about what has happened rarely reflects reality. Traditional medicine is marginalised within current government health structures, a nd efforts to create a m odern, scientific traditional medicine system are challenged by the lack of human resources and training. A lack of centralised information sources and inconsistent approaches to dissemination of research make it difficult to access reliable data. Weak reg ulation and the attractiveness of Laos' remaining biodiversity to bioprospectors means the rapid loss of medicinal plants. Conservation projects that are reliant on external donors often struggle to maintain impetus after the fundin g runs out. However, des pite all of the evidence to the contrary, government staff seem optimistic that an integrated medical system will be achieved - and indeed that this is essential for the survival of traditional medicine. Despite the gap between poli cy and practice evidence d by the history of attempted integration, there is still a belief that state intervention can provide a path forward - perhaps in part due to a pragmatic attitude that there are no other options. Whilst the state may to some extent be depicted as a source of potency, with the potential to provide dividends for those who invest themselves in its project (Singh 2012), this is not done uncritically. As High (2014: 8) points out, it is a conundrum that Lao citizens \"keep returning to, a nd thus socially reprodu cing the state, despite their criticisms and distrust of it\". Indeed, the desire to manifest aspirations into reality may be described as a \"shared delirium\" which is necessary in order to continue functioning within the practical r ealities of the Lao PDR (High 2014: 21). The ITM director has dreams of a new hospital, a clinic at the institute, and more research and documentation of the knowledge of traditional healers. There is a seemingly universal agreement that preserving the k nowledge of traditional healers is crucial to this vision. As one university faculty member commented: \"Yes, I think in the future, western medicine and traditional medicine have to combine together. We need this to stop traditional medicine being lost. Some traditional healers might keep their information secret - so we need teachers to go to remote areas, to ask them, to tell them the value of the herbs - they have to 344 transfer the knowledge to the new generation, or the knowledge will die with them.\" During my last visit to Champasak, in October 2019, I film some video interviews with Nueang and Vilaysack, asking them to speak about the future of traditional medicine in Laos. Each speaks eloquently and at length on their feelings about the future. Whilst t here is not enough space in this thesis to share their views in detail (to be saved for a future video project), I summarise their ideas briefly below. Neither seem particularly hopeful that a new generation of practitioners will emerge, but nevertheless h ave a number of suggestions. Vilaysack , in particular, has very concrete ideas about the future preservation of traditional medicine, using the word anulak, to take care of or protect, which in modern usage refers to the conservation of natural resources. \"We should anulak suan, anulak tamla, anulak ya l ao (conserve gardens, prescriptions and Lao medicine) \". He would like to set up two medicinal plant gardens, near his home in Nonxay Village, and on land he owns in neighbouring Paksong district, on the fertile Bolaven Plateau. Here, he would protect the already existing biodiversity as well as planting particular species such as van. He would like to document his own knowledge, by writing down his herbal prescriptions and cataloguing plants - for this, he needs access to a computer and camera . He would also like to improve the facilities he has set up for his visiting patients - by adding electricity, running water, beds and facilities for preparing decoctions. Although he desires recognition from the gove rnment and the implementation of bette r regulation, he is clear that these projects would be done more effectively without state involvement. This is an acknowledgement that development assistance usually involves substantial siphoning off of funds by gove rnment agents, and that the red tape n eeded to actually implement a project may be overwhelming. In the particular political context of Champasak, and its history of resistance to centralised power, as High (2014:3) suggests, this may make for a \"particula rly doubtful set of recipients\" of sta te assistance. Po Nueang is more circumspect, consistently taking the government line and suggesting that the way to ensure continuity was to promote teaching through the hospital or universities . He says the best meth od for aspiring practitioners to learn would be to go and study with Phaiboun and Dr. Outhai at the hospital . He encourages me to assist with state efforts, such as the plans for improving the garden in Munlapamok. His concerns are instead oriented more to wards the pressures of modernity, and he does not believe his work can continue 345 after his death. He is doubtful about the motivations of practitioners in the present day . Without following the set of regulations designed to ensure phitsanu (see Chapter 5 ), he is afraid that the quality of care offered will fall - the medicine will lose its efficacy, and people will sell their medicines instead of seeking to treat people correctly .138 Temptations to make profit may lead to plant loss in the wild , instead of ca reful harvesting . He is also not sure whether creating gardens will really be useful - as he says plants should really be collected from their natural environment - and anyway, it 's just not possible to plant them all in the same place. So, will healthcar e integration ever be achieved? It seems unlikely that this would happen in a form still recognisable to the healers. Furthermore, without a strong national medical identity or de fined system which lends itself easily to formalisation, it is likely that an y new healthcare structure would rely strongly on the input of donors, most probably China. This is not necessarily negative, as Laos would benefit from China's arguably very succ essful experience in including aspects of their national medicine within hosp itals. Certain practices, such as acupuncture, have been implemented worldwide within biomedical contexts. But could this then be termed a Lao traditional medicine system? It is t rue that Chinese medicine in Laos already makes up part of a plurality of pra ctices, particularly in urban areas, and Chin a has undoubtedly influenced the historical development of Lao medicine (see introduction ). But, this is different from the creation o f a new, modernised national medical system which is based on the experience of practitioners trained in China. 138 In Cambodia, this appears to have already happened through a process of commercializatio n (Ros et al. 2018). 346 Dr. Outhai in CRH TM department Vilaysack in his medicine area 347 CONCLUSION This thesis has mapped a landscape of healing in southern l owland Laos , demonstrating how medical and health practices engage with and occur within the local environ ment , set against the wider soci o-political and medical landscap e. In addressing the resear ch topics and questions, I have shown that traditional medicine use is most commonly a response to chronic illness, as part of complex health -seeking trajectories and intertwining modalities of care. Focusing on the work of traditional healers, I have described the particular characteristics of ya phuen mueang, includ ing the collection of fresh plant materials in the wild, specific preparation methods such as ya fon, the use of individual herbal formul ae, blowing techniques and mantra, and the logic of phitsanu which frames efficacy through local sources of spiritual potency. I have also demonstrated how traditional medicine forms are heterogeneous and localised , opera ting primarily outside the formal healthcare context . Although integrated medicine is national policy, moves to incorporate traditional medicine into state healthcare are dependent on local implementation, existing more in theory than reality. Concurrently , Lao medic al practices and knowledge can be situated within intersecting and layered medical and religious landscapes of Southeast, East and South Asia, incorporating aspects of Theravada Buddhism and Indian and Chinese schools. The primary distinction betwee n Laos and neighbouring nations is the lack of re -invention or creation of a national medical system in the 20th century, or a prominent power hierarchy with biomedicine and state regulation. In the post -revolutionary era, the potency of local landscap es and animist lifeworlds have maintained a powerful impact on how rural people experience illness and health. In exploring ho w medical knowledge is produced, I have shown how s ubstances used as medicine are encompassed under the term ya, which is both fle xible and functional. Wide knowledge of plant names which infer medicinal use suggests that a level of tacit knowledge exists among rural lowlanders, which is uncovered through the role of plants in social relations and in the process of plant collection. Correspondences between plant and illness forms give insights into how medicinal knowledge is constructed. At another level, t he healers' knowledge is specific and individualised, transmitted through teacher -apprentice lineages. Knowledge is hidden or reve aled according to the status of the person receiving it and hierarchies between practitioners. 348 Relationships with the environm ent, shared medicinal principles and bodies of transmitted knowledge also underlie the treatment of illness . Fevers, an important illness category in the southern lowlands, arise in the body due to invasive factors which penetrate weakened bodily boundaries, and are associated with loss of equilibrium in bodily, social or spiritual spheres. Healers f ormulate a complete treatment thro ugh the use of individualised herbal prescriptions, which show how medicinal plants are grouped and classified and re late to the human body. These are named according to symptom patterns rather than focusing on the proximal cause, and diagnosis is often re trospective to treatment, through a process of experimentation. Preparation methods also alter the effect of the medi cine, particularly in terms of maintaining the balance of heat and coolness in the body. Approaches to treatment may incorporate biomedical explanations, as well as the influence of the healer's own experience and ideas; thus, herbal formulary is a constan tly evolving practice, especially as medicinal plant materials become harder to find. The effectiveness of the healers' treatments also rel ies on sources of religious -spiritual potency. Phitsanu is the vitalising aspect of the Lao healer's medicine and the origin of their therapeutic power, and is reflective of the complex cosmologies of southern Laos . In the present day, practitioners also d raw on modern pharmaceutical ideas which re -conceptualise phitsanu as a quantifiable material substa nce, or the 'active ingredient' of the medicine. The ability to use phitsanu is received during initiation, and is activated through mantras which are blown in the breath of the healer onto the body of the person and the medicine . A specific plant family, van, both assist in healing potency and act as spiritual protection. Drawing power from natural forces can be dangerous and must also be carefully controlle d through specific practices of self -regulation, including keeping Buddhist precepts, food and behav iour taboos , collecting plants according to astrological principles and the prohibition against asking for payment. There is thus a coherent system of logic which governs the healer's behaviour and his reputation as moral and efficacious . Power also permeates the relationship between practitioner and patient. Experience s of the therapeutic encounter , including its sensory, social and symbolic setting, the phy sical and relational qualities of the space and the interaction between practitioner, patient, and their family have a significant effect on satisfaction with treatment received. I have shown how preferences for traditional medicine are strongly associated with social connection, the use of familiar symbols and techniques, specific actions undertak en during the encounter to build trust, and the capacity of the sick person to understand and be engaged with their own care. 349 Contrasting experience s of seeking c are from healers and rural hospitals can be partially be explained by the level of agency expe rienced by practitioners working in varying institutional contexts. Social and familial ties are also important in understanding the process of recovery from sickness. The soul -calling ceremony is both the enactment of social wellbeing, and a method of re-integration after illness. Wellbeing, sabai, is a broad notion of health which emphasises the person's mental -emotional and spiritual state and their emplacem ent within social and familial networks. The loss of the souls and restoration through ritual can be interpreted on various levels; as a method of helping the sick person to cope psychologically, as a metaphor for societal expectations, and as a means thro ugh which they can experience care and good wishes through the tactile act of string -tying . The importance of this ritual in Lao lowland life emphasises that the pursuit of good health in Laos does not occur only through the individual act of seeking healt hcare, but is dependent on networks of care. Although traditional medicine in Laos operates primarily outside state control, with little regulation other than medicines for export, it is also affected by government policy. Attempts to c reate new generations o f practitioners emphasise the creation of a scientific medicine and rely heavily on external assistance, especially from China, altering the form in which traditional medicine is taught and practised. Maintaining biodiversity into the future, and thus the \"potent plants\" of the healers will also be dependent on political ties and state regulation . More work remains to be done on this topic. As an ethnographic case study, this researc h has examined lowland Lao healing practices conducted by specific individu als in one province of Laos. This does not reflect the wide ethnic, linguistic and botanical diversity found across Laos. As I worked in areas with well -established traditional heal ers, the results are also likely to be biased towards favourable perception and frequent use of traditional medicine; they may not reflect greater decline in popularity in other areas. I also have not examined how urban and rural use differ. It is thus difficult to say whether these results can be extrapolated more broadly. Altho ugh the thesis has examined the institutional and political dimensions o f traditional medicine in national healthcare, this is limited by lack of historical data available. Likewise, description of medical history also remains primarily hypothetical withou t access to primary sources. The subject would also benefit from more detailed botanical, pharmacological and linguistic analysis, areas in which I am personally 350 lacking in expertise, although I have made every effort to ensure accuracy. The palm leaf manu scripts (bailan) also represent rich possibilities for textual study, wh ich was outside the scope of this thesis. In the present day, there are many reasons both for the enduring popularity and rapid decline of traditional medicine in Laos . Certainly, in o rder to survive, traditional medicine will have to evolve. It is clear t hat this will be the last generation of traditional healers practising in ways that have been passed down through generations. As the healers can also be viewed as vessels of bodies of cultural knowledge , such as their unique sets of herbal prescriptions, documenting their knowledge is thus vitally important. However, beyond the rather bleak picture of declining medical lineages, biodiversity loss, the failure of any meaningful state action towards healthcare integration and the future threat of further annexation of resources, there is still much to value and learn from Laos . Keeping a \"cool heart\" in the face of change or events outside their control is a skill that rural Lao people e xcel at. Just as plants move of their own accord , and human action requires negotiation with the spirit world, things happen in often surprising ways. Indeed, the normalisation of loss and re -creation is given an apt metaphor in the palm leaf manuscripts, which eventually succumb to termites or humidity and must be copied into new forms. As I have shown throughout this thesis, traditional medicine in Laos cannot be so easily categorised or sidelined, as it exists on multiple levels, under the surface, as pa rt of so much of the life course of people in Laos . Everyday practices, rituals , social relations, doing things with plants - these are all ways in which new ideas, techniques and knowledge arise. Traditional knowledge is not static; innovation is, and has always been, how it progresses and transforms. 351 References Abhay, Thao Nhouy. 1959. \"Courts of Love and Poetry.\" In Kingdom of Laos: The Land of the Million Elephants and of the White Parasol .
