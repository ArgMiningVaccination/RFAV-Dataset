Telehealth has supported physical distancing efforts and helped to ensure that care continues to be provided to those who need it most by triaging low-risk urgent care and follow-up appointments while maintaining continuity of care, especially for chronic disease and behavioral health patients who may require routine check-ins. By reducing unnecessary visits to health care environments, we can curb the exposure to and transmission of infectious disease, while helping to keep our front lines safe and ensure they have the resources needed to take on this immense challenge. Telehealth has been particularly crucial throughout the current pandemic. The American Medical Association is committed to supporting and advocating for physicians and practices throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. For the latest information and updates on COVID-19 and the AMA's physician resources, visit the COVID-19 Resource Center for Physicians . In addition to this resource, if you are working to optimize and sustain telehealth in your practice, the American Medical Association also recommends visiting the AMA Telehealth Quick Guide resource and accessing the AMA STEPS Forward Innovation Academy Telehealth Immersion Program. \"With the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on access to medical care, there is no better time to help physicians navigate and implement telemedicine into their practices and enhance their ability to care for patients. Through telemedicine, we can triage patients and help avoid unnecessary visits to health care settings, thereby reducing exposure to the COVID-19 virus and helping to keep our front lines safe, ensuring they have the resources needed to take on this immense challenge. The tools and guidelines being created now are already helping many to use telemedicine and will continue to help define its role at this moment, and shape the future of physician practice. \" \u2014DR. RUSSELL LIBBY , PEDIATRICIAN & BOARD MEMBER, PHYSICIANS FOUNDATION 5Part 1: Warm-up Before you embark on your telehealth implementation, it's important to understand what telehealth is and how it's impacting the world of health care. In this section of the Playbook, we'll define telehealth and explain how to use the resources included in this document. 67Introduction to the Digital Health Implementation Playbook PART 1 / WARM-UP At the AMA, we are committed to partnering with physicians to meet the changing landscape of health care. Recent research1 found that physicians had four key requirements for the adoption of digital health in practice: Does it work? Will I receive payment? Will I be liable? Will it work in my practice? In support of that pursuit, we have collaborated2 with physicians, care team members, patients, and thought leaders to create the Digital Health3 Implementation Playbook Series. WHAT IS A DIGITAL HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION PLAYBOOK? Months of research compiled into a Playbook documenting the most efficient path to implementing a new digital health solution, including key steps, best practices, and resources to accelerate and achieve digital health adoption.WHO IS THIS PLAYBOOK SERIES FOR? This series is intended for those who believe in the importance of digital health and its role in helping deliver better care. Whether you are a physician, a care team member, a health care administrator, or a passionate advocate for the implementation of digital health technology, if you are looking for guidance to navigate the process and achieve scale, this series of Playbooks is for you. WHY SHOULD I USE THE PLAYBOOKS? Implementing digital health technology can be complicated and time-consuming. On average, it takes hospitals 23 months to go from identifying a digital innovation need to scaling a digital solution to meet that need4. The Playbook series has been designed with input from over 140 physicians, care team members, health care administrators, and digital health thought leaders to help health care organizations adopt change faster and more successfully. WHEN SHOULD I USE THE PLAYBOOK SERIES? Refer to this series of Playbooks whenever you are considering the implementation of a digital health solution. By adopting these solutions now, your organization can improve its ability to deliver on the Quadruple Aim of Healthcare, inclusive of Health Equity5. WHERE CAN I USE THE PLAYBOOK SERIES? The Playbooks are designed for care teams and administrators in medical practices of all sizes and areas of specialty. We have consulted with small private practices and large health systems, in rural and urban settings, with high-income and Medicaid-dependent populations. No matter where you are, you can use this Playbook as a guide to successfully implement digital health solutions in your practice. Digital tools that enable new methods and modalities to improve health care, enable lifestyle change, and create efficiencies are proliferating quickly. Clinical integration of these tools is lacking. We want to change that. 8Introduction to Digital Health Solutions New technologies are fundamentally changing the way people interact with health care. Successful implementation of digital health technology will be imperative for improving patient outcomes and ensuring financial stability for health care practices. The landscape of digital health technology is seemingly endless and spans from clinical workflow solutions and data management to population health and patient interaction tools. You've likely been exposed to or considered implementing a number of these solutions. Despite the increasing prevalence of digital health, many health system leaders struggle to drive innovation in their organizations. They are looking for a better, more efficient path to scaled implementation, but report that knowledge gained by other organizations and best practices is not readily available. This Playbook series is an effort to provide widespread access to institutional knowledge and best practices currently held by experts in the field. The Playbook series will be updated to include new content over time. As the series evolves, it will provide helpful frameworks and resources for your practice related to specific digital health solutions. This Playbook provides resources for the implementation of: Telehealth If you are currently interested in learning more about telehealth, you can find more resources at ama-assn.org/practice- management/digital/ telehealth-resource-center- ama-policy-resources . If you are interested in learning more about implementing digital health solutions, you can find other Playbooks in the Series at ama-assn.org/digital-health- playbook. 9For the purposes of this Playbook, we define telehealth as a digital health solution that connects the patient and clinician through real-time audio and video technology. It can be used as an alternative to traditional in-person care delivery and, in certain circumstances, can be used to deliver care such as the diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management, and self-management of patients. WHAT IS TELEHEAL TH? Telehealth, telemedicine and related terms generally refer to the exchange of medical information from one site to another through electronic communication. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defines telehealth as a two-way, real-time interactive communication between a patient and a physician or practitioner at a distant site through telecommunications equipment that includes, at a minimum, audio and visual equipment. While telemedicine has historically eferred to remote clinical services, telehealth can refer to broader services including:Introduction to TelehealthPART 1 / WARM-UP Introduction to Telehealth Synchronous Telehealth Real-time, audio-video communication that connects physicians and patients in different locations. Note: This definition is used for telehealth for CMS coverage and payment. Real-time audio and telephone communications.Asynchronous Telehealth Store-and-forward technologies that collect images and data to be transmitted and interpreted later. Online digital visits and/or brief check-in services furnished using communication technology that are employed to evaluate whether or not an office visit is warranted (via patient portal, smartphone). Interprofessional internet consultations between physicians and/or other qualified health care professionals to improve care coordination for patients by sharing verbal or written reports for further assessment and/or care management. 10BENEFITS OF TELEHEAL TH Telehealth adoption allows health care providers to increase continuity of care, extend access beyond normal clinic hours, reduce patient travel burden, and help overcome clinician shortages, especially in rural and other underserved populations6, which ultimately helps health systems and physician practices focus more on chronic disease management, enhance patient wellness, improve efficiency, provide higher quality of care, and increase patient satisfaction7. It can also be used to help reduce the spread of infectious diseases.BARRIERS TO TELEHEAL TH Although telehealth brings many benefits, we also recognize the barriers to adopting such technology, including inconsistent reimbursement models9; interstate licensure challenges10; legal and regulatory issues11; concerns over security, privacy, and confidentiality12; lack of evidence about impact on health care costs, utilization, or outcomes13; concerns about impacts to clinical duty to provide safe and effective care (e.g., over-prescribing antibiotics in urgent care settings)14; and logistical space challenges15.COMMON USES FOR TELEHEAL TH INCLUDE: FOLLOW-UP CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTHOVERCOMING TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS Patients on treatment protocols who need close follow-up care and multiple visits to ensure compliance and manage medication Care for chronic and complex conditions, including virtual consults on lab results, symptom triage, lifestyle management, and remote patient monitoring (RPM) check-ins Post-operative wound care Group education consults with prediabetic and diabetic patients on healthy eating, exercise, and wellness tips Address shortages in local or on-site mental health services in rural or underserved populations by connecting patients to a specialist8 For routine follow-ups with anxiety, depression, and ADHD patients who are adjusting to new medications Routine virtual psychotherapy appointments Access care from the convenience of the patient's home For patients who face mobility barriers and lack a caregiver or assistance with transportation to the doctor's office Urgent care for established patients with low-risk, infectious diseases, such as conjunctivitis or urinary tract infection For long-term patients who are temporarily relocated out of state Pre-orthopedic surgery preparation Expand access to and expedite clinical trials 11PART 1 / WARM-UP In 2016, the AMA conducted a study16 of physicians' motivations, current use of, and requirements for the adoption of digital health tools, including telehealth. Our recent refresh of that digital health research indicated usage of telehealth has doubled from 14% in 2016 to 28% in 2019.17 Additionally, we saw the explosion of telehealth across the industry in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we continue to see expanded use increase, there is still work to be done in optimizing and scaling telehealth that works for patients, physicians, and care teams. Recognizing challenges still exist, this Playbook is designed to help you and your team overcome these barriers to adoption so you may experience the many benefits of telehealth for your care team, your patients, and the broader community. \"Implementing a telehealth program is a winding road at first. It takes a bit of patience and flexibility, but it's well worth it, and the end of the road is satisfying for all involved. \" \u2014DR. SARITA NORI, DERMATOLOGY , ATRIUS HEALTH\"Behavioral health is a great use case for virtual care, and we look forward to expanding our tele- behavioral health offerings in 2020. It's important for our organization to provide the best possible care to our patient population, and virtual visits provide another way for us to do so that enables us to meet patients and families where they are. Virtual care is a key component of our enterprise strategic plan in the coming years. \" \u2014KELLY CROWN, PROGRAM DIRECTOR, VIRTUAL CARE, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES\"Technology has made improvements; however institutional understanding, reimbursement, and regulation challenges still exist. My goal for telehealth is for it to be more ubiquitous within health care delivery. While I have seen the need for years, I am living the need currently with aging parents who do not have the access to efficient telehealth services. With the aging of our society, telehealth is going to become more important for patients and their caregivers. \" \u2014DR. BRENT WRIGHT, ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR RURAL HEALTH INNOVATION, THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 12CONTINUITY OF CARE As telehealth vendors become more common and other urgent care settings grow in popularity, it's important to consider how this market may impact overall health outcomes by disrupting continuity of care. In order to stay competitive and maintain that continuity of care, it's increasingly important for physicians, practices, and health systems to consider implementing telehealth in their own environments.Telehealth solutions allow clinicians to offer more convenient options for followup and urgent care cases to curb patient no-shows for in- person appointments or patients turning to one-off interactions in convenient, urgent, and third-party telehealth care settings. Although it's suggested patients follow up with their primary care physician after an urgent care or third-party telehealth visit, this often does not happen. By offering telehealth in their own practices, clinicians and health systems will be able to provide an improved patient experience and continuity of care, and maintain a strong patient- clinician relationship. The AMA is focused on helping confront the increasing chronic disease burden, especially preventing or managing diabetes, blood pressure, and substance use, and helping increase patient care and physician satisfaction by leveraging telehealth technology as an asset, not a burden.Telehealth in Practice 13Interstate Licensure Telehealth rules and regulations vary state to state. If your patient has out-of-state health insurance or wants to receive care outside of your state, make sure that you are meeting the state's guidelines where your patient is receiving care (e.g., reimbursement policies, clinician licensure). Below is a checklist of items for consideration before initiating telehealth in your practice: \u00fcInclude your legal and billing team as early in the process as possible to understand federal, state, and payer requirements and regulations \u00fc Identify in which states your clinicians need to be licensed as well as in which states they are currently licensed \u00fc Research interstate licensure, including the Interstate Licensure Compact \u00fc Check with your malpractice insurance carrier to ensure you are covered to provide telehealth services UNDERSTANDING THE RULES Licensure and reimbursement are two of the most common challenges to scaling telehealth in practice. Investing time in understanding some of the complexities of implementing telehealth early in the process could save time and resources later. Telehealth in PracticePART 1 / WARM-UP 14Path to Payment Each health system and practice must determine the best reimbursement model for their system and patient population. A few common reimbursement models include: BILL INSURANCE (E.G., PRIVATE, MEDICARE, MEDICAID): Although this model most closely reflects the existing patient experience, it's important to know that reimbursement rates vary by payer and there may be specific criteria your platform and/or use case must meet in order to be reimbursed. OUT-OF-POCKET (E.G., $50-$100 PER TELEHEAL TH VISIT): This model places a higher burden on patients and treats telehealth more like a luxury than a necessity, but it does allow it as an option if insurance reimbursement rates otherwise make telehealth a nonviable option. FREE Although rare, some organizations choose to fund telehealth through grants or private endowment funds to help meet broader health system or community needs such as increasing access to care for rural or other underserved populations. Practices that primarily plan to bill insurances should consider the following to ensure success: qUnderstand ins and outs of CPT\u00ae codes, including modifiers and correct language to use (Appendix E.1) qResearch which payers do and do not cover telehealth qConsider negotiating with individual payers regarding coverage and health outcomes qUnderstand the geographic restrictions for an originating site as well as any restrictions on qualifications as a distant site qConsider focusing your telehealth program on patients who use the primary payer at your practice, especially if they already cover telehealth DOCUMENTATION IS CRITICAL TO REIMBURSEMENT Be sure to document when your visit begins and ends to meet the length requirements for payer and/or state. Based on the requirements of coding and billing, keep a checklist for how you have to document in order to meet regulations. (Appendix E.1) STAY UP TO DATE Telehealth rules, regulations, and reimbursement rates are continuously evolving, so ensure your practice or organization is staying up to date with the latest information by checking your state's rules and regulations and the reimbursement rates and guidelines for the payers most commonly used at your practice. Below are some helpful links: The AMA Advocacy Resource Center provides materials for physicians and physician advocates focused on state telemedicine policies and issues. Patient-physician relationship - Learn more about the rules by state for establishing the patient-physician relationship via telehealth and telemedicine. The Federation of State Medical Boards provides telemedicine policies by state . The Center for Connected Health Policy has various state-based resources including: Telehealth policy and reimbursement by state and the state tracker covering topics such as regulatory, cross-state licensing, and reimbursement Disclaimer: Reimbursement-related information provided by the American Medical Association (\"AMA\") and contained within this Playbook is for medical coding guidance purposes only. It does not (i) supersede or replace the AMA's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT\u00ae) manual (\"CPT Manual\") or other coding authority, (ii) constitute clinical advice, (iii) address or dictate payer coverage or reimbursement policy, or (iv) substitute for the professional judgment of the practitioner performing a procedure who remains responsible for correct coding. 15The Path to Implementation The following step-by-step process is intended to guide your practice through the implementation of a digital health solution. As this is part of a Digital Health Implementation Series, the steps to implementation will likely remain the same throughout the series; however, each Playbook will focus on a different digital health modality. The first six steps in Part 2 are fundamental to the initial planning of a telehealth program, and the subsequent six steps in Part 3 focus on more specific details of how to truly implement your telehealth program. While we have displayed these steps chronologically, we know that the real world is not always straightforward. Use this process as a guide while understanding that: q The order of steps may shift based on your practice or organization q Some steps may overlap or may be executed simultaneously q Some steps may take more or less time than others q You may need to reiterate or circle back to an earlier step when expanding your program or if challenges ariseWe recommend reading through the Playbook in its entirety before embarking on the path to implementation so you know what lies ahead. Then, once you've commenced the process in practice, refer to each step in Part 2 and Part 3 for best practices, checklists for success, and practice spotlight stories to guide you along your way.PART 1 / WARM-UP 16IDENTIFYING A NEED What's the problem?

SCALING What's next?TIMELINE OF STEPS PAR T 2 PAR T 3 17Part 2: Pre-game The following six steps will serve as the general foundation for planning for your telehealth program and will prepare you to embark on the more detailed steps outlined in Part 3, which will help you with practical implementation. 1819Step 1: Identifying a Need Ground your telehealth implementation in a true need. Telehealth became an industry necessity amid COVID-19 in 2020, aiming to minimize disease exposure and transmission, but it can also help address opportunities or challenges physician practices and/or health systems face on a regular basis. With that said, it is important to ensure this type of technology is aligned with organizational priorities. Specifically, with telehealth, it's also important to understand legal, regulatory, and financial implications as early on as possible to appropriately scope your program and avoid significant roadblocks in the future. Brainstorm a list of your organization's gaps in care\u2014where you lose efficiency, where your staff encounters pain points, or where patients' health or satisfaction suffers. Prioritize issues identified by front-line staff that align with your organization's strategic goals, and determine which can most likely be addressed by telehealth (revenue loss, disruption in continuity of care, low compliance, clinician shortages, and socioeconomic or geographical barriers to in-person visits). Many organizations start small, focusing on a target patient population, department, or clinical need, with an established plan to scale into other areas. The focus on need will help justify your effort with key stakeholders, sharpen your implementation strategy, and help you select the platform best suited to your practice's needs and workflow. PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 1: IDENTIFYING A NEED 20WHY IDENTIFYING A NEED IS IMPORTANT Prioritize resources by centering your initiative around a true organizational need. This practice also: Brings purpose and context to the project Forms the basis for program evaluation Helps crystalize buy-in from key stakeholders Incites long-term stability for the project GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING IDENTIFYING A NEED qSolicit feedback from staff to identify the biggest pain points and opportunities that exist in your organization (Appendix A.1) qIdentify areas of opportunity from patients via satisfaction and/or experience survey responses and ensure that responses are reflective of the diversity within your patient population qPrioritize your list of pain points and opportunities based on severity of need and fit with the strategic goals of the organization (Appendix A.1) qIdentify problems that are most likely to be resolved by a telehealth solution qSelect a problem that, if solved, would have the greatest value to your entire organization and patients qIdentify what type of telehealth service could be offered to solve this need (e.g., 1:1 follow-up care, connection to specialists, group education) qEvaluate your organization's overall readiness for a telehealth solution (consider using this tool) qEnvision the expected outcome(s) if that problem were addressed (Appendix A.2) qIdentify legal, regulatory, or financial restraints that could get in the way of solving this need (e.g., reimbursement, interstate licensure, data use, and ownership) qBegin to establish a budget and funding source 21Identifying a Need AVOIDING A MISSTEP Evaluate the financial implications of telehealth. Determine if your organization or practice is financially ready for telehealth by starting to understand the cost of implementation and how telehealth could have a positive impact, whether that would be through reimbursement, improved patient experience, increased access for patients, or reduced no- show rates.LARGE PRACTICE CALLOUT Prioritization can be especially difficult for large organizations. It is difficult when key decision- makers may not regularly interact with front-line staff. Seek feedback from care teams to avoid misalignment between the organization's strategic priorities and the day-to-day needs of staff and patients.BEST PRACTICE Look to your network. Seek out colleagues within or at practices similar to yours who have previously counseled or executed the implementation of a telehealth program. Foster open communication with these advisors. If you are affiliated with another practice or health system, explore how they might support your implementation with existing programs and/ or technology. Throughout the implementation process, rely on their experience and advice as you run into challenges.PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 1: IDENTIFYING A NEED 22\"Telehealth was a solution that we came up with because we wanted to be able to be there for the patients, for everyone. \" \u2014IT TEAM MEMBER, PRIVATE HOSPITAL Practice Spotlight Focus on resolvable issues. Both patients and physicians build confidence in a new technology quickly if it works the first time they try it. This principle holds true for using telemedicine as a new modality. One way to launch a successful telehealth program that has the potential to build positive momentum and scale is to begin by focusing on a few chief complaints that providers agree will be easily resolved by a video visit. Those conditions, such as pink eye or certain rashes, can be triaged to telehealth by patient education or nursing telephone lines. As both patients and providers become accustomed to having their medical complaints resolved through telemedicine, the system can then grow the program by continuously adding additional chief complaints to the triage that will most likely be resolved by telehealth. In this way, both patients and providers can be confident that they can trust the telemedicine service to meet their needs. \u2014DR. SYLVIA ROMM, PEDIATRICIAN AND CHIEF INNOVATION OFFICER, ATLANTIC HEAL TH SYSTEMQUICK TIP Frame your need within a larger context. Identify how telehealth intersects with your organization's broader strategic goals around creating community and regional access, addressing health equity, and/or supporting emergency preparedness. 23Step 2: Forming the Team The success of any implementation depends on engaging the right people. Telehealth implementation is a team effort that requires on- the-ground knowledge, open communication, and long-term commitment for success. While you won't need to directly engage all the teams right away, it's helpful to identify who will be on which teams and consider when and how different players will be involved (Appendix B.3). Roles and responsibilities will vary, depending on the size of your organization, but it is important to include perspectives from all departments that will be impacted by telehealth, including clinical, financial, administrative, IT, and legal champions. Consider organizing your key stakeholders into four teams: Core, Leadership, Advisory, and Implementation based on the criteria and responsibilities outlined in Appendix B.1. Telehealth programs can take months to launch, so the kickoff meeting should gain stakeholder alignment on objectives, concerns, important dates, and approval protocols for the entire implementation process. A clear and thorough understanding of your organization's needs and internal processes will help you avoid missteps and ensure a smoother collaboration with your telehealth vendor for launch. PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 2: FORMING THE TEAM 24GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING FORMING THE TEAM qIdentify the key members of your Core, Leadership, Advisory, and Implementation teams (Appendix B.1; B.2) qHost a kickoff meeting to outline and communicate the responsibilities and time commitment required of each team member (Appendix B3; B.4) qDiscuss financial, IT, and legal considerations at kickoff meeting qSet clear dates for Cross-Committee action on Selecting a Vendor, Making the Case, and First Implementation qSet up regular meetings with your Core team qSolicit input from your Implementation team qSet key checkpoints with the Advisory team at least one month in advance to stay on schedule qPre-seed your program intent with key members of your Leadership team qSet up weekly emails to make sure communication is open between teams and departments WHY FORMING THE TEAM IS IMPORTANT Having the right people involved upfront provides diverse perspectives. These different viewpoints are critical to the planning and implementation of telehealth, as they help to: Anticipate barriers from all angles Facilitate buy-in Distribute workload Minimize workflow disruption during implementation 25Forming the Team AVOIDING A MISSTEP Carefully consider who needs to be at the table. It's possible to have too many players involved, which could slow down the process. Alternatively, missing a key person or role during the planning stages can result in rework or difficulties with developing buy-in. BEST PRACTICE Keep the end user in mind. The foundation of your implementation should be informed by the people you are designing for so the solution is tailored to suit their needs. Consider who will be most impacted by telehealth\u2014 including clinicians, care team members, patients, and support roles such as schedulers and billers \u2014and solicit feedback early on. Ensure diverse perspectives are represented and considered throughout the implementation process. LARGE PRACTICE CALLOUT Find a home for telehealth within your organization. Determine where telehealth will be housed within your organizational structure (e.g., part of IT, innovation, its own committee or task force) in order to establish an accountability framework, protect your budget and resources and avoid overlapping roles and responsibilities. PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 2: FORMING THE TEAM 26\"At a small practice, you couldn't possibly do everything there is to do with just one person taking it on all themselves. Everybody has to have a part and share. They say 'teamwork makes the dream work. '\" \u2014LEAH, PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT, CHICAGO ARTHRITIS, LLC Practice Spotlight Clear roles and responsibilities ensure success as engaged teams shift throughout process. When starting their telehealth implementation process, a Director of Nursing and the team at her hospital knew it was essential to have the right individuals on the core teams, even if each member's engagement would flex throughout implementation. They found it important to include members representing risk management, safety, IT and biomed as well as physicians, administrative staff, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Information Officer (CIO), and representatives from the specialty in which the initial implementation will take place. Although each representative's time and resource investment shifted throughout the process as sometimes all team members were needed while at others only certain parts of the team were needed, it was important to identify each of these key players early on and establish clear roles, responsibilities, and expectations. \u2014DIRECTOR OF NURSING, HOSPITALQUICK TIP Pre-seed your idea with the Leadership team. Use standing meetings or casual conversations to keep Leadership team members updated on your telehealth program. Share your intent, what organization-wide impact telehealth could have (e.g., increasing revenue, improving patient retention, expanding patient access, increasing the organization's reputation for being innovative), and provide initial exposure to your implementation before seeking official approval to secure high-level sponsorship and increase buy-in potential. 27Step 3: Defining Success Define what success looks like early. Once you're aligned with your Core team on the key need for telehealth and vision for success, use this step to set specific short- and long-term goals with measurable metrics using the AMA Return on Health framework (Appendix E.4) and a process for tracking your progress to guide your team along the way. List the anticipated benefits18 of your telehealth program from the patient, clinician, and Leadership team's perspective as well as the limitations already identified by your key stakeholders to form your initial definition of success. Outline a phased approach with endpoints for growth and expansion. PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 3: DEFINING SUCCESS 28WHY DEFINING SUCCESS IS IMPORTANT Envisioning success brings clarity to the goal you are trying to achieve by using telehealth.This helps: Set realistic expectations for your program Identify the right vendors Rally the team around a common goal Bring rigor to tracking metrics GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING DEFINING SUCCESS qList benefits of your telehealth program for patients, clinicians, and your organization as a whole qReground yourself in the financial, legal, and operational limitations your stakeholders have identified, especially reimbursement and interstate licensure limitations (Appendix E.1) qResearch the various ways the telehealth solution you are considering can deliver value for your practice or organization (Appendix E.4) qIdentify 3-5 goals that are most important for your entire practice or organization (e.g., continuity of care, reimbursable interactions, appointment compliance, patient satisfaction, physician satisfaction, access to care) qIdentify which metrics are most appropriate for assessing progress toward these goals qEnsure each goal is S.M.A.R.T. (Appendix C.2) qSet up a process or system to collect data and track progress against the goals (keeping in mind that vendors' platforms may have analytics capabilities) qEstablish specific checkpoints to collect data qSet clear endpoint criteria to reevaluate as needed or to scale the program qPlan for how and when you'll establish baseline metrics as a comparison point for your program's success qPlan for how and when you'll evaluate success after initial implementation 29AVOIDING A MISSTEP Establish a baseline. Don't forget to define and document where you currently are across all success metrics before the implementation of your program. This will help you make the case for the program's success by demonstrating how telehealth has specifically contributed to your larger goals rather than only being able to highlight an increased number of telehealth appointments. Measuring true impact from the telehealth program will be nearly impossible without a clear understanding of your baseline. BEST PRACTICE Align your goals to the Quadruple Aim of Healthcare, inclusive of Health Equity . By focusing on health outcomes, improving the patient experience, reducing cost, and/or increasing clinician satisfaction, you will inevitably impact the end user, care team, and patient in a positive way. Consider ways telehealth can also help your practice address health inequities by expanding access and initiating partnerships across the community. These goals are also more likely to align with the strategic imperatives of your organization, which will be an advantage when seeking approval and resources later in the process. (Appendix C.1)Defining Success QUICK TIP Explore how digital health solutions fit into government programs.See how digital health solutions (e.g., telehealth) could help your practice or organization meet the participation requirements for programs such as the Quality Payment Program (QPP), Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), and/or Alternative Payment Models (APMs). PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 3: DEFINING SUCCESS 30\"Having a vision for success helps with buy-in and budget from the organization's leaders. \" \u2014SHANNON VOGEL, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (HIT), TEXAS MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (TMA) Practice Spotlight Clearly defined success metrics ultimately help highlight program success. When beginning their telehealth implementation, Angela and her colleagues at Privia Medical group knew it was important to clearly define success metrics so they could easily measure possible progress made with patients as well as the overall telehealth program's success. The team agreed on defining success as improved outcomes, strengthened patient/physician communication, and increased compliance, which allowed them to clearly track success as they initially implemented telehealth with patients with cases such as ADHD medication checks, urgent care infectious disease cases, minor traumas, and patients with protocols needing close follow-up such as Lyme disease. Starting with a clear vision of success allowed the team to highlight improvements made with each metric and, ultimately, the telehealth program's success. \u2014ANGELINA FARELLA, PEDIATRICIAN, PRIVIA MEDICAL GROUP 31Step 4: Evaluating the Vendor Evaluate possible vendors across key criteria that will enable your goals. Many electronic health record (EHR) vendors have functionality that provides practices with the ability to facilitate telehealth visits. This is a great way to build your existing relationship and ensure seamless integration. If you do seek a new, outside vendor, go into the process with the intent of finding someone who will be a long-term partner and not just someone to execute a transaction. Select a shortlist of quality vendors by speaking with organizations or practices similar to yours or reaching out to your state medical association for recommendations. Alternatively, attending health care technology conferences like HIMSS (and local HIMSS chapters), American Telemedicine Association, HLTH, or Rock Health; collaborating with a health care accelerator or incubator; or leveraging the AMA's Physician Innovation Network19 to connect with one of 1,500+ companies can expose you to possible vendors and practical solutions.PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 4: EVALUATING THE VENDOR 32WHY EVALUATING THE VENDOR IS IMPORTANT Select a vendor who is worthy of a long-term partnership. This ensures you will have: An expert resource always on hand in challenging situations Support throughout your implementation process, from start to finish (and beyond) A partner who is equally motivated as you to achieve a successful outcome GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING EVALUATING THE VENDOR qBegin with your network, including asking for word-of-mouth referrals from experienced practices early on and researching third-party reviews qResearch potential vendors and talk with your EHR vendor for existing options that may be available through your existing technology infrastructure qBuild a Request for Proposal (RFP), clearly outlining the goals you identified in Step 3 qSend RFPs to vendors that most closely align to your goals qReview RFP responses alongside key representatives from the Core and Advisory teams qAsk for case studies and referrals qSchedule live vendor demos with select members of the Core, Advisory, and Implementation teams qEvaluate vendors across six critical factors: Business, Information Technology, Security, Usability, Customer Service, and Clinical Validation (Appendix D.1) qNarrow your options to one or two preferred vendors to include in your pitch to leadership qUse established criteria to make the evaluation process simple for leadership when Making the Case (Step 5) 33Evaluating the VendorPART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 4: EVALUATING THE VENDOR BEST PRACTICE Evaluate vendors across six key variables to find your best partner. If you're struggling to identify a vendor that's right for you, consider engaging external resources, such as the American Telemedicine Association or your state medical association/society for support. Remember to incorporate legal feedback and security standards to make sure risk and liability are properly assessed (Appendix E.2) and reference the AMA's Privacy Principles . 34SELECTING A VENDOR GUIDE (Appendix D.2) 5. USABILITY: User experience of platform for patients and care team members Patient and care team engagement metrics Dashboard/workflow assimilation Multi-specialty application Platform launch process and timing Ease of billing/payout for patients and health systems/practices Diverse users considered in the development and design of the technology and user experience4. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Level of support available to practice during and after implementation\u2014staff training, patient education, project management, data analysis and insights, etc. What technology does the patient need and does the vendor support this? Degree of technical support available to patients Access to existing procedures and templates6. CLINICAL VALIDATION: Documented clinical outcomes Published peer-reviewed research Product and outcomes research includes patients from historically marginalized and minoritized populations1. BUSINESS: Organizational overviewI\u2014 tenure, funding source, financial stability, affiliations, notable customers, etc. Impact to program ROI\u2014 product cost, business model, reimbursement rates, risk sharing, support payment program participation, etc. Expertise in offering telehealth to your specialty Knowledge of federal and private payer requirements Commitment to organizational diversity, equity, and inclusion2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: Ability to integrate with your current IT landscape, particularly your EHR system Cost, process, and timeline associated with integration and product updates Ability to capture data important to care team and patient20 Patient geolocation for licensure Customization capabilities Patient access to data Ability to maintain patient identity across platforms Biometrics/RPM integration capability Information blocking and interoperability requirements (as applicable) Impact analysis on your internet and local network usage3. SECURITY: (APPENDIX D.3) Supports compliance with HIPAA rules, such as willingness to sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) Third-party audits (SOC 2, HITRUST) Liability structure for managing potential security breaches User authentication and authorization Transparency on collected data use processes Local regulatory compliance (i.e., State Medical Board) In-platform consent capabilities 35AVOIDING A MISSTEP Do your due diligence. Don't rely on the sales pitch to provide all the information you need. Ask for case studies and referrals to support the pitch and ask to speak with the product engineers and existing customers to gain a realistic picture of the process to integrate this telehealth solution into your organization. While financial perks such as free trials are tempting, remember to look for a vendor worthy of a long-term partnership.SMALL PRACTICE CALLOUT Value-adds make a big difference for a small group. If you are worried about not having the internal resources to support your implementation, talk with vendors about value- added services they may be able to provide, such as project management, staff and patient training, emergency IT support, patient engagement management, etc. LARGE PRACTICE CALLOUT Anticipate scale from the beginning of your project. Discuss expectations about when and how you intend to scale your program. If you are hoping to scale a program to a large number of patients, consider whether vendors have the resources and infrastructure to support a large-scale rollout within your expected time frame.Evaluating the VendorPART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 4: EVALUATING THE VENDOR 36Practice Spotlight Filter vendors by compliance with your state's regulations. Kristen spent over six months researching the right telehealth vendor for her small endocrinology practice, primarily to serve non-urgent established diabetic patients to help give them quality medical advice and quality medical care in a convenient manner. Kristen consulted with other medical offices and health organizations, began with a simple Google search, and narrowed her options down from 50 to five companies, using legal compliance as the first and foremost basis of her criteria. She contacted COPIC, the Colorado insurance malpractice company, who informed her team that their telehealth partner must support compliance with HIPAA rules and provide a teleconsent, that the patient signs to consent to receive telehealth each visit. By understanding legal restraints early on, Kristen was able to set her practice up for success. \u2014KRISTEN S, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT, ENDOCRINOLOGY PRACTICEQUICK TIP Test technology with a patient advocate, member of a patient advisory board, or staff member unfamiliar with the project. Technology may be too complicated if your test users cannot operate the equipment or process on their own without the help of vendor training. An important aspect when evaluating a vendor is making sure that your patient data is your patient data, and is no way about to be sold, used, de-identified, anonymized, and packaged off to somebody else. \u2014CLINT PHILLIPS, FOUNDER AND CEO OF MEDICI 37Step 5: Making the Case Compile the content you've gathered into a Leadership team proposal. Gaining buy-in from your Leadership team is a key element of long-term success for your telehealth program. Without broader buy-in, it can be challenging to source the resources and prioritize the time needed to make implementation successful. As you build your telehealth program proposal, be sure to share the problem you've identified, how telehealth can solve that problem, can deliver value, and is aligned with organizational goals. Additionally, you'll, want to outline what success looks like and the metrics you will use to keep the team informed of progress. You will also introduce which vendor is most suited for the job based on the initial evaluations and how partnering with them will deliver a positive Return on Health (ROH) for the organization. PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 5: MAKING THE CASE WHY MAKING THE CASE IS IMPORTANT Making the case is integral to getting your organization or practice on board. Communicating your vision opens up the opportunity to: Gain valuable input to improve your program Secure funding Obtain program sponsors to champion the success of your program throughout the organization as you scale 38GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING MAKING THE CASE qClearly define resources needed to move forward with this implementation (funds, additional staff, additional bandwidth, political support, official approval, etc.) qEstimate the budget required to obtain the resources to implement your program including vendor services, equipment, marketing, education, EHR integration, additional personnel resources, etc. qEstimate the value your solution will contribute to the organization if goals are achieved achieved using the AMA's Return on Health framework (Appendix E.4) qCalculate the ROH of your implementation considering the budget and value you've estimated qAlign your implementation with organizational objectives/goals to justify why this is a priority qResearch coding and payment available for your chosen digital health solution (Appendix E.1) and assess your liability and risk (Appendix E.2) qReach out to malpractice insurance carrier to ensure proper coverage qCompile all necessary information in a proposal to the key decision-makers to obtain approval and resources to support your implementation. Below are a few examples of how organizations are using the Return on Health framework to \"make the case:\" Virginia Commonwealth University Health\u2014 Telepsychiatry during COVID-19 Ochsner Health\u2014Hypertension Teleneurology and telestroke Cityblock Health\u2014 Complex care coordination 39Making the Case AVOIDING A MISSTEP Lean into how you'll overcome reimbursement and licensure challenges. Although it may be easy to skip over challenging topics like reimbursement models, interstate licensure, and state- specific laws and regulations, including information in your proposal about how you'll address and work within these challenges shows leadership that your team is realistic about both the benefits and challenges of implementing telehealth.SMALL PRACTICE CALLOUT Don't skip this step even if official alignment isn't necessary. In a small practice, you may not need to pitch to a board of directors or your CEO for approval. However, thoroughly evaluating budget and ROI against your objectives will help determine the impact telehealth will have on your practice. Thinking through key business elements of your project helps you strengthen your plan and increase your probability for success.BEST PRACTICE Use storytelling to engage others in your initiative. Different decision-makers will have varying priorities and interests. Take time to consider what will be most motivational to your organization. Emphasize the ROI metrics that will resonate with your stakeholders. Look for opportunities to share your passion and drive excitement around the project by sharing personal stories that led you to want to implement telehealth in practice, and leverage your patients or a patient advisory board to strengthen your proposal with stories of how telehealth would impact their lives. PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 5: MAKING THE CASE 40QUICK TIP Explore all opportunities for funding. Come to leadership with a plan for how to fund the project, highlighting various options including those beyond traditional funding through reimbursements. That could include creative external funding sources, such as government grants, accelerator sponsorships, or community support. Practices should also inquire about discounts and freebies with vendors. For internal funding, consider where there is room in the budget and what departments might be willing to pitch in and discuss current opportunities for reimbursement with your practice or organizational payer contracting team.\"Telehealth can help boost revenue for our physicians by turning on-call hours into billable time, attracting new patients, reducing no-shows, and even reducing overhead for physicians who decide to switch to a flexible work-from-home model for part of the week. \" \u2014CHAD, ADMINISTRATOR, INTERNAL MEDICINE PRACTICE Standardize and simplify the decision- making process for senior leadership. Getting buy-in was essential to a successful telehealth launch at a federally qualified health center, so the Head of Behavioral Health needed to make the case to the Vice President of Medical at her organization as well as the rest of the executive board. With the aim of improving behavioral and psychiatry services for underserved and rural populations, she used evidence-based metrics to demonstrate that telehealth has promising outcomes. The Head of Behavioral Health's core telehealth committee of three interviewed different telehealth vendors and created a cost-benefit analysis of each, narrowing it down to three bids. She created a clear matrix that compared her key areas of evaluation across the three vendors: the services they offer, the cost, how they rate on policies and procedures, how they rate on customer services, and references that the organization could check. Each vendor was invited to give a demonstration to the executive board. With a clear, organized plan, the Head of Behavioral Health's senior leadership was able to make a cogent decision on the right telehealth partner for their organization. \u2014HEAD OF BEHAVIORAL HEAL TH, FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEAL TH CENTERPractice Spotlight 41Step 6: Contracting Lay the groundwork for a successful long-term vendor relationship. Think beyond financial considerations to align on expectations for how you'll work together and communicate. Discuss the level of support or training you'll expect from them as your partner, and think creatively about where they can provide additional value or share the risk with your organization. Ensure your negotiations and agreed parameters are clearly captured in key legal documents that protect both you and your existing EHR vendor or new partner. PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 6: CONTRACTING 42WHY CONTRACTING IS IMPORTANT A strong contract underpins a successful long-term relationship by providing: Aligned expectations Written, agreed-upon terms to hold each party accountable Legal protection for you and your vendorDisclaimer: This document is for informational purposes only. It is not intended as medical, legal, financial, or consulting advice or as a substitute for the advice of an attorney or other financial or consulting professional. It does not address all possible legal and other issues that may arise with the acquisition of a health information technology product or service. Each health care organization is unique and will need to consider its particular circumstances and requirements, which cannot be contemplated or addressed in this Playbook. A health care organization should seek legal counsel from an experienced attorney whenever it proposes to enter into a legally binding agreement. GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING CONTRACTING qSecure any remaining approvals within your organization to proceed with contracting qNegotiate terms (financial investment, customer support, additional services, upgrade schedule, success metrics, etc.) qDocument clear and measurable definitions of success for your working relationship and the initiative at large qIdentify the timeline for the current contract and outline when terms will be renegotiated qClearly outline the plan to scale your program, and align on any relevant contingency plans qWork with your legal, financial, procurement, or IT teams as necessary to get the new contract signed or existing contract updated (Appendix F.1) 43Contracting SMALL PRACTICE CALLOUT Explore external resources. If you don't have an internal legal and/or compliance team, you may want to invest in obtaining input from a compliance or legal expert. Some state medical associations/societies may be able to provide support. Otherwise, securing outside legal counsel is recommended.AVOIDING A MISSTEP Understand who has access to your patients' data. Many practices don't realize that a digital health service might be low cost or free because the vendor's business model is based on aggregating and selling patients' data. Ensure you are aware of the vendor's privacy practices, intended data use, and your access to the data. Consult with your legal team and clarify how video, audio, and other data are being captured and stored by the vendor and who has access. Ensure the vendor is willing to sign a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA).BEST PRACTICE Think about your contract as a \"Path to Commitment. \" If your original contract only covers an initial rollout of your solution, spend time talking with your vendor about what that larger contract will look like when you are ready to expand. Your scaling plan should consider each partner's financial investments, timing considerations, and success metrics. Clear expectations upfront will help build a healthy, long-term partnership. If for some reason the relationship is not successful, make sure you have a clearly defined exit plan built into your contract to protect your practice from unnecessary risk.PART 2 / PRE-GAME STEP 6: CONTRACTING 44QUICK TIP Negotiate beyond finances. While your contract obviously needs to lay out the financial terms of the deal, you may also be able to negotiate for the inclusion of additional services and future upgrades. Ask about ways your vendor can provide support pre- and post-implementation (training, tech support, workflow design collaboration, data analysis, project management, etc.).Practice Spotlight Ensure easy access to data collection when contracting to save time later when evaluating success. Rather than waiting until the end of initial implementation to secure access to data needed to support your key success metrics, David Cooper of Xealth finds it's best to ensure ongoing access to this data upfront when building out your vendor contract. This way, your team is not held back waiting on data access when they are trying to measure success and show your Leadership team how the telehealth program performed. \u2014DAVID COOPER, MANAGER, STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, XEALTH 45Part 3: Game Time - Telehealth As you move from planning to implementation, your path will require even more detail specific to how the telehealth technology will integrate into your practice. The remaining steps focus on the unique details to consider, including the development of modified or new workflows, preparing care teams and patients, and how to measure success and expand the program. 4647Step 7: Designing the Workflow Document an updated workflow for telehealth visits. Telehealth appointments will likely require an adjusted workflow to ensure that you are offering a positive experience for both your patients and care team. Daily logistics such as your physical workspace arrangement, appointment scheduling procedure, staff time, and communication may have to be altered to integrate telehealth into your organization. Consider how to incorporate telehealth appointments with the least amount of workflow disruption, especially at first, to help seamlessly introduce the technology to your practice. Seek to understand the preferences and needs of both patients and clinicians, such as the times of day that may work best for them and what types of barriers they may have to engaging in a telehealth visit, to ensure your workflow accounts for these details.PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 7: DESIGNING THE WORKFLOW 48GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING DESIGNING THE WORKFLOW qEngage the Implementation team to provide input on workflow design qSolicit feedback from a diverse group of patients to understand their needs, times of day that may work best for appointments, and barriers they may have to engaging in a telehealth visit qDocument your existing clinical and administrative workflow and identify where updates may be necessary (Appendix G.1) qIdentify updated procedures, such as patient and case identification, appointment scheduling, patient training, appointment logistics, consent, platform assistance, and billing qEnsure care will still be provided in a fully legally compliant way (e.g., follows fraud and abuse laws, privacy standards, and other applicable legal requirements) qDefine clear triage protocols for when a telehealth appointment is appropriate (Appendix G.3) and ensure the clinic staff and scheduling teams are trained to distinguish when it is an acceptable alternative to an in-person appointment qIdentify what support clinicians and staff will need to effectively complete a telehealth visit18 qAssign clear roles and responsibilities for any new actions necessary for integration (Appendix H.1) qDocument a new workflow that incorporates necessary changes qPartner with your vendor to identify opportunities for efficiency (e.g., patient communication, rooming, etc.) based on your team's needs qEngage your IT team and/or vendor to understand how to best integrate your workflow into your EHR and establish a plan for emergency tech support qDevelop resources to support and socialize the new workflow (written procedures for each department, communication templates) qCreate a proper environment that will support successful telehealth visits (e.g., strong Wi-Fi connection, sufficient internet bandwidth, quiet/private clear video telehealth test visits qIf you've introduced new technology, make sure you conduct a HIPAA Security Risk Assessment qCollect patient and staff feedback and iterate as necessary 49Workflow Design WHY DESIGNING THE WORKFLOW IS IMPORTANT Telehealth is a new way for practices to interact with patients. A clear workflow is vital to ensure everyone understands their role and how to maximize the value of telehealth through procedures that: Set clear patient and provider expectations Ensure telehealth is used for clinically relevant purposes and adheres to licensure, policy, and reimbursement requirements Streamline the patient experience Preserve the patient-clinician relationship PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 7: DESIGNING THE WORKFLOW 50BEST PRACTICE Ensure your workflow addresses the entire telehealth life cycle. Partner with your clinical champions to determine how best to update your workflow. Remember to incorporate legal feedback and security standards to make sure risk and liability are properly assessed. Then, when adapting your organization-specific workflow, consult the Workflow Design Checklist in Appendix G.1 for specific considerations. DURING THE VISIT AFTER THE VISIT Handling patient intake, \"rooming\" patients Supporting patient and clinician troubleshooting Setting up the exam room Communicating with patients Knowing codes available for telehealth Integrating CPT\u00ae codes and appropriate modifiers into the EHR Sharing visit summary and follow up care2 3BEFORE THE VISIT Patient Engagement and Education: Identifying patients likely to need additional support and developing a plan to set them up for success Educating patients on the offering Setting expectations for use Educating on proper appointment standardsScheduling Protocols: Identifying appropriate clinical use cases Determining when/how telehealth visits will fit into the schedule Updating the EHR scheduler Identifying triage questions for scheduling appointments Ensuring clinicians are only providing care in states where they are licensed Ensuring telehealth is covered in clinicians' liability insurance1 51AVOIDING A MISSTEP Identify proper documentation protocol. To ensure patient access to records , reimbursement for telehealth visits, and ultimately gain buy-in for future scaling, focus on consent and proper documentation in the EHR system when preparing your staff. Ensure you are able to capture and record any necessary patient signatures and consents including practice privacy notices, etc. For relevant CPT\u00ae codes for telehealth visits, see Appendix E.1Workflow DesignPART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 7: DESIGNING THE WORKFLOW 52Practice Spotlight Visualize the workflow with all stakeholders to ensure all perspectives are included and aligned. When Designing the Workflow for a telehealth integration through T.J. Samson Regional Health and the University of Louisville, Dr. Brent Wright found it important to share the vision for the program, then focus on listening to key members of the team including administrative staff, clinical staff, physicians, technology leads, administration stakeholders, and patients. He also found it helpful to diagram the workflow so everyone was visually aligned on the process as well as to update the workflow regularly with team members' advice. \u2014DR. BRENT WRIGHT, ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR RURAL HEALTH INNOVATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE See Appendix G.2. QUICK TIP Incorporate staff feedback to determine your appointment scheduling strategy. Work with your administrative and clinical staff to determine when is best to host telehealth visits. This could be throughout the day, during specific clinic hours, or potentially after-hours if you have the staffing capacity. Discuss how telehealth will be demarcated in your daily schedule and how the care team will be notified. \"A good workflow makes the process easier on all stakeholders (patient, physician, supporting staff). Making sure that all parties know their role is important for smooth workflow as well and increases the chance for successful telehealth visits with satisfied patients who should have better clinical outcomes. \" \u2014SHANNON VOGEL, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR TEXAS MEDICAL ASSOCIATION 53Step 8: Preparing the Care Team Thorough workflow and technical training lead to successful telehealth integration. Getting the rest of your team or practice up to speed on your telehealth vision, technology, and workflow is critical to a smooth rollout. Consider schedulers, physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other members of the care team who have not been part of the implementation thus far but will be using telehealth at the go-live date. Provide technical training on the telehealth platform, new workflow procedures, triage protocols, and patient education materials. To help your team feel prepared, be mindful of their existing responsibilities and discuss expectations honestly and openly18. Ensure everyone knows their role and responsibility for utilizing telehealth to achieve the success metrics outlined in Step 3 (Defining Success). PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 8: PREPARING THE CARE TEAM 54WHY PREPARING THE CARE TEAM IS IMPORTANT Successful implementation of telehealth is a team effort. Your team will serve on the front line, promoting telehealth and engaging patients, so it is important for them to know their role and responsibilities within the implementation (Appendix H.1). Proper staff preparation ensures: Staff understands the importance of the program and is motivated to participate Staff understands their key responsibilities in achieving aligned success metrics New procedures are understood, correctly followed, and documented Staff is prepared to impart both the key benefits of and guidelines for using telehealth with patients GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING PREPARING THE CARE TEAM qTalk with your vendor about available training support qIdentify staff leads who can develop, position, and socialize training materials qIdentify \"superusers\" who can act as ongoing trainers for other staff and physicians, especially as you scale qDevelop (or source from your vendor) written and/or video training materials (scripts, guides, reference documents) that staff can use and refer to for technical aspects of training and on how to conduct virtual visits qSchedule training session(s) qPlan for how and when training will be refreshed/reviewed as needed qEducate staff on the new workflow, clinical protocols, and operation of the telehealth platform qInclude telehealth training for new hires qTrain staff to educate patients (see Step 9: Partnering with the Patient for tools) qConduct internal telehealth test visits qProvide a process/opportunity for staff to provide ongoing feedback to optimize workflow qDevelop a process for onboarding new staff in the event of turnover 55Preparing the Care TeamPART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 8: PREPARING THE CARE TEAM AVOIDING A MISSTEP Give clarity and structure to care team roles. Clearly designate roles and responsibilities so that physicians are focused on clinical tasks and not the administrative aspects of telehealth visits. If there is a lack of clarity about who should be responsible for a task, proactively gain team alignment or else it may not get accomplished consistently.18 Gather input from staff when creating these roles, and be open to further optimizing your workflow to address ongoing relevant feedback and concerns from members of the care team.SMALL PRACTICE CALLOUT Many vendors provide resources for staff training and support. When bandwidth is limited, consider partnering with your telehealth vendor to provide virtual or in-person educational sessions and training materials for end users at your organization. BEST PRACTICE Start with your most enthusiastic clinicians and staff. Although all staff should be educated on and given the opportunity to participate in the initial telehealth implementation, starting with your most enthusiastic staff will help build successful data and case studies to help encourage other less-enthusiastic staff to participate in future scaling efforts. 56QUICK TIP Appoint a staff \"superuser\" to provide ongoing training and support. This person should have an advanced understanding of the telehealth solution and updated workflow to support physicians, advanced practice providers, and staff as needed.Practice Spotlight Equip clinicians and staff for implementation with hands-on training. An operations manager and her team at an academic hospital leveraged both in-person and online training to ensure care team members and staff felt empowered to use the telehealth platform. First, they hosted in-person, position-specific (e.g., physicians vs. administrators) training to help team members understand the basic function and features of the platform they would each use. Then, they hosted online training with similar content but also featured quizzes throughout to help team members learn to do specific skills such as schedule an appointment or actually lead a telehealth appointment via the platform. Overall, this multi-step training process, grounded in the platform itself, allowed team members to become comfortable with the technology across multiple touchpoints before implementing it with patients. \u2014OPERATIONS MANAGER, AN ACADEMIC HOSPITAL\"We were kind of thrown into it without knowing a lot about it, and then we found out as we backed up that our front desk had to be very involved, our billing department had to be involved, our billers actually had to do research before we saw the patients to find out if they actually have a telehealth benefit. And then when we got the patients in, we had to show them how to use it, how to have consent forms. So then when you get into it, there's a lot of things that need to happen. \" \u2014MARYANNE, NURSE PRACTITIONER, PRESBYTERIAN ST. LUKE'S MEDICAL CENTER 57vStep 9: Partnering with the Patient Strategically engage patients to maximize the impact of telehealth. Telehealth visits can only truly be successful when patients are empowered and able to use them. Ensure that they are prepared through a patient-centered approach to engagement and education. As you plan to tell patients about the program, ensure you are prepared to answer questions about appropriate use, how to schedule, accessing the platform, and appointment expectations, and communicate a clear value proposition (Appendix A.2) at multiple touchpoints in order to drive awareness and excitement.PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 9: PARTNERING WITH THE PATIENT 58WHY PARTNERING WITH THE PATIENT IS IMPORTANT Telehealth relies on patient interest, access and engagement.Thorough preparation is vital to ensuring that patients: Are aware of telehealth appointments and the proper use of them Have access to and are confident with the technology Show up prepared for their appointment Feel empowered to troubleshoot issues they encounter GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING PARTNERING WITH THE PATIENT qDevelop (or source from your vendor) a wide variety of patient educational materials to support different learning styles (Appendix I.2) qFinalize patient eligibility criteria for engaging in a telehealth appointment (Appendix G.3) qProgram final patient eligibility criteria into scheduling algorithm qMarket the eligibility criteria to patients with use cases best suited to be addressed using telehealth qFinalize training protocols and educational materials for patients to participate in telehealth appointments qEnsure you are prepared to initiate workflow for telehealth appointments 59Partnering with the PatientPATIENT EDUCATION FLOW A telehealth implementation is only successful when patients are aware of the options, are empowered to use it, and appropriately interact with the platform. Below is a five-step outline of how to educate patients about telehealth and keep them engaged.PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 9: PARTNERING WITH THE PATIENT ANNOUNCE TELEHEALTH LAUNCH Go-live date; Quarterly, Before/after visits; New patient; Plan to message the same patient about three times about telehealth before engagement Messaging: Showcase benefits including increased convenience; increased access to specialized care not locally available; decreased time and money spent getting to care; use cases; evidence; appropriate uses; where to Email Patient portal; TELEHEALTH VISIT REMINDER Timing: Day of visit; 15 minutes before visit Messaging: Walk through check-in process; provide link to meeting Channels: Email; TextFOLLOW-UP CARE Timing: After visit Messaging: Collect patient TextSCALING ANNOUNCEMENTS Channels: Website; Social TELEHEALTH Timing: Once visit is scheduled Messaging: How to download the app or platform; learn more about the Make telehealth an inclusive technology for your patients. To ensure inclusive access and a positive experience for all of your patients, be sure to consider:TECH ACCESS: If your patients may have challenges accessing technology (i.e., rural area, lack of technology, slow connectivity), identify community-based resources and places that they may be able to leverage technology to facilitate a telehealth visit. LANGUAGE BARRIERS: If you do not speak the same language as your patient, plan to have a translator present on your telehealth visit. This could be on-site with the physician or ability to dial in a third party from the telehealth platform. TECH SAVVINESS: Consider having a care team member host a practice session with those patients that may need additional help leveraging the technology prior to their telehealth visit. CAREGIVERS: For patients with caregivers, be sure to communicate to all important parties that telehealth is an option. Look for technology that enable the integration of a third party into virtual visits as needed. AVOIDING A MISSTEP Don't forget to set expectations. Patients must have clear expectations for the appointment (Appendix I.3) to ensure repeat use and success of the program long term. Ensure patients are aware of: Cost expectations: help patients understand the value of paying for virtual services and encourage them to check with their insurance ahead of time to ensure telehealth services are covered (Appendix A.2) Dynamics of the interaction (e.g., visit length, often a more focused visit) Logistical expectations (e.g., strong Wi-Fi connection, private environment, ability for doctor to see them clearly)BEST PRACTICE Partner with patients at multiple touchpoints. Although there may be one role responsible for patient education, relying solely on that person may not lead to the best program outcomes. Instead, inform and educate about telehealth at multiple touchpoints (e.g., patient portal announcements, front-desk reminder, TV screens throughout office, email newsletter reminders, etc.), leveraging talking points about how this will benefit patients (Appendix I.1). This helps build awareness and drive engagement. 61Partnering with the Patient Practice Spotlight Use multi-touchpoint patient education to empower patients to use telehealth. In preparation for Partnering with the Patient, Kristen put together an educational communication toolkit to introduce patients to telehealth and help them feel comfortable using it. This toolkit included a general education handout she created to introduce all patients to telehealth including (1) what telehealth is, (2) what type of visits are and are not appropriate for telehealth, (3) what patients need for a successful appointment, (4) how to connect to an appointment, and (5) a short overview of consent. She also leveraged resources from her vendor including an overview brochure to promote telehealth in the waiting room and a document sent to patients after scheduling an appointment further outlining how to check in for an appointment. \u2014KRISTEN S, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT, ENDOCRINOLOGY PRACTICEPART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 9: PARTNERING WITH THE PATIENT 62\"Telehealth was helpful because my mother, who has Alzheimer's, didn't have to travel because she has limited mobility and osteo arthritis in both of her knees. So it was very good to have. \" \u2014TRACEY , TELEHEALTH PATIENT AND CAREGIVER Telehealth allows patients with chronic conditions greater convenience, swifter management response, and increased engagement in care. In order to cut down on the number of in-person visits and decrease time between testing and taking action for Edwin's lung cancer and COPD treatment, his doctor uses telehealth appointments. Rather than waiting a week or two after blood tests or scans, Edwin and his doctor are now able to connect via telehealth appointments a day or two after testing, allowing them to make better, faster adjustments to medication to deal with the many side effects associated with treatment. Often, when Edwin had these conversations with his doctor during the same appointment as treatment, he was more focused on just getting through treatment than asking questions about medication changes.Now, with a separate telehealth visit not tied to treatment, Edwin feels more willing and able to ask questions, ultimately helping him feel more engaged in his care. \u2014EDWIN, TELEHEAL TH LUNG CANCER AND COPD PATIENT Practice Spotlight 63Step 10: Implementing Launch your telehealth program and execute your plan. Put your new workflows to the test. Particularly with telehealth, you'll focus your energy on scheduling appointments, supporting clinicians and patients as they start using the technology, and ensuring a path to payment. You'll also need to monitor the impact of your program by tracking your key success metrics. Ensure you collect feedback from staff and patients and iterate as necessary. PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 10: IMPLEMENTING 64GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING IMPLEMENTING qOfficially launch the program with some initially scheduled patient visits qBe prepared to support patients with any scheduling or technical issues during the visit qBe prepared to support physicians and care team members with technical issues during telehealth visits qEnsure your patient intake flow is working as intended in your workflow design qSolicit post-visit feedback from staff and patients; adjust procedures as necessary qEnsure you are tracking key success metrics outlined in Step 3 (Defining Success) qEvaluate how documentation and billing procedures are working; adjust as necessaryWHY IMPLEMENTING IS IMPORTANT This is the payoff for all your hard work! During this initial implementation, you'll finally see telehealth in action. Celebrate the work that has gone into the process thus far and recognize how this phase will allow you to: Better understand and communicate with your patients about their condition and care remotely Increase care convenience for improved continuity of care for existing patients Increase access to care for underserved patient populations Demonstrate success to justify scaling the program 65Implementing AVOIDING A MISSTEP In the beginning, allow for extra time for telehealth appointments. Although telehealth appointments should ultimately help better utilize appointment times, ensure you have extra time for telehealth visits early in your initial implementation. This leaves time to troubleshoot technology glitches and get comfortable with this new way of interacting with patients.BEST PRACTICE Don't take shortcuts because you're working within a smaller scope. Design the initial implementation of telehealth as if you were launching it full scale across your organization, including fully updating your workflow and ensuring quality care by initiating a quality assurance program (check out Practice Spotlight for QA program inspiration). Although it may take more planning upfront, it will ease the expansion of your program in the future. PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 10: IMPLEMENTING 66Practice Spotlight We have a number of inspiring patient success stories, for example: one of our providers had a virtual visit with a family with a child with Autism. While this patient had been cared for by Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) providers for years, this was the first time the patient was calm and cooperative during the visit. Being at home allowed the patient to feel comfortable in a familiar environment, so he participated more in the visit, he showed the provider around his room, his toys, and they really bonded on a more meaningful level. \u2014KELLY CROWN, PROGRAM DIRECTOR, VIRTUAL CARE AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES QUICK TIP Ensure patients can consent to care in platform.In order to avoid first-time issues with using a telehealth platform, it can be helpful for patients to be able to consent to telehealth care on the platform itself. That way, patients can use the platform even if they haven't been to the office since the launch to sign consent forms. Include a quality assurance program during implementation to delivery high-quality care. At the time they first implemented their dermatology telehealth program, a Stanford study highlighted gaps in the quality of telemedicine. To avoid gaps in care, and because they were evaluating lesions, Dr. Sarita and her team at Atrius Health decided to put into place a quality assurance program based on the British National Health Service's (NHS) Quality Assurance program to be sure that their diagnostic accuracy was high. Dr. Sarita and the team of seven dermatologists meet quarterly to evaluate anonymous telehealth cases together and correlate their assessments to validate the accuracy of their diagnoses. Her team, thus, optimized their clinical workflow and eligibility criteria to ensure a high-quality standard of care for future telehealth visits and to protect the reputation of their practice. SARITA NORI, DERMATOLOGY , ATRIUS HEAL TH Determine the success of implementing telehealth by revisiting your goals. Focusing on the key success metrics you identified in Step 3 (Defining Success), relevant data points you've collected will allow you to determine whether you've achieved success. In addition to hard metrics, such as number of patients seen via telehealth, reduction in no-shows, and/or clinical outcomes, remember to consider qualitative metrics, such as how telehealth has impacted patient and staff satisfaction and compliance with treatment as a result of access, convenience, and continuity of care. If you haven't hit your goals, determine if this is due to an issue with the telehealth technology, patient engagement, or the organizational implementation. Then, look for opportunities to restructure the program for improvement. If you are achieving success, compile your most compelling data to justify scaling your program for greater impact. PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 11: EVALUATING SUCCESS 68WHY EVALUATING SUCCESS IS IMPORTANT Validate your program's success to secure its future. In order to determine the next step for your program, you have to know how it's performing. Use the AMA Return on Health framework (Appendix E.4) and data collected throughout pre and post implementation to highlight impacts to patient outcomes and access, patient and clinician satisfaction, finances, operational measures, and equity to determine: Next steps to scale the program to expand benefits of telehealth to more patients, conditions, specialties, etc. How to rework the program to better perform against key metrics The most persuasive measures to justify continued or expanded funding GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING EVALUATING SUCCESS qGather data used to track your key success metrics (Appendix J.2; J.3) qCollect feedback from your Implementation team (Appendix J.1) qDetermine your success by comparing this data to the pre-implementation baseline qIf failing to meet goals, revisit your process to identify hurdles to success; rework and iterate as necessary qIf succeeding, gather compelling success metrics into an expansion proposal qConsult your Core and Leadership teams to determine the program's future qAlign on goals for next iteration or phase of the program 69Evaluating Success PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 11: EVALUATING SUCCESS AVOIDING A MISSTEP Evaluate beyond the number of patient visits. Although this can be a sign of patient interest, it may not tell the full story of whether your initial implementation is a success or not. In order to highlight success and gain further buy-in for scaling, ensure your metrics provide a holistic picture of patient and clinician experience (Appendix J.2; J.3), health outcomes, operational efficiencies, access, financial impacts, and health equity. The AMA Return on Health research provides real-world case studies and illustrative scenarios as examples.BEST PRACTICE Clinical success can be slow to measure. It may take six months or longer to prove the clinical results of your program. In the meantime, lean on more immediate measures of success, such as staff and patient satisfaction, utilization rates, and reimbursements received so far to confirm if the program is having an impact. With telehealth, patient engagement with the technology can be a key metric that patients like the program and feel it offers a tangible benefit.QUICK TIP Centralize feedback. Have a centralized platform for collecting feedback such as sending the patient to a survey at the end of a telehealth visit. 70\"I feel this [telehealth] has ensured success with some complicated patients who need to remain compliant on protocols or to tweak medications, supplements, intercurrent illnesses, or those with new onset symptoms. This allows for improved outcomes, better patient/physician communication, and better compliance. \" \u2014ANGELINA FARELLA, PEDIATRICIAN, PRIVIA MEDICAL GROUP Practice Spotlight Clearly defined success metrics allow for a clear picture of telehealth impact. When implementing their telehealth program, Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) clearly outlined measures of success including reduced wait times for visits, decreased absenteeism from school and from work, reduced clinic no-show rates, reduced risks and barriers associated with transporting medically complex patients to CHLA for visits, and improved provider satisfaction through offering alternative care delivery models and new approaches to medical practice. In order to measure the performance of their program, they then defined key success metrics to measure when Evaluating Success. Those defined metrics included but were not limited to: Virtual visit volume Number of providers trained and using virtual care services Number of additional appointments available as a result of virtual visits Patient satisfaction with virtual visits Provider satisfaction with virtual visits Reduced no-show rates for clinic visits Reduced absenteeism from school and work for patients and parents Improved utilization of clinic space and resources As applicable, achievement of established standard of care recommendations (e.g., ADA guidelines for visit frequency for diabetes patients) As applicable, development of new and innovative virtual care models for specific patient populations By defining success criteria and metrics early, CHLA was able to clearly and more easily measure overall telehealth program impact when evaluating success. \u2014KELLY CROWN, PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF VIRTUAL CARE, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES 71Step 12: Scaling As you scale, focus on growing smart, not fast. Leverage your success metrics to position your program for expansion. Consider other areas telehealth can improve your practice. Is there a new patient population you'd like to reach? Another department or location? Once you identify your target for expansion, circle back to Step 7 (Designing the Workflow). Evaluate possible workflow changes to accommodate a larger program, then proceed through the remainder of the steps, modifying your program as needed. PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 12: SCALING 72GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING SCALING qResolve any improvement opportunities identified in the initial implementation qSocialize the success of the telehealth program throughout your organization to generate enthusiasm qSelect your next scaling prospect (i.e., more patients, different visit type, new specialty, etc.) qBudget and secure financing for growth, depending on your vendor contracting model qNegotiate the next phase of your partnership with your vendor qAdjust workflows to account for program growth qRetrain staff or train new staff to account for program growth qEngage new patients qContinue tracking key success metrics for ongoing impactWHY SCALING IS IMPORTANT Don't allow your initial implementation to die or lose momentum. Use the momentum gained with telehealth implementation to: Apply initial implementation learnings to continuously improve the program Improve management of other patient populations and conditions Ensure continuity of care Improve organizational performance against quality and patient satisfaction metrics Increase access to care 73Scaling AVOIDING A MISSTEP Plan to scale from the beginning. A scaling plan should be considered upfront, before the program even goes live. In order to be ready to scale when the time comes, it's best to consider what other populations, conditions, and specialties may benefit from telehealth should the initial implementation prove successful.BEST PRACTICE Streamline administrative tasks. Telehealth can be used for a variety of conditions and patient populations. Prevent creating siloed programs requiring similar yet separate resources. Instead, standardize telehealth across your organization. Consider designing a common assessment to gauge patient and case fit with telehealth, developing training templates that can be customized rather than created from scratch and socializing billing and documentation best practices. PART 3 / GAME TIME STEP 12: SCALING 74\"It can be challenging getting everyone on board, especially some doctors, but all new things take time to accept. To help, we brought in other groups that have implemented telehealth and listened to their stories. \" \u2014DR. JAY C, DERMATOLOGY , PRIVATE PRACTICE Practice Spotlight Leverage internal champions to build excitement for scaling. A team at an urban children's hospital leveraged internal telehealth champions who were telehealth superusers to help build excitement about the program's success, optimize the program for scaling, and train staff that were part of the new scaling efforts. Rather than letting staff new-to-telehealth stumble on their own, they were trained by the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable physicians, nurse practitioners, and other care team members, which helped set not only the staff but also the overall scaling effort up for success. \u2014TELEHEAL TH IMPLEMENTATION TEAM MEMBER, AN URBAN CHILDREN'S HOSPITALQUICK TIP Socialize success to gain further buy-in. Leverage a physician champion and the metrics featured in your Return on Health framework to highlight initial implementation success to help gain buy-in from skeptical parties who may prevent telehealth from scaling to more practices, departments, use cases, and patient populations. Enthusiastically socializing success may help you scale faster.7575This Playbook series is a living document that will be updated to include new content over time.

Specifically, think about how telehealth will improve health outcomes, health equity, patient experience, and provider satisfaction while also reducing costs. The AMA Return on Health framework (Appendix E.4) can also be helpful in identifying areas where telehealth can provide value. In doing so, your implementation is more likely to deliver value to the organization, result in a positive ROI, and set you up for success when Making the Case in Step 5. Below are some specific areas of value to consider when you and your organization are defining the success of your implementation.

The increased industry focus on digital health technology, including telehealth, underscores the need for practices to consider how they will keep their patients' protected health information (PHI) private and secure. Generally, once outside data is incorporated into the patient's electronic medical record, it becomes PHI. Physicians are responsible for the privacy and security of PHI under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS: Cybersecurity is not just a technical issue; it's a patient safety issue. 4 out of 5 physiciansii have experienced some form of cyberattack. While inappropriate employee use and disclosure of PHI (e.g., inappropriate sharing or selling of patient information) are more of a concern among large health systems, phishing and viruses are the most common types of cyberattacks in small practices. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HOW CYBERSECURITY CAN AFFECT YOUR PRACTICE/ORGANIZATION: Cyberattacks can cause interruptions in practice operations, compromised electronic health records (EHR) security, and direct threats to patient well-being. 2 out of 3 physicians have experienced downtime of up to four hours because of a cyberattack; 1 in 10 have experienced downtime of up to two days. WHAT YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHEN IMPLEMENTING TECHNOLOGY: Your practice's health information technology (health IT) networkiii is comprised of several different components, and it is important to consider all of them when figuring out how to securely implement new technology. For example, not only are your practice's internet connection and EHR part of your network but also things like copiers, telephones, and practice management systems. You must also consider how a new telehealth solution will impact your health IT network, especially if outside your current EHR vendor. Physicians need to look at their networks holistically to ensure that all the \"entry\" and \"exit\" points for information coming in and out of the practice are effectively protected. Only 20% of small practices have internal security officers, so they typically rely on health IT vendors for security support. Physicians should understand basics about cybersecurityiv so that they are well informed enough to ask vendors the right questions. Such knowledge will help to equip physicians with the autonomy they need to confidently implement new technologies into their practice. 100Cybersecurity 101: What You Need to Know (Cont.) APPENDIX D.3: EVALUATING THE VENDOR WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT REGULATION: While evaluating whether or not to implement telehealth technology in your practice, consider whether it would be appropriate to conduct or update a HIPAA security risk assessment.v Additional protections, in addition to HIPAA compliance, may be considered. Information might come into your practice through medical devices and patient apps. HIPAA may not apply to medical device manufacturers or patient apps, so physicians must be extra diligent when evaluating how to incorporate information from those sources. Medical devices, like computer systems, can be vulnerable to security breaches, potentially impacting the safety and effectiveness of the device. Medical device manufacturers and health care facilities should take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not conduct cybersecurity premarket testing for medical devices. vi Testing is the responsibility of the device manufacturer. Manufacturers are responsible for remaining vigilant about identifying risks and hazards associated with their devices, including risks related to cybersecurity. They are responsible for putting appropriate mitigations in place to address patient safety risks and ensure proper device performance. iAmerican Medical Association.

The resource below is based on coding and payment policies that were in place before the pandemic; however, we recognize that there has been an expansion of telemedicine coverage for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payers. Please visit the Telemedicine Quick Guide for the latest updates and information: https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/ama-quick-guide-telemedicine-practice. INTRODUCTION Determining whether there is coverage and payment for digital medicine services and technologies that you want incorporated into your practice will require research and planning. This resource is designed to highlight several digital medicine services covered and paid separately by Medicare on the Physician Fee Schedule (Medicare Part B). Commercial health insurers and government health care programs may have very different coverage policies as well as different payment. However, both commercial and state Medicaid programs are influenced by Medicare's policies, so it is anticipated that other health insurers will expand coverage as well. AMA DIGITAL MEDICINE PAYMENT ADVISORY GROUP Coding and payment for digital medicine is a work in progress, but significant gains have been made in 2018 as Congress and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have authorized coverage of a number of digital medicine services and modalities beginning January 1, 2019. The Digital Medicine Payment Advisory Group (DMPAG) plays an important role by recommending clinical validation literature to support coverage of a number of the new digital medicine modalities and proposing coding changes to the CPT Editorial Panel that have resulted in new codes for Digital Medicine services. The DMPAG, convened by the AMA, includes a diverse cross-section of leading experts who identify barriers to digital medicine adoption and propose comprehensive solutions for coding, payment, and coverage while also identifying clinical validation literature and evidence. OVERVIEW OF DIGITAL MEDICINE SERVICES AND PAYMENT This resource will provide information on the digital medicine services summarized below. Commercial and private payer coverage will vary, so it will be important to do your research on your practice's payer mix and proactively identify those that may cover some or all of these services. Engage team members who oversee payer contracting and leverage them to initiate conversations with payers over digital medicine coverage. Telehealth visits Online digital visits Remote evaluation of pre-recorded patient information Remote physiologic monitoring Remote therapeutic monitoring Interprofessional internet consultations Telephone evaluation and management services 102Navigating Digital Medicine Coding & Payment (Cont.) APPENDIX E.1: MAKING THE CASE TELEHEALTH VISITS Synchronous audio/visual visit between a patient and clinician for evaluation and management (E&M). CODE* DESCRIPTION CPT\u00ae Code 99202-99205 POS 02 for Telehealth (Medicare) Modifier 95 (Commercial Payers)Office or other outpatient visit for the evaluation and management of a new patient CPT\u00ae Code 99211-99215 POS 02 for Telehealth (Medicare) Modifier 95 (Commercial Payers)Office or other outpatient visit for the evaluation and management of an established patient *A list of all available codes for telehealth services can be found here: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General- Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes Medicare pays for telehealth on a limited basis: when the beneficiary receiving the service is in a designated rural area and when they leave their home and go to a clinic, hospital, or certain other types of medical facilities for the service. Check with your payer to determine the appropriate Place of Service (POS) code for your telehealth visits. The AMA is aware that some commercial payers are requiring the use of POS 02 - Telehealth (the location where health services and health-related services are provided or received through a telecommunication system). ONLINE DIGITAL VISITS These services are the kind of brief check-in services furnished using communication technology that are employed to evaluate whether or not an office visit or other service is warranted. When the check-in services are furnished prior to an office visit, then the Medicare program considers them to be bundled into the payment for the resulting visit, such as through an evaluation and management (E/M) visit code. However, in cases where the check-in service does not lead to an office visit, then there is no office visit with which the check-in service can be bundled. Therefore, Medicare will cover and pay for such services to the extent these are medically necessary and reasonable. 103Navigating Digital Medicine Coding & Payment (Cont.) APPENDIX E.1: MAKING THE CASE ONLINE DIGITAL VISITS (CONT.) CODE DESCRIPTION CPT\u00ae Code 99421 Online digital evaluation and management service, for an established patient, for up to seven days, cumulative time during the seven days: 5-10 minutes CPT\u00ae Code 99422 11-20 minutes or more minutes CPT\u00ae Code 98970 Qualified non-physician health care professional online digital assessment and management, for an established patient, for up to seven days, cumulative time during the seven days: 5-10 minutes CPT\u00ae Code 98971 11-20 minutes or more minutes HCPCS Code G2012 Brief communication technology-based service, e.g., virtual check-in, by a physician or other qualified health care professional who can report evaluation and management services, provided to an established patient, not originating from a related E/M service provided within the previous seven days nor leading to an E/M service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment: 5-10 minutes of medical discussion Additional coverage requirements for use of HCPCS Code G2012 include: Advance patient content: Practitioners must obtain advance consent for the service and document in the patient's record. This service is only covered for established patients. The technology that can be used by the patient includes real-time, audio-only telephone interactions and synchronous, two-way audio interactions that are enhanced with the video or other kinds of data transmission. Telephone calls that involve only clinical staff cannot be billed using this code. 104Navigating Digital Medicine Coding & Payment (Cont.) APPENDIX E.1: MAKING THE CASE REMOTE EVALUATION OF PRE-RECORDED PATIENT INFORMATION CMS has created a service code to support remote evaluation of recorded video and/or images submitted by an established patient. CODE DESCRIPTION HCPCS Code G2010 Remote evaluation of recorded video and/or images submitted by an established patient (e.g., store and forward), including interpretation with follow-up with the patient within 24 business hours, not originating from a related E/M service provided within the previous seven days nor leading to an E/M service or procedure within the next 24 hours or soonest available appointment Additional coverage requirements for use of this code include: Advance patient content: Practitioners must obtain advance consent for the service and document in the patient's record. This service is only covered for established patients. Services may involve pre-recorded, patient-generated still or video images and may be used to determine whether or not an office visit or other service is warranted. Follow-up with the patient could take place via phone call, audio/visual communication, secure text messaging, email, or patient portal communication and must be compliant with HIPAA. Service is distinct from the virtual check-in service in that this service involves the practitioner's evaluation of a patient- generated still or video image transmitted by the patient and the subsequent communication of the practitioner's response to the patient. 105Navigating Digital Medicine Coding & Payment (Cont.) APPENDIX E.1: MAKING THE CASE REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING Effective January 1, 2018, Medicare began coverage and payment for the collection and interpretation of physiologic data digitally stored and/or transmitted by the patient and/or caregiver to the physician or other qualified health care professional (CPT\u00ae Code 99091).

It is not intended as medical, legal, financial, or consulting advice, or as a substitute for the advice of an attorney or other financial or consulting professional. It does not address all possible legal and other issues that may arise with the acquisition of a health information technology product or service. Each health care organization is unique and will need to consider its particular circumstances and requirements, which cannot be contemplated or addressed in this Playbook. A health care organization should seek counsel from an experienced attorney whenever it proposes to enter into a legally binding agreement. When adopting any new technology, you will need to understand and assess your liability and risk. Some common legal risks and liability questions associated with digital medicine may include but are not limited to: Medical liability Licensing Consent Privacy and security Considerations to assess in order to understand potential liability and attempt to mitigate risk when implementing digital health solutions may include but are not limited to: Check to see whether or not your malpractice carrier covers digital health practices under your current policy. Some carriers may require disclosures of these practices to receive coverage. Know your federal and state laws around various types of digital medicine. Different states may have different definitions, statutes, regulations, sub-regulatory guidance, or case law as it relates to the licensing, practicing digital health, and consent. States may differ as to whether you need to have an established physician-patient relationship prior to performing telemedicine (and potentially other digital health solutions) and may also have different requirements for informed consent related to telemedicine and telehealth. Determine whether you will need to update any informed consent forms to comply with new and modified telehealth laws. All conversations with patients regarding digital health solutions should be an open, two-way discussion about the benefits, risks, alternatives, and potential consequences in choosing to use (or not) digital health solutions. Digital health solutions can be negatively impacted by loss of internet or power, software incapability, interrupted or slow internet transmissions, and more. Delays in care without proper backup plans can result in serious consequences to patients. To assess and balance potential liability, it's beneficial to have a plan in place in case the digital health solution fails and to discuss the plan and alternatives with patients. This topic may also be addressed in contracting with the digital health solution vendor. Protect yourself and your organization/practice during the contract process with your future vendor partner. Some contract provisions that relate to liability include but are not limited to: Indemnity clauses - The clause, among others, addresses and apportions certain risks between contracting parties. It often specifies under what conditions each party must compensate the other party for intentional or unintentional harms, claims, or other liabilities. You may be able to manage your potential risk by limiting your overall or total liability to a manageable amount through a specific dollar cap, the amount of your investment, or other ways. Choice of Law Provision - This clause dictates what state, federal, or international laws the contract operates under. Make sure you are comfortable with the jurisdiction chosen. Technology has increased connectivity and collaboration in all facets of the health care delivery systems, so particular attention should be paid to the cybersecurity practices at your organization as well as with your future digital health vendor. In all situations, however, you should obtain legal advice from an experienced attorney whenever you are entering into a legally binding agreement. 110AMA Return on Health Framework APPENDIX E.3: MAKING THE CASE The American Medical Association's \"Return on Health\" framework was designed to articulate the value of digitally enabled care that accounts for ways in which a wide range of virtual care (telehealth) programs can increase the overall health and generate positive impact for patients, clinicians, payors and society. The integration of new digital health solutions into digitally enabled care models offers the potential to address the quadruple aim in a new era of high access, high quality, lower cost and high experience care. The framework outlines the value streams to consider when you and your organization are defining, measuring, and evaluating the success of your implementation.

Below are the key questions and criteria to keep in mind: GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS qHow will the telehealth technology integrate with the EHR if it isn't through your existing EHR setup? qHow will clinicians document telehealth visits? into the clinic/clinician schedule? qWhere will telehealth visits take place in the clinic (e.g., administrative office, specific exam room)? qHow do patients first hear about telehealth? (e.g., from health care practitioner (HCP) during appointment, read in waiting room, read on website, email announcement) qHow do patients learn more about telehealth? (e.g., designated staff, website, email) qHow do patients register for telehealth? qWhat reimbursement model makes most sense for your practice (e.g., bill insurance, flat fee for patient)? qWho will keep track of developing reimbursement policies? qAre the appropriate codes available in the EHR system? qDo the care team members know what documentation is required for telehealth billing? 115Key Considerations When VISIT POST-VISIT Identification q How will eligible patients be identified for telehealth appointments? q How do patients know if they and/ or their case is eligible for a telehealth appointment? (e.g., digital triaging of patients to in-person or telehealth) q What workflows and resources do we need to support patients with barriers to accessing telehealth including limited digital literacy or limited English proficiency? q When there is coordination between providers, how will information exchange occur? q How do we ensure the clinician is licensed in the patient's state? Education q What type of preparation education is needed? (e.g., how to download and use platform, visit expectations) q Who educates the patient on telehealth? Communication q How will patients be reminded of appointments? q Who sends appointment reminders? q Who will field patient questions? q How are appointments scheduled? (e.g., time blocks vs. throughout the day; digitally vs. manually) q How will you ensure eligible and interested patients are covered? Administrative q How will patients \"check in\" for their appointment? q Who will get patients set up on the platform (e.g., \"room\" them)? q How will patient consent be obtained and stored? q Who ensures the HCP's room is set up? (e.g., clean, quiet, Wi-Fi working) q Who troubleshoots with the patient and/or HCP? q How many people need to be ready to answer patient and/or HCP questions? q How does the handoff to the provider take place? Clinical q Which care team member(s) is providing virtual care? q What is the record-keeping workflow? (e.g., codes and modifiers to include in note) q What are the protocols for telehealth patients?Clinical q How are prescriptions or follow-up tests ordered? q How is the care plan entered? Administrative q When and how will patient follow-up be conducted? q How often are patients expected to have an in- person visit and how is that communicated to patients? q How is feedback collected? Managing Coding and Billing q Who will verify insurance eligibility and manage authorization? q How is payment collected? q Who will manage reimbursement paperwork? q Who will track reimbursement status? q Who will work with insurance companies to ensure billing is correct? q Who will follow up on rejected reimbursements?

Consider incorporating messaging into practice marketing and communications and featuring it on your patient portal or in newsletters, emails, and SMS. We are now offering telehealth services! (Clinic/health system name) is now offering telehealth visits as an additional way to interact with you. What is telehealth? For the purposes of this Playbook, we focus on telehealth, a digital health solution that connects the patient and clinician through real-time audio and video technology. It can be used as an alternative to traditional in-person care delivery, and, in certain circumstances, can be used to deliver care such as the diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management, and self-management of patients. Benefits of telehealth include: No transportation time or costs Reduced wait time More detailed and personalized care compared to a telephone call (Include a statement about data encryption, storage, privacy, and HIPAA compliance.) What types of visits can telehealth be used for? Telehealth is best suited for interactions with established patients who do not require a physical exam or lab work. Examples would be insulin adjustments, review of continuous glucose monitoring data, dietary counseling, and follow-up after a medication change.What types of visits are not appropriate for telehealth? Telehealth is not suited for physical examination and lab testing. Examples of services that require in-person evaluation include A1C testing every three months, acute illness evaluation, or new problems. Telemedicine cannot be used for new-patient evaluations. What is needed to connect for an online appointment? You will need a video camera, microphone, headphones (optional), and strong internet connection. You will need to use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari browser if using a computer. You may also use Android or Apple iOS cellular phone devices. (Update as needed for your platform.) At your appointment time, you will access the portal by (include platform-specific instructions). Consent to treat you via telehealth You will need to sign a telehealth consent form prior to your visit, allowing our office to conduct a telehealth appointment.

It can be used as an alternative to traditional in-person care delivery, and, in certain circumstances, can be used to deliver care such as the diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management, and self- management of patients. Who is telehealth for? All established patients who have access to and are willing to use technology for a visit with their physician or advanced practice provider. Patients must also meet clinical protocols that allow for a telehealth visit. When should I use telehealth? When you need to contact your health care provider about personal health information, lab results, prescription management, follow- up care, or urgent care that may not need a physical, in-person exam.Why other patients like telehealth: 1. More convenient: Care when you need it, from the comfort of your home. No travel costs or hassles. 2. Better patient experience: No waiting rooms or long queues. Less risk of spreading or contracting infectious disease. Who will pay for virtual visits? Many insurance companies and employer-sponsored health plans will pay.
