Objectives A systematic review of the published clinical data in view of the safety and e\u0000cacy/effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment protocols in Gout viz-a-viz Vatarakta. Methods We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials: Issue 6 of 12, June 2018), Google Scholar, AYUSH Research Portal (Govt. of India), DHARA, Ancient Science of Life, Shodhganga@INFLIBNET, Online clinical trial registers, and grey literature available from Government Ayurveda College, Trivandrum (Manual search) IPGT & RA, Gujrat Ayurveda University. We excluded abstract-only publications. We could not do a meta-analysis due to the unavailability of relevant studies. Study eligibility criteria: Cases diagnosed as Gout by laboratory \u0000ndings and/or clinical symptoms, who underwent Ayurvedic treatment/Cases clinically diagnosed as Vatarakta, who underwent Ayurvedic treatment. Participants and interventions and controls: We included participants of either sex satisfying the inclusion criteria who underwent Ayurvedic treatment either Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), Quasi-Experimental Trials, Single group clinical trials, Comparative Clinical Trials (CCTs), and Pragmatic trials. Results A total of 398 potentially relevant studies were found, and 21studies met the inclusion criteria, among which ten studies were pre-post studies, seven studies were included among Randomized Comparative Clinical Trials, and four were among Comparative clinical trials. Conclusions and implications of key \u0000ndings Even though Ayurveda physicians are pragmatically treating/rehabilitating Vatarakta/Gout cases and reported satisfactory results in terms of both safety and e\u0000cacy/effectiveness, this review is unable to produce strong valid evidence to prove the e\u0000cacy/effectiveness and safety of Ayurveda over Non-Ayurveda interventions or Placebo due to lack of quality and unavailability of published works. So the authors propose well-organized and methodologically sound quality research works in this regard. Systematic review registration number- PROSPERO (CRD42019131198) Introduction Ayurveda, the science of life, gives a holistic approach to an individual's physical, mental, and social health. It is the Indian traditional system of medicine, which gives utmost importance to the preventive and curative aspects of healthcare. Vatashonita(VS) or Vatarakta (VR)in Ayurvedic parlance closely resembles Gout. Etiology, Pathology, and clinical features are common under both these headings (1). Gout is a metabolic disorder that causes in\u0000ammation of the joints. Due to the excessive buildup of uric acid crystals in the body, tiny needle-shaped crystals of uric acid accumulate over joints which, in turn, trigger in\u0000ammation(2). According to available data, the worldwide prevalence of Gout ranges from 0.1% to approximately 10%, and the incidence ranges from 0.3 to 6 cases per 1,000 persons. Genetic and environmental factors play a signi\u0000cant role in contributing to the disease. Other major risk factors for Gout include hyperuricemia, dietary factors, medications, co-morbidities, and exposure to lead (3). Mortality is higher in individuals with cardiovascular co-morbidity. Tophi, joint deformity, osteoarthritis, bone loss, and ocular complications like conjunctivitis, uveitis, or scleritis are very common in Gout patients. Major complications like urate nephropathy and nephrolithiasis are not uncommon. Increased prevalence of Gout among individuals with chronic diseases such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, etc., increases the disease burden and risk of death (4) (5) (6) (7). Patients usually present with acute joint pain. The pain is usually of sudden onset waking the patient from sleep, or it may have developed gradually over hours,reaching the maximum intensity in 24 hours (8). The pain will be excruciating. Gout \u0000are-ups are often presented as local in\u0000ammation, which is erythematous, swollen, and a warm joint. Systemic features of the joint in\u0000ammation may include fever,Page 3/15fatigue, and general malaise (9).Even though conventional treatment for Gout is suitable for managing symptoms, long-term adverse effects on vital organs are of great concern (10). As already mentioned,Gout closely resembles Vatarakta in Ayurvedic parlance, where the vitiation of Vata and Rakta causes the manifestation of the disease in joints. Vatarakta is characterized by Ruk (severe pain), Swayathu (swelling), Daha (burning sensation), StabdhaSandhi (joint stiffness), Shyava (blackish-red color), and Sparsasahatwa (severe tenderness and hyperesthesia) in the affected joint. The characteristic feature of this disease is that it begins at the Hasta or PadaMoolam (small joints of hands and foot) and spreads quickly like rat poison or Akhuvisha(11). Research works on Ayurvedic treatment for Gout is not yet compiled and analyzed. A systemic review of Ayurveda interventions is of utmost importance to provide knowledge in detail regarding the safety and e\u0000cacy/effectiveness of Ayurveda interventions concerned in this regard. Asystematic review is de\u0000ned as a comprehensive review of literaturethatdiffers from a traditional literature review in that it is conducted in a methodical (or systematic) manner, according to a pre-speci\u0000ed protocol to minimize bias, to synthesize the retrieved information (12). Assessments of the validity of the \u0000ndings were carried out in detail to assess the safety and e\u0000cacy/effectiveness of Ayurveda interventions for the management of Gout. This study thoroughly reviewed published data and gray literature on Ayurveda management of Gout viz-\u00e0-vizVatarakta to establish its safety and clinical effectiveness. This study shall provide more precise estimates of various Ayurveda interventions' effects in the management of Gout either as stand-alone or as an add-on to conventional management. Methods The protocol for this review was published in a peer-reviewed journal (13). 2.1. Search strategy For electronic searches, we used PubMed, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials: Issue 6 of 12, June 2018), Google Scholar, AYUSH Research Portal (Govt. of India), DHARA, Ancient Science of Life, Shodhganga@INFLIBNET and Online clinical trial registries for identi\u0000cation of trials. We have done a manual search in the Central and departmental libraries of Govt. Ayurveda College, Trivandrum; IPGT & RA, GAU, Jamnagar with due permissions and Ayurveda Research Database from authorities. There were no language restrictions. Studies published to date (November 2020) were sought. We repeated the searches just before the \u0000nal analyses, and further studies were retrieved for inclusion. 2.2 Inclusion criteria Types of interventions We included clinical trials with the following intervention and control groups. 1. Intervention - Ayurvedic treatment protocol (Shamana or/and Shodhana) with different dosage forms, types, schedules, drugs, treatment procedures, with or without Pathayapathya (Lifestyle modi\u0000cations and or speci\u0000c diet charts). 2. Control - Ayurvedic treatment protocol (Shamana or/and Shodhana) with different dosage forms, types, schedules, drugs, treatment procedures, with or without Pathayapathya (Lifestyle modi\u0000cations and or speci\u0000c diet charts) were the comparative group to intervention(s)/ exposure(s).Placebo and/or sham therapy and/or Shamana therapy were also considered. 2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment 1. Selection of studies: To determine the studies to be assessed further, three authors (APS, PPN, and SGN) independently scanned the abstracts andtitles. 2. The screening of the search results: Three investigators independently screened all citations and abstracts identi\u0000ed by a comprehensive primary search and sorted out potentially eligible trials. Full articles of potentially eligible trials were obtained and independently evaluated for inclusion in the review based on prede\u0000ned inclusion criteria. 3. Data extraction and management: A data extraction and management form was prepared, which included 1) Methods used in the study (Randomization/ allocation concealment/blinding/ sampling and sample size calculation/length of follow up) 2) Participant characteristicsof individual studies (along with disease characteristics/ Number of participants randomized/ Number of participants completing follow up/ reasons for withdrawal from the study) 3) Interventions (Treatment protocol administered/ Formulations used/Page 4/15SOP's administered/) and 4) Outcomes (in terms of safety/e\u0000cacy/effectiveness/ Improvement in QoL). For each outcome measured from individual studies, efforts were taken to discuss the risk of bias, consistency, precision, and reporting bias. We \u0000xed disagreements if any in data extraction by open communication and ensured the concluding remark was in accord. When needed, data was sought from the authors of the studies.(For details, see characteristics of studies and PRISMA \u0000ow chart (Table 1 & Fig 1) (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) (Liberati 2009)(14) (15). 4. Dealing with duplicate publications In the case of identical publications and companion papers of a principal study, we tried to maximize the yield of information by simultaneous evaluation of all available data. In cases of doubt, the original publication (usually the oldest version) was given priority. 5. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two authors (APS and PPN) independently assessed each trial. We resolved any disagreements by consensus or consultation with a third author (SGN). We evaluated the risk of bias by using the Cochrane RoB tool (Fig 2 and 3) (Sterne JAC 2019). We used the Measures of treatment effect: The treatment effect was measured by using data available in the individual studies. 6. Unit of analysis issues: The levels at which randomization was done and the effect of interventions in the included studies. Dealing with missing data, we obtained relevant missing data if needed from the authors themselves. We cautiously assessed such as screened patients, randomized patients, and ITT (Intention to treat) and PP (Treated and per-protocol) population. We investigated dropouts, losses to follow-up, and ADR/AE (Adverse Drug Reaction or Adverse Events). 2.4 Data presentation We presented the characteristics of each study with the type of study, sample size, outcome measures, \u0000ndings, and adverse events so that the readers can easily access the risk and bene\u0000ts of each study (Table 1). Results As shown in \u0000g.1, we found 398 potentially relevant studies after searching electronic databases and grey literature. After analysis of the titles and abstracts, we excluded 377 trials because they didn't meet the inclusion criteria. 21 studies were included in this review, among which ten studies were pre-post studies, seven studies were included among Randomized Comparative Clinical Trials, and four among Comparative clinical trials- (Figure 1) (Table 1) (16-36) Risk of bias in included studies Out of seven RCTs selected for the review, only two studies had blinding (single blinding) in the procedure (2 studies conducted by Kuvettu H et al., 2016). All remaining others were open trials. Two of them were three-arm trials (AfshanBegam et al., 2019; VishwajeetManjhi et al., 2015), and the remaining studies had only two arms (Aditya Acharya K et al., 2013; Praveshet al., 2019; Kuvettu H et al., 2016 (2)).The risk of bias assessments is summarized in Figures2 3. The bias assessment of Non-randomized- comparative parallel design is outlined in \u0000gure 4. Effect of Ayurvedic herbal preparations/ Ayurvedic procedures No study was reported or designed to investigate complications, hospitalizations, death from any cause, and economic data. Adverse Effects-Adverse effects were not reported in any of the studies. Discussion This review included trials on Vatrakta or Gout. While searching electronic databases and grey literature, there are discrepancies in diagnosing cases such as gouty arthritis to Vatarakta by some authors. Some authors considered RA, ischemic conditions, psoriatic arthritis, SLE, peripheral ischemia, etc. as Vatarakta. The nonuniformdiagnosis was the major problem faced while screening and selecting trials. We included cases diagnosed as Vatarkta/Gout based on signs and symptoms of Vatarakta and serum uric acid levels and excluded patients diagnosed as RA, SLE, psoriatic arthritis, etc. Few studies used only pure Ayurveda diagnostic criteria which were also included in this review.Page 5/15Out of sevenRCTs selected for the review, only two studies had blinding (single blinding) in the procedure, and all remaining others were open trials.Two of them were three-arm trials, and the remaining studies had only two arms. Subgroup analyses were performed in one study, but only for participant variables such as Prakruti and Agni, not for assessment parameters. One thousand seventy-three participants from these seven studies diagnosed with Gout were randomly allocated into study and comparison groups. The sample size varies from 462 to 30 in RCTs. The method of sampling was mentioned only in one study. Six studies used classical symptoms of Vatarakta as per Ayurveda and elevated serum uric levels as the diagnostic parameter for Gout, whereas one study used only the classical symptoms of Vatarakta as the diagnostic feature.Out of the seven RCTs, the interventions in 3 studies were only internal medications. In the remaining four studies, three had procedures such as Basti treatment in one group, while the fourth one had Pradeha (local applicants). A similar comparator was found in only one study. Four non-randomized comparative parallel design studies were included in the review; three studies clearly described the interventions, while one study had not mentioned this vividly. The assessment criteria were purely based on signs and symptoms of Vatarakta in one study;Ayurvedic parameters like Sandhishula (musculoskeletal pain), Sandhishotha, (burning sensation), Stabdhata (stiffness), Shithilata (instability/loosening of joints) along with modern parameters in another study.The third study used the American College of Rheumatology 1980 classi\u0000cation criteria. There was no clarity in the assessment parameter, age speci\u0000city, and procedure adopted in the fourth study. Out of ten non-comparative before-after trials, \u0000ve trials were about the effect of simple formulations or single drugs. Four trials comprised interventions with internal medication along with some procedures and one trial was about the impact of leech therapy. The signi\u0000cant change in e\u0000cacy/effectiveness between groups of each study was slight as there was a little difference in interventions adopted in the study and comparators groups. Understandably, the chances of confounders could not be excluded as there was no proper randomization in most of the studies. Only the effect of the individual intervention/Panchakarma procedure as part of a treatment protocol can be assessed in single-group, before-after trials. The rational value of such interventions can't be understood unless an RCT is conducted. Thus the following drawbacks exist while the systematic review of all these studies. The method of randomization was not proper in most of the trials. Hence, studies with the correct methods of randomization and blinding will give more unbiased results. Few trials are a combination of procedures and medications. Hence, the protocol for a black box or Pragmatic trials will be more suitable than strict RCTs. Replications of the same or similar studies, i.e. in terms of population, intervention, and assessment criteria, are needed to establish the effectiveness of protocols. Proper follow-ups were not mentioned in any of the studies to discuss the effect of sustenance. These studies did not state quality control measures to get a consistent and replicable result. Most studies did not mention proper statistical measures with valid signi\u0000cance levels in most. Hence it will be challenging to give a conclusive remark on the cumulative e\u0000cacies or effects of Ayurvedic treatment or protocols in Vatarkta/gout with these published documents. However, the effectiveness of such protocols is clinically evident in real settings. Conclusion Even though Ayurveda physicians are pragmatically treating/rehabilitating Vatarakta/gout cases and reported satisfactory results in terms of both safety and e\u0000cacy/effectiveness, this review is unable to produce strong valid evidence to prove the e\u0000cacy/effectiveness and safety of Ayurveda over Non-Ayurveda interventions or Placebo due to lack of quality and unavailability of such trials. So the authors propose well-organized and methodologically sound quality research works in this regard.
