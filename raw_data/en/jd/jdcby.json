We have determin ed that you are unlawfully advertising that certain products or services that you se ll online or in your clin ic treat or prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some examples of Coronavirus treatment or prevention claims on your website include: In marketing materials titled \"Coronavirus: What to Do,\" you claim that intravenous therapies you provide can trea t or cure COVID-19: \"Conventi onal medicine has little to offer to prevent or treat cor onavirus infections... It is time for you to take the initiative and learn what other therapies are out there . . . My last recommendation is to work with a holistic doctor who can give you nutrient IVs when you become ill. Vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone IVs can help a nyone suffering from an infection. At my office, The Center for Holistic Medicine, we have seen the positive results a holistic approach to combatting viruses can provide.\" In marketing materials titled \"Coronavirus : What to Do,\" you claim that iodine supplementation \" is essential to not only fighting o ff an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine. . . . I suggest taking 25 mg/day as a daily dose and more (sometimes 50-100 mg/day) at the first sign of an illness.\" Page 2 of 4 In marketing materials titled \"Coron avirus: What to Do,\" you claim, \" First, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nut rients, particularly vitamins A, C, and D. Most people have suboptimal vitamin A a nd C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack. If you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/hour unt il diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period. For vitamin A, I suggest usi ng 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness... Also, vitamin D is very important for fighting infections. I suggest, at the onset of an illness, taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/day for four days.\" In marketing materials titled \"C oronavirus Part II,\" you claim: \"At my office, we find great success with doi ng IV nutrient therapy wh en our patients are ill with a viral or bacterial in fection. I received a note from a physician colleague of mine (a \"Yooper\") who, at my request, gave hims elf a hydrogen peroxide IV and recovered from the flu in a day. Intrav enous vitamin C, glutathione and ozone are other therapies that also help with viral infections. Holistically, there are a lot of things to do for a viral infection like coronavirus. Conventionally, there is little to offer. My best su ggestion? Become a patient at the Center for Holistic Medici ne. We have many safe and e ffective therapies to treat viral, bacterial, parasitic , and yeast infections.\" In marketing materials titled \"85 COVID Pa tients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths,\" you cl aim that your \"protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine\" and \"intravenous nutri ent therapy\" should be \"the first-line treatment provided in any COVID patient.\" In marketing materials titled \"85 COVID Pa tients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths,\" you cl aim that your vitamin-based protocol \"was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patie nts. I (and my partners) have no doubt that the vast majority of COVID patients would a void a deterioration of their symptoms if they started this protocol at the outset of symptoms.\" In marketing materials titled \"85 COVID Pa tients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths,\" you claim that, \"At my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine (CHM), we have had 85 COVID patients. At this time, no one has been hospitalized, no one has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there have been no deaths.... I first reported to you about C OVID on January 26, 2020. That was the first time I presented our protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine not only to support the immune system but also to treat viral infections .... [A]fter witnessing the results our patients have experienced, I am more convinced than ever that a holistic approach like I presented above should be the first-line treatment provided to any COVID patient.\" Page 3 of 4 In marketing materials titled \"85 COVID Pa tients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths\" you clai m that, \"In my blogs, I encouraged people to take high doses of vitamins A, C, D, and i odine at the first sign of an illness. In our practice, this was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patients.... However, some became more ill or did not start the oral supplements early enough into their illness. Those patients needed additio nal holistic therapies. These included nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine along with intravenous nutrient therapie s. To protect our staff and healthy patients, we did not treat sick COVID patients in side my office. We were gowning up and meeting our patients at their au tomobile at the back of our building and administering IVs and ozone ther apies. Some of these patients were very sick. So far, they all recovered.\" In marketing materials titled \"85 COVID Pa tients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths,\" you claim of people sick with COVID-19: \"Having them increase the frequency of nebu lizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine helped them all. Some of the sickest were advise d to nebulize every hour or two for a short period. IV therapies and ozone treatments have helped many. This therapy has worked for helping COVID pa tients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted. In a perfect world, I would immediately start an IV of vitamin C and begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxi de and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need fo r mechanical ventilation.\" In marketing materials titled \"85 COVID Pa tients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths,\" you clai m that \"[l]ike most ho listic therapies, the earlier they are started in a diseas e process the better they perform. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A VIRAL ILLNESS I ENCOU RAGE MY PATIENTS TO START MY VIRAL PROTOCOL OF TAKING VITA MINS A, C, D AND IODINE. Due to the severity of COVID, I now recommend starti ng to nebulize hydrogen pe roxide and iodine early into the illness as well.\" In marketing materials titled \"There Is St ill Hope Out There- Ch ristopher: 'Four Days Ago I Felt Like I Was Staring At Inevitabl e Death,'\" you present a video testimonial from a man named Christopher, represented to have been a patient of Dr. Ng at the Center for Holistic Medicine. You claim, \"D r Ng's patient, Christopher, [] had tested positive for COVID-19. This is one of the worst cases we have seen at CHM. Christopher was sick for nearly 2 weeks, with a high fever, body aches, chills, nausea, and diarrhea.... Thankfully, Christopher is recovering afte r 4 days of a supplement protocol to strengthened [sic] his immune system administered by Dr Ng. This pandemic is real, but so are the results of natural therapies . Watch Christopher's testimonial on how he recovered from COVID-19.\" In marketing materials titled \"T here Is Still Hope Out There- Andre: 'It was a remarkable recovery,'' you present a video testimonial from a man named Andre. You claim, \"[M]y Page 4 of 4 long term patient, Andre from Boston, [] I diagnosed as COVID positive. Andre had a fever, severe diarrhea, and body aches that were painful to the touch. Watch Andre's emotional testimonial as he talks about hi s recovery by strengthening his immune system with high doses of vitamins A, C, D & i odine, nebulization, as well as at-home ozone therapy administered by his wife.\" In marketing materials titled \"There Is Sti ll Hope Out There-Miss El izabeth: 'Now that I am nebulizing properly I feel 95% better!,'\" you present a video testimonial from a woman named Miss Elizabeth. You claim, \"M eet my patient Miss Elizabeth. She & her family had COVID-like symptoms to include severe headaches & extreme difficulty breathing.

Wa tch her testimony to learn more.\" In marketing materials titled \"There is St ill Hope Out There- Br andon: 'I Didn't Really Break My 102 Fever for 4 or 5 Days,'\" you present a video testimonial from a man named Brandon. You claim, \"Check out my interview with COVID patient, Brandon, who is a paramedic. He experienced fati gue, body aches, high fever, followed by a shortness of breath.
