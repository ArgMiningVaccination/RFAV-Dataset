It is not about the treatment of homocystinuria due to inherited severe deficiency of function of the enzyme Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase , nor about Cob alamin C disorder (probably currently the most frequently detected cause of elevated blood total homocysteine when screened for), no r about the related Cobalamin D, Cobalamin E, and Cobalamin G disorders. It is not about addressing mild increases in blood homocysteine due to mild deficiency of function of the enzyme Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase, or due to low or deficient folate or low vitamin B12 . It is not about addressing higher blood homocysteine levels of up to about 100 micromoles per litre due to lower or deficient vitamin B12. The significance, or lack of significance , of mild increases of blood homocysteine levels from the level usually accepted as desirable (10 micromoles per litre), up to about 20 or so micromoles per litre, such as are exciting the interest of various practitioners giving advice to the numerous people in this category, is dealt with in another book, \"Homocysteine and Atherosclerosis - Causal Directions in Homocystinurics, the General Population, and Vegetarians\" expec ted to be also available for purchase and freely from the Multifactor Health Website for those unable to afford such purchase in late 2013 or 2014 , parts of which have already been posted on the Multifactor Health website. Introduction continues ne xt page MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 9 This book(let) is intended to serve a range of people, from the general public including cystathionine beta synthase deficient homocystinurics and their families, through to scientists, and health and medical personel involved in treatment(s ) of the condition(s). This book is in six main parts and chapters : Chapter 1. The advice regarding treatment of homocystinurics after infancy (over 3 years) stated as concisely as possible , which is intended to be understandable by the general public, i .e. homocystinurics and their families . Chapter 2. The advice regarding treatment of homocystinurics during infancy (under 3 years) stated as concisely as possible , which is intended to be understandable by the general public, i.e. homocystinurics and the ir families . Chapter 3 . The details of how part of this advice was derived from an analysis of the data of the treatment outcome, in terms of thrombosis (formation of undesirable blot clots inside the body, the usual immediate cause of premature death of sufferers from this disease), of five major hospitals (in Dublin (Ireland ), Sydney (Australia) , Nijmegen (The Netherlands) , Manchester and London (The UK)). This is in a form resembling that required for submission to scientific journals, and includes an A bstract and a Concise Summary. The statistical analytic part will be difficult (though not necessarily impossible) for most members of the general public (and less statistically versed scientists and health and medical personel) to follow, but should at le ast provide a good portion of the general public a glimpse of the nature of imperfections in work done by even well qualified and otherwise generally expert scientists . Chapter 4 . A table summarising or extracting the most important numerical data and wor d descriptions from literature on Cystathionine Beta Synthase deficiency Homocystinuria , arranged chronologically . References : a list of scientific journal articles and reference book chapters read by me in the course of writing this book. This does not i nclude hundreds of related articles read in the course of preparing the larger work on homocysteine noted on the previous page. Peer and expert review comments and discussions . A list of experts in the treatment of homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency have been provided with the pre -publication final draft of this book, and invited to comment critically under the conditions that they do so independently of each other, that their full responses will be reproduced in this section exac tly as they gave them, and that sufficient time for responses by me, and further responses by them, to the conclusion of discussions through agreement or disagreement, be allowed. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 10 Chapter 1. Concise advice for treatment after infancy (from 3 years on): 1.1 Eat no more than 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day , choosing low methionine foods , in order to keep methionine (one of protein 's amino acids) intake low. Of the low amount in total to be consumed of the high-protein foods (listed immediately below) includ e a substantial proportion of Macadamia Nuts ( which score 0/5 for (methionine + almonds score 3/5 for (methionine + cysteine) to keep methionine intake lower still . Bear in mind that the high -protein foods ar e also generally high -calor ie foods by weight compared to fruit and vegetables, as fruit and vegetables have more water in them - therefore the weight of fruit and vegetables eaten should far exceed the weight of the high -protein foods eaten. Weighing of all/most foods need only be done until a good visual approximation of the portions is fixed in the memory, and thereafter need only be done occasionally as a refresher of the memory . The success of the following of these recommendations needs to be determ ined by serial blood tests of methionine levels, and of blood/ urine tests of homocysteine/ homocystine, in the same way that these tests are used to determine the success of other recommended treatment combinations. You need to have some knowledge of foo d protein levels, at least the following generalizations , of percent by weight as usually purchased in retail shops (the list down to and including legumes is of the high -protein foods, and foods listed after that are of lower protein (per energy) level) : Soy Beans (as for the Other Beans, fairly well dried) 40%, wet (drained) after boiling 11 % Peanuts (a type of bean/legume) 25%, Other Beans (the seed inside the pod; includes lentils ; fairly well dried ) 20-25%, wet (drained) after boiling 5 - 6 % Sunflower Seeds, Sesame Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds 20 -25%, Undried Meats 10-12%, Pine Nuts/Seeds 7%, (Continued below) MFHEI Multifactor Health and Initiative ctorhealth 11 Rice (a grain) 7% , Yoghurt 4%, Milk (of any fat content) 3%, That legumes are a little low in methionine compared to other amino acids regarding human requirements, and that grains, s eeds and nuts are a little low in lysine compared to other amino acids regard ing human requirements (so eat more of legumes than of grains, seeds and nuts other than macadamia nuts and almonds ), Root vegetables range from : Carrots 1% to Sweet Potato es and Potatoes 2%, Common Green Leaf and Flower (cauliflower and broccoli ) Vegetables 2%, uncommon green leafs sometimes being much higher, Fruits are generally 1% protein by fresh weight , and are even more useful in the diet of homocystinurics than they are in other people (a healthy diet should be mostly fruit by fresh weight) because fruits are generally at the low end of the range of protein:energy ratio of all food groups, and they have a n unusually diverse amino acid complement , allowing the choice of fruits whose protein content is unusually low in methionine (ignoring cysteine, because it is much easier to replace this with a capsule supplement than it would be (impossible) to find enou gh foods high in cysteine but low in methionine to make up a diet acceptable to homocystinurics from) - such fruits include (1/5 is very low, 5/5 would be high in Apricots were given as 1/5, but as peaches which are also members of the sto nefruit botanical family, are given as 5/5, the dissimilarity seeming unlikely and therefore suspect, I hesitate to include them here, and the same thing applies for mandarins given as 1/5 and oranges as 4/5, both of the citrus botanical family. (Continued below) MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 12 (Reference s: for food protein contents Insel, Turner Ross (2007) , Shils, Shike, Ross, Caballero, Cousins (2006) , Whitney, Rolfes ; for food methionine and cysteine contents the SelfNutritionData website ) Note that previously the common practice has been more to achieve a low enough methionine in the diet by use of a synthetic formula diet with additional breast milk and /or normal foods added as deemed appropriate. Not enough consideration has been given to the ability to construct an acceptable, palatable die t that homocystinurics can and will use with little burden, based mostly on generally healthy whole fresh foods . Linder (1991) provided the following table from Acosta and Elsas (1976) of suggested methionine and protein intakes in homocystinuria , compared with the requirements of a normal child of 10 - 12 yrs age. Age Methionine Protein Energy (years) (mg/ kg body/ day) (g/ kg body/ day) (kcal/ kg body/ day) 0 - 0.5 42 2.00b 120 0.6 - 1.0 20 1.50 110 1 - 3 10 - 23 1.25 1300 (total/ day) 4 - 6 10 - 18 1.00 1800 (total/ day) 7 - 10 10 - 13 1.00 2400 (total/ day) Normal Child 10 - 12 22 0.81 1500 - 3000 (total/ day) b More is possible if low -methionine mixtures are consumed. (a referred to Vit B6 as trialworthy) It can be seen that the eating of the foods I have given above, in the amounts given , will reduce the dietary methionine to approximately that level suitable for homocystinurics 1.2 Eat only balanced m eals, in order to provide the best combination of amino acids, fats and carbohydrates; and the best blood levels of these over time . This is to say that each day's intake, eaten only in 2 or 3 balanced meals, should include a total over the entire day no more than 100 grams (50 g for each of 2 meals, or 33 g for each of 3 meals) for (some mixture of , with little or no dairy ) all of the beans, nuts, seeds, meats, eggs, dairy products, grains and grain products (e.g. bread etc) together (all the weights of a ll of these added together). - alongside this should be a good -sized pile (300-500 g at each meal) of green -leaf vegetables , with or without additional weights of tomatoes and carrots - and 1.5 - 3 kg (depending on growth and body size) of (combined total weight) starchy root vegetables (e.g. potatoes and sweet potatoes) (less of) and fruit (more of). (Reference: Vance (2011) for aspects of human diet in general) MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 13 1.3 Take cysteine supplements with all meals , up to 150 mg of L -cystine (two cysteine molecule s joined) per kg of body weight per day (divided up into each of the day's 2 or 3 meals), the amount for the particular patient, to normalise blood levels, being determined through a series of blood tests. Capsules or pills may be preferred. Vitamin B6 -nonresponsive homocystinurics will need more cysteine than vitamin B6 -responsive homocystinurics, as they are producing less of their own (Mudd , Levy, Kraus 2001 ). Because , early studies showed clear benefit from cysteine supplementation prior to the vitami n B6 treatment era (Laster, Mudd, Finkelstein et al 1965 ; Carson, Dent, Field et al 1965; Brenton, Cusworth, Dent et al 1966 ; Perry, Dunn, Hansen et al 1966; Komrower, Lambert, Cusworth et al 1966; Perry, Hansen, Love et al 1968 ), and because nitrogen (and sulphur) balance studies (Poole , Mudd, Conerly et al 1975 ) do not address some body proteins needing a higher proportion of cysteine than other body proteins , nor do they address the roles and levels of the sulphate (Nimni, Han, Cordoba 2007) , and Lefer, Gojon 2012) that eventuate from cysteine metabolism (some of its breakdown products , as well as larger molecules it is made a part of). Also because glutathione , a smallish molecu le made (in the body) from cysteine and two other amino acids, is protective against oxidation (is an antioxidant) and potentially enhances immune function (Nimni, Han, Cordoba 2007). Also because probably it is not only that excess homocysteine interfer es with cysteine -cysteine disulfide bonding within proteins (i.e. fibrillin (cysteine -rich)) due to homocysteine bonding with the cysteines (and that more strongly than cysteines bind to each other) , but also because a lack of cysteine probably retards the formation of those cysteine -cysteine double bonds thereby leaving unbonded cysteines freely available for longer periods of time so that homocysteine can increase its bonding with them and thus prevent the formation of those cysteine - cysteine double bonds, cysteine deficiency thus probably being an important factor in the disruption of proper formation of some protein fibers that are important parts of the body structures including the walls of arteries and veins, the fibers that retain the len ses of the eyes in their proper positions, and the fibers that are part of correct bone formation (Hubmacher, Cirulis, Miao et al 2010 ); Also because amino acids for protein synthesis are not much stored in the body but require being provided fairly imme diately together with each other by the body circulation at the time of protein synthesis; Also because the present studies of homocystinuria treatment benefit do not yet extend into older ages, where problems that have been only slowly developing (as ye t undetected ) begin to become ((much) more) apparent. The fact that ascertainment bias here (generally more severe cases being the ones detected earlier in the history of the treatment of the disease , and therefore constituting disproportionately more of the natural history (untreated) reference group of patients in studies of treatment outcomes ) has resulted in overestimat ion of the benefit of treatment for the real population whole group of CBS -- homocystinurics (Skovby, Gaustadnes, Mudd 2010) is not a go od argument against better treatment - consider how most other preventable and other diseases do not become cl inically highly MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 14 pathological or urgent until mid -life and beyond for most cases because they include a large proportion of milder cases that only evolve to serious disease more slowly . Although cysteine supplementation is particularly important (essential, not optional) for those homocystinurics whose Cystathionine Beta Synthase function is approximately nil and cannot therefore be improved much by vitamin B6 supplementation , it may also be particularly important for those whose cystathionine beta synthase function has enough residual activity to therefore be able to be significantly improved by vitamin B6 supplementation , but who also take folate and/or vitamin B12 and/or betaine in order to further reduce homocysteine levels, because in this case the further reduced homocysteine levels produce less of a drive through the still debilitated Cystathionine Beta Synthase to produce the resultant cyste ine, which is therefore further lowered by the folate and/or vitamin B12 and/or betaine treatment that allows homocysteine to escape down that other pathway (remethylation ) instead of being forced to some (already suboptimal) extent down the transsulfurati on pathway to give some (already suboptimal) amount of cysteine . This despite reduced binding of cysteine by the lowered homocysteine. Eat only at mealtimes, so that appropriate cysteine supplementation can be achieved , with good proportions of amino acid s being absorbed together . 1.4 Take daily vitamin B6 supplements if the homocystinuric is B6 -responsive, the amount for the particular patient, to best as close to normalise blood levels, being determined through a series of blood and/or urine tests. Homocys tinurics who do not respond to B6 with a useful decrease in homocystine should not take B6 supplements , Ross et al 2006; Mudd, Levy, Kraus 2001 ; Mudd, Edwards, Loeb etc 1970 ) 1.5 Take folate, Vita min B12 and Betaine supplements as appropriate, to further reduce homo cyst(e)ine levels and (the folate) to compensate for excess use of folate due to excess use of the alternative pathway (remethylation) for metabolizing homocysteine . The amount(s) of the particular nutrient(s) for the particular patient, giving the best trade -off between the beneficial effect of lowering homocysteine levels and the risk of any side -effects , to best on balance normalise blood levels, being determined through a similar sor t of series of blood tests as for the vitamin B6 supplementation (Yap 2012; Shils, Levy, Kraus 2001) . It should be noted that in the case of B6 -responsive homocystinurics, use of these three nutrient supplements (alone or toge ther) reduces the amount of homocysteine forced by higher -than-normal concentrations to go down the transsulfuration pathway via the but B6 -partly -restored Cystathionine Synthase enzyme , which amount of cysteine resulting from metabolism of homocysteine down that pathway, which may increase the need for, or potential benefit from, additional cysteine supplementation to the diet , despite there being less homocysteine to bind to cysteine . MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 15 1.6 Eat a largish green salad with all meals , (as noted above) because this is an important part of a generally healthy diet for virtually all humans. (Vance 2011) 1.7 Derive most calories from fresh low-methionine fruit . (as noted above) 1.8 Don't eat fried, roasted, saut\u00e9ed , grilled, baked or toasted foo ds, because the oxidatively damaged fats in these will probably increase whatever damage is happening to artery and probably also vein walls, predisposing to atherosclerosis , and therefore possibly thrombosis also - there is already some artery wall dama ge in this disease, and it is best to minimize any further damage that may occur from eating these sorts of foods . Eat raw, boiled, steamed, poached or stewed foods instead. High heat in the presence of oxygen (i.e. in the air) damages fats, particular ly but not only the otherwise generally healthy unsaturated fats. 1.9 Top up total vitamin C intake to 1 gram per day (Pullin, Bonham, McDowell et al 2002) with a supplement that has other antioxidants and nutrients in conservative (lowish, mild) amounts . Be conservative and avoid higher doses from supplements until more is known in this field of science. 1.10 Regular contact between patients/doctors can be important for helping patients adhere to recommendations. Perhaps blood sampling should be scheduled so as to maximize maintenance of doctor -patient contact and patient adherence to recommendations. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 16 Chapter 2. Concise advice for treatment in infancy (up to 3 years) : 2.1 Combine some amount of breast milk with low -methionine cysteine -supplemente d formula food, the correct proportions for the individual being determined by a series of tests For Newborns and young infants, even if the mother is known to be homocystinuric herself, it is best if some amount of breast milk can be used (preferably in the same meal) together with some of the synthetic low/nil -methionine, cysteine -supplemented feeds as commonly used (Yap 2013) . This is because the breast milk of the first 10 or more days contains a complex mixture of protein and other substances the bene fit of which cannot be sensibly measured as merely its amino acid content because much of this protein is not broken down into amino acids in the stomach and intestines of newborn and very young infants , but is absorbed intact into the infants bloodstream to perform various important functions. This probably also applies to a lesser extent after the first 10 or more days. It has been noted that 'mature' breastmilk as produced 10 or 14 days or so after birth and on thereafter, as well as being very low in p rotein relative to energy (because humans are by evolution a very low - protein -requiring animal) compared to milks of other animal species (human milk is only a quarter o r so in protein:energy ratio as other known mammals ' milks (Oftedal 1981 )), and also being low in protein relative to energy compared to to other food groups (roughly equal to fruits) regularly eaten by humans. Also, this breastmilk has been said to be the highest in cystine (free cysteine, not in a protein): methionine (ambiguous as to whet her free or in protein) ratio (2:1) of all animal products, resembling therein plant tissues (WHO Bulletin 1989 ). In any case, be the mother a homocystinuric or not ; if a homocystinuric , be she vitamin B6 -responsive or -nonresponsive ; the correct mixture of breast milk and the synthetic low -methionine, cysteine - supplemeted formula will require determination through a series of tests - tests of the blood levels of the important biochemicals reacting to variation in the doses or ratios of the different treat ments applied (breast milk, special formula foods, and vitamin B6 and/or other nutrients (folate, vitamin B12, betaine) - tests that will roughly determine what are the best doses and ratios of the treatments to proceed with. The tests are necessary becau se there is no ready mathematical formula to calculate the doses and amounts for a particular homocystinuric patient - though there are in some centres some reasonable starting points from which to begin to test variations of treatment dose and ratios, and in the near future hopefully these will be better agreed by consensus and readily available as such in the literature. Presently, it seems to me that as good an authoritative opinion as any in the world on the details of these matters (on this page) woul d be that of Professor Sufin Yap of the UK, a practitioner and teacher of inherited metabolic disease treatment with many years of experience with a patient group that for decades now have been more diagnosed and treated in infancy than any other homocysti nuric patient group in the world. Also there are known psychological benefits from breastfeeding, which are part of breastfeeding's known ability to help infants thrive. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 17 2.2 Later in infancy replace some amount of breast milk and low-methionine cystein e- supplemented formula food with low -methionine whole foods and cysteine supplements , the correct proportions for the individual being determined by a series of tests However, I suggest that as the infant grows older, there is some scope for replacing the presently used synthetic low -methionine cysteine -supplemented formula by the correct combination of low-methionine whole foods and cysteine supplementation as detailed above but with adjustment for the increased protein requirements of infants in accord w ith the table reproduced above here in section 1.1, of suggested methionine and protein intakes in homocystinuria by Acosta and Elsas (1976) given by Linden (1991) . I recommend that this be done in close consultation with the treatment team, who should make themselves aware of the details I have provided here, and done with the standard series of tests of body methionine and homocysteine levels to determine the success of both the diet specifications and the patient's following of them. Aside to Chapters 1 and 2: There has been some work done on the effect of mutation topology (a fundamental aspect of enzyme shape, here being changed due to the replacement of one amino acid in the/a protein that makes up/ is part of an enzyme , with a different ami no acid) on the folding of the protein and therefore on the enzyme's activity (Kozich, Sokolova, Klatovska et al 2010), and on how this might be changed (restored towards normal) by the addition of naturally occurring or synthetic (bio)chemicals (interesti ngly betaine, taurine and glycerol, all occurring naturally have had potentially valuable activity) (Kopecka, Krijt, Rakova, Kozich 2011) . This has some promise for the future, but work has only been done in in -vitro (in a test -tube or other such significantly artificial situation), leaving the question of whether any beneficial changes in humans will be worth paying the price of whatever undesirable side -effects may occur at whatever stage of the patient's life.

To further analyse the data of Yap et al Homozygous low -methionine supplementation al (2001 /2003 ) of the thrombosis outcomes of five major (CBS --)- treating centers: in Dublin , Sydney, Nijmegen, Manchester and London ; was statistically compared with outcomes predicted by Mudd et al 's (1985) untreated natural history outcomes , and then Dublin with the others, and treatments examined. Considera tion MFHEI Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 19 Results . There were less thromboses outcomes (P<.05) in the treated and followed CBS -- patient groups of each of the five groups, even when considered singly, t han that expected in the absence of treatment by reference to the natural history data of Mudd et al (1985). The thromboses outcome of the Dublin group is better than that of the other four groups, but this does not attain statistical significance at the P<.05 level (P ~ 0.16 with the other four groups combined, or P ranging from 0.14 to 0.23 with the other four groups each taken singly). There are differences in treatment regimens . The considerations of the other metabolites and nutrients suggested potentially important r oles for these molecules, such that treatment that included their normalisation or optimisation would be desirable if it could be had at an acceptable, efficient price, which it potentially can to a substantial extent. Conclusions . Cysteine supplementatio n may be of more importance than generally acknowledged , and that maybe as a function of the use of homocysteine -lowering treatment modalitie s other than VitB6 . Low-methionine, high -fruit and vegetable diets may be of more importance than generally acknowl edged, and supplementation with vitamin C and other antioxidants should probably be implemented . Thoroughness , and psychological competence, with regard to the cultivation of treatment compliance is important. 3.3 Concise summary Homozygous (or compoun d heterozygous) Cystathionine -beta-synthase deficiency (CBS --) may result in thrombosis, and its treatment has included low -methionine diets, cystine -enriched amino acid supplementation B6, folic acid, vitamin B12, and betaine. The data of Yap et al (2001/2003) was further analysed, showing that the thrombosis outcomes of five major (CBS --)-treating centers: in Dublin, Sydney, Nijmegen, Manchester and London, even when considered singly, are better (P<.05) than that expected in t he absence of treatment by reference to the natural history data of Mudd et al (1985). The thromboses outcome of the Dublin group is better than that of the other four groups, although P ~ 0.16 with the other four groups combined, and there are differenc es in treatment regimens associated with this, suggesting that c ysteine supplementation may be of more importance than generally acknowledged , and that maybe as a function of the use of homocysteine -lowering treatment modalities other than VitB6 . This fin ding, added to which the consideration of other relevant and potentially relevant metabolites and nutrients, suggested that low-methionine, high -fruit and vegetable diets may be of more importance than generally acknowledged, and supplementation with vitam in C and other antioxidants should probably be implemented . Futhermore, thoroughness and psychological competence with regard to the reinforcement/cultivation of treatment compliance is important. Key words : CBS, homocysteine, diet, vitamin C, FMD, cyste ine References to electronic databases: Nil MFHEI (OMIM #236200) ; cbEGF, UK, United Kingdom; USA, United States of America; 3.4 Background information on homocystinuria resulting from severe homozygous (or compound heterozygous) Cystathionine -beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) deficiency (OMIM #236200) results in a range of pathologic outcomes in the absence of treatment, including variably throm bosis (the focus of this (Chapter 3) work); atherosclerosis, increased Intima -Media Thickness, reduced Flow ectopia lentis and myopia; and fatty liver changes (Mudd et al 1985). Treatment is generally focused on reducing the homoc ysteine levels of the patient, with the focus on other altered metabolites having varied according to treatment locale or even individual practitioner, though less so lately, with more internally - homogenous treatments applied in locales (ie nations or major city -serviced areas), which are accordingly better differentiable. Treatment has included low -methionine diets, cystine -enriched supplementation and formula vitamin B6 (responsivity to this, the major cofactor of CBS, is the criteria for dichotomising CBS --.), Kraus 2001; Yap et al 2001). The objective of this work is to re -examine the work of Yap et al (2001) dealing with the thrombosis outcome s of five major CBS -- treating centers, in Dublin of Ireland, Sydney of Australia, Nijmegen of The Netherlands, and Manchester and London of the UK, and to further (i.e. statistically) compar e them not only with Mudd et al 's (1985) untreated natural histo ry outcomes, but with each other, and examine the possible relationship of any differences in thrombosis outcomes to respective treatment regimes. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 21 3.5 Comparison of the treatment outcomes in terms of thrombosis (formation of undesirable blo od clots ins ide the body, the usual immediate cause of premature death of homocystinuric patients ), of five major hospitals (in Dublin (Ireland ), Sydney (Australia) , Nijmegen (The Netherlands) , Manchester and London (The UK)) having different mixtures of homocystinuri c patient types, and using different combinations of treatments . 3.5.1 Methods: Outcome data collated by Yap et al (2001) of the thrombosis outcomes of five major (CBS --)-treating centers, in Dublin of Ireland, Sydney of Australia, Nijmegen of The Net herlands, and Manchester and London of the UK, was statistically compared (with an adjustment for proportions of VitB6 -respondent/ - nonrespondent CBS -- treatment years ) with outcomes predicted by Mudd et al (1985)'s untreated natural history outcomes (using only that portion of Mudd et al's time -to-thromboembolic event curve that is covered by the ageing period between the average age at commencement of treatment, and the average age at the Yap et al (2001) study present time). The thrombosis outcome resul ts of Dublin of Ireland are then compared to the thrombosis outcome results of the other four centres combined and then individually. The basic statistical method used is the method for comparison of proportions in independent samples provided by Snedeco r and Cochran (1989), the essential equation being: z = (p1hat - p2hat)/[sqrt(phat*qhat)(1/n1 + 1/n2)], where: (n of group1 + n group2), qhat = 1 - phat, and p for statistical significance is obtained by referring z to the table for the normal distribution of z . The possible relationship of any differences in thrombosis outcomes to respective treatment regimes is then discussed. 3.5.2 Background information from Mudd et al (1985) : The following is the backgr ound information from Mudd et al (1985) necessary for thorough comparative considerations: Mudd et al (1985), in a seminal paper, mailed a standardized questionnaire to each clinician known from a previous study (cited Mudd et al 1981) to be caring for pa tients with CBS --. Physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire for each such individual about whom they had appropriate information. Further questions focused upon the factor(s) that led to ascertainment, whether the patient was responsive to VitB6, and upon the presence and age of appearance of major clinical manifestations. A detailed history of therapy was requested, as well as a reproductive history....Additional sources of information were identified by a review of the literature and by contacting centers around the world specializing in diagnosis and management of inborn errors of metabolism, as well as by soliciting physician cooperation by notices in appropriate journals. For some patients on whom recent information could not be obtained, publish ed material only was used, if details were available to prove that they did not MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 22 overlap. Data collection occurred during 1982 and early 1983 - duplication was searched for, and redundant information deleted. For their 1985 survey, updated information was r eceived concerning 532 homocystinuric patients with proven or presumed CBS --. To this group was added material from an additional 97 patients obtained primarily from published reports (cites 37 references), bringing the total to 629 patients. All patient s admitted to the study had been demonstrated to be excreting homocystine in conjunction with either 00%) Where hyperMet = Hypermethioninemia 58 were discovered during screening of newborns, and an additional 88 were discovered by screening all siblings (the balance ascertained on clinical features).... Of the 629 patients, 307 were females and 321 male s.... Of the 629 patients, 231 (37%) were classified as biochemically responsive to VitB6 when not folate depleted; 231 (37%) were classified as nonresponsive to VitB6; 67 (11%) were judged intermediate in response; and 100 (16%) had not been classified. Fo r their subsequent analyses only the 231 VitB6 - responsives and the 231 VitB6 -nonresponsives newborn ascertainees, were VitB6 -responsive.

By 28 years of age the slope(s) has decreased again. As they note, an idea of the differences between the VitB6 -responders and -nonresponders is given by the chances of having had the initial clinically de tected event by age 15 y being 12% and 27% respectivel y: Figure 1. Reproduction (projections added) of Mudd et al's (1985) Time -to-event graph for first thromboembolic event in cystathionine deficiency . 3.5.3 Background informa tion from Yap et al (2001) The following is the background information from Yap et al (2001) necessary for thorough comparative considerations . Selected data from that they collated, and selected results of theirs relevant to my study here, appear in the table in the Results below: Now, Yap et al (2001) produced a paper, the abstract for which is reproduced here: \"Abstract.....We performed a multicenter (Dublin, Ireland; Manchester, UK, Nijmegen, The Netherlands; Sydney, Australia. DV) observat ional study to assess the effectiveness of long -term Hcy-lowering treatment in reducing vascular risk in 158 patients. Vascular outcomes were analysed and effectiveness of treatment in reducing vascular risk was evaluated by comparison of actual to predic ted number of vascular events, with the use of historical controls from a landmark study (Mudd et al 1985. DV) of 629 untreated patients with CBS --. The 158 patients had a mean (range) age of 29.4 (4.5 to 70) years; 57 (36%) were more than 30 years old, a nd 10 (6%) were older than 50 years. There were 2 ,822 patient -years of treatment, with an average of 17.9 years per patient. Plasma Hcy levels were markedly reduced from pre -treatment levels but usually remained moderately elevated. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 24 There were 17 vascular events in 12 patients at a mean (range) age of 42.5 (18 to 67) years: pulmonary embolism (n = 3), myocardial infarction (n = 2), deep venous thrombosis (n = 5), cerebrovascular accident (n = 3), transient ischemic attack (n = 1), sagittal sinus thro mbosis (n = 1), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (n = 2). Without treatment, 112 vascular events would have been expected, for a relative risk of .09 (95%CI .036 to 0.228; P<.0001).\" Yap (2003) provide additional comment on these findings. 3.5.4 Results (of Vance, here) : Now, firstly, it was not quite proper for Yap et al (2001) to aggregate thromboembolic events in with aneurysms, as they may well have differing metabolite etiologies, and also as diagnosis of aneurysms is not assured. Secondly, the me thod of calculation of the number of events expected in the treatment period had treatment not been applied is by no means made clear. The following is an example of what I posit is the most correct method without more complex computational requirements (such as individual data instead of the group averages available from Yap et al 2001) that would probably add little more precision to the outcome; it uses only that portion of Mudd et al's curve that is covered by the ageing period between the average age a t commencement of treatment, and the average age at the Yap et al study present time: Taking the average age of 29.4 years, minus the total treatment time divided by n (2822/158 = 17.9 years) one derives that on average treatment commenced at age 29.4y - 17.9y = 11.5y. Extrapolating from the (\"All types combined\", on the basis that over all five study centres there are very roughly similar numbers of VitB6 -responsive and -nonresponsive CBS --) thromboembolic event time -curve of Mudd et al (1985) , it can be seen that for an average individual of this group, the probability of having a thromboembolic event , in the absence of treatment, was: 0.52 ( the probability of having a thromboembolic event, in the absence of treatment by age 29.4y) minus 0.10 ( the probab ility of having a thromboembolic event, in the absence of treatment by age 11.5y) = 0.42. And, 0.42*158 = 66.4 thromboembolic events expected during the treatment period had treatment not been applied , compared to the 112 given by Yap et al . Now, t ake away the 2 abdominal aortic aneurysms , and the 5 repeat thromboses, to leave 1 0 vascular events instead of the 17 noted (It seems Yap et al did this) . The relative risk would in fact be closer to 0.2 than the .09 claimed . MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 25 The .09 relative risk reported is therefore a twofold exaggeration of treatment efficacy . And when it is considered that Mudd 's (1985) cases had an ascertainment bias towards more severe cases (in particular out of the vitamin B6-responsive cases ), as the index cases (which in the early d ays constituted a greater proportion of any family case group) in any family group were nearly all discovered clinically, this exaggeration is even more so for the four groups other than Dublin (as they have a lower proportion of vitamin B6 -nonrespondent p atients than does Dublin) , probably nearly a threefold exaggeration of treatment efficacy. (References related to the ascertainment bias in Mudd's (1985) study being towards Skovby, Sokolova, Janosikova et al 2009) More to the point however, is that the treatments applied by these different groups of practitioners are quite different, in partic ular the Irish compared to the Dutch and to the Australian (See my Table 1 below, and Yap et al 2000 ), and regarding the usually quite variable cysteine supplementation , which (Yap 2013 personal communication) is virtually universally only applied as part of the proprietary synthetic low -methionine, cysteine -enriched formula food, not as itself, and which has a far from perfect compliance with in that context by homocystinuric patients - usually the later in life treatment commences, the worse the complianc e (Wilcken & Wilcken 1997, Walter et al 1998 ). It seems that with later average age of treatment commencement it is probable it is less attempted to prescribe , and still less achieved of compliance, than in the commendably thorough treatment/monitoring pro tocols of the Irish group. This lower compliance in the later -diagnosed cases is only somewhat ameliorated in its negative effects , due to the later -diagnosed cases being more often Vit B6 -responsive cases, the Vit B6 supplementation being substantially mo re complied with by homocystinuric patients. Analysis would more profitably ha ve compared on this basis and sought biochemical theoretical basis for the differences amongst them, rather than proceeding as they have done. There is also an issue of non-compl iant patients being excluded (maybe differentially more so from the Irish study group ), but because ultimately further pursuance of this aspect would not change my recommendations, as it very probably does not distort the comparison of treatments (rather, enhances it) , maybe only distorting comparison of centers of treatment, I only mention it here for completeness. I provide in the following table, data reproduced from tables in Yap et al (2001), as well as the results of my own corresponding, and furthe r, analys es (all delineated by \"According to Vance\"), which includes the appropriate refinement of adjusting the number of thromboses for any compared group by a factor addressing the ratio of Total VitB6 -responsive: -nonresponsive treatment years, derived in part from proportionate movement away from the \"all types combined\" graph line some commensurate distance towards whichever of the VitB6 -responsive/ -nonresponsive graph lines was appropriate, before projecting across to the y axis. The fact that the n umber of VitB6 -responsive/ -nonresponsive CBS -- are closely proportional to the number of respective treatment years meets one condition necessary for the validity of that procedure. My tests of statistical significance are by the method for comparison of proportions in independent samples provided by Snedecor and Cochran (1989) , done by hand . The Yap et al (2001) data was drawn by them from : Yap & Naughten (1998), Kluitjmans et al (1999), Wilcken & Wilcken (1997), Yap et al (2000) , and Walter et al (199 8).

The derivations use the following algorithms: For Manchester and London a change of the Bonham et al (1997) algorithm of tHcy = 60uM + 4. 5 * (Hcy(ine) <20uM) + 2*(Hcy(ine)>20uM ), to that more consistent with the Given Dublin correlates, that is, tHcy = 50uM + 3.5 * (Hcy(ine) <20uM) + 2*(Hcy(ine)>20uM ); For Sydney, a rough mean of the tHcy = 40uM + fHcy rule ( Wiley et al (198 9) with derivations involving the amount of protein per blood volume) and the relationship of the Nijmegen correlates. So, there is statistically significantly (at the P<.05 level) less thromboses outcomes in the treated and followed CBS -- patient groups of each of the five groups, even when considered singly, to that expec ted in the absence of treatment by reference to the natural history data of Mudd et al (1985). There is a substantial suggestion that the thromboses outcome of the Dublin group is better than that of the other four groups, but this does not attain statisti cal significance at the P<.05 level (P ~ 0.16 with the other four groups combined , or P ranging from 0.14 to 0.23 with the other four groups each taken singly ). MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 28 The possible relationship of any differences in thrombosis outcomes to respective treatment reg imes is addressed in the Discussion section below. 3.6 Discussion of results of analysis of Yap et al (2001/ 2003) data by Vance here : Firstly, my rough derivation , from data provided by Anderson et al 's (1991) community -wide study of 16 short -stay hosp itals in metropolitan Worcester, Massachusetts, USA, indicates that the population (this would include CBS -- cases) rate of incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) was one per 20 people over an average lifespan of 80 years. Of co urse the very large majority of these would occur at ages > 40 years, whereas most of the CBS -- subjects of this work are aged <40 years , and in the four groups other than Dublin had very roughly one deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism per 10 people , at a much younger age than the age at which DVT/PE occurs in the general population . However, Anderson et al state that because of the silent nature of such events and the low rate of autopsy in the USA, the total incidence , prevalence, and mortality rates of venous thromboembolism remain elusive (and will include the CBS --). Even given the lack of opportunity for formal statistical comparison of the rates of thrombosis found in the five (four) groups studied here, taking into account the aforementioned aspects, as well as that most of the general population thromboses are preventable by diet and other lifestyle factors like physical exercise and non -smoking , it seems safe to assume that the rates of thromboses observed in the five ( the four other than Dublin ) groups studied here are substantially in excess of the real rate in the (non -CBS --) general population for these age groups, and very much to the point are very likely to increase with the ageing of the CBS -- patients, and therefore desirable of fu rther lowering . This latter aspect further validat es the carrying out of the numerical and other analys es done here. Without belabouring the point of the differences in outcomes between Yap et al 's (2001) and my analyses (in particular their risk ratio of .09 for treatment versus non -treatment, compared to my calculation (using only the periods of time under treatment, not the period of time from birth, which that difference suggests they used) of the risk ratio being a more modest claim of treatment su ccess of 0.2 (that is, a claim of only half the treatment success) for the five groups combined (and substantially less for the four non -Dublin groups, as noted above) ) I move to suggesting that the differences between the Irish outcomes and the other outc omes are worth noting, particularly in the light of small numbers overall plausibly being a factor in the statistical significances of the comparisons not quite reaching any (arbitrary, if generally reasonable) criteria set at P<.05 . However, i t is necess ary to consider the fact that Dublin' s (and less so Manchester' s) patients were on treatment in early childhood whereas the other centers' patients were not. It is necessary to identify potential biases, their types and their directions, and their potentia l relative magnitudes and net effect, such as in producing ascertainment bias of cases towards or away from a predisposition to thrombosis. Note that while on the one hand thromboses are a small part of the symptoms contributing towards ascertainment of the non -newborn -screening CBS -- cases that effectively do not constitute any of the Irish (approx all newborn -screening ascertained) and therefore insofar give an ascertainment bias towards the non -Irish groups having more thromboses, on the other hand the Dublin cases are on CBS genetic bases alone more severe, being of the vitamin B6 -nonresponsive type , whereas all the other MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 29 centers are much closer (roughly 1:1 to 1:2) to being evenly comprised of B6 -nonresponsive and B6 - responsive , giving insofar an asc ertainment bias towards the Irish group being more predisposed to thrombosis. It is possible that clinical detection in the non -Dublin cases would drive a higher compliance with treatment, particularly in the earlier -detected vitamin B6-nonresponsive cas es, but also in the vitamin B6-responsive cases, due to non -trivial disease manifestations being already experienced by the patient or members of their family, compared to drive from ascertain ment via family studies, and even less so for drive from ascerta inment by population screening. Compliance is of course a function of the experienced burden of the treatment, which might be reasonably said to be greater insofar as it included the synthetic low -methionine high -cysteine formula food (though cysteine should be able to be given as a single amino acid in a capsule(s) rather than as a more voluminous mixture of amino acids, relying on food for the other amino acids ). However compliance is also a function of patient -doctor contact type and frequency , includin g the formation of dietary habits very early in life - though peer -group and other societal effects at various other stages of life can override such established dietary habits to varying extent and duration . Hcy bound to plasma proteins + free homocysteine) levels of the Dublin CBS -- cases are nonetheless in the middle of the range of the five centers (tHcy approximately 110 micromoles per liter versus approxim ately 80 -130), though it might well be the case that the B6 -nonresponsive cases in the other centers have higher tHcy, and the B6 -responsive cases lower tHcy, than the combined averages given. Furthermore, the Dublin group of CBS -- experience much more ve nupuncture in the course of their metabolic monitoring, and venupuncture is noted to promote thrombosis. Also, the repeat thromboses of the English group have not been incorporated into the analysis, which increases their apparent treatment success in th e numerical analysis. It should be borne in mind that Dublin has absolutely no events of thrombosis (in those on treatment) , as yet. I suggest that a fair adjustment for th ese difference s would put the difference in thromboses outcomes between the Dublin (treated) and the combined other groups in the direction of being more significant, not less significant, and therefore close enough to being statistically significant at the p<.05 level to even more definitely warrant further discussion. Even if earlier treatment of the Dublin group had confe rred some advantage other than better later adherence to homocysteine -lowering treatment (this adherence seeming, on the basis of the tHcy levels derived , to be not much better ), it is very likely to be due to differ ences in the body's more permanent structures, rather than to differences in less permanent things like platelets and biochemicals in solution , (though of course these latter might themselves cause differences in the body 's more permanent structures) . For example the protein fiber scaffolding of tissues including the walls of arteries and veins, in particular the protein fibrillin with its unusually high cysteine content and cysteine -cysteine double bonds. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 30 I take the view that when the bias -relevant factors listed above are roughly though reasonably, and also conservatively, adjusted for, Dublin seems to have better treatment outcomes. I do not claim that this proves that Dublin 's treatment practice is better, I claim only that it suggests it. And considera tion also of other metabolites and nutrients as follows here provides a reasonable theoretical support for cysteine supplementation being important. 3.7 Discussion of relevant metabolism, homocysteine, betaine ; vitamin C ; Oxidation and formaldehyde. 3.7.1 Diagram of relevant metabolism: Consider the following diagram of the metabolic pathways central to considerations of the CBS -- situation: Figure 2. Metabolic pathways central to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency (adapted from Mudd et al's (2001) use of Mudd and Poole's (1975) work) MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 31 3.7.2 Sulfate. \"Approximately 19 percent of total comes from ingested inorganic sulphate from foods and 17% of total comes from inorganic sulphate in drinking water and beverages. Many other sulfur compounds in food can yield inorganic sulphate as a result of degradation or turnover. Among organic compounds, methionine and cysteine in food proteins, glutathione in both animal and vegetable products (Wierbicka et al., 1989), taurine in animal -source food s, lanthionine (a cross -linked sulfur amino acid produced when protein -bound cysteine undergoes heat treatment at an alkaline pH), and sulphated glycosaminoglycans in both plant - and animal -derived foods are important contributors of organic sulphate, prov iding the remaining approximately 64 percent of total sulphate available for body needs. ... Table 7.2 shows a fairly similar sulphate content related to calories or good proportion of diet amongst a fairly wide range of foods of different types ... From Table 7.3 Sulfate levels: Cow milk 100 mg/ L; Human milk 5 mg/ L; Human infant formula 66 mg/ L ... Human milk is very low in sulfate (5 mg/ L), and even though an average value for infant formula products (both milk - and soy -based) was found to be 13 times higher than that in human milk (66 mg/ L), these levels of sulphate are still lower than those in many sources of drinking water (Hoppe et al., 1998).\" (National Academy of Sciences 2004) Now , inorganic sulfate is quite rea dily absorbed from the GIT (Morris and Murer 2001, Florin et al 1991), and this and renal secretion and reabsorption (this latter predominating over secretion , as the molecule is freely filterable; Becker at al (1960) ) are quite the main mechanism of sulfa te homeostasis. So although, for example, the family of recessively inherited osteochondroplasias, resulting from mutations in the Diastrophic Dysplasia Sulfate Transporter, are due to the undersulfation of proteoglygans in chondrocytes (Satoh et al 1998, Hastbacka et al 1994), it seems unlikely that derangement of sulfation is part of the mechanism of CBS -- pathology, unless in -situ generation of sulfate is a requirement, but this seems unlikely, as there are a number of sulfate -transporters seemingly supplying sulfate from ECF to the ICF of cells (effectively all types of cells?) that require sulfate for the production of 3 -phosphoadenosine 5 -phosphosulfate (PAPS) for some use(s) or other. So, given the above information, I will not consider sulfate any further here as an etiologic agent of CBS --, notwithstanding its manifold and varied role in biology , as I have not encountered any information suggesting an important role . MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 32 3.7.3 Cysteine. In accord with the enzyme defect in CBS it has been shown that requirement for cysteine is increased in CBS -- (Laster, Mudd, Finkelstein et al 1965; Carson, Dent, Field et al 1965; Brenton, Cusworth, Dent et al 1966; Perry, Dunn, Hansen et al 1966; Komrower, Lambert, Cusworth et al 1966; Perry, Hansen, Love et al 1968 ), though even 2% of normal CBS activity may allow the processing of 50% of methionine (via homocysteine) into cysteine (Poole, Mudd, Conerly, Edwards 1975) though the remaining excess methionine/ homo cysteine then increases up to high levels, indicat ing insufficiency . Inspection of the cysteine levels given in Chapter 4 below shows them to be consistently lower th an normal, roughly 1/2 to 2/3 of normal, in CBS -- cases considered to be generally satisfactorily treated. Milewicz et al (2000) review that Marfan Syndrome (MFS, OMIM #154700) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting multiple systems, including the cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal systems. The cardiovascular pathologies include pes planus, and highly arched palate with crowding of frontal teeth. They note it has been established that mutations in the gene for fibrillin -1, an elastic fiber, are responsible for most MFS cases. Sakai et al (1991) report that fibrillin contains 14% cysteine (an unusually high content among proteins), of which one third appeared to b e in the free reactive sulfhydryl form. Disulfide bonds play a major role in the fibrillin protein 's structure. CBS -- has in common with MFS many of the abovementioned pathological features (hence the term \"Marfanoid habitus of CBS --\") (Mudd , Skovby, levy et al 1985 ; McCully 1969; Perry et al 1968 ; Brenton et al 1966 ; Carson et al 1965 ; Gibson et al 1964) , such that in times predating differentiation such CBS -- cases would be lumped in under the MFS diagnosis . Majors and Pyeritz (2000) report their inv estigations following on speculation by themselves and others that in CBS -- the altered plasma concentrations of homocysteine and/or cysteine may hinder the synthesis, deposition, or both, of fibrillin -1. They report that when arterial smooth muscle cells were cultured under conditions of cysteine deficiency fibrillin -1 deposition into the extracellular matrix was greatly diminished (and restored with addition of cysteine ), but that excessive homocysteine in contrast had little if any effect on fibrillin -1 deposition. Type I collagen, the major matrix component synthesized by these smooth muscle cells, was not reduced by low cysteine concentrations nor high homocysteine concentrations. In VitB6 -responsive CBS --, the use of VitB6, as a sole treatment , such as to lower methionine to and homocysteine (relatively) near to normal levels, must therefore also have increased cysteine to near normal levels, with regard to its coming from the CBS pathway represented at the bottom of the diagram. Now, if it is necessa ry to lower methionine intake to lower methionine and (focally) homocysteine to near normal levels, the question must arise as to whether the products of the CBS pathway, in particular cysteine, become deranged, and to what extent - in this particular case , it would be expected that cysteine would be reduced - less homocysteine to drive the CBS pathway, resulting in less cysteine. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 33 The use of methionine -restriction in non -synthetic food as a sole t reatment would be very likely to decrease the supply/ metabol ic production of cysteine and to result in cysteine deficiency of some level. Now, if one adds folate, betaine, or VitB12 to the initially (however) successful VitB6 -treatment of VitB6 -responsive CBS --, this will reduce the drive down the CBS pathway, resu lting in less cysteine . At this point it seems reasonable to suggest that a decrease in dietary methionine might benefit from an accompanying addition of cysteine to make good the resultant decrease of the latter. And likewise, an increase in folate, bet aine, and/or VitB12 might benefit from an accompanying addition of cysteine to make good the decrease in metabolic production of cysteine due to the increased folate, betaine and/or VitB12 having routed more of the homocysteine down the rem ethylation pathw ay. Use of combinations of these would potentially benefit from further increases in the additional cysteine. In VitB6 -nonresponsive CBS --, methionine -restriction as a sole therapy would be very likely to result in an even more deficient level of cystei ne than that pre -treatment , as even careful dietary compositing must reduce cysteine also, as they are substantially positively correlated in foods in both being protein constituents - in practice this compositing constitutes a move to a lower -protein diet , with plant protein sources predominating over animal protein sources . The addition of folate, and betaine treatment of VitB6 -nonresponsive CBS -- would not be expected to result in as lowered, or any at all less, metabolic production of cysteine , as would be the case in VitB6 -responsive CBS --. However, i n the event of folate, VitB12 and/or betaine treatments displacing, through either CBS -- patient non-compliance or physician non -emphasi s, either the methionine -restriction of diet , or the cysteine supplementation (the latter two both via the same synthetic formula food , in the current standard treatment ), then cysteine levels would be reduced accordingly. Note that the Irish tre atment regime is instituted from birth, and is reinforced thereafter in the most thoroughgoing manner of all the CBS -- treatment centres considered here ( though the Vit B6 - nonresponsivity of their patients is the highest and therefore the most needing of r einforcement) , and that it is probable that the Irish accordingly have better compliance with cysteine supplementation than the other centers, particularly if it is over -connected in the minds of the patients/carers with use of the low-methionine (lower -protein) diet. Such over -connection is not valid, particularly in the case of VitB6 -nonresponsive CBS --, in particularly the case of non -compliance with any low -methionine diet that has been structured to include higher cysteine:methionine ratio, but also in any case (cysteine - methionine correlation in foodstuffs being sufficiently high as noted above) , and it is erroneous and undesirable to view non -compliance with the low -methionine diet as at all a good reason for non - compliance with cysteine supplementati on, notwithstanding that cysteine supplementation seems mainly to have been confined to and offered as synthetic low -methionine, high -cysteine formula foods . In the case of VitB6 -responsive CBS -- patients that ha ve been prescribed a low -methionine diet th at has not been structured to include higher cysteine: methionine ratio, non -compliance with cysteine supplementation per se (in the apparently unlikely event that it has been attempted to institute supplementation with cysteine as itself) is much less lik ely to be problematic, but is still undesirable. Hosoki, Matsuki, Kimura (1997) cite earlier work by one of their group and others (Abe and Kimura 1996) that hydrogen sulfide can be formed from cysteine by (read via) CBS, which is highly expressed in the hippocampus and cerebellum, and that brain homogenates produce hydrogen sulfide, and that MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 34 physiological concentrations of hydrogen sulfide facilitate the induction of long -term potentiation in the hippocampus. Relevant to my work here they (1997) present results that they interpret as indicating that endogenous hydrogen sulfide may regulate smooth muscle tone in synergy with nitric oxide. 3.7.4 Other Metabolites : The OTAMC pathway and 3 - methylthiopropionate, formate and f ormaldehyde . Discussion of other metabolites involved in CBS -- I am only in a position to deal with as a general concept, but even just the general concept is worth bearing in mind. In VitB6 -responsive CBS --, if only VitB6 has been used to successfully lower both methionine and homocysteine to near normal levels, then it may be reasonably said that the resultant levels of all metabolites central to CBS -- have been perhaps close to effectively normalised - and this situation ( all metabolites normalised) is probably/possibly the most desirable, practically. Now, if it is necessary to lower methionine intake to lower methionine and (focally) homocysteine to near normal levels, the question must arise as to whether (other) products of the CBS and oxidative transamination methionine catabolic ( OTAMC ) to what extent . If one adds folate, betaine, or VitB12 to the initially (however) successful VitB6 -treatment of VitB6 - responsive CBS --, then this will reduce the drive down t he CBS pathway - but, via raised (above threshold >350uM, Tangerman , Wilcken, Levy 2000 ) methionine, will increase the dri ve down the OTAMC pathway , producing raised and potentially harmful levels of hydrogen sulfide Elzen 1989, Steele 1979) . In VitB6 -nonresponsive CBS --, methionine -restriction as a sole therapy would be very likely to result in an even more deficient level of metabolites downstream of cysteine in the CBS -- than th e level pre- treatment, unless careful dietary compositing had not reduced cysteine also (as noted above in the Cysteine section ), but in a change towards normal of OTAMC pathway metabolites, particularly if assuming that nor mally flux through the OTAMC pathway is minimal (Tangerman , Wilcken, Levy -restriction -treatment of VitB6 -nonresponsive CBS -- would perhaps seem likely to result in little change in OTAMC pathway metabol ites. The addition of -nonresponsive might increase OTAMC pathway metabolites via increased methionine. In the event of these latter treatments displacing, through either CBS -- patient non- compliance or physician non -emphasis, either the methionine -restriction of diet or the cysteine supplementation, then OTAMC pathway metabolites would be expected to increase, or, metabolites downstream of cystei ne in the CBS -- to decrease , respectively. So, there are other metabolites than the ones commonly focused on in CBS --, that are also deranged, and may contribute to some aspect(s) of CBS -- pathology. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education . Pullin , Bonham, McDowell et al (2002 ) report that after treatment of 5 CBS -- patients (mean age 26 yrs, all treated with vitamin B6, and folate, four treated with betaine, two treated with a \"methionine -free protein mix\", one treated with VitB12, such as to result in tHcy mean 100 uM vs 5 controls 9 uM) acutely with 2 g of vitamin C once, or chronically with 1 g of vitamin C/ day for 2 weeks or 6 months, endothelium -dependent Flow -Mediated Dilatation (FMD) was restored from a baseline of mean 20um (vs controls mean 116um) to 160um, 170um, and 170um, respectively. This was highly statistically significant (P<.001 for all time -points). Note that there was no blinding in this experiment, and that CBS -- patient behaviour in other regards, ie compliance to other treatment modalities ie including d iet may have changed as a result. FMD has been found to be strongly negatively associated with the following prothrombotic states: , Spencer, 200 3), artery disea se; FMD 2.4% vs et al 2005). However, it is not clear whether differentiation of the FMD -reduction etiology has a bea ring on tendency to thrombosis. Nevertheless, there is a fairly strong suggestion that reduced FMD might be a contributor to the thromboses found in untreated CBS -- patients , and also to a lesser extent amongst CBS -- patients under some treatment regimes, although of course compliance is always a factor. Now, 1g of vitamin C would be supplied by (the second digits being almost meaningless in most cases due to the great variability between different batches of fruit or vegetables) : (Fruits) 0.42 kg of Hawaiian guava, 1.4 kg of kiwifruit, 1.7 kg of pawpaw, 2 kg of lychee fruit, 2.3 kg of custard apple, 2.9 kg of rockmelon, 3.6 kg of mango, 5 kg of pineapple, 5.6 kg of honeydew melon or prickly pear, 6.7 kg of bananas, 7 kg of persimmon, 17 kg of apples or grapes, and not at all by any even vaguely feasible quantity of pears; (\"Vegetables\") 0.6 kg of raw red capsicums, 0.9 kg of raw broccoli or Brussels sprouts, 1.2 kg of boiled broccoli or Brussels sprouts, 1 kg of raw mustard cabbage or watercress, 1.4 kg of raw red cabbage or raw cauliflower or raw kohlrabi, 2.2 kg of raw common cabbage, MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 36 2.8 kg of boiled common cabbage , 3.4 kg of boiled broad beans, 5 kg of boiled potato or sweet potato, 5.3 kg of boiled fresh kidney beans, 5.6 kg of raw common tomato, 6.7 kg of Lebanese cucumber, 8 kg of raw bean sprouts, 8.3 kg of boiled pumpkin, 12 kg of common cucumber, and not at all by any even vaguely feasible quantity of lettuce and even less so of any legume dried then boiled (ANZ FA 1991) . Furthermore, amongst these and other foods are substantial amounts of other antioxidant nutrients such as vitamin E and carotenoids, which are very likely to reduce the absolute amount of vitamin C required for most of its biological functions , and certainly its antioxidative functions. It can thus be seen that dietary modifications on their own could probably bring about the vitamin C related increase in FMD noted by Pullen et al (2002). Cultivating complete enough compliance to such dietary modifications might be impossible or too difficult, or inefficient, but even if so, some substantial compliance combined with antioxidant supplementation (vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and perhaps others) seems to me obviously worth doing, particular ly bearing later -life outcomes in mind. The question then follows as to whether CBS -- treatment regimens that achieve compliance with low - methionine diets, which in practice have / should have an increased amount of fruit and vegetables, are achieving an i mproved thrombosis outcome via improved FMD via increased intake of vitamin C and other antioxidant nutrients. Note that the Irish treatment regime is instituted from birth, and is reinforced thereafter in the most thoroughgoing manner of all the CBS -- treatment centres considered here ( though compliance is more crucial for their very predominantly VitB6 -nonresponsive patient group ), and that it is probable that they accordingly have better compliance (though they have some non -compliance) than th ose other centers . Also, it is potentially of importance, in regard to antioxidants, to note that cysteine in the body is joined to glutamate and glycine to make glutathione , which is one of the body's most important antioxidants (see below). MFHEI Multifactor Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 37 3.7.6 Glutathione Glutathione is formed in cysteine, joined to glutamate and glycine. Glutat hione is peroxides (Nimni, Han, Cordoba 2007) . Glutathione also functions normally to keep a substantial portion of the cysteines in protein in a reduced state at their thiol side -chain, rather than those thiols being linked in disulfide bonds to other cysteines in the same protein chain, in different protein chains, or to thiol side -chains of molecu les like cysteine and homocysteine. This activity is probably a function of the extent to which the thiol (the disulphide bond, as acted on) is exposed, and the nature of the other molecule joined to the protein in the disulphide bond. Note that homocyste ine is considered to bond to not only itself, but also to cysteine, more strongly than cysteine bonds to cysteine - this probably applies also in the context of the cysteine being part of a protein chain. Obviously, then, a shortage of cysteine will poten tially, via a shortage of glutathione , have a negative effect both on antioxidation function and on protein assembly and configuration (particularly, on average, the greater the proportion of cysteines there are in a protein, for example fibrillin, a very high- cysteine protein molecule the misfunction of which is very probably involved in the lenticular dysplasia (eye lense displacement) that is characteristic of more severe cases of CBS -- homocystinuria. 3.7.7 Acid -base balance. Remer (2002) notes that acidification of the human body is more closely tied to higher food sulfur amino acid levels than to food amino acid levels per se. Based on this and other aspects of his review one would expect the low -methionine diet as commonly employed in CBS -- to lea d to a reduction in acidity. However, the sparse literature (ie Martini , Pusateri, Uscilowicz et al 2005) suggests that acidosis is associated with reduced , not increased, coagulation. What bearing any alkalizing effect of the low -methionine diet as comm only employed in CBS -- might have on thrombosis (in CBS -- patients) seems unclear. In a more general sense, it seems that humans generally are evolved to best eat a predominantly vegetarian low -protein diet with enough fruit and vegetables to generally me et most of the water requirement (Vance 2011 ), and that this would be a more alkalizing diet than the high -protein, low -fruit and -vegetable diets common in most western (and increasingly, unfortunately, in many Eastern) societies. MFHEI Multifactor Health and autopsies two CBS -- patients dying of postoperative pulmonary thromboembolism aged 9 years, and 14 controls, reports : \"....the strikingly low concentrations of free cystathionine in all parts of the brains exam ined in homocystinurics (0.0 -0.4 mg/100gWetW) as compared to normal brains from patients dying from entirely unrelated conditions...\", but also \"If (n = 11) the adult control tissues alone are considered, the various areas of brain show striking difference s in the concentration of free cystathionine from one area to another: Occipital lobe (12 Frontal (8,5) > lateral lobe Cerebellum (3.5, 2)\" in conjunction with \"The other sulphur containing free amino acids showed no difference either between controls and homocystinurics or between various areas.\" (This seems suspect, fairly unlikely, to me - the assay techniques, and maybe therefore for cystathinine itself, used here, may have been faulty.) One meaning of this is basically that cystathionine is potentially not merely an intermediate in the transsulfuration pathway, with no biochemical function of its own, in all tissues. How this might relate to CBS -- pathology is not well defined, even regarding the possibility o f involvement in CBS -- patient clumsiness and gait disturbance, where homocysteic acid as a neural excitotoxin must also be considered a possibility ( Sommer Hunzinger, Schillo et al 2004, Adalbert , Engelhardt, Siklos 2002). Further research is required to elucidate any importance of cystathionine in CBS --. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 39 3.7.9 Homocysteine. It is beyond the scope of this work to consider the likely involvement of the many postulated mechanisms of homocysteine pathogenesis, with the thrombosis o utcome that is the focus of this paper, and this has not been established elsewhere, so I only list the following potential mechanisms noted by recent reviewers: The high pKa (10.0) of the homocysteine sulfhydryl moiety enabling it to form stable bonds wi th protein cysteine residues, impairing the function of proteins such as albumin, fibronectin, transthyretin, annexin II, and factor V (Jacobsen , Catanescu, Dibello et al 2005) (Note that the bond strength of homocysteine - homocysteine (\"homocystine\") is gr eater than the bond strength of homocysteine -cysteine, which is greater than the bond strength of cysteine -ceysteine (\"cysteine\")); angiotoxicity, upregulation of prooxidant enzymes and downregulation attenuation activates a inhibitors of metalloproteinase (Tyagi , Lominadze, Roberts 2005). Also note the report by Hutchinson , Aplin, Webb et al (2004) concluding that reduction of intramolecular calcium binding epidermal growth factor like (cbEGF) domain (i.e. of the cysteine -rich fibrillin -1 elastic fiber protein) disu lfide bonds by homocysteine and the resulting disruption of structure may contribute to the change in connective tissue function seen in homocystinuria, but that other cbEG F-containing proteins may also be involved in CBS -- pathology. It seems plausible th at both homocysteine excess and cysteine deficiency could play joint roles in at least this latter aspect of CBS -- pathology. Unfortunately, comparison of the homocysteine levels of the five centers examined in this work provides little information - the algorithms I've used to derive those of the tHcy values that had to be derived, though reasonable, are fairly rough, and the tHcy values have little consistent association with the thromboses outcomes - while the UK centers London and Manchester had both higher tHcy levels and more thromboses than the other three centers, Nijmegen and Sydney had lower homocysteine levels but more thromboses than Dublin. And here of course the comparison should incorporate VitB6 -responsivity, but that differentiation of data is not available from Yap , Boers, Wilcken et al (2001). Also it is not guaranteed that the different monitoring schedules (in conjunction with other aspects) of the different centers give rise to equal representativity of the assayed homocysteine values of the average homocysteine values, nor that such averages are of more relevance than i.e. maxima. Any attempt to relate the tHcy values to the treatment regimens should incorporate VitB6 -responsivity, but that differentiation of data is not availa ble from Yap , Boers, Wilcken et al (2001), and given the relative closeness of the five regimens, even guarded speculation has little to offer here. And finally, the tHcy values are not greatly different from each other. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 40 3.7.10 Platelets. McDonald , Bray, Field et al (1964) used the platelet stickiness method of Wright 1941, Mc Donald and Edgill 1957, 1958, to report that 5 CBS -- patients aged 4 -15y had 46%, 58%, 60%, 48%, 48%, average 54% of platelets remaining at 20 minutes, while the 5 similarly age d controls had 50%, 85%, 77%, 85%, 75%, average 80% of platelets remaining at 20 minutes. However a correction for platelet count (CBS -- average 296,000/ul, control average 216,00/ul) might have decreased the observed difference to little or nothing. Bren ton, Cusworth, Dent et al (1966) report that during the course of nitrogen balance studies in one CBS -- case, SM, \"The platelets appeared to be equally abnormal in the first, third and fourth periods and no decreased stickiness had occurred when the last m easurement was made 2 days before SM 's discharge although the plasma methionine levels had been near normal values for 5 days. The only change in platelet behaviour was in the second period (supplementary cysteine replaced with methionine) when temporaril y they were more sticky than usual and clumped together to such an extent that it was not possible to count them.\" They report to the contrary that in trials of a low -methionine, low -protein diet in another CBS --, RM, \"Platelet stickiness was measured 3 t imes in RM. Once before starting the diet , and on the 8th and 22nd day after starting it. On all three occasions the platelets were grossly abnormal in behaviour and the improvements induced by the diet in plasma amino acid concentration (reported: plasma methionine from 12mg/dl to 1 -2mg/dl, free homocysteine from 130uM to 100uM) were not obviously associated with any decrease in platelet stickiness.... The dietary trial here was long enough to allow regeneration of all platelets, taking the life of a platele t to be 8 days, so that the failure to improve was not due to the persistence of permanently injured platelets in the circulation.\" However, note that the change in homocysteine levels was not great, and not equal to that able to be obtained by full or ev en substantial compliance with the specified regimens of any of the five centers studied here. Komrower , Lambert, Cusworth, Westall (1966) report of a a calcium cystinate -supplemented low-protein branched -chain ketoaciduria diet which generally a chieved approximately undetectable free homocysteine levels (other than those attending infrequent indiscretions), that is to say tHcy levels approximately <40uM, in CBS -- case treated from infancy to age 2.3 years with good outcome, that \"platelet stickin ess of 72%\" was \"considered well within the normal range of this technique.\" Harker , Schlichter, Scott et al (1974) report ed on the following groups: Two VitB6 -nonresponsive CBS -- patients , diagnosed at age 20 years and 16 years , one of whom had tHcy>200u M and the other probably likewise, had a platelet count of mean 297,000 /ul and platelet survival of mean 5.0 days ; Two VitB6 -responsive treated CBS -- patients , diagnosed at age 8 years and 16 years, with tHcy of approximately <100uM and 50uM and a platelet count of mean 197,000 /ul and platelet survival of mean 8.6 days ; Thirty five normal controls with a platelet count of mean 250,000/ul and a platelet survival of mean 9.5 days. They carried out further platelet function tests and homocysteine infusion exp eriments using baboons, to further report that platelet destruction was not due to a direct toxic effect of homocysteine on platelets, MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 41 since dipyridamole therapy blocked platelet consumption, nor was it due to enhanced platelet reactivity. They therefore c oncluded that the underlying process of CBS -- thromboses probably involves formation of platelet thrombus on altered, nonendothelialized endarterial surfaces. Grobe (1979) reported that in three VitB6 -responsive CBS -- cases, collagen -, ADP-, and adrenalin -induced platelet aggregation was decreased (not my misprint) before treatment started, and returned to normal when homocystine disappeared from plasma . They concluded that the platelet alterations in untreated patients result from their refractory stage after a release reaction has already taken place, as maybe caused by homocysteine -caused endothelial damage. Hill-Zobel , Pyeritz, harvested platelets from six VitB6 -nonresponsive CBS -- patients (treated with VitB6 an d folate) , six VitB6 -responsive CBS -- patients (treated with VitB6) , and 11 normal volunteers, labelled them with 111Indium and reinfused them to note no substantial differences (a maximum difference between any two groups of approximately 5% of the surviv al times found) in platelet survival time according to any of three different mathematical models . Newman and Mitchell (1984) report on a 20 year -old female CBS -- case diagnosed eventually (and later found to be VitB6 -responsive) after thrombotic sequelae following one month after first parturition, whose platelets while on warfarin treatment (no CBS -- treatment) following on serial thrombectomies, had a very high count at 674,000/ul (normal <450,000/ul), and had a stirred, EDTA -added, whole -blood platelet disappearance of 20% (normal <5%). However molondialdehyde -generation in clotted whole blood was normal, as was separated platelet rich plasma behaviour with regard to arachidonic acid -induced malondialdehyde production, and response to challenge with ADP, adrenaline and collagen. In conclusion, it seems reasonable to assume that platelets are more likely to generate thrombi when/after contacting damaged endovascular epithelium, and that reduced FMD causes pressure phenomena that probably in crease thrombogenesis (as well as vascular endothelial damage) . These phenomena are likely to apply not only to normal platelets, but also to deranged platelets. The other obvious inconsistencies in, and incompleteness of , the information discussed on pl atelet behaviour in CBS -- patients I am unable to resolve in general and in particular with regard to the differences in thromboses outcomes of Dublin versus the other four groups examined here. MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 42 3.8 Overall conclusion for Chapter 3 . There seems enough evidence to warrant consideration that cysteine supplementation may be of more importance than generally acknowledged , in the treatment of CBS --, and that it should be seen as a standard part of all treatment regimes, not only as part of a synthetic formula CBS -- diet food . Perhaps in some cases the cysteine dose should be varied more systematically as a function of the use of homocysteine -lowering treatment modalities other than VitB6 (such as betaine, that metabolic fl of homocysteine down the CBS transsulfuration pathway in VitB6 - responsive CBS --, by allowing it to escape down the remethylation pathway), when it becomes potentially even more important , although reduced homocysteine levels resul ting in less sequestration of cysteine in homocysteine -cysteine and less other interference with cysteine would (variably) ameliorate this. Likewise, that low -methionine, high -fruit and vegetable diets may be of more importance than generally acknowledge d, and that where compliance with this is compromised (and perhaps in any case, to some extent) , supplementation with (at least) vitamin C and other antioxidants should be implemented, though hopefully not in a manner so as to further displace the diet. Also, the apparent thoroughness of the Dublin group with regard to the reinforcement/cultivation of compliance with dietary treatment, though they do not have a perfect success in this regard, is potentially worthy of study and emulation. Though, perhaps those patients/ parents who do not comply with low -methionine high -cysteine synthetic formula diets may well potentially comply with an appealing generally healthy low -methionine wholefood high-fruit and vegetable diet with cysteine supplementation via a c apsule. It behoves to consider that these CBS -- cohorts are not yet into older age, when pathologic outcomes in general are greatly increased. Further study of these matters, at least via ongoing monitoring of treatments/outcomes , and improved detail of data collected, is obviously desirable. Clarification of platelet behaviour and mechanisms would potentially be helpful. It is redundant for me to note that further inquiry into the role of homocysteine in disease is desirable, but I add that some more attention to/inclusion of related other metabolites seems warranted.

The superior sagittal sinus and some of its immediate tributaries are occupied by fully organised and partly recanilized tissue. The venae cavae are normal. In the left renal vein t here is moderate degree of fibrous endophlebitis. Other veins are normal. Medium -sized muscular arteries are affected in a patchy fashion. Lesions are detected in some of the arteries in the spleen, pancreas, colon, thyroid, and thymus, pelvis and left kid ney, with minor or few changes of the same type in arteries of the heart, liver and right kidney. The internal elastic lamina is prominent and often thick. The main element is intimal fibrosis without deposits of iron pigments or other special features. Th e fibrosis is either symmetrically distributed so as sometimes to cause severe narrowing, as in the splenic artery, or symmetrically distributed in the form of pads. In the intimal pads, layers of elastic fibrils have split of from the main elastic lamina and small degrees of metachromasia are present. The medial coats of these arteries do not usually stain metachromatically but in some sections of the left renal and splenic arteries the muscle fibers are separated from each other and thinned out by promine nt deposits of interstitial material which stains as collagen and also stains metachromatically with moderate intensity. The external elastic lamina is often swollen. The adventitia is little affected except in vessels such as the proximal part of the hepa tic artery where thrombus is being organized; in those sites the vasa vasorum are congested and there is little polymorphic infiltration of the media.....There is slight concentric intimal fibrosis which is marked in the common iliacs and associated there wi th some fatty atheromatous plaques. Some area of intimal fibrosis stain well with alcain. The media is a little less cellular than normal with increased amounts of interstitial material between elastic fibres....The elastica is frayed, attenuated or irregula rly thickened and disorderly in arrangement in such areas, particularly in the superior mesenteric artery. A little polymorph infiltration is associated with the aneurysmal dilatation ofthis vessel....The microscopic structure of the aorta is most altered in the arch above the left subclavian artery where the wall is stretched and thin. The intima of the arch is little altered. The adventitia is congested and the vasa vasorum are prominent; there is a little lymphocytic infiltration and no fibrosis. The medi a is deeply penetrated by by vasa vasorum and slightly fibrosed and the lines of the muscular and elastic fibres are disturbed and disrupted here and there. In little cysts or pools around some of the vasa vasorum and in little clumps between cells lie sm all granular or hyaline areas which are brightly metachromatic.......mouths of the renal arteries and neighboring large branches. Here the findings are complicated by ridges of intimal fibrosis. These ridges and striations are composed of moderately cellular f ibrous tissue thickly interspersed with elastic fibrils. Staining for fibrin and for iron pigment is negative in the ridges and metachromatic staining is generally slight except where the fibrous tissue merges with the the process of organisation of thromb us in the aortic lumen. The media is not extensively altered but is thinned under the intimal ridges and there the vasa vasorum are prominent and penetrate deeply into the media. The adventitia is slightly fibrosed and there is a little lymphocytic infiltr ation round the vasa. The pulmonary artery is of looser texture than normal and between the fibres lie many small deposits of material that stain metachromatically.\" (continues) Hcy-uria present, Equates to tHcy > 40uM Beta Synthase Severe Homozygous (or compound heterozygous) Mutations Authors, Journal, Site Study Group Disease Hcy level Treatmnt and biochem etc contexts (continued) Gibson JB et al (1964); J Clin Path; Two hospitals, Belfast, Ireland (Cont) Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 (Continued) GM, detected at the age of 13years, mentally retarded, Marfanoid Habitus, ectopia lentis, hematuria the at age 6years \"; blood pressure was 115/70mm Hg, blood urea 168mm%.

In the larger arteries, fibrous tissue has proliferated in the intima as a thin irregularly disposed layer and elastic fibres extent into it from the internal elastic lamina; the intima shows marked metachromasia. In the m edia muscle fibres are often enlarged and somewhat irregularly arranged with an increase of interstitial material which stains as collegen and is, in places, metachromatic; fine elastic fibrils of frayed appearance are scattered through the muscle singly o r occasionally together in narrow wedge - shaped segments of the vessels. The external elastic lamina is a little thickened and frayed; there is little or no alteration in the adventitia; sometimes a little metachromasia is seen. Similar changes have taken p lace in the arcuate arteries. At this level, intimal fibrosis is often marked in the form of pads and other asymmetrical deposits. Many elastic fibrils traverse these deposits and the internal elastica is often reduplicated. Sometimes the muscle is irregul arly disposed and segmental area of fibrosis occur in the media. The walls of the straight arteries are thickened by fibrosis of the media, sometimes severely, the internal elastica is often reduplicated, and there is often a little ring of metachromasia b eneath it and hyperplasia of the muscle.\" For other details see GM case of Carson et al (1965) below AS, male, severely mentally retarded, Marfanoid Habitus, ectopia lentis, several unexplained episodes of venous thrombosis in the lower limbs from the ag e of 2years 8months, at age 7years admitted to hospital with venous thrombosis in the lower limbs, liver enlarged and palpable fingerbreadths below costal margin, platelets reactions soft yellowish -pink with a smooth surface and rounded edge, \"I n a surgical biopsy of liver, a marked degree of fatty change was seen.

It is commonly supposed that the myelin loss and sponginess in this type of degeneration is secondary to serous imbibition, which in turn, is due to a congenital defect in the blood -brain barrier or osmotic dysfunction. The marked defi ciency of sulfhydryl and disulfide groups at the site of the greatest sponginess suggests that any defect in the blood -brain barrier is due to the lack of sulfur proteins.

Dietary treatments: At some point in time each of Patients A, C, and D were commenced on a low-methionine diet \"which provided approx 1g protein and 10mg of methionine per kgBW/day. Half of th e daily protein and methionine intake was supplied by soybean protein ('Sobee', Mead Johnson). The remainder of the dietary protein and methionine was derived from a wide variety of cereals, vegetables and fruits. All foods of animal origin were excluded from the diet.....Each patient was also given daily supplements of dicalcium phosphate, ferrous sulfate, and a multivitamin preparation.\" Choline 10g/day was given intermittently, but a 100day period of it was centered about the time of the institution of the low-methionine diet in all cases; Patient A also received 10g/day for a 40day period 20days prior to the 100day period, and Patients C and D received also 10g/day for two periods 50days, 30days, after the 100day period. Pyridoxine (VitB6) 500mg/day was gi ven for a 20day period separate from and partly occupying the intermission 'twixt the latter two choline periods in Patients C and D, and for 20day and 40day periods bracketing the choline periods but well separate from them in Patient A. (see also continu ation next table, for cystine details) Results: The pyridoxine (VitB6) was not associated with any change in either plasma methionine or homocysteine in Patients C and D, so these seem to be VitB6 -nonresponsive cases. In Patient A there was an association with lower plasma homocysteine paired with barely -visibly lower plasma methionine in the second period but not the first. The choline was fairly consistently associated with lower plasma homocysteine paired with higher plasma methionine, of lesser magnitu des during the low -methionine diet periods. The low -methionine diet was consistently associated with decreased plasma methionine and decreased plasma homocysteine. Note: The arrangement of these treatment periods was quite well done with a view to differe ntiating the effects, via maximising crossover in the context of ethical maintenance of the low -methionine diet once instituted.

The material was light red when stained with Giemsa but metachromatic red -violet when stained with toluidine blue. Reduced numbers of fibrils of normal morphology were present either in confluent areas or in sparsely p opulated areas. The abnormal material was produced throughout the growth cycle. When Hcy or Hcy thiolactone was added to the culture medium, larger amounts of the abnormal substance formed. In addition, comparison with control cultures revealed that the to tal number of cells in the monolayer was decreased after 1 week's growth when Hcy 1000uM was added to the medium. The addition of Hcy 200 -2000uM to the medium did not, however alter the cloning efficiency (26%) of the CBS \u2014cells. In cultures with Hcy in the medium, some of the cells were found to contain small, uniform sized cytoplasmic granules, less than 1u in diameter, frequently distributed in a short linear array at the margin of the cytoplasm, and extending along extracellular appearing fibrils. Cells from the normal patients formed large numbers of long extracellular and intracellular fibrils of varying length and diameter without evidence of granular aggregated material. Addition of Hcy or Hcy thiolactone (He doesn't give conc...apparently 1000uM from his Figure caption.) to the medium, however, resulted in the formation of moderate amounts of light red -staining granular flocculent substance and small amounts of fine granular material associated with fibrils. ...... Examination of the confluent layer of no rmal cells, by polarized light, revealed numerous, long, moderately birefringent fibrils. However, only small numbers of short, irregular, clumped birefringent fibrils were observed in the confluent \"Discussion and Conclusions: The altered solubility of the glycoprotein and proteoglycan fractions isolated from the aorta of a patient with homocystinuria (cites Carson NAJ et al 1966) is probably the result of an altered state of aggregation and molecular conformation of proteoglyca ns synthesized by aortic cells. The ectopia lentis commonly observed in the syndrome was found to result from replacement of the normal fibrillar structure of the zonular fibers by irregular, granular material (cites Henkind and Ashton 1965). This morpholo gic change is very similar to the replacement of fibrils by granular fragmented material observed in the cultured cells. The findings of increased amounts of soluble collagen and an increase in the amount of noncross -linked collagen in two individuals wit h homocystinuria (cites Harris and Sjoerdsma 1966( )), as well as some features of the various connective tissue abnormalities in the syndrome, are presumably due to partial inhibition of normal collagen cross -linking by abnormal proteoglycans elaborat ed by the CBS \u2014cells of connective tissues.....The glycousaminoglycans of human skin cultures do however, contain appreciable amounts of esterified sulfate. If increased homocysteine concentrations within the cell produced a change in the number or distributi on of esterified sulfate groups on the carbohydrate side chains of the proteoglycan molecules synthesized by the cell, a drastic change in the conformationof the macromolecule at physiologic pH might be expected to result from the consequent alteration in the ratio of charge on polypeptide core to charge on surrounding carbohydrate envelope.....The finding that the addition of Hcy (1000uM from figure caption) to the culture medium of normal cells produced proteoglycan abnormalities similar to those found in CBS\u2014cell cultures suggests that elevated concentrations of exogenous homocysteine are capable of producing arteriosclerotic and connective tissue changes in vivo in normal individuals without enzyme deficiencies.\" MFHEI Multifactor Beta Synthase Severe Homozygous (or compound heterozygous) Mutations Authors, Journal, Site Study Group Disease McCully KS (1972); Am J Pathol; Massach'ts General Hospital, Boston, USA 2 CBS \u2014 cases, And, 2 Control human Cell lines \"Fragments of dermis were obtained fro m a skin biopsy of a 9y -old, mentally retarded female with documented cystathionine synthetase deficiency and homocystinuria.

The meaning of this might be that: in the CBS -- cells there is a deficit of endogenous sulfate due to the defective transulfuration pathway, which the cell attempts to redress by in corporating more exogenous sulfate, and that endogenous Hcy has already bound to a large proportion of binding sites in the CBS -- cells, leaving less opportunity for exogenous Hcy to bind, However, as we are unable to differentiate extracellular phenomena from intracellular phenomena , such interpretations must be viewed with caution to say the least. # No consistent effect of adding extra sulfate to medium on the binding of exogenous Hcy MFHEI Multifactor Health and Synthase Severe Homozygous (or c ompound heterozygous) Mutations Authors, Journal, Site Study Group Disease (continued) McKully KS (1972); Am J Pathol; Massach'ts General Hospital, Boston, USA (cont) 2 CBS -- cases, And, 2 Control human Cell lines \"Aliquots of some homogenates were mixed with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and filtered through Millipore filters; the filters and filtrates were counted in while some 35SO42- will be endogenous from the processing of 35S- Hcy'lactone down the transulfuration pathway, mostly in the normal cells were it is available - \"The observation that CBS \u2014cell monolayers bind 35S in an amount aprox equal to or lower than that of normal cell monolayers may be explained by assuming that cellular synthesis of unlabelled homocysteine and homocysteic acid derived from methionine was increased due to CBS -- inability to convert the Hcy to cystathionine (>>>sulfate).

Moreover, the result does not argue strongly against the benefit of cysteine supplementation for all CBS \u2014 pateines, Vit B6 -responsive and -nonresponsive, because some proteins have a higher content of cysteine than others, and the fact that in this experiment with only 7 CBS \u2014subjects, over a a very short period of time, were only roughly close to being in nitrogen balance, does not argue strongly that over the whole of a lifetime , a CBS \u2014patient of either B6 typ e without supplemental cysteine would be fairly likely to evolve by middle or old age significant disease due to the lack of that supplemental cysteine. Aside from cysteine in body proteins, there are also other metabolites of cysteine that are potentially of importance - cystathionine, glutationine and its anti -oxidant activity, sulphate, and hydrogen sulphide, just for examples. Many chronic diseases are known to have the contributing factors present for many years before the diseases finally develop to be clinically manifest in middle or old age.

At admission he had a walking distance of only 100metres. There were no known cardiovascular cases among his relatives. He had been smoking 20 cigarettes/day since age 20. Bilateral extirpation of his eye lenses had been performed in 1971 because of luxation. The patient appeared older than 35years. He had a course, light -coloured hair. He had a normal body build and there was no sign of mental retardation. Heart, lung and abdomen were normal at physical examination. ECG and laboratory tests including blood lipids were also normal. Arteriography demonstr ated occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery. A femoro -popliteal vein bypass was performed. The operation was uncomplicated and the function of the leg was restored to normal. In September 1977, the patient was readmitted for further investigat ion. All routine tests were within normal limits. .... The cyanide -nitroprusside reaction of urine was positive.... Treatment with pyridoxine 320mg/day was started. Subsequent homocystine tests in urine were negative, indicating a favourable response to treat ment. On January 8 1978, he noted the sudden onset of sever abdominal pain. On admission a pulsating abdominal mass was found. Aortography showed a large abdominal aortic aneurysm. In retrospect this aneurysm could be seen in the previous arteriograms. Emergency laparotomy was performed and a large leaking aneurysm was found with retroperitoneal bleeding. The aneurysm measured 10*13cm and large organised thrombi covered the inner wall. The aneurysm was resected and a bifurcated dacron graft was inserted into the common iliac arteries. The postoperative course was uneventful.

Labour had been induced after a small ante -partum Hemorrhage but the pregnancy was otherwise norm al. The vaginal delivery was complicated by a retained placenta which was removed manually under general anaesthesia. She remained well until 1month post -partum when she noticed that both her feet felt cold and numb. When walking she developed aching pa in in both calves which abated after rest; during the next month her right leg gradually improved but she continued to have pain in the left. 2months post -partum she suddenly developed pain, numbness and paraesthesia in her left arm.... For 10minutes she al so had intense vertigo and a disturbance of vision which she described as \"like staring at a bright light\". There was no relevant past medical history and she had never taken the contraceptive pill. During pregnancy she had taken ferrous sulphate and during labour she received oxytocin (Syntocinon), pethidine, promethazine and ergotamine with oxytocin (Syntometrine). After manual removal of the retained placenta a single dose of ergometrine was given intravenously. No drugs were given to suppress lact ation and on admission she was taking inositol nicotinate (Hexopal).... Initial investigations to identify a source of emboli, a vasculitis or a thrombotic tendency were negative. These included a chest radiograph, echocardiogram, blood cultures, full blood count and film, ESR, anti -thrombinIII level, fibrinolytic screen, VDRL, TPHA, and a search for immune complexes and cryoglobulins. An arch aortogram via the femoral route showed complete obstruction at the origins of the left subclavian and vertebral arte ries and injection of contrast into the lower aorta showed marked narrowing of both external iliac arteries and occlusion of the right internal iliac artery. The left subclavian artery was explored; it was found to have a normal external appearance but to be occluded by a large thrombus which was removed. Histology showed this to be laminated platelet -leucocyte -fibrin material which was sterile on culture. The brachial pulse was restored but was lost again several hours after the operation. In spite of re -exploration, the removal of further thrombus and anticoagulation with heparin, the artery occluded yet again. She was subsequently anticoagulated with warfarin and made good progress apart from developing a left ulnar nerve palsy and a tender swollen left calf which had the clinical appearance of a typical deep vein thrombosis..... positive cyanide -nitroprusside reaction...confirmed aa analysis, but detailed clinical examination after the acute episode showed no stigmata of homocystinuria save for quivering o f the iris of both eyes (iridodonesis) on slit - lamp examination.

Her whole - blood platelet count was found to be very high 674,000/ul (normal range up to 450,000/ul). Her whole -blood platelet aggregation, as judged by the disappearance of single platelets from stirred whole blood to which EDTA had been added as anticoagulant was 20% in 6minutes (upper limit of normal 5%) but her ability to generate malondialdehyde (MDA) in clotted whole blood was normal at 12.5uM. Tests of platelet activity in separated platelet rich plasma were within our normal range (arachidonic acid -induced MDA production - 9,7nmol/109platelets; platelet release reaction, as judged by the 5HT liberated in response to challenge with ADP, adrenaline and collagen was normal).

Segments of forearm vein were excised under local anesthesia and were immediately fixed both in tact and after opening up. The blocks also included some small arteries. Scrutiny of the vessels by light, transmission, and where appropriate, scanning electron microscopy, showed them to be normal. In particular, normal endothelial cells were seen to be covering the intima with no breaks or defects..... Pyridoxine 250mg/day was added to her warfarin nerve palsy progressively improved, but when she became more active after leaving hospital, she experienced left calf claudication at 50yards. 2months later she could walk for 2miles on the flat without pain, although she still had some discomfort on hur rying up steep hills. This was matched by a return of the left dorsalis pedis pulse and a stronger left femoral pulse but there has been no return of the pulses in the left arm. She continues on pyridoxine 250mg daily and on warfarin to produce Thrombotes t levels of 5 -10%. We can document the contribution which the former has made to render the amino acid metabolism normal (overgeneralisation. DV) so we can confidently advise her to continue it indefinitely. What is less clear, however, is whether the cor rection of the homocystinemia with pyridoxine has now controlled her \"thrombotic tendency\" so that we could stop the anticoagulants. (Note: Consider the possibility that rebound hyposulfatism resulted from the cessation of the ferrous sulfate in the conte xt of apparently no cysteine supplementation and the only minor activity of the other (methionine - metabolising) pathway generating endogenous sulfate - could this lead to heparin hyposulfation and a resultant increase in platelet stickiness?....DV) We a re similarly uncertain as to the part played by pregnancy in her thrombotic episodes and do not know how to advise her about the risks of a second pregnancy, with or without anticoagulant cover. The brother has remained symptom free but has elected to sta rt pyridoxine treatment.

Combination of the results from screening programs of newborns in the Rocky Mountain states, New England, and Maryland and Delaw are (various citations) leads to a rate of detection of CBS -- of 1/209,000 newborns (total 3+ million screened). Extrapolating this combined ratio to the country as a whole, assuming from the results reported here that 78% of those detected are VitB6 -nonresponsive and taking into account the age structure of the population of the USA and the less than normal survival of VitB6 -nonresponsive, one may estimate that in the USA the number of living VitB6 -nonresponsive CBS -- persons <=25y of age should be 299, a nd incidence of 1/738,000 persons in the total population. Reports were obtained for the survey concerning 63 patients of this sort, or 1/3,500,000. Although the above estimate is no better than a very rough approximation, it appears that a substantial proportion of potential VitB6 -nonresponsive subjects in the USA have been both diagnosed and reported on in the present survey.

The biochemical changes were not improved by treatmen t with pyridoxine. At the age of 18y he developed spasmodic torticollis followed by truncal and upper limb dystonia. He had prominent retrocollis and truncal hyperextension which were exacerbated by walking. Tetrabenzine and anticholinergic agents had no effect on the dydtonia although bromocriptine produced a modest improvement. He died at the age of 22 from bronchopneumonia secondary to severe neurological disability. Neuropathological examination. The brain weighed 1520g and showed no macroscopic abn ormalities on external and cut surfaces. The vessels of the circle of Willis were of normal configuration and serial sections of the main cerebral vessels revealed no sign of organised thrombus. Histological examination with haematoxylin and eosin staining showed no evidence of thrombosis affecting small intraparenchymal vessels. Sections through areas of frontal lobe convexity and orbital cerebral cortex and temporal lobe cerebral cortex were normal with respect to the thickness of the cortical ribbon, and cell numbers, type and layering; there was no sign of gliosis. Sections of caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus and substantia nigra were normally pigmented. Cell populations in all of these areas were assessed semi - quantitatively in luxol fast blue/cresyl violet sections; standard areas were examined using eyepiece graticule and stage micrometer to check magnification and compared to an age and sex matched control. This did not indicate any significant loss of neuron s. Case 2: This girl presented at age 7years with mental retardation (IQ = 60) and bilateral lens dislocation. At that time a diagnosis of pyridoxine -resistant homocystinuria was made. At age 9, upper right limb tremor and hypertonia associated with a bnormal posture of the right shoulder were observed and over the subsequent years she developed progressive dystonia affecting limbs, neck, trunk and tongue associated with dysarthria, generalised hypertonia, hyperreflexia and a shuffling gait. A cranial computed tomographic scan at the age of 20 was normal apart from a small cortical area of low density in the right temporal region. Now aged 26, she has persistent generalised dystonia which has proved resistant to treatment with haloperidol, Lioresal, br omocriptine and clonazepam. Case 3: This boy presented at the age of 4years with marked developmental delay and bilateral lens dislocation. Pyridoxine resistant homocystinuria was diagnosed. At age 9years he began to have tonic -clonic and akinetic seiz ures, which were treated with phenytoin and sodium valproate. He developed a Marfanoid body habitus and was severely intellectually impaired (IQ<50). At age 5years he first showed a tendency to walk on his toes and by the age of 10 his gait was unstead y, he was dysarthric and there was generalised hyperreflexia. Thereafter gradual evolution of involuntary movements affecting neck, trunk and lower limbs occurred. At the present time, aged 19, he has dystonic posturing of the neck and feet with superimpo sed rapid torsional neck movements and choreiform lower limb movements.

See Above The Authors provide 2 scatterplots, one with plasma free Cys (fCys) on the x axis, the othe r with plasma free Hcy (fHcy) on the x axis, the y axes being \"Ratio: Bound Cys/Free Cys (Hcy) ((umol/g protein x 1000)/umol/l)\" - note that the factor 1000 should have been 74 as noted above, so for the following discussion I have corrected their y axes' s scales by dividing them by 1000/74 = 13.5. For the cysteine there is a slight curve ascending to the right, such that at plasma fCys 50uM the ratio = 0.3, at plasma fCys 75uM the ratio = 1.0, at plasma fCys 100uM the ratio is 1.4, at plasma fCys 12 5uM the ratio is 1.7, at plasma fCys 150uM the ratio is 1.9. For the homocysteine there is a quite sharp reverse -J-curve descending to the right, such that at plasma fHcy <10uM the ratio = >2.0 (max 6 at far left), at plasma fHcy 20uM the ratio = 1.3, at plasma fHcy 30uM the ratio is 1.1, at plasma fHcy 50uM the ratio is 1.0, at plasma fHcy 100uM the ratio is 0.9, at plasma fHcy 200uM the ratio is 0.6 It may be concluded that Hcy has a greater affinity than Cys for plasma proteins It may be concl uded that my operating assumption that Hcy<40uM is bound to protein and thereafter free as Hcy(ine) or Hcy -Cys is simplistic (and that not surprisingly), as tHcy goes up to say 200uM, then boundHcy goes up to say 75uM, so that where I have added only 40uM to higher values of fHcy in the literature to derive a rough tHcy, it may be taken that the tHcy value is lower than it ought be, by as much as 100uM at say 400uM fHcy. At low ie trace or nil values of fHcy the assumption of tHcy<40uM is roughly correct en ough for most useful purposes. Also the ramifications regarding the higher values ie in CBS -- are trivial for most useful purposes, and for mine in this work.

The specific activities of methionine adenosyltransferase and betaine -homocysteine methyltransferase are lower in the fetal liver than in the adult liver, whereas the activit y of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate -homocysteine methyltransferase is higher in fetal tissue than in adult tissue (cites Gaull et al 1972, 1973). This fetal enzyme pattern should direct a large portion of the available homocysteine to the 5 -methyltetrahydrofolat e-dependent methylation cycle rather than towards the synthesis of cystathionine, then change to an adult pattern during development. (Seems these two former abovementioned lower enzyme activities would lead to an increase in Hcy, while the latter aboveme ntioned higher enzyme activity would lead to a decrease in Hcy?..... relative proportions of metabolic activity, as well as developmental evolution of other enzymes in these pathways need be considered also.

In other tissues, intracellular accumulation of Hcy causes export of Hcy into t he extracellular space. In the CNS, CSF is in continuity with the extracellular space, and accumulation of Hcy in this fluid is likely to reflect accumulation within the brain. The mammalian brain does not contain the enzyme betaine -homocysteine methyltran sferase (cites McKeever et al 1991). So the effect of betaine is most probably mediated through changes in the plasma Hcy concentration. Because we found that CSF Hcy concentrations decreased with betaine treatment, it suggests that the reduction in plasma tHcy caused by betaine is responsible for the decrease in CSF tHcy. It is possible that a reduction in plasma concentration of Hcy facilitates the active removal of Hcy fthe brain, thereby reducing its accumulation in the CFS.....Another potential mechanism might involve oxidation of Hcy to homocysteid acid, which is glutamate + Folate Ditto + + Betaine 250mg/ kgBW/d * 3 - 6month 3 on low diet + Folate Ditto + Betaine 250mg/ kgBW/d * 3 http://sites.google.com/site/multifa Severe Homozygous (or compound Muta tions Authors, Journal, Site Study Group Disease DEL Wilcken B (1997); J Inher Metab Dis; Prince Henry, Prince of Wales, and New Children's Hospitals, Sydney, NSW, Australia (Continues) 40 CBS --, 17 VitB6 - responsiv 15 VitB6 - nonrespon Age 30, (9-66) years 8 VitB6??

DV) Vascular Events Vascular events were documented in surviving and nonsurviving patients in relation to whether or not they were receiving treatment at the time of the event, and to what the treatment was. We assessed the effect of treatment on the occurrence of vascular events by comparing the findings in our treated patients with those in the untreated patients reviewed by M udd and Colleagues (1985). They found that at the time of maximum risk (beyond the age of 10y) there was 1 event per 25y. We compared our risk data with that statistic. This is a conservative estimate since, before treatment started, 2 patients had alread y had vascular events, which enhances the risk in untreated patients to about 1 event in 10y (Mudd et al 1985). (Note: this \"enhancement\" might only apply if a patient doesn't know why the event occurred, or what to do about it - otherwise it might not, an d might even decrease risk by fright value and a resulting increase in treatment compliance...DV) Results In the 40 patients there were 10 deaths at ages 2 -30y. ...only 2 were receiving effective treatment at the time of death, and only 1 of the 2 was CBS ---related, ...massive pulmonary embolus. (Note: There were 2 deaths whilst on \"No effective treatment\" for which no further details are provided. DV). Of the 32 patients receiving effective treatment, 17 were pyridoxine -responsive. During 281 patient years of t reatment which maintained plasma total free homocyst(e)ine consistently <20uM, there were 2 vascular events in this group. 1 patient, referred to above, succumbed from a pulmonary embolus and a second patient, who had had 4 vascular events prior to startin g treatment at age 41y, subsequently had a myocardial infarction at the age of 55y. From the data of Mudd et al (1985), untreated, 11 events would have been expected, relative risk =0.17 (CI .04 -0.80) P = .026. During 258 patient -years of treatment I the 15 pyridoxine -non-responsive patients, no vascular event occurred. These 15 nonresponsive patients have current mean+/ - SD total free homocyst(e)ine of 33+/ -17uM. From the data of Mudd et al (1985), in untreated nonresponsive patients at least 10 events w ould have been expected, P = .005. 19 patients of the series had a total of 19 major and 15 minor operatios requiring an anaesthetic and there were 3 successful pregnancies, one in a patient receiving betaine. There were no thromboembolic complications. Thus, during 539 patient -years of treatment in all 32 patients there were 2 vascular events, whereas, if untreated, 21 events would have been expected. These findings indicate that treatment markedly reduced the relative risk to .09 (95%CI .02 -0.38) P = .0001.\" (Continues) tHcy Beta Synthase Severe Homozygous (or compound heterozygous) Mutations Authors, Journal, Site Study Group Disease Hcy level (Continued) Wilcken DEL Wilcken B (1997); J Inher Metab Dis; Prince Henry, Prince of Wales, and New Children's Hospitals, Sydney, NSW, Australia (Contin) (Continued) Now, as Mudd et al (1985)'s risk of thrombosis is not constant over time, but ra ther sigmoidal, with the risk at <10y of age and >32y of age being approximately half the risk at (max) age 21, and as the average ages of the subgroups of pyridoxine - responsive( -nonresponsive) have not been provided here by W & W, the only comparison that may be properly attempted is that between W & W's combined (VitB6 -responsive( -nonresponsive)) group and Mudd et al's combined group. That of the sentence immediately preceeding this paragraph. Now, as Mudd et al's statistic of 1 event per 25y refers to ( both of, approximately equal) the respective periods of maximum risk of thrombosis of the VitB6 - responsive( -nonresponsive) subgroups (ages 22y and 15y respectively, mean 18.5y), and as the average age of W & W's combined group is 32y, then their group here is expected to be a nontrivialy lower risk group, and therefore their estimation of relative risk is not conservative, but a rather a nontrivial overestimation/inference of treatment efficacy. Furthermore, here, as in Mudd et al the oldest cases are mild er cases by survival, but their oldest cases here will be milder cases than Mudd et al's due to (hopefully...) improved diagnosis. Also, their youngest cases here will too be milder cases than Mudd et al's due to (hopefully...) improved diagnosis. Therefore the real relative risk is likely to be nontrivialy higher (less treatment efficacy) than they report here, possibly so as to include unity in the CI, though note that given the lowish n, the suggestion of efficacy is certainly strong enough to warrant cont inuing with the treatment, while considering possible improvements (ie earlier detection, cysteine supplements, VitC, VitE, and better dietary al (1997); J Inher Metab Dis; U Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, U K 12 CBS --, 13 CBS -+ Obligate Heterozyg 22 Normal \"We have compared the relationship between total homocysteine and free homocystine in plasma in 12 patients with CBS \u2014over a 2year period, 13 obligate heterozygotes and 22 normal individuals.

At least 7 countries have either national or regional screening programmes; 12 programmes are known to have discontinued. The wrldwide incidence of HCU i s approximately 1 in 335,000 but varies from 1:65,000 (Ireland) to 1:900,000 (Japan). Methodologies include the BIA, one -dimensional or thin -layer amino acid chromatography and, more recently, tandem mass spectrometry. The BIA diagnostic cut off concentra tion of blood methionine varies from 67 to 270uM (10 - 40mg/l) with a median of 135uM (20mg/l). In Ireland, 25 cases of HCU from 19 families have been identified from 1.58 million newborn infants since 1971; 21 cases were detected through the screening progr amme. Of the 4 missed cases, 3 were breast -fed (= lower -methionine diet. DV) at the time of blood collection and 1 was pyridoxine responsive. These findings are in broad agreement with the results from 5 other programmes, in which approximately 1 in every 5 cases was missed by the screening programme.

Of the 4 cases missed on screening, 3 presented with ectopia lentis after the age of 2years.... All 21 cases of HCU detected by newborn screening had high blood methionine concentration of more than 100uM, assayed by t he bacterial inhibition assay (BIA) on the heel prick blood sample taken on day3 to day5 of life. A liquid blood sample, separated and deproteinized within 10min of collection, was requested from these infants and assayed using an amino acid analyser for m ethionine, free homocystine and cystine. A high blood methionine and free homocystine with a low cystine confirmed the diagnosis for those detected on newborn screening and those that presented clinically.... Clinical management and follow -up: All patients diagnosed as having HCU had their pyridoxine status (pyridoxine - responsivity status meant. DV) determined clinically by commencement on oral pyridoxine 50mg*3/day as inpatients....Pyridoxine responsiveness was indicated by a rapidly falling methionine level and clearing of free homocystine from the plasma, while pyridoxine nonresponsiveness was indicated by persistently high or rising plasma methionine and free homocystine. In pyridoxine -nonresponsive patients, dietary management was commenced by restrictin g dietary methionine and using a methionine -free, cystine -supplemented synthetic mixture. Methionine was added as a proprietary food preparation or as breast milk and the amount was titrated against the plasma methionine and free homocystine concentration . Two-thirds of the total protein intake was derived from the synthetic methionine -free, cystine -supplemted mixture and the remaining third from the natural methionine - containing foods (P. Howard, personal communication). Plasma VitB12 and folate were as sayed and, if they were found deficient, the patient was given supplements. Once stabilized, blood was drawn, deproteinized, and analysed for methionine, free homocystine and cystine at least once a month, or more frequently if clinically indicated, to mo nitor biochemical control. During all episodes of acute illness, prompt treatment of the illness with additional supportive care, including adequate hydration and aspirin or dipyridamole, was given to prevent blood stasis..... Upon discharge from hospital, patients initially attended the outpatient department fortnightly and thereafter at 4 - to 6-weekly intervals. They were reviewed minimally at least 4 times per year.

Now, although it may certainly not be said that the treatment here could have been statistically significantly more efficacious than that of the Australian CBS -- cases repoted on by Wilcken and Wilcken, there is a substantial suggestion that it may have been in regard to thromboembolism, on taking into account that there has been far more venupuncture (which has been documented as a precipitant of thromboembolism, which theoretical considerations strongly support) in the Irish cases of Yap and Naughten (an av erage of a minimum of 58 punctures each) than in the Australian cases of W & W, and that the increased sulfate provided by the cystine supplementation plausibly increases the sulfation of ie heparin to an extent that increases its ability to prevent throm bosis (CITATION). The obvious implication being that increased Hcy is not the only metabolite level change that is pathogenic in CBS --. Noteworthy also is the apparently scrupulous attention to establishing the low - methionine, cystine -supplemented dietary treatment at a very early stage of infancy, and following through with comprehensive reinforcement, for which the practitioners ought be highly commended. However, note that even so, some ammount of non -compliance is likely to creep in as time passes, and that in this regard, it is likely that the cystine supplementation would suffer less non -compliance than the low -methionine diet. Overall, there is a fairly strong suggestion, that all CBS --treatment regimes should include cystine supplementation - which many apparently do not. Note that CBS -- cohorts have not yet been followed into old age, where factor suboptimality is manifest in increasingly worse outcomes, in general.

All 31 CBS -- diagnosed /managed since 1962 Since 1962 we have been responsible for the diagnosis and/or the management of 31 patients with CBS --, 23 of whom have been non responsive to pyridoxine. 12 patients, all of whom are non responsive, were diagn osed after an initial finding of raised methionine on our newborn screening programme (started in 1969). The eldest patient from this group is now 25y of age. All other patients (10 non responsive, 8 responsive presented with typical clinical features of homocystinuria. Patients non responsive to pyridoxine have been assessed 3 -monthly and those with pyridoxine responsive disease yearly. On each occasion blood has been collected, deproteinised and assayed with an amino acid analyser. The concentration of homocystine measured in this way represented plasma free homocyst(e)ine.... In our patients only 8 of 31 were pyridoxine responsive, presumably due to a different genetic population and also to to ascertainment bias as a consequence of our newborn screenin g. Following a diagnosis of CBS --, patients should be treated with VitB6 at a dose of at least 500mg/day for a period of several weeks to determine their response. Folic acid requirements are probably higher in CBS -- as a consequence of increased flux th rough the remethylation pathway, and lack of folate may lead to a suboptimal response to treatment with pyridoxine (cites Wilcken and Turner 1973). Patients should therefore be treated with folic acid (5mg/day) in addition to pyridoxine. Although large do ses of pyridoxine may be associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy this has not been a complication in our patients (cites Mpofu et al 1991)....... Because raised methionine is not prominent in newborn infants with pyridoxine responsive disease this type of homocystinuria is rarely diagnosed by newborn screening. The diagnosis is consequently made only after the development of complications which are largely irreversible. In our experience, however, the skeletal, neurological and vascular probl ems associated with homocystinuria have not progressed following treatment with pyridoxine. The median IQ for our patients with pyridoxine responsive disease was 82 with a range of 57 -101. There was no fall in IQ after treatment had been started. Eye dis ease, however, if advanced, may lead to glaucoma and further damage........ Dietary restriction of methionine, by limiting natural protein intake, necessitates the use of an amino acid supplement, to provide other essential amino acids, vitamins minerals and trace elements and special low protein foods to provide sufficient caloric intake (This might not be correct - limitation of protein to the physiological minimum on the bases of the essential amino acids other than methionine, in the context of choosing those food protein sources that are relatively lower in methionine, might not require the use of any supplemental amino acids other than cysteine (However the use supplemental cysteine can be applied to reduce the amount of methionine, which is largely there by substitutable, required in the diet, ie reduction of the methione intake to a level so low that other essential amino acids then require supplementation...CHECK THIS against the earlier good works examining this, and food tables). Furthermore, there is no thing \"special\" about fruit, or vegetable oils, which in general can meet caloric requirements with little addition to the protein (and somewhat particularly methionine) intake. DV). Cysteine becomes an essential amino acid in CBS -- and needs to be provi ded in an amino acid supplement. The practicalities of the diet are similar to phenylketonuria. We use a protein exchange system in both conditions but in CBS -- one exchange contains approximately 20mg methionine, rather than 50mg of phenylalanine. The d aily amount of methionine tolerated in order to achieve good control (plasma free homocyst(e)ine < 10uM) varies somewhat between patients but is relatively constant throughout life. In the 23 patients treated in our clinic methionine has been restricted to a median value of 230mg/day with a range of 160 -900mg. Many children, particularly adolescents and those diagnosed after infancy, find the low methionine diet difficult. Problems with compliance are common, and an increase in natural protein intake is ra pidly followed by a rise in plasma homocyst(e)ine levels. Reduced intake of the amino acid supplement may also be associated with raised homocyst(e)ine levels and poor growth due to protein catabolism......

In the majority of patients methionine levels increased significantly (before treatment: mean plasma methionine 83 uM, after treatment: mean 295uM, P = .004) although, as a group, biochemical control, as assessed by a fall in plasma free homoc yst(e)ine, was not improved (before treatment: mean plasma free homocyst(e)ine 35uM, after treatment: mean 33uM, P = 0.89). Compliance with betaine in many cases was poor, and this probably explains the lack of efficacy (Their reasoning here seems dubious - it might be at least as likely that compliance with the low -methionine diet decreased, in response to a perception that with the additional treatment, less stringent adherence to the diet would be necessary....assuming the amino acid supplement was easy e nough to comply with?......DV)..... None of our 11 patients diagnosed on newborn screening developed physical stigmata of homocustinuria during childhood. The median IQ for this group of patients was 100 with a range of 84 -117. This is significantly bette r than that found in patients diagnosed after infancy (pyridoxine non responsive patients diagnosed after infancy: median IQ 58, range 20-86, P<.0001; pyridoxine responsive patients diagnosed after infancy: median IQ 82, range 57 - 101, P = .02). During ad olescence control in some individuals deteriorated. One patient suffered from fainting episodes, numbness and weakness of the left arm and leg from the age of 17, although a brain scan and angiography were reported as normal. Despite these symptoms she fai led to comply with diet or take regular pyridoxine. At 21y of age she was found on ophthalmological review to have developed iridodonesis and phacodonesis, with backward displacement of both crystalline lenses leading to a progressive myopia. Another patie nt whose control had deteriorated had a respiratory arrest and died at the age of 19y following a short history of headache and increasing confusion. At post mortem he was found to have an extensive thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and transverse and lateral sinus. There was, however, no evidence of atheroma in the cerebral arteries. The outcome for patients with pyridoxine non responsive disease diagnosed after infancy was poor with a median IQ of 58, range 20 -86. Two siblings diagnosed shortly after the original description of homocystinuria at the ages of 7 and 13y were unable to comply with treatment and died in childhood from pulmonary embolism and thrombosis.... The clinical manifestations of the disease can be avoided with appropriate therap y but only in those children treated from soon after birth. Unfortunately patients with pyridoxine responsive disease rarely have a sufficiently raised methionine in the first weeks of life to be detected on current screening programmes. As a consequence t reatment is most often started in patients with pyridoxine responsive disease only after the development of irreversible damage. Although pyridoxine, with the addition of folic acid, prevents further deterioration in patients with pyridoxine responsive CB S--, a better outcome for such patients will only be achieved if they are identified earlier in life. More sensitive newborn screening methods will need to be developed that are able to detect pyridoxine responsive disease. In non responsive patients a l ow methionine diet with amino acid, mineral and vitamin supplements can be highly successful treatment. However, homocyst(e)ine levels must be kept throughout life, as a loss of good biochemical control at any age is associated with the development of ser ious complications which may be life -threatening.\" Note: It may well be that if response to VitB6 alone is not sufficient to decrease Hcy levels to very near normal, and if VitB6 is not used alone in any case , that it may be desirable to incorporate cysti ene supplementation in treatment (in order to ensure more optimal amounts of each of cysteine and sulfate to be available for their respective biological roles), due to decreased production through the CBS pathway. This desirability of cysteine supplement ation may also apply in the case of suboptimal compliance even when VitB6 alone is sufficient to decrease Hcy levels to very near normal, and VitB6 is used alone.

We have examined 4 apparently non -functiional polymorphisms in the CBS gene and have determined their frequency, degree of linkage disequilibrium and association with plasma Hcy levels. The polymorphisms are a 68bp insertion in C6 and C1985T in the 3' untranslated region. 785 individuals participating in the European Atherosclerosis Research Study II (EARSII), from 11 countries across Europe were genotyped for these polymorphisms. The 68bp insertion ahd the highest frequency in the UK and in the middle region, with a lower frequency in the Baltic and the South (P = .01), and the exon 11 polymorphism had the highest frequencies of the rare allele in the Baltic (P<.05). There was a high degree of linkag e disequilibrium between the polymorphisms (P<.001 overall), except between C699T and the C1985T, with 3 common haplotypes accounting for nearly 80% of the chromosomes. Examination of the association between these polymorphisms and plasma Hcy levels reveal ed that the carriers of the rare alleles of the C699T, C1080T and C1985T polymorphisms had lower plasma Hcy concentrations than those homozygous for the common alleles, although these differences were not ss. The thermolabile valine variant caused by a sub stitution of a C for a T at nucleotide 677 in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) has previously been shown to have profound effects on plasma levels of Hcy in this sample, but the Hcy -raising effect associated with this thermolabile variant wa s not seen incarriers of the 68bp insertion, with this interaction being ss (P<.001). These data demonstrate that variation in the CBS gene as detected with these 4 polymorphisms, had no ss effect on plasma Hcy levels in these healthy young men.

In view of their extremely high homocysteine levels at diagnosis, these patients were treated directly with a combination of therapeutic regimens (pyridoxine and folic acid, with or without betain e). Pyridoxine responders were diagnosed at a mean age of 29years (median 26y, range 7 -45y), and nonresponders at a mean age of 19years (median 16y, range 4 -30y); P = .08. 7 (58%) of 12 homozygotes for the I278T mutation pyridoxine 3 (25%) were nonresponders, and, in 2 (17%) patients, this specific responsiveness could not be assessed.

Biochemically, pyridoxine treatment resulted in a marked decrease in Hcy concentrations of 90% in homozyg otes for the I278T mutation and of 67% in patients with other genotypes (P<.02).

During 257 patient years of treatment in patients with another genotype, 1 patient (25)(VitB6 -responsive) who suffered from a cerebrovascular event before diagnosis died, at age 42y, of a myocardial infarction. In summary, in 378 patient -years of Hcy -lowering treatment, only 2 vascular events were recorded. From the data of Mudd et al (1985), an expected number of primary vascular events of 2 pe r 25years can be calculated for untreated patients. Without treatment in our group fo 27 homocystimurics, at least 30 vascualr events would have been expected (P<.01). During long -term follow -up, no first involvement of any involved organ system was notice d. Furthermore, no deterioration fo clinical symptoms was recorded, except for recurrent depressive episodes in 2 patients (2, 15).\" Now, as the data provided does not enable the outcomes in terms of thromboembolic events to be related to patient -years of treatment with regard to VitB6 -responsiveness, the only appropriate comparison with regard to Mudd et al's (1985) data would be that of the combined whole - group here with that of Mudd et al. So Roughly averaging the age at diagnosis for the whole group is by [14*29years + 9*19years]/(14 + 9 = 23) = 25years, this being for the 14 known VitB6 -responsives with the 9 known VitB6 - nonresponsives, and assuming representativity for the other 6 with undetermined VitB6 -responsiveness. And, 378 patient -years of treat ment for the whole group of 27 cases, so the average age 'now' is by 25years + 378py/27p = 39years. Now, referring these ages to Mudd et al's (1985) Time -to-event graph for first thromboembolic event, the proper method is to subtract the probability of hav ing had a thromboembolic event by age 39y (P = 0.59) from that by age 25y (P = 0.43), that is P = 0.19, then to multiply this by the number of patients, 27, such that 0.19*27 = 4.3 (4 and 3tenths) thromboembolic events would have been expected had the grou p been untreated, during the period of treatment. This is obviously in great disagreement with their claim here of 30 thromboembolic events being expected given no treatment, and far from ss being P<.01 as claimed, in fact the difference would be nss. Furthermore, as analogously noted in my analysis of their earlier (1998) work, using the data from Mudd et al (1985), there would have been expected to have been approx 0.43*27 = 11.6 first thromboembolic events in the period preceeding diagnosis, and in fact there were only 8 such, which raises the question of whether these Dutch CBS -- might be less severe than those of Mudd et al, or alternatively whether some other Dutch factor (environment/genetic) is more protective than that of Mudd et al, but the differe nce would probably not be ss, on the basis of low n alone - in any case the ramification for adjustment of their thromboembolic ss to less ss. Of the 8 cases presenting with a thromboembolic event, only 2 (25%) also had arteriosclerosis on presentation, and there were 7 (24%) presentations with arteriosclerosis out of the 29 in the whole group. tHcy 30uM 67uM P<.01 See column 2 to left, above Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 128 Cystathionine Beta Synthase Severe Homozygous (or compound heterozygous) Mutations Authors, Journal, Site Study Group Disease Hcy level Treatmnt and biochem etc contexts Peter - schmitt MJ et al (1999); NEJM; New England Newborn Screening Program, Boston, USA USA newborn screening \"For the first 23.5years of the review period, the blood methionine cutoff v alue was 2mg/dl (134uM).

A missense mutation in coagulation factor V (Factor V Leiden, FVL) accounts for 95% of cases with activated Protein C resistance (cites Bertina et al 1994 and Dahlback 1995). This single point mutation in the gene coding for Factor V (G1691A) predicts the synthesis of the FVL molecule, where glutamine has been substituted for arginine at position 506 (Arg506Gln). This renders the molecule resistant to inactivation by activated Protein C which r esults in a hypercoagulable state conferring a lifelong increased risk of thrombosis. The allelic frequency of FVL in Europe is about 4.4% with the highest frequency found in Greeks at 7%.

Secondly, the method of calculation of the number of events expected in the treatment period had treatment not been applied is by no means made clear. Taking the average age of 27.8years, minus the total treatment time divide d by n (1314/84 = 15.6years) one derives that on average treatment commenced at age 27.8y - 15.6y = 12.2y. Going to the thromboembolic event time -curve of Mudd et al (1985) it can be seen that for an average individual of this group, the probability of hav ing a thromboembolic event was 0.47 (by age 27.8y) - 0.12 (by age 12.2y) = 0.35. And, 0.35*84 = 29.4 thromboembolic events expected during the treatment period had treatment not been applied. By coincidence the risk ratio would be somewhat similar to the o ne given. More to the point however, is that the treatments applied by these three different groups of practitioners are quite different, in particular the Irish compared to the other two, and analysis would more profitably had compared on this basis, and sought biochemical theorietical basis for the differences amongst them, rather than proceeding as they have done.

The results clearly demonstrate that CBS -- patients develop elevations of these metabolites once a threshold of 350uM for the concurrent plasma methionine concentration is exceeded. The absence of elevated methionine transamination products pr eviously reported amongst 16 CBS \u2014VitB6 -responsive patients may now be attributed to the fact that in those patients the plasma methionine concentrations were below this threshold. The observed elevations of transamination products were similar to those obs erved among patients with isolated hypermethioninemia. Plasma Hcy did not exert a consistent effect on thransamination metabolites, and betaine appeared to effect transamination chiefly by its tendency to elevate methionine.\" To describe the scatterplots, firstly the results for those on betaine treatment not have been differentiable from those not. For plasma the upper level of the reference range is given as 0.5uM - once the plasma methionine levels come above approx 350uM the transamination products are fairly widely scattered but increasing with the methionine - up to methionine 600uM, mostly 1 to 2uM - from methionine 600 - 15000uM, plenty of values all the way from 2 to 20uM. For urine the scatterplot is entirely in agreement with that for the plasma, in its proportions with regard to the reference range. It seems unlikely that sulfate production dimished in CBS -- is fully restored by methionine metabolism through transamination.

DV) observational study to assess the effectiveness of long -term Hcy -lowering treatment in reducing vascular risk in 158 patients. Vascular out comes were analysed and effectiveness of treatment in reducing vascular risk was evaluated by comparison of actual to predicted number of vascular events, with the use of historical controls from a landmark study (Mudd et al 1985. DV) of 629 untreated pati ents with CBS --. The 158 patients had a mean (range) age of 29.4 (4.5 to 70) years; 57 (36%) were more than 30years old, and 10 (6%) were older than 50years. There were 2822 patient -years of treatment, with an average of 17.9years per patient. Plasma Hc y levels were markedly reduced from pre -treatment levels but usually remained moderately elevated. There were 17 vascular events in 12 patients at a mean (range) age of 42.5 (18 to 67) years: pulmonary embolism (n = 3), myocardial infarction (n = 2), deep venous thrombosis (n = 5), cerebrovascular accident (n = 3), transient ischemic attack (n = 1), sagittal sinus thrombosis (n = 1), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (n = 2). Without treatment, 112 vascular events would have been expected, for a relative risk of .09 (95%CI .036 to 0.228; P<.0001).\" Now, firstly, it was not proper to aggregate thromboembolic events in with aneurysms, as they may well have differing etiologies, and also as diagnosis is not assured. Secondly, the method of calculation of the numb er of events expected in the treatment period had treatment not been applied is by no means made clear. Taking the average age of 29.4years, minus the total treatment time divided by n (2822/158 = 17.9years) one derives that on average treatment commenced at age 29.4y - 17.9y = 11.5y. Going to the thromboembolic event time -curve of Mudd et al (1985) it can be seen that for an average individual of this group, the probability of having a thromboembolic event was 0.52 (by age 29.4y) - 0.10 (by age 11.5y) = 0. 42. And, 0.42*158 = 66.4 thromboembolic events expected during the treatment period had treatment not been applied. Taking away the 2 abdominal aortic aneurysms to leave 15 vascular events instead of the 17 noted, the relative risk would in fact be closer to 0.2 than the .09 claimed. More to the point however, is that the treatments applied by these different groups of practitioners are quite different, in particular the Irish compared to the Dutch and the Australian (see Yap et al 2000 above) other two, an d, one needs to know the amino acid supplementation used by the two UK groups - given their average age of treatment commencement it is probable that they do not achieve (if they even attempt it...) compliance in this respect the equal of the Irish group.

DV) using age -appropriate psychometric tests and were compared to those of 10 unaffected siblings (controls). Of the 23 individuals, 19 were diagnosed through newborn screening with early treatment, 2 were late -detected and 2 were untreated at the time of assessment. 13 of the newborn, screened group who were compliant with treatment had no complications, while the remaini ng 6, who had poor compliance, developed complications. Good compliance was defined by a lifetime plasma free homocystine median <11uM (equivalent to tHcy < 110uM. DV). The newborn screened, good compliance group (n = 13) with a mean age of 14.4years (ra nge 4.4 -24.9) had a mean full -scale IQ (FIQ) of 105.8 (range 84 -120), while the poorly -compliant group (n = 6) with a mean age of 19.9years (range 13.8 -25.5) had a mean FIQ of 80.8 (range 40 -103). The control group (n = 10) with mean age of 19.4years (ra nge 9.7 -32.9) had a mean FIQ of 102 (range 76 -116). The 2 late -detected (at ages 2.4, 2.9years) patients aged 22.4 and 11.7years had FIQ of 80 and 102, while the 2 untreated patients aged 22.4 and 11.7years had FIQ of 52 and 53, respectively. There was no statistical evidence of significant differences between the compliant, early -treated individuals and their unaffected siblings (controls) except for the FIQ, which was significantly higher than that of the unaffected siblings (P = .040).\" \"Statistical analysis: .....In 1 family of 3 children, 2 of whom were compliant patients, the same unaffected sibling was used as the control. There were 8 newborn -screened compliant patient -unaffected sibling control pairs used in the analysis. The remaining 2 were poor ly compliant newborn -screened -unaffected sibling pairs.\" Note: The comparison should also have compared only between the 8 newborn -screened compliant patient - unaffected sibling control pairs, excluding those 2 poorly -compliant sibling pairs. The first sen tence above is incorrectly worded in any case. In any case there is the possibility of confounding through parents and teachers being not blinded to the child's CBS condition and reacting to this with different volume/quality of teaching/other social fact ors. Also, tests of ss should have been done on various other pairs of groups, ie the 13 good -compliance with the 6 poorly -compliant, and reported. \"Treatment regimens: All patients diagnosed with CBS -- were commenced on oral pyridoxine while on a norma l diet, to ascertain their clinical responsiveness to pyridoxine. Once pyridoxinje -nonresponsiveness was confirmed, as indicated by a persistently high or rising plasma methionine and free homocystine, the patient was commenced on dietary management of met hionine restriction and a methionine -free cystine -supplemented synthetic amino acid mixture. Plasma VitB12 and folate were assayed and if these were found deficient the patient was given supplements. Betaine, a remethylating agent, was used in the last 5y ears as an adjunct to treatment only in those patients (late adolescent/young adults) who became poorly compliant to dietary management (Yap and Naughten 1998). In the late -detected This regimen of betaine and cofactors did not seem to lower the free homocystine and methionine concentrations (this would be very unexpected regards the homocystine - perhaps they meant \"sufficiently\" DV) in o ur patients and the addition of dietary methionine restriction with supplementary methionine -free amino acid mix was necessary to obtain biochemical control.\" Kalkanoglu HS et al (2001); J Inherit Metab Hacettepe U, Ankara, Turkey. 6 CBS -- \"Summary:. ..

Off pharmacological treatment, the biochemical phenotype was characterized by accumulation of tHcy ( median 135uM) and blood S - adenosylHcy (median 246nM), and by normal levels of guanidinoacetate and creatine. In addition, enhanced remethylation was demonstrated by low serine level (median 81uM), and by increased concentration of methionine (median 76uM) and N - methylglycine (median 6.8uM). Despite the substantially blocked transulfuration, which was evidenced by undetectable cystathionine and severely decreased cysteine levels (median 102uM), blood glutathione was surprisingly not depleted (median 1155uM) .

The plasma methionine concentration was 203uM (normal 10 -54uM) with a no rmal VitB12 level and a normal urinary organic acid profile. CBS activity in fibroblasts was undetectable, with no change after the addition of pyridoxal - phosphate or SAM. Clinically, there was only a partial response to pyridoxine (500mg/day) and folic acid (5mg/day) with tHcy of 253 -340uM.

At the 10th week of gestation, ultrasound showed a minimal detachment area, and rest was prescribed, without further events. Pyridoxine treatment was reduced to 300mg/day and acetylsalicylic acid (100mg/day) was added, while cystine an d betaine treatments were maintained at the same doses. Increased ingestion of milk derivatives to prevent osteopenia resulted in raised tHcy (100uM) and Met (75uM) levels, which suggested the need to start a Met -restricted diet (XMET Maxamaid, 75mg/day) at the 29th week of gestation. This resulted in a marked decrease in tHcy (10uM) and Met (27uM) levels.

Recent studies provide evidence that H 2S is a gaseous neuromodulator and smooth muscle relaxant and that H 2S is produced by CBS (cites Kimura 2002). Although the author suggests that H2S is produced by a beta-elimination reaction with L -cysteine, H 2S may be a product of the beta-replacement reaction of L -cysteine with another thiol (cites Maclean and Kraus 2004). CBS will also very efficiently catalyze the formation of L -cysteine from L -serine and H 2S. This serine sulfhydrylase reaction may be an alternative method of cysteine synthesis and H 2S detoxification...... Regulation of Cystathionine Beta -Synthase. The human CBS gene is transcriptionally regulated by two promoter regions designated -1a and - 1b. Th e major promoter ( -1b) is serum and fibroblast growth factor -responsive and is down - regulated by insulin, growth arrest due to contact inhibition, nutrient depletion, or the induction of differentiation (cites Maclean et al 2002). The CBS -1b promoter is r egulated in a redox - sensitive fashion by synergistic interactions Sp1 -Y and Sp1 and Sp3. Sp1 and Sp3 are the specificity factors 1 and 3, respectively, whereas NF -Y is the nuclear factor Y, a histone -like CCAAT -binding trimer. The dominant a Sp1 in regulating both GC -rich CBS promotors may allow tissue -specific repression by -like factors. S1 - like proteins and Kruppel -like factors are highly related redox -sensitive zinc -finger proteins that are important compone nts of the eukaryotic cellular transcriptional machinery. In contrast to the relatively slow transcriptional response, AdoMet can instantaneously activate human CBS. Proteolytic removal of the C -terminal region also activates human CBS; the extent of the activation is similar to that observed with AdoMet..... AdoMet does not activate the yeast enzyme..... The role of heme in human CBS is still not clear. Heme is not essential for catalysis because it is absent in yeast CBS and T.cruzi CBS and because heme -free human CBS has activity. Human CBS may be regulated by the redox state of the heme.

Her family noticed a forward -bent spine when she was 2years old. She was diagnosed with homocystinuria at trhe age of 9years following the development of a cataract in the right eye. When she was 14, she developed involuntary tremor -like movementsand twisting contractions appearing first on the right foot and later on the left, which in time spread to the upper extremities. Since that time, axial dystonia has been gradually developing leading by age 20 to scoliosis with deviation of the body and neck to the right side. Later her hair became light -clored and she had a major depressive illness that responded well to treatment. In the late of her 20s she finally became wheelchair -bound and mostly dependent on others in her activities of daily living as a result of generalized dystonia.... Neurological examination of the patient at age 34 showed moderate mental retardation. Generalized dystonia was prominent on the right side leading to the right late ro- and retrocollis, extensor posture in the rigtht leg and plantar flexion posture of the feet associated with a high amplitude dystonic tremor at the limbs as well as the head and trunk, causing twisting movement to the right and back of her body, worse with action. The physical examination revealed grey hair, bilateral pes cavus and equinovarus deformities and kyphoscoliosis. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed amaurosis in the right eye with corneal calcification and shrinkage of the iris and -10 di optri myopia on the left eye. At the age of 38, the clinical picture became worse with gait and stance problems due to extensor right leg, inversion posturing of the right foot and plantar flexion of the feet and toes. Her speech became incomprehensible because of dystonic contractions of the maseter and laryngeal muscles. Achilles clonus in the right foot was present, but neurological examination was otherwise normal. Lab investigations of blood and urine, including the serum levels of copper and cer uloplasmin, VitB12, folate as well as 24hour urinary copper, the panel of liver and renal function tests were all normal except to an increased level of Hcy (I think they meant Hcy(ine), considering their normal value, and everything else....DV) in the urine at 85uM (Normal 0uM).

The patient underwent an operative thrombectomy and a s aphenous vein bypass from his right superficial femoral artery to his peroneal artery. However, occlusion of the graft and occlusion of the distal right superficial femoral artery occurred in the ensuing 4months and required repeat thrombolysis attempts, operative thrombectomy, and a new operative bypass from the proximal superficial femoral artery to the posterior tibial artery with the use of a CryoVein because his native saphenous vein had already been used.

The principal lesson.is that interventional radiologists and surgeons may be called on to treat young patients with ischemic disease secondary to homocystinuria before the diagnosis has been made. The diagnosis may not even be c onsidered because typical phenotypic features are absent.

We limited our investigation to 6 CBS mutations previously found in Norwegians, but there are numerous other CBS mutations associated with homocystin uria. Thus our estimate is probably too low..... However, we do not know whether CBS mutations in the mother or fetus cause reduced reproductive fitness. This could lead to a lower prevalence of live -born babies with CBS --. Hence the the H -W equilibrium may not exist. Another factor is clinical penetrance, that is, whether homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for any pair of these mutations will lead to a clinically evident homocystinuria (means other CBS -- stigmata? DV). We found that 90% of the mutated alleles in newborn infants are associated with a pyridoxine responsive phenotype. This proportion differs markedly from the widespread experience that only ~50% of patients respond to pyridoxine. Pyridoxine -responsiveness is usually associated with a le ss severe clinical disease. The discrepancy between the genetic findings in newborn blood samples and that observed in patients could suggest that many CBS -- have a pyridoxine -responsive variant with mild or no symptoms. Another possibility is that diagn osis is frequently missed because the medical community is not fully aware of this disorder and its clinical manifestations. Our findings indicate that novel high throughput techniques for mutation detection may be a useful procedure to identify babies wit h mutations causing both mild and severe variants of CBS --. However this approach will miss cases caused by unknown or rare CBS mutations and may include those with a genetic defect but normal biochemical and clinical phenotype.

DV), cysteine (Cys) is oxidized into its cystine disulfide protein -free sulfhydryl groups, such as albumin Cys34, to form cysteinylated species of the protein. Cys34 is t he only free sulfhydryl group on albumin, which accounts for over 80% of the total free thiols in plasma (cite Carballal S 2003). In cases of ischemia, when hypoxemia and acidosis are present, the activity of CBS in the area of ischemia is decreased (cite Taoka S 1998) leading to the accumulation of Hcy. When equilibrated with the normal non -ischemic circulation during reperfusion, Hcy is metabolized by non -inhibited CBS from non -ischemic areas into Cys. Consequently, Cys id oxidized into cystine which re acts with free sulfhydryl groups on proteins.

Cartilage differentiation of CBS -- mice was delayed at 1month compared to age -matched CBS++ m ice, and hence the growth of the long bones was disturbed...... Therefore, hyperhomocystenemia due to CBS -- in mice was associated with delayed ossification rather than with failed ossification..... Growth retardation is not a characteristic of human patients wi th CBS --. Nevertheless, it has also been observed in rats fed excessive methionine or homocystine (cites Cohen et al 1958).... Some of the skeletal abnormalities, such as kyphosis and arachnodactyly observed in CBS -- mice, shared an outward resemblance to th ose observed in mice with a hypomorphic fibrillin -1 mutation, which leads to Marfan syndrome -like manifestations (cites Periera et al 1999)..... Morover, CBS is not ubiquitously expressed in in mouse tissues (cites Robert et al 2003). In the early stages of development, the gene is expressed only in liver and in the skeletal, cardiac, and nervous systems. In the skeletal system, expression can be detected at early stages in chondroblasts in areas at which bone ossification is believed to be initiated. In adul t mice, the signal for enzyme synthesis persists in the perichondrium in cartilage and in the periosteum in bone. This indicates that dietary cysteine is insufficient in some organs and there is a requirement for the local production of cysteine or its me tabolic byproducts by transsulfuration. It should be noted that MTHFR -- mice, which do not have an impaired transsulfuration pathway, are significantly lighter and develop more slowly than MTHFR++, but kyphosis is only observed occasionally (cites Chen et al 2001). Although CBS -- phenotype appears to be caused by dramatically elevated Hcy, it is possible that blocking cysteine biosynthesis could contribute to the skeletal defects observed in CBS -- mice, where the transsulfuration pathway is impaired.\" MFHEI Multifactor Health and Beta Synthase Severe Homozygous (or compound heterozygous) Mutations Authors, Journal, Site Study Group Disease Robert K et al (2005b); The Anatomical Record Part A; U Paris, INSERM, & U Necker Enfants Malades, All of Paris, France.

CBS -- causes severe hyperhomocystein emia, which confers diverse clinical manifestations, notably liver disease...... Methods. The degree of liver injury and inflammation was assessed by histologic examination, by measurements of products of lipid peroxidation, and by formation of carbonyl groups on protein as a measure for the occurrence of protein oxidation. Analysis of profibrogenic, proinflammatory factors and cell apoptosis was performed by Western blots, real-time quantitative PCR, activity, DNA laddering, and TUNEL assay. Results. Histologic evaluation of liver specimens of 8 - to32-week -old CBS -- mice showed that CBS --mice develop inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatic steatosis, concomitant with an enhanced expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase -1, alpha -smooth muscle ac tin, pro(alpha)1 collagen type 1, transforming growth factor -beta1, and proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, even if the proapoptotic protein Bax was dominantly expressed and Bcl -2 was down -regulated, caspase -3 was not activated, DNA laddering was not dete cted, and number of positive TUNEL cells was not increased in liver of CBS -- mice compared with CBS++ mice. Conclusions. The results show that hyperhomocysteinemia in liver of CBS -- mice promotes oxidative stress, which may cause mitochondrial damage in as sociation with activation of hepatic stellate cells, leading to liver injury. The absence of caspase -3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and TUNEL -positive cells shows that protective signals may counteract apoptotic signals in liver of CBS --mice..... .....Densi tometric analysis of immunoblots demonstrated an approximate increase of 30% in oxidatively mocified proteins (P<.01; n = 4 in each group).....

Choumenkovitch et al (2002) have shown an increase in SAH levels, a powerful inhibitor of of SAM -dependent transmethylation reactions, associated with lower genomicDNA methylation status in liver of CBS -- mice.... CBS -+ mice fed a hyperhomocysteinemic diet have increased hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels through increased hepatic expression of genes involved in cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis, uptake, and storage, which results in hepatic steato sis (cites Werstuck et al 2001).\" Beta Synthase Severe Homozygous (or compound heterozygous) Mutations Authors, Journal, Site Study Group Disease Riksen N et al (2005); Arterioscler Thromb Centre this hypothesis, a Hcy -induced fall in extracellular adenosine contributes to the cardiovascular sequelae of hyperhomocystenemia. Fundamental to this is the reversibility of the reaction in which SAH is hydrolysed to Hcy and A do. Although the equilibrium constant of this reaction favors SAH synthesis, under physiological conditions SAH is hydrolysed to to Hcy and Ado, because both reaction products are rapidly metabolized. In hyperhomocysteinemia, the reaction shifts towards SA H synthesis at the expense of free intracellular adenosine. Subsequently, facilitated diffusion of extracellular adenosine into the cells through the dipyridamole -sensitive equilibrative nucleoside transporter is enhanced, limiting stimulation of membrane -bound adenosine receptors. By stimulation of these receptors, extracellular adenosine induces several effects, which could protect against the development of atherosclerosis and thrombosis and against ischemia -reperfusion injury (cites Riksen et al 2003, R ongen et al 1997). Particularly in situations of hypoxia or ischemia, when the concentration of adenosine increases rapidly, these effects (not noted DV) work in concert to protect the affected tissue.....

Additionally, in isolated erythrocytes, adenosine uptake (from 1uM solution) was accelerated by (100uM, Conclusions. In hyperhomocysteinemia, adenosine -induced vasodilation is restored by dipyridamole. Accelerated ce llular adenosine uptake probably accounts for these observations.

All those contacted were approached via an email including the following: \"The book has significant differences from your own work and that of others' in the field, though is muchly informed by that - accordingly a condition I will stric tly adhere to is that your commentary would be reproduced in the final published form, in a section on peer review commentary, in the book exactly as you provide it, verbatim and in full, no matter how negative your comments - however, prior to the publica tion I have the right of reply (within 1 week), and then you and the others have the right of reply (within 1 week) to my replies, and so on until we have nothing new to contribute to the discussion - at whatever point you finalise your commentary and subs equent replies absolutely everything you have contributed would be included in the published book exactly as you provide it.\" The following workers in the field of CBS -deficiency Homocystinuria , contacted by email , represent the large majority of more pro minent treatment centres worldwide : Professor Harvey S Mudd , Scientist Emeritus at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, the USA, and author of the relevant chapter in the most authoritative The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (Scrivner CR, Beaudet AL, Sly WA, et al, eds). Prof Mudd contributed the reviewing and suggestions reproduced verbatim below. Professor Sufin Yap , a clinician , researcher and teacher of many years, at various times bei ng a Consultant Paediatrician in Metabolic Medicine at Sheffield Children's Hospital, and similarly involved at the National Center for Inherited Metabolic Disorders, and the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders , mostly in Dublin of Ireland, The UK. Prof. Yap was unable to review this book, but provided information as acknowledged in citation. Professor Bridgett Wilcken , a clinician, researcher and teacher of many years, in paediatric and metabolic diseases, of the Children's Hospital Westmead, The University of Sydney, Australia. Prof. Wilcken was initially approached around 2010 with a view to co -authorship of a paper I was attempting to get published in scientific journals, the paper being around the statistical and other re - analyses of the data a nd analyses of the Yap ( 2001 ) paper (of which she was a co -author) much as appears here in chapter 3. At that time she responded with a disputing of my analyses , to which I responded, inviting her further response on more than one occasion, which she decli ned to make. On deciding to publish as a book instead of in journal articles, in 2013 I notified her that I would be including our earlier dialogue on the matter in this book, as that matter was included much in its entirety in this book, and offered her t he opportunity to provide me with a replacement reviewing of the whole book in its present form. On receiving as yet no response I proceed to reproduce the dialogue of 2010 verbatim below. Professor G H Boers , Professor FJ Trijbels, Professor HJ Blom, and Dr. LA Kluijtmans , all of The Netherlands, I tried (after much failure elsewhere) to acquire the email contacts for from Prof Ko zich of Czechoslovakia, but he informed me that Profs. Boers and Trijbels had retired quite some time ago, and that Prof. Blom and Dr. Kluijtmans are biochemists/ molecular geneticists, not clinicians, so I ceased MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 164 attempts to contact them, though I would welcome any feedback they would care to make and include it in the book soon after receipt. Professor Vi ktor Kozich and colleag ues, of Czechoslavakia were requested to review or comment, but other than a congratulation (probably merely routine politeness) from Prof. Kozich I have received nothing in response. In Sweden, Associate Professor Olov Ekwall, Specialist Physician Annika Queen Hospital, Gothenburg ; and Associate Professor Anna Nordenstr\u00f6m, Physician Rolf Zetterstr\u00f6m, and Dietician and Associate Professor Ulrika von D\u00f6beln, of the Centre for Inherited Metabolic Diseases (CMMS), Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Stockholm , were all invited to contribute review or comments, but none have yet been recieved . Response from Professor Harvey Mudd : Thanks very much for your response Prof. Mudd. I agree with virtually every change you suggested, and will carry them out as detailed here below. I respond in detail to your comments one by one as you provided them, below. What appears below will be reproduced exactly verbatim in the last section/ chapter of the book, so there should be no chance of the level of your involvement being misrepresented. Any further commentary would be very welcome, and as I am self -publ ishing via Amazon's CreateSpace (Print on Demand), even if you comment after the initial publication, which is unlikely to be sooner than two weeks from now, I will be able to modify the book as printable in the future. Of course the earlier I can include the expert review / commentary in books printed or downloaded the better. Thanks again, David Vance From: muddh@mail.nih.gov 2013 22:49:36 +0000 HM: I am writin g hurriedly. Chiefly to respond to your request that I acknowledge receipt of your book - which I did receive. Clearly you have done a great deal of work and analysis - too much for me to go over in any detail in the few moments I have had available that were not distracted by other events. I offer here a few relatively minor suggestions for changes that occurred to me as I no more than skimmed your draft: HM: p.8 , line 4: Mention might be made of disorders of homocysteine remethylation in addition to M THFR deficiency that are not covered: cblC disorder (probably currently the most frequently detected cause of elevated tHcy when screened for), cblD, cblE and cblG disorders. (DV: Yes, I will make this addition) MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 165 HM: p. 9, text line 2 Eithe r replace \"homocystinurics\" with \"CBS -deficient individuals\" or explain that the word \"homocystinuric\" is used with a restricted meaning. (DV: OK, I will change \"homocystinurics due to cystathionine beta deficiency\" to \"cystathionine beta synthas e deficient homocystinurics\") HM: p. 19, first line of 3.3 and many other places: In most instances what is being discussed when you say \"homozygous CBS -deficiency\" is in reality either homozygous or compound heterozygous -CBS deficiency. Probably most of the headlines on p. 55 -157 have similar mis -terminologies (although there may be a few papers where only homozygotes are discussed). (DV: Yes, I will change to \"homozygous or compound heterozygous CBS deficiency\") HM: p. 29, middle paragraph: I may h ave missed, but it would be a convenience for the reader if, when you first discuss \"homocysteine\" levels, you specify the difference between homocysteine and total Hcy (tHcy) and, perhaps, present examples of how to covert relevant values to tHcy. (DV: Ye s, I will Hcy bound to plasma proteins + free homocysteine)\" At the bottom of Table 1 I have already detailed the algorithms I used to convert other Hcy value s to tHcy) HM: p. 55 -157: For the many instances when you talk about \"homocytinuria\", explain what is actually found in urine in the way of homocysteine derivatives, and explain how you converted to tHcy (although that may or may not be appropriate in th is situation, given that there is probably little or no free homocysteine in urine). (DV: Yes, on these pages I will change the line above the tables to \"Cystathionine beta Synthase deficiency by severe homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations\" Yes, I will reproduce the Bonham (1987) and Wiley (1989) algorithms on p27 at the bottom of Table 1, to also appear under the section heading on p 54) HM: More importantly, I do agree with the need to recalculate treatment outcomes in the studies such as those in the Yap et al paper. However, I have not had time to go over the details you present on this matter. Again, I may have missed it, but another concern I have is that the time -to-event curves for B6 -responders presented by Mudd et al 1985 may have been severely affected by ascertainment bias (you must have seen the paper by Skovby et al (Mol. Genet. Metb 101, 172 -177, 2010). If the tentative conclusion in that paper holds up, the risk MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 166 for untreated B6 -responders in Mudd et al 1985 probably was severely overestimated. You may choose to at least mention this possibility. (DV: I agree, and I did address this on p 24 -25 where I noted that the relative risk of .09 given by Yap et al. was actually closer to 0.2 when determined using only the actual portions of your (1985) survival curves that are applicable to the cases, this being a two -fold exaggeration of efficacy, and that consideration of the ascertainment bias you note would indicate probably nearly a three -fold exaggeration of the real efficacy in total.) HM: Hope this helps. Use it as you wish, but please do not quote me in a way that suggests I have gone over your draft in detail. I may or may not find time to read more carefully those portions on which I might have further comments (e.g. chapter 3), but my schedule is too crowded to offer even a vague deadline to try to do so. (DV: Thank you very much Prof. Mudd, as noted from the outset there should be virtually no chance of such misrepresentation because all of your comments here, and my respons es to them, will be reproduced verbatim in their entirety in the last section/ chapter of the published book. Any further commentary would be very welcome, and as I am self -publishing via Amazon's CreateSpace (Print on Demand), even if you comment after th e initial publication, which is unlikely to be sooner than two weeks from now, I will be able to modify the book as printable in the future.) Harvey Mudd Response from Professor Bridget Wilcken : BW: Dear David, I have just been re -reading your pap er. While I think there are excellent points, there are also aspects that you haven't taken into account. Firstly, it is evident that the treatments, various, do result in benefit with regards to occurrence thrombo -embolism (and maybe that should in fact be vascular disease in general), (DV: Yes, but unfortunately, as I noted in my work under discussion here, and as you have not noted in your comments here, the thrombo -embolism is very likely to still be substantially above the level of the general popu lation (except in the Dublin cases where there isn't any at all.....), and therefore it is desirable to reduce it still further if possible, for example by some sensible, safe, cost -effective method(s), perhaps such as I have suggested.....) MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 167 BW: and that we do not really know what aspects of the treatments are the most important. (DV: Indeed \"we do not know what aspects of the treatments are most important\" - that is why I carried out my study under discussion here - to further elucidate what aspects of trea tment may be not necessarily most important (which is not quite the point) but be important enough to be done (which is more the point).) BW: It is clear that the treatments used all resulted in lowering of homocysteine levels, but that the great majorit y of patients continued to have very significant elevations. (DV: And therefore will have very significant decreases in cysteine, unless receiving it in supplements, particularly if they are receiving folate and/or vitaminB12 and/or betaine (which they a re....) as explained again here below in response to your response here.) BW: However, it is not at all reasonable to compare Dublin (and maybe Manchester also) with the other centres, as almost all the patients from Dublin and most from Manchester were dia gnosed by screening (newborn or family studies) and started on treatment in the first few months. Thus the homocysteine levels that group obtained would ha ve been extremely well -controlled in childhood. (DV: Ill begin here by agreeing with you that I havent dealt sufficiently with the differences between Dublin (and less so Manchester) and the other centers regards the former centers' patients being on t reatment in early childhood whereas the latter centers' patients were not. I fully acknowledge this oversight. And I have now included the following points in the discussion in my work under discussion here. However, comparing the centers with each other is quite reasonable if it is done reasonably, adjusting properly for relevant factors where known and possible, and properly noting the caveats including known factors not adjustable for or adjusted for, and mentioning as far as possible the possibility an d probability of factors that might be unknown. Firstly, the homocysteine levels of the Dublin cases are nonetheless in the middle of the range of the five centers (tHcy approximately 110 micromoles per liter versus approximately 80 -130), though it might well be the case that the B6 -non-responsive cases in the other centers have higher tHcy, and the B6 -responsive cases lower tHcy, than the combined averages given. Now, if early treatment confers some advantage other than later adherence to homocysteine - lowering treatment, it is very likely to be due to differences in the bodys more permanent structures, rather than to differences in less permanent things like platelets and biochemicals in solution. For example the protein fiber scaffolding of tissues in cluding the walls of arteries and veins, in particular the protein fibrillin with its unusually high cysteine content and cysteine -cysteine double bonds. Furthermore, the Irish (Dublin) cases are nearly all of the more severe vitamin B6 -unresponsive type whereas all the other centers are much closer (roughly 1:1 to 1:2) to being evenly comprised of B6 -unresponsive and B6-responsive (which fact I neglected to point out in discussion (although the facts are clear in the table), and thank you for inadvertentl y causing to me to have to look again to respond to your comments, and I have now added that point to the discussion). Such cases would nearly all be detected clinically within the first five years of life. It is possible that clinical detection would dri ve a higher compliance with treatment, due to non -trivial disease manifestations being already experienced by the patient or members of their family, whereas this is less so for those ascertained via family studies, and even less so for those ascertained b y population screening. Compliance is of course a function of the experienced burden of the treatment, which might be reasonably said to be greater insofar as it included the unpalatable cysteine supplementation (though this should be MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 168 able to be given as a single amino acid in a capsule(s) rather than as a more voluminous mixture of amino acids, relying on food for the other amino acids). However compliance is also a function of patient -doctor contact type and frequency. It should be borne in mind that Du blin has absolutely no events of thrombosis, as yet. Note that there is no ascertainment bias unreasonably against the other four centers in comparison, because the Dublin cases are absolutely more severe - if anything the ascertainment bias would be unre asonably in favour of the other four centers in comparison, even if this is in the reverse direction to most ascertainment bias noted in the field of epidemiology. The point is that when, as my numerical data analysis does, the case severity is adjusted f or, which is a substantial improvement over all prior such studies (which you do not acknowledge and seem not to understand), Dublin does better. I do not claim that this proves that Dublins treatment practice is better, I claim only that it suggests it. And consideration also of other facts as provided in my work under discussion here provides a reasonable theoretical support for cysteine supplementation being important.) BW: From my long experience of treating large numbers of phenylketonuria subjects , who also need a low - protein diet with a (different) amino acid supplement, I can say that it is usually not possible to get them to comply fully unless treatment is started in infancy. The taste of the supplement is simply not acceptable to many unless t hey have become accustomed in infancy. (DV: I am well aware of the taste factor, and thought that this was sufficiently well implied to the expected readership when I raised compliance with treatment as an issue, and explicitly suggested that compliance will be better when treatment is implemented early and doctor -patient contact type and schedule is optimized. However, again, it seems to me that cysteine supplementation should be able to be given as a single amino acid in a capsule(s) rather than as a m ore voluminous mixture of amino acids, relying on food for the other amino acids, sufficiently increased compliance being the justification.) BW: I don't think therefore that it is valid to make a sudden, evidence -free leap, and say that cysteine supplem entation is likely to be a major factor in better results. It could be so and it seems quite reasonable that more cysteine could be needed, but the better results obtained by Dublin are not sound evidence for this. They are much more likely to be due to ea rlier treatment (DV: My suggestion is not a \"leap\", and it is most certainly not \"evidence -free\". More the point, you are one of the experts that have unfortunately overlooked the significance of low cysteine as the other half (versus high homocysteine) of one of the main, if not the main problem(s). Note that the area of structural tissue involved in the ectopia lensis (eye lense displacement) of CBS -- homocystinuria has a very high (almost singularly so, compared to other body proteins) content of cys teine in its proteins, and cysteine -cysteine double bonds in its structure. To copy verbatim from my work being discussed here by way of citing references contributing evidence \"In accord with the enzyme defect in CBS it has been shown that requirement for cysteine is increased in CBS --: Perry et al (1968), Komrower et al (1966), Perry et al (1966), Brenton et al (1966), Laster et al (1965). ...... ....... ......... Majors and Pyeritz (2000) report their investigations following on speculation by themselves and others th at in CBS -- the altered plasma concentrations of homocysteine and/or cysteine may hinder the synthesis, deposition, or both, of fibrillin -1. They report that when arterial smooth muscle cells were cultured under conditions of cysteine deficiency fibrillin -1 deposition into the extracellular matrix was greatly diminished (and restored with addition of MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 169 cysteine), but that excessive homocysteine in contrast had little if any effect on fibrillin -1 deposition. Furthermore, in the reference book Homocysteine in Health and Disease (Carmel and Jacobsen, editors (2001) p238) Kraus and Victor cite Mudd and Levy (1978) in the universally accepted as authoritative The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease to the effect that \"Dietary manipulation of methionine and cystei ne intake is an option for treating patients who are partially or fully nonresponsive to vitamin B6. ....... For patients with no residual CBS activity, cysteine must be provided........\" Now, if treatment of CBS homocystinuria (in particular, but not only, the p artially vitaminB6 -responsive cases with vitamin B12 and/or folate and/or betaine causes a further reduction of flow of homocysteine through the transulfuration pathway and therefore further reduction of cysteine production, because the homocysteine escape s through the remethylation pathway instead, considered with all the evidence available, including but not limited to my data analysis (which you have not well if at all understood) in the work under discussion here, it is hardly a \"leap\" to suggest that f ailure to provide or take supplemental cysteine is likely to cause problems in later life. I acknowledge that you have other types of cases than CBS homocystinuria to deal with, whereas I have made the time to specialize in studying homocysteine for a few years, but I suggest that you, and more the point your patients, would benefit from yourself studying the situation further, regards aspects that I have raised, and changing your practice accordingly, unpalatable as that may be coming from someone outside your network. Furthermore, your statement \"They are much more likely to be due to earlier treatment\" is much more of an \"evidence -free leap\" than my suggestions, offering as it does no supporting evidence, and certainly my extensive reviewing of the liter ature (see also the 100 -page tabulation of extracted data and word descriptions in the file on the Multifactor Health website {here above, now} ) has not revealed any evidence in support of that statement. More likely you resent an outsider correcting a def iciency in your practice, and respond in a way very devoid of the objectivity and logic that are at least the cornerstones, if not much more as well, of scientific rigour.) BW: Now that we are screening for homocystinuria, there is accumulating evidence a bout the value of early instigation of treatment - not that this was not extremely likely, but now there is some slowly gathering data. There is some other evidence for the value of vitamin C (Bonham et al - cant look it up at present, I fear) (DV: Other than in Pullin, Bonham and McDowell (2002) as already cited in my work being discussed here, it must be very recent, and I would be pleased to add it to the literature review if available) BW: , and most of our older patients are on this (DV: Why only the older patients?). BW: I am writing this without the benefit of referring to our combined paper, as, unkindly, I am not able to access the internet due to some server glitch. This will have changed perforce, if I can send this to you, so I may add so mething at the end. But I thought that the method of computing the expected number of thrombo -embolic events was a simple method of summing the numerical risk for each patient derived from the Mudd graph. Then it is not necessary to know the average age at treatment. Eg, from Mudd's graph one can see that the risk for patient \"A\" aged 20 years and B6 non -responsive, if untreated would be about 0.26 (I cant see the graph very clearly), for patient \"B\" B6 responsive and aged 32 would be about 0.51, for patien t \"C\" B -6 non -responsive and aged 6y would be c. 0.04, and so forth. (DV: No, one may not reasonably claim a treatment success for time periods that one has not been applying MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 170 the treatment - this had the effect in the Yap et al (2001) paper of inflating the actual treatment success from a risk rate of approximately 0.2 (by my calculations using only the (average) periods the patient groups were actually treated for) to one of .09, which I noted in my work (also noting that I would not belabor the point, a s I was then inclined to be a little less combative than I presently am inclined) which is not a trivial difference (It is a claim to have been approximately twice as successful as one could reasonably claim, and probably closer to three times as successfu l as one could reasonably claim, for four non -Dublin groups, considering the ascertainment bias towards more severe cases of the vitaminB6 -responsive cases in the Mudd (1985) study used for comparison to derive the risk ratio in Yap et al (2001) ). Indeed , had I had the individual data, I would have used them instead of the averages, but the small gain in precision thereby achieved would not much change the outcome of my numerical analysis, and it certainly would not negate the fact of my analysis being fa r more reasonable than that of Yap et al (2001) due to my use of the appropriate time period (the period during which treatment actually occurred). Furthermore, Yap et al (2001) did not at all sufficiently detail their numerical analysis methods, leaving it to readers to have to trial various possible methods in order to determine what they had in fact done - doubtless very few readers if any other than myself actually did so, although some may well have realized what shortcomings the lack of given detail could imply.) BW: Unfortunately I found your statistical analysis difficult to follow, but I am not expert in that area. However, I'm not sure it was necessary in the first place. (DV: The statistical analysis is indeed more difficult to follow than mu ch of what appears in the literature. I also would not call myself an expert statistician, or even rank myself with the very competent. I am, however, better qualified and more competent as an epidemiologist than the average medical doctor, and also than the average journal article author with a medical degree, judging from the shortcomings and mistakes that I repeatedly or very often find in the hundreds of journal articles that I review. I hope you will understand, with further consideration, the appropri ateness of my statistical analysis here. If not, there are various courses that you can take to improve competence in that field, should your time commitments permit and you incline to.) BW: From a publication point of view your paper would need very sub stantial revision. It is much too long for most journals, and I would advise aiming for a text of c. 3,000 words, certainly less than 4,000 (DV: To revise it back to this length would remove so much material as to reduce the quality of the work unaccepta bly, which should be somewhat obvious - if it is too long for a standard journal article, then so be it, for the moment.) . BW: It is also not very focused (DV: It is quite appropriately focused, on optimizing the treatment of cystathionine beta syntha se deficiency homocystinuria) . BW: I think the discussion section (which is not a discussion at all of what you have analysed) (DV: It is a discussion, including of what I have analysed, of what is potentially relevant to optimizing the treatment of c ystathionine beta synthase deficiency homocystinuria.) BW: is interesting, and it might be that your work could become publishable if it was mainly focused on this MFHEI Multifactor Health and Education Initiative http://sites.google.com/site/multifa ctorhealth 171 - a review of possible treatment modalities. Homocystinuria is relatively rare and the cli nical outcomes are very long -term (DV: Ultimately all clinical outcomes should include old age, and this is hardly unique to homocystinuria, in which outcomes addressed in formal analysis to date have only included life periods up to and including middle age, not old age, which is an explicitly stated reason for seeking to further optimize treatment.) BW: , which is why we have so little reliable information about ideal treatment aims. (One thing of note, not obviously related to thrombo -embolism, is the much better intellectual outcome with early treatment. Quite a proportion of B6 non -responsive patients clinically diagnosed have intellectual handical to some degree, whereas it seems likely from screening data that this does not occur at all with early treatment.) (DV: This has been quite well noted for many years now.) BW: I'm sorry to sound negative overall. I am not sure I can be of much more help with this, and certainly ought not to be an author.
