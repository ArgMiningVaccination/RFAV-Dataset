Vaccinate people who are at high risk. But not everyone like we're doing. 2. Provide self-assessment tools to help people identify if they are high risk. 3. Provide early treatments - purge the parasitic entities suppressing them. 4. Create a home diagnostics system to test if you're infected. About Our Guest Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of the core mRNA vaccine technologies & RNA transfection. He has done extensive research and development work in: Preclinical discovery research, Clinical trials, Gene therapy, Vaccines, Immunology, and bio-defense. Dr. Robert Malone trained at UC Davis, UC San Diego. At the Salk Institute of Molecular Biology & Virology Laboratories. He received medical training from Northwestern University (MD), Harvard Medical School (Clinical Research Post Graduate), and UC Davis (Pathology). To date, he has written close to 100 peer-reviewed publications. These have 12489 citations. 31 are h-index & 50 are i10-index [it's a big deal]. Dr. Robert Malone has been involved in developing, designing, and providing oversight to around: 40 phase-1 clinical trials, 20 phase-2 clinical trials, and 5 phase-3 clinical trials. Plus vaccine-focused clinical research organizations In most of those as medical director & medical monitor. With 20+ years of management and leadership experience in pharmaceutical, biotechnology industries, academia, government and non-government organizations. He is one of the most experienced & credible experts you can find on this subject. His prescription to end this pandemic quickly? 1. Only vaccinate the high-risk groups. Not everyone. Natural immunity is 10x better, stronger, faster, longer-lasting. So if you're not high risk, it should be a choice to not get vaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness is diminishing fast. Covid-19 is mutating way more each week than they anticipated. Vaccine-induced disease enhancement is a real thing. Mass vaccination campaigns are only encouraging this. Based on current rates of reduced vaccine effectiveness. Estimates are current vaccines will be ineffective within 6-12 months. Meaning new ones will replace them. There are legitimate risks involved from vaccination. If vaccines synthesize a misfolded protein, we wouldn't know. Misguided spike proteins CAN cause problems with Prion Diseases. Lipid-nanoparticles with mRNA can pass the blood-brain barrier. The covid vaccines went out fast. We don't have good long-term data. There HAVE been production contamination issues. [See Moderna + Japan as an example]. Alphabet agencies could do better tracking & reporting adverse events. Many things significant to an individual, don't register as clinically significant. Like a 3% drop in fitness for an NFL player]. Recently 2 top brass left the FDA. For reasons related to the third shot rollout. My questions, not his, are: Will a third shot meaningfully boost immunity? Or are they moving big pharma inventory before the new vaccines come in? #ProductLifecycles Did anyone use a fax machine lately? 8 track? CDs? Just curious. Each year some major pharmaceutical company is paying hundreds of millions in criminal and civil settlements. Often for marketing dangerous drugs or paying kickbacks to incentivize prescriptions. 2. Early Detection. Provide home test kits. Apps. Tools to help people make data-driven decisions. If they should get vaccinated or not. Some people need to be vaccinated.
