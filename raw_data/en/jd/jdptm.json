But, I am definitely seeing enough patients experience changes to their menstrual cycle after vaccination, to pay attention. In clinic I'm mostly seeing a delay in menstruation occurring (a longer cycle / later period) and/or a heavier bleed. This seems to be short-lived, lasting only a cycle. This observation, being echoed around the world, was unexpected, and therefore highlights a real gender-gap in the research about the Covid vaccines specifically, and in health-research in general. Why is it so easy for research to dismiss the menstrual cycle? Participants in Covid-19 vaccination trials weren't asked about any observed changes to their menstrual cycle, so this wasn't picked up and passed on as a potential reaction to Covid-19 vaccination. Women have therefore been caught by surprise by any menstrual irregularities occurring after vaccination. However menstrual irregularities do occur anyway, to all of us. Our body will occasionally throw out a long or short cycle, or a heavier / lighter bleed. Usually menstrual disruption will be due to stress, infection, a change in diet, weight loss or gain, and a change in exercise habits. Um...global pandemic anyone...?! And some of us will be regularly-irregular anyway, which in turn causes fluctuations in menstrual bleeding patterns. So all this makes it hard to be able to directly attribute any menstrual irregularities to Covid-19 vaccination. But...a lot of women are noticing a temporary change to their cycles. After their vaccination. The menstrual cycle is viewed as a Vital Sign - a genuine marker of a woman's broader health picture. So if menstrual irregularities are due to vaccination, it does prompt the question...why? Researchers just don't know yet. Some hypotheses are: if a woman has an underlying bleeding or clotting disorder, or has had issues with this in the past, that might predispose her to bleeding changes post-vaccine some women might have a more vascular uterine lining, predisposing her to post-vaccine bleeding changes perhaps there are as yet underlying and unknown autoimmune factors that might contribute to menstrual changes possibly an inflammatory response from the vaccine interferes with the normal inflammatory events that contribute to ovulation and menstruation potentially the immune cells that play a role in the growth and breakdown of the endometrial lining are affected by the vaccine Researcher Dr. Kathryn Clancy, who experienced menstrual changes herself after Covid-19 vaccination is conducting an online survey to further analyse these experiences. If you've had your vaccine, do consider becoming part of this body of research! - [join in here](https://redcap.healthinstitute.illinois.edu/surveys/index.php?s=LL8TKKC8DP). And if you haven't had your vaccine yet, know that you might experience a delayed period or a heavier period after your vaccination, and that this will be a short-lived change - like your sore arm or fatigue.
