After you have been rescued by allopathic measures from imminent death in an emergency situation, the healing is still up to you by seeking other modalities. And when it comes to chronic illness like cancer, arthritis, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, allopathy has no cures and usually makes matters worse. One reason medical practitioners do best in a crisis is because that is the emphasis on their training. In fact, in America 85% of medical expenditures are for emergency applications. Responding to accidents, acute life-threatening conditions, or patching up the body when seriously, advanced disease has occurred, and death may be imminent. Meanwhile, less than 6% of health care expenditures are for prevention and wellness education. True healing can only take place with the participation of the patient on all levels - mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical. The idea of \"leaving it to the doctor\" leads to unending sickness and poor health. Health care and health maintenance is something you do for yourself, with the help of God. Not something for which you pay your money and continue to do as you please without altering your lifestyle. Health care is your responsibility - not the government's, not the insurance company's, not the health care system's, and not the doctors. Can the Present Health Care System Change? In my opinion, changing the medical system toward natural and spiritual forms of healing that encourages more individual responsibility is impossible. The system can't change. It won't change. It must be replaced. There was a time for horses and buggies, but when automobiles came along, people gave up their former ways of transportation. There is also a time to repair your car and keep it, and a time to discard it for a new one. The medical profession is a sophisticated machine, but it rests on a fallacious foundation. Its philosophical basis is like a Model-T Ford stuck in the mud that can't move and won't change. The current medical system is an old car, beyond repair, and parked on a false foundation. It survives, not because it serves the good of humanity, but because it has become politically entrenched in our society. The time has come to remove its legal franchise, and replace it by allowing alternative modalities to flourish free of the shackles placed upon them by allopathy's monopolistic intent. Terry Friedmann MD, in his book, Freedom Through Health, envisions a new holistic system to replace the current one that emphasizes personal responsibility and fosters cooperative relationships among many modalities with allopathy playing only a minor role. Dr. Friedmann's new health care model would include nutrition, exercise, stress management, and aromatherapy, to address the whole person - mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. In their books, Robert Mendelsohn, MD, and Richard Gerber, MD, also foresee a new holistic medical paradigm - one that is not dependent on allopathic drugs and procedures as its primary focus. The time has come to move on to paradigms and modalities based on different premises than those that underlie modern allopathy. Those of you who have opted out of the system in favor of essential oils and their physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual benefits are among the pioneers who are replacing the system. As for those of you who have taken over-the-counter or prescription drugs over extended periods of time, essential oils are your best friend. They can cleanse the residues of these toxins from your system once and for all, and help restore your body back to its natural healthy state.
