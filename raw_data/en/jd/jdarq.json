Boone MD1, Rochelle T. Johnson BBS2, Lori A. Rolando MD, MPH1and Thomas R. Talbot MD, MPH1 1Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee and2Department of Human Resources, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee Abstract Objective: Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) requires that all faculty and staff receive the seasonal influenza vaccine annually or receive an approved vaccine exemption, either for a medical or deeply held religious or personal belief. We sought to understand the under-lying principles behind these exemption requests and their interaction with a multidisciplinary exemption review process. Design: All of the personal and religious exemption requests at VUMC for 3 consecutive influenza seasons from 2015 to 2018 were analyzed, categorizing these requests by 1 of 12 standardized employee categories and 1 of 18 unique reasons for vaccine exemption. Setting: Tertiary-care academic medical center.Participants: Healthcare personnel (HCP).Results: Among the 3 influenza seasons, 1.1% -2.1% of all VUMC HCP requested religious or personal exemption from vaccination. The frequency of religious and personal exemption approval increased annually from 296 of 452 (65.5%) to 196 of 248 (80.2%) to 283 of 323(87.6%) over the 3 seasons, representing a statistically significant increase each year. Of the 5 most common reasons against vaccination, 4 were explicitly religious in nature; the most common reason was that the \"body is a temple or sacred. \"Nonclinical staff submitted the most religious and personal exemption requests of any job category, submitting approximately one-third of all requests every year. Conclusions: These results demonstrate how detailed the personal or religious convictions behind vaccine avoidance can be among HCP and how vaccine avoidance stems from much more than simple misinformation regarding vaccination. The intersection between misinformationand personal or religious beliefs provides a unique opportunity to address HCP opinions toward vaccination in an exemption and appealsprocess like the one described here. (Received 20 August 2020; accepted 7 October 2020; electronically published 29 October 2020) In 1997, the Advisory Committee on I mmunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention (CDC) first recom- mended universal influenza vaccin ation for healthcare personnel (HCP), barring any contraindication.1Due to traditionally low HCP influenza vaccination rates, var ious professional societies have increasingly supported mandatory condition of employment HCP vaccination policies over the past decade, including the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the AmericanCollege of Physicians (ACP), and the Infectious Disease Society ofAmerica (IDSA). 2-4Although the importance of HCP influenza vac- cination has been conveyed over the years, the best mechanism to maximize HCP vaccination rate s has not been so apparent. Over the past 15 years, many instituti ons have implemented successful mandatory and condition-of-employment immunization policies thatrequire HCP to receive the influenza vaccine in the absence of specific exclusions.5-11The CDC has affirmed the positive effect of such pol- icies; the national HCP influenza vaccination rate in institutions withmandates reached 94.8% in the 2017 -2018 season compared to the overall national average of 78.4%. 12The consequences of noncompli- ance with mandatory policies are va riable, ranging from mask wearing during influenza season to employment termination; however, the implementation of a mandatory vaccination policy with consequencesfor noncompliance has been associated with twice the increase in vac-cination compared to the effect of mandatory policies without conse-quences. 13Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) has shared this experience. In the 3 influenza seasons leading up to the current study, the VUMC employee influenz a vaccination rates were 72.0% for 2012 -2013, 80.0% for 2013 -2014, and 91.7% for 2014 -2015. The 2014 -2015 season was the first to in volve a formal exemption review committee, and the 2015 -2016 season was the first with con- sequences for being noncompliant with vaccination or an approved exemption. In the subsequent 3 seasons, HCP influenza vaccinationrates were 97.7% in 2015 this article: Boone BC, et al. (2021). Use of a comprehensive program to review religious and personal seasonal influenza vaccination exemption requests by healthcarepersonnel. Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology , 42: 507 -512, https://doi.org/ 10.1017/ice.2020.1260 \u00a9 The Author(s), 2020. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of AmericaInfection Control & Hospital Epidemiology (2021), 42, 507 -512 doi:10.1017/ice.2020.1260 from https://www.cambridge.org/core . 19 May 2021 at 11:19:45 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.Two important variations in reported mandatory programs are the types of requested exemptions from influenza vaccination, aswell as the process for evaluating these requests. The review proc-esses vary widely and often go unreported. Of those who reporttheir methods, they range from a simple review by the humanresources department 8to the use of large, multidisciplinary committees.7,10,15,16 With regard to the types of requested exemptions, institutions tend to consider exemption from vaccination in 2 general catego-ries: (1) medical contraindication and (2) personal belief or religiousreasons. Medical exemptions typically include prior allergic reactionto the vaccine or its ingredients, a severe nonallergic adverse reac-tion, or other compelling medical reasons provided by an HCP 's primary care clinician. The various personal reasons for whichHCP decline vaccination have been well described: concerns overvaccine side effects, a perceived lack of vaccine efficacy, confidencein one 's own health, and inadequate vaccine access. 5,17-26Although many facilities include a general category for religious reasonsagainst vaccination, some may require a linkage to a formal religion,and some have allowed broader personal-belief exemptions. 27In all their complexity, the precise nature of these religious objections as apart of a large mandatory program is largely undescribed. We ana-lyzed the trends regarding the religious and personal-belief exemp-tions submitted by HCP as part of a large, mandatory influenzavaccination program and noted their interaction with a multidisci-plinary exemption review process. This project was approved by theVUMC Institutional Review Board. Methods Exemption request and approval processThe VUMC requires that all faculty and staff members, both clini- cal and nonclinical, receive the seasonal influenza vaccine on anannual basis or receive an approved vaccine exemption. An excep-tion is granted for either (1) a medical reason, which requires attes-tation by a separate licensed healthcare clinician, or (2) a deeplyheld religious or personal belief against vaccination. Medicalexemptions are permanent, but those for deeply held religiousor personal beliefs must be submitted on an annual basis.Requests for exemption are submitted in a free-text format beforeinfluenza season or upon hire if an HCP is a new employee duringinfluenza season. These are reviewed on a rolling basis by a multi-disciplinary review committee comprised of representatives fromoccupational health, infection prevention, infectious diseases, riskmanagement, legal affairs, human resources, and allergy.Reviewers see only the exemption text itself and are blinded toall details related to the employee submitting the exemption. Arequest is either granted or denied. If denied, the reasoning fordenial is provided to the requestor, with clarification on the ration-ale for denial. After denial, an appeal can be made in which furtherinformation can be provided to the review committee. A secondappeal can be submitted to the institutional executive sponsorsif the first appeal is denied. If an exemption is ultimately granted,requestors are required to wear a surgical mask whenever in patientcare and public areas during the influenza season. Faculty whorefuse vaccination and are not granted an exemption have theirinstitutional access to all electronic systems (including those usedfor patient care and research administration) revoked, effectivelyimpeding their ability to work in their designated roles (clinical,research, or administrative). Nonfaculty employees who refusevaccination and are not granted an exemption are placed on unpaid leave until the end of influenza season, when they canreturn to work if they choose. All of the exemption requests were recorded in a database that included for each request a uniqueemployee identifier, job title, free-text reason requesting exemp-tion, and ultimate approval or denial status. To fully describeand analyze the submitted religious and personal-belief exemptionrequests, the database information covering the 2015 -2016 through 2017 -2018 influenza seasons were included in the current study analysis. For the purposes of analysis and because newemployees are subject to the vaccination policy as they are hiredon a rolling schedule, the seasons for vaccine requirement wereselected to begin on July 1 and end on June 30 of each year. Job categorization Well over 100 unique job titles were submitted with exemption requests. To facilitate our analysis of exemptions by employeeswith similar type of role, each job title was reviewed by a singlereviewer (B.C.B.) and then sorted into 1 of 12 general job catego-ries. Each job category was then generalized by the presence orabsence of patient contact (Table 1). A human resources database of employees by job type was used to serve as a denominator, whenpossible, of these job titles submitting requests as a percentage ofthe overall number of employees. Categorization of exemption requests When submitting an exemption request for deeply held religious or personal beliefs, requestors are allowed to explain these reasonswithout word limitation. All of the exemption requests werereviewed by a single reviewer (B.C.B.), and the fundamental rea-sons against vaccination within each exemption request were gen-eralized into at least 1 of 18 exemption categories, with no categoryexcluding or taking priority over another (Table 2). Analysis of exemption approval and reasons against vaccination Once each exemption request had been characterized by employee and exemption categories, the prevalence of each particularexemption category was then calculated as a simple percentageof the total requests submitted in a given season. Similarly, thenumber of faculty or staff within each job category submittingexemption requests was totaled for each year of the study. Thereviewer did not have access to personally identifiable information and was blinded to the identity of the individuals who submitted the exemption requests. Statistical analysis Comparison of the annual exemption approval rates was per- formed using test of proportions with Stata version 16.0 software(StataCorp, College Station, TX). Results Exemption submissions approvalsIn the seasons, the num- bers of VUMC faculty or staff who submitted deeply held religiousor personal belief vaccination exemption requests were 452 (2.1%of all HCP), 248 (1.1%), and 323 (1.4%), respectively. The fre-quency of exemption approval increased each year from 296 of452 (65.5%) to 196 of 248 (80.2%) to 283 of 323 (87.6%; P<.05 for each annual change) (Fig. 1).508 Benjamin C. Boone et al Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core . 19 May 2021 at 11:19:45 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.Reasons for requesting exemption from vaccination The number of general reasons provided within a single exemption request ranged from as few as 1 to as many as 11 of the 18 catego- ries (mean, 2.47 for 2015 -2016; 2.60 for 2016 -2017; and 2.71 for 2017 -2018). The prevalence of each reason given for exemption requests is shown in Table 3. The most common reason provided stemmed from a belief that the human body is sacred or a templeand that vaccination would violate the sacredness of the person 's body. Although many submissions were less specific in making such statements, many of the submissions cited verses from theBible to support their reasoning. These verses included 1Corinthians 6:19 -20, which states: \"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. \"Other verses cited which express similar convictions were 1 Corinthians 3:16 -17, 2 Corinthians 7:1, and Romans 12:1. Not only was this reason the most com-monly cited, the frequency with which it was cited increased in total requested exemptions each successive year from 146 of 452 (32%) in 2015 -2016, to 117 of 248 (47%) in 2016 -2017, to 188 of 323 (58%) in 2017 -2018 of ( P<.01 with each annual increase). After the sacred-temple reasoning, 3 of the next 4 most common reasons for exemption requests were also religious innature. These included, in decreasing order of frequency, (1) the belief in protection from influenza by a higher power, (2) an opin- ion that influenza vaccination was against one 's generic religious beliefs, and (3) that one 's belonging to a specific organized religion precluded vaccination. The frequency of citing a higher powerincreased year after year from 105 of 452 (23%) in 2015 -2016 to 77 of 248 (31%) in 2016 -2017 to 105 of 323 (33%) in 2017 - 2018 ( P<.002). A similar trend occurred among those mentioninga particular organized religion, save for the final season, with the frequency changing from 81 of 452 (18%) in 2015 -2016, to 65 of 248 (26%) in 2016 -2017, to 80 of 323 (25%) in 2017 -2018 ( P< .02). This finding contrasts with the less specific reasoning of vac-cination standing against one 's generic religious beliefs, which decreased in frequency each year from 89 of 452 (20%) in 2015 - 2016, to 28 of 248 (11%) in 2016 -2017, to 26 of 323 (8%) in 2017 -2018 ( P<.001 from year 1 to year 2, but nonsignificantly from year 2 to 3). Exemption requests by job category The distribution of exemption requests across all job categories is noted in Table 1. Most exemption requests all 3 years of analysis were submitted by nonclinical staff, who submitted 33.2% of allexemptions in 2015 in 2016 -2017, and 34.7% in 2017 -2018. Nurses submitted the second highest number of exemptions to vaccination all 3 years, submitting 16.8%, 15.3%,and 18.9% of exemptions in the same respective years. The nurses submitting exemptions represented 1.5%, 0.7%, and 1.1% of all employed nurses in those years. When job categories were groupedinto those with routine patient contact and those without routinepatient contact, the proportions of exemption requests for eachgroup were similar in both the 2015 -2016 and 2017 -2018 seasons. In the 2016 -2017 season, however, non -patient-care job categories comprised a disproportionate number of exemptions compared topatient-contact job categories (149 of 248; P<.01). Discussion The results of our study highlight in detail the types of religious and personal beliefs that form requests for exemption to mandatoryTable 1.

Notably, in contrast to prior studies noting that the most commonreasons for objection to the vaccine had to do with misinformationand misconceptions regarding the vaccine, 4 of the 5 mostcommon reasons in this study were religious in nature. 28 Because of their subjectivity, religious and personal belief exemp-tions provide a unique challenge to the reviewers. The various law-suits brought by HCP whose religious exemptions were denied byhealthcare facility leaders highlight the importance of an explicit,multidisciplinary, and reasonable exemption approval process for this phenomenon, like the one described in this study. 27Moreover, an appeals process allows for both clarification of HCP reasoningas well as education directed toward misinformation. After religious reasons, one o f the most common reasons for exemption was an opinion that vaccine ingredients were toxic(Table 3). The CDC publishes a list of standard vaccine ingredients. 29 Most of the ingredients cited by exemption requests were either intimidating names for innocuou s buffers (eg, sodium phosphate - buffered isotonic sodium chloride solution) or otherwise toxic ingre-dients that are present in negligib le concentrations (eg, formalde- hyde). The most controversial vaccine ingredient cited was thimerosal, which is notably absent from the vaccine formulationsused by VUMC. A different contention asserted that the vaccine con- t a i n sh u m a nf e t a lt i s s u e ,w h i c hi sn o tt r u ef o rt h i so ra n yo t h e rF D A -approved vaccine. 29Finally, many submissions were both lengthy and conspicuously identical , suggesting that they originated from a single common source. At least 1 institutio n has encountered a similar prob- lem.7Indeed, we found at least 7 websites that publish examples designed to assist employees seeking exemptions from mandatoryvaccination policies. We have decided not to name these websitesto preserve the integrity of the exemption system. The percentage of HCP who submitted vaccination exemption requests ranged from 1.1% to 2.2% in the 3 years of this study. This finding contrasts with those of other institutions that have reported this information, such as Cincinnati Children 'sH o s p i t a l , which reported a mere 0.08% of empl oyees submitting such requests. 5 A St Louis healthcare institution of similar size to VUMC has reported that only 0.3% of employees received a religious exemption for vac- cination.8Although personal and religious reasons against vaccina- t i o na r eb yn a t u r es u b j e c t i v et ot he individual, they may stem from some degree of misconception about the vaccine. Therefore, efforts are underway at VUMC to address common misconceptions to mit-igate their effects on the frequency of vaccination exemption requests. Despite the higher rate of exemption requests, the HCP influenzaTable 2. Categories and Examples of Exemption Requests General Category of Belief Sample Verbiage The body is a temple/sacred \"Our body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which lives in you.

Given that the criteria for exemp-tion approval did not change over this time, one possible reason forthis increase could be an increasing realization among requestorsof verbiage that does not sufficiently convey a deeply held belief. This hypothesis is supported by the annually decreasing percent- age of exemption requests that include the generic reasoning\"against my religion, \"which decreased from 20% to 11% to 8% and coincided with an increase in more specific descriptive lan-guage in the 3 most common reasons submitted (Table 3). Notably, the frequency of approval increased annually, but the number of exempted employees did not. Whether employeesexempted in prior years subsequently went on to become vacci-nated or stopped working at VUMC is unclear. Nurses submitted the most exemption requests of any job cat- egory with routine patient contact; 1.5%, 0.7%, and 1.1% of all nurses submitted exemptions in each year of our study. This is not entirely surprising, as nurses represent the largest categoryof employees with routine patient contact. Nurses submittedexemptions less frequently than the overall employee population,however, whose rates were 2.1%, 1.1%, and 1.4% those same years. For reference, nonclinical staff submitted more than twice the number of exemption requests than nurses over the 3-year period,despite being a job category of similar size. In the 2017 -2018 influenza season in the United States as a whole, the vaccination rate among nurses w as 90.5%, trailing only physicians (96.1%) and pharmacists (92.2%). Al l of these are notably higher than the overall HCP vaccination rate (78.6%) and that of nonclinical HCP (72.8%). 12These national averages are lower than the VUMC vacci- nation rate, which was >97% in all 3 years of our study. This finding suggests that mandatory vaccinati on policies may increase vaccina- t i o nr a t e s ,g i v e nt h a tt h eV U M Cv a c c i n a t i o nr a t ei nt h e3y e a r sp r i o rto initiating the mandate ranged much closer to the national average, from 72.0% to 91.7%. First and foremost, this study wa s intended to be a descriptive analysis of the many reasons HCP have for objecting to receipt ofthe seasonal influenza vaccine. The liberty given by VUMC to itsHCP to describe these reasons in detail is meant to give HCP anopportunity to express their convictions without restriction. Although this open forum gives requestors the best chance to be understood, it makes perfect classification of their reasoning a chal-lenging task. We believe that the 18 exemption categories adequately convey the subjective reasons provided by requestors against vaccina-tion, but they are admittedly generalizations of motivations unique to each individual. We had access to precise job descriptions of all individuals submit- ting exemption request s. However, because HCP are often grouped by their department rather than their specific role in the human resour-ces database, the precise job descriptions of all VUMC personnel werenot available for this study. This l imitation prevented us from calcu- l a t i n gt h ee x a c tn u m b e r so fe x e m p t i o n sa sap e r c e n t a g eo fa l li n d i v i d - uals in a given job category. A notable exception to this was nurses,whose collective numbers were precisely known. Finally, the processof categorization of the exemption requests was made by a singleinvestigator, which may have led to biases of classification. The inves- tigator did regularly review his methodology and specific examples with a second investigator, which helped to limit this bias. In conclusion, our results demonstrate how detailed the personal and religious convictions behin d vaccine avoidance can be among HCP, and how vaccine avoidance stems from much more than simplemisinformation regarding vaccina tion. The intersect ion between mis- information and personal and rel igious beliefs provides a unique opportunity to address HCP opinions toward vaccination in anexemption and appeals process. Mai ntaining a fair process for navi- gating HCP dissent regarding mandatory vaccination will increase in importance as such programs become increasingly prevalent. Fig. 1.
