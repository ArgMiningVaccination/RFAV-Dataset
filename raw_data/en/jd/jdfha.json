My interest was sparked by my interactions with my pediatrician, Dr. Gomez. Seeing Dr. Gomez's impact on my family and I, I recognized that I want to work with children and their families. Becoming a pediatrician will allow me to practice in fields that resonate with my personal desire to become a doctor that can heal and teach, practicing primary care and preventative medicine. In addition, I am interested in working with patients long-term. As a pediatrician, I can care for patients from birth through adolescence. By working with children, I can practice in a setting that requires mastery of communication and Researchers interviewed 1,699 adults that included primary caretakers for 811 children. And they investigated five factors: health conditions, health behaviors and attitudes, health care access, quality of life, and social or environmental factors. The communities were largely minority. One of the discoveries was that: From a pediatric perspective, the family is an integral part of the healthcare team. Parents are the primary ally and resource in providing individualized care for their child. Even in adult patients, who they are is impacted by the relationships that they have. Serious or chronic illnesses and injuries affect the entire family. The family, then, becomes the patient, particularly when it is necessary to make lifestyle changes. Child life specialists play an increasingly important role in health care by helping children and families cope and adjust to the challenges of hospital visits. Although a child life -A succinct philosophy of family nursing is seen in The Association for the Care of Children's Health standards stating the expectation for healthcare providers to facilitate family/professional collaboration at all levels of care, and to recognizing family as the constant in the patient's life whereas the healthcare providers will fluctuate (p.40, 2003). During the 2012 Winter Break period, I had the opportunity to participate in my first shadowing experience with Dr. Mafhuzul Huq, a local pediatrician, at Sunshine Pediatrics, in Mcallen, TX. During this period, I observed common check ups and specialized appointments of children ranging from 1-10 years of age. This experience gave me a unique opportunity to observe parent, patient, and physician dynamic. During the 2013 Winter Break period, I was able to 1.

During my clinical rotations, I always requested to work with pediatric patients if available. Unfortunately, my nursing instructor who understood this passion and extracurricular activities passed away shortly before graduation. However, that adds to motivation to help continue to help children and their communities. In the first month of clinical rotation at Seattle Children's, there was a patient's family who was getting frustrated. After The article in the textbook concerning child vaccinations touches on the importance of vaccines and some of the reasons why children aren't vaccinated. Vaccinations are very important to prevent diseases; the injection is a small dose of inactive virus to allow the body to guard itself against the disease. Some common beliefs are that children who are vaccinated are at risk of chronic illnesses which the textbook reveals that these illnesses have no correlation to the vaccinations. Another reason why children aren't vaccinated is due to income, poverty levels affect the children who are not vaccinated because the families cannot afford them. In the article, \"Vaccines Prevent Infectious Diseases\" by Roman Espejo from Opposing Viewpoints in Context, some background is given about vaccines. First, the article talks about some history of some diseases. \"Similarly, diseases like whooping cough (pertussis), measles, mumps, and German measles (rubella) may be unfamiliar to you. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, these illnesses struck hundreds of thousands of people in the United States each year, mostly children, and tens of thousands of people died\" (Espejo). This is true and is eye opening to some. Next, how a vaccine works is described. \"Traditional vaccines contain either parts of microbes or whole microbes that have been killed or weakened so that they don't cause disease. When with pus. On day twelve the blisters start to get hard and crust over and stomach pain starts and confusion starts to occur. On the third or forth week the blisters start to fall of and leave big nasty scars all over. If not treated the long term affects of the virus include blindness and deformed hands and feet. It kills 3 out of every 10 people it infects. After you get vaccinated on the third or forth day after vaccination a red itchy bump will start to appear it is called the vaccination cite. The bump becomes a blister and will then begin to fill with pus then will later drain. A health care worker should check to see To begin, the success with Arlene's family doctor is built on a therapeutic relationship and rapport. By having this therapeutic relationship allows for effective communication to improve the quality of care of the individual (Stickley & Freshwater, 2006). By developing a therapeutic relationship with your physician an individual is trusting that they get the best possible care by them seeing the whole picture at the micro-level. Having effective communication results in a positive outcome for the patient (Travaline et al., 2005). In Arlene's case a therapeutic relationship was fostered by the 4 phases developing a therapeutic relationship; pre-interaction, orientation, working and termination (Day & Levett-Jones, 2010). Being Arlene's family A growing multicultural society presents healthcare providers with a difficult task of providing appropriate care for individuals who have different life experiences, beliefs, value systems, religions, languages, and healthcare practices. This is especially vital when pediatrics care is needed during childhood. The authors explored the subject by bringing the information about the differences in culture, spirituality, and health practices, which may cause Family Presence and Participation: Pediatrics Leading the Way... and Still Evolving Katalin T. Bieniek Florida Atlantic University Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing Family Presence and Participation: Pediatrics Leading the Way... and Still Evolving In the realm of nursing, family-centered care is extremely important to developing the individual nurse's authentic presence (Watson, 1985). As a nurse, one needs to be able to successfully connect to patients, while also involving the families of the patient in the healing process. Pediatrics was the first subdivision of nursing care to begin implementing parental involvement, as it was the most effective way to keep children calm while undergoing various stressful procedures (Dokken et al. 2015). Through the incorporation of relatives to the care setting, the young convalescent will feel a sense of comfort in the hospital or emergency room, which can be quite daunting even for some adults. However, parents are not the only key figures in a child's life. The inclusion of other family members, such as aunts, uncles, and siblings, has reflected in an increase in both quality of care as well as safety for hospitalized pediatric patients (Dokken et al. 2015). I chose the article \"Family Presence and Participation: Pediatrics Leading the Way... and Still Evolving\" by Deborah Dokken, Kelly Parent, and Elizabeth Ahmann. This article reflects on the importance of family-centered care in the discipline of nursing, and details published a controversial study in British journal Lancet where he linked MMR vaccination to autism. (Should I include what his study was based on and results?) Years later, many other studies proved it wrong but mistrust of science and mistrust of government is still there (2011).
