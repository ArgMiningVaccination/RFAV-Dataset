Nonetheless, despite our challenges, numerous contributions have been made to advance surgical science and surgical education by members of our Department as illustrated in this newsletter. It gives me great satisfaction and joy to also see our department grow in other ways as families have expanded with the birth of children and grandchildren! I look forward to 2023. No doubt, challenges remain. Nonetheless, I look forward to continuing our path towards excellence in surgery with the prospect of working less encumbered by the devastation of the pandemic. DemetriusLetter from the Chair UMass Chan Resident-Led 'Day in the Life of a Surgeon' Event Promotes Diversity in Surgery More than 60 college students from across Massachusetts attended \" A Day in the Life of a Surgeon\" event held on November 11, organized by two UMass Chan surgery residents, to give students underrepresented in medicine the opportunity to learn about the surgical field, gain exposure to specialties, and seek mentorship and guidance in pursuing this field. Paulo Martins, MD gave an inspirational keynote address. Olajumoke (Jummy) Megafu, MD, General Surgery resident (left) and Emily Fan, MD chief resident of vascular surgery (right), belong to the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Task Force in the Department of Surgery and are focused on promoting diversity in their field. The task force is working to eliminate discriminatory practices and proactively implement changes that will promote a diverse, equitable, and inclusive working and learning environment through recruitment, mentorship, outreach, and research. Over the course of the day, students listened to a panel of specialists in orthopedic surgery, urology, obstetrics/gynecology, general surgery, pediatric surgery, neurosurgery and vascular surgery; observed a livestream of an open aortic aneurysm repair and a robotic inguinal hernia repair; discussed the cases with attending surgeons; toured the Medical School and surgical facilities; and got hands-on experience in the simulation lab. Dr. Olajumoke (Jummy) Megafu and Dr. Emily Fan and their team imagined, created, and implemented an event for Massachusetts college students to foster DEI in surgery. Page 2 Great Turnout for the UMass Medical Student Laparoscopic Surgery Simulation Session & Career Development Night DEP ARTMENT OF SURGERY EVENTS Edward Kim, MD, PhD General Surgery (PGY-4, right) General Surgery, developed a medical school educational program aimed to foster early exposure to general surgery. One of the initiatives is a laparoscopic surgery simulation session/ career development night.

Page 3Remembering Bryce Bludevich, MD Bryce's contributions rival - and even surpass - those of someone who lived a very long life. Remarks by Nicole Cherng, MD about AOA inductee, Bryce Bludevich, MD at the Alpha Omega Alpha Ceremony, October 4, 2022. \"Tonight Dean Flotte has graciously given me the honor to give some remarks about Dr. Bryce Bludevich. Dr. Bludevich is being inducted post-humously. We are honored to have her parents, Jacki Murphy and Zaf Bludevich, here to accept on her behalf. Examples of Dr. Bludevich's humanism began well before her time in Worcester. In medical school, at the University of Vermont, she participated in global health mission trips to Russia and Uganda, implementing quality initiative projects in the departments of surgery at the local medical schools. After medical school, Dr. Bludevich began her categorical General Surgery Residency in 2017. She excelled in her two clinical years prior to her research years in the Division of Thoracic Surgery. Besides striving for clinical excellence, she became known for constantly recycling the empty cans and bottles laying around the work rooms, bringing in baked goods for her co-residents' birthdays, and always acting on ways to improve the surgical residency, not just for current residents, but for all future residents. But unfortunately, it would be in her second year of residency where she would be diagnosed with stage III melanoma that would progress to stage IV within two years of diagnosis. However, her disease along with undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, radiation, and various surgeries, wouldn't stop Bryce from writing multiple peer reviewed publications, creating a transition to residency curriculum for UMass medical students, develop a Residents as Educators pathway for surgical residents interested in education, and help implement a virtual general surgery residency interview process when the pandemic hit. Bryce's contributions rival - and even surpass - those of someone who lived a very long life. Jennifer LaFemina, MD her program director, commented that \"few (perhaps none) have demonstrated the values of AOA more comprehensively than Dr. Bludevich. To be honest, Bryce lived the values\" . And I could not agree more. Bryce's accomplishments clearly warrant tonight's induction, but it is her kindness that is truly unparalleled. Bryce genuinely believed in the potential of all individuals and reached out a helping hand in whatever way she could. For those fortunate enough to have crossed paths with Dr. Bludevich and those who have heard of her story - one sentiment remains clear - Bryce was humanistic in its truest form, and her light will never go out. \"Congratulations Department of Surgery Inductees in UMass Chan Chapter of Alpha Omega Alpha Alexander Pong, MD Plastic Surgery (PGY-6) , Shirley Shue, MD Plastic Surgery General Surgery (PGY-5), and Bryce Bludevich, MD General Surgery Resident were inducted October 4, 2022 into the Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) Delta Chapter (left to right).

TAVR Team Implants First-of-Its-Kind Aortic Valve The UMass Memorial Medical Center Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) team became the first program in New England to implant the new generation SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve in a patient with aortic stenosis. It was a complex percutaneous axillary implant, and the team reports that the new valve worked very well. This kind of valve has shown to improve valve longevity and poten- tially reduce the need for another procedure. The TAVR team includes Jennifer Walker, MD, Cardiac Surgery (left); Nikolaos Kakouros, MD, PhD; Waqas Qureshi, Perras, NP; Stephanie Wiafe, NP; JaeY oon Park, MD. Do Y ou Need Research Assistance?

Dr. Nguyen's research explores how the diabetic immune system contributes to nonhealing foot ulcers. Her research will prevent amputations and save limbs. She has developed a system to culture human bone marrow cells using samples donated from diabetic and non-diabetic patients after leg amputations. Using this system she aims to identify pathways that affect immune cell development lead- ing to poor wound healing. Another Historic First! The UMass Vascular team, led by Andres Schanzer, MD, was the first in THE WORLD to repair a diseased aortic arch using a retrograde three-vessel arch device that was custom-made for the patient's anatomy. The device was the first of its kind to be used in the world using three branch- es to the arteries supplying the arms and brain in such a way that all could be accessed from a single groin puncture. Andres Schanzer, MD Named Endowed Chair Andres Schanzer, MD, Professor of Surgery and Population & Quantitative Health Sciences and Chief of the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, is the inaugural Cutler Chair in Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, which will provide ongoing support to research, teaching, and clinical work. The Cutler Chair in Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, which was approved in an affirmative vote by the University's Board, was made possible through the commitment of significant funds by Bruce S. Cutler, MD, UMass Chan Professor of Surgery Emeritus and former Chief of the Division of Vascular Surgery, and his wife, Leslie. The Cutlers' generous contribution enhanced an already-existing endowed vascular surgery fund.

Page 7COVID Critical Care Experience Leads UMass Chan Surgery Resident to Study CPR Survival A new controlled study from UMass Chan Medical School provides evidence for the first time that could inform physicians about which very sick or injured patients would be most likely to benefit from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The study by Daniel J. Baldor, MD, MPH, General Surgery (PGY-5) and his colleagues found that \"full code\" status, including aggressive CPR, provided no survival benefit over do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status among individuals with greater than 75 percent predicted mortality as determined by Apache IV score, a severity of illness rating. Among less severely ill patients, full code status was associated with improved survival. The article was published in Journal of Intensive Care Medicine.

In order to meet the special needs of the aorta, this device, called a fenestrated endograft, must be customized to match the exact physiology of each patient. Our team uses special imaging software that allows us to take exact measurements to match the specific anatomy. The endograft is designed just for that patient. See video: https://www.ummhealth.org/fevar Innovation that Makes Everyone Breathe Easier. We've Reduced the Time to get a Biopsy, Diagnosis and Surgery from Weeks to Hours ROADAT team (left to right) Andrew Fischer, MD, Cytopathology; Rahul Sood, MD, Pulmonology; Mark Maxwell, MD, Thoracic Surgery Dejah Judelson, MD, Vascular Surgery, Medical Director, AV Access Medical Director, Center for Venous Disease Mark Maxfield, MD, Assistant Professor, Division of Thoracic Surgery, is a member of the team that has helped pioneer the Robotic One Anesthetic Diagnosis and Treatment (ROADAT) procedure. \"The idea was to provide the best patient experience possible for the person with a suspicious lung nodule, \" says Dr. Maxfield. \"In order to do that we had to do two things. The first innovation was to rethink the entire process from the patient perspective and to stop looking at the biopsy and the surgery as separate events. We had to reinvent our protocols and find ways to achieve accurate, timely and clinically effective results, and a better experience for the patient. \" \"Next, we employed the right technology to make the procedure as minimally invasive as possible so that the patient doesn't have to endure unnecessary, large incisions. To accomplish this, we chose specially designed robotic technology that can produce a 3D map of the patient's lung, which helps us be even more precise and accurate, and allows us to do the entire procedure with very small incisions. \" \"The second innovation was to have a cytopathologist, the physician who determines whether the biopsy is cancer, in the operating room ready to render a diagnosis in minutes. \" \"If the cytopathologist tells us it's cancer, \" says Dr. Maxfield, \"we call the patient's family, keep the patient asleep, and perform the surgery to remove it then and there. If it's not cancer, we wake them up and give them the good news. \" See video: https://www.ummhealth.org/ lung-cancer-surgeryRELENTLESS INNOV ATION Page BABIES Jonathan Green, MD, MSCI, Pediatric Surgery, and his wife Jenna, welcomed twins, Jacob and Jillian, born August 19, 2022.
