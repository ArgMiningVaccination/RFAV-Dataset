[Vaccination]against COVID-19 among immunocompromised [population]is an essential step to minimize deadly [complications]. Numerous studies have shown an [association]between immune status, [disease severity], and suboptimal responsiveness to [vaccination]. Additionally, data suggests that elevated [IgG]levels correlated with host viral neutralization. We herein present data [vaccination]between January and March 2021;two doses in total. The 30 days post- [vaccination] [SARS-CoV-2]spike [antigen]-specific [IgG]levels were measured Result(s) The included [patients]underwent [kidney transplantation]between 1983 and 2020. these [patients], 35% showed detectable peak COVID [IgG] [serum]levels 30 days after the 2nd [vaccine] [dose]. A total of 31 [patients](65%) did not show any response;majority of these non-responders (62%) were heavily immunocompromised, either on high [dose]Mycophenolate (at least 720 mg twice daily) in addition to standard [Calcineurin inhibitor]/ [Sirolimus]+/- [Prednisone]), or had received high [dose]Thymoglobulin (6 mg/kg or more) within a year of [vaccination]. Among immunocompetent [patients], over 95% immunological responsiveness or viral [transplantation]management. However, their utilization impacts B [cell proliferation], thereby reducing production]and [transplant] [patients]. The [ability]of these immunosuppressive medications to suppress responsiveness to the SARS CoV-2 [vaccine]supports the need for 1) regular [immunological surveillance]post- [vaccination]among [transplant] [patients], and 2) the need for a third or possibly fourth booster [dose]to achieve a sustained and effective response.
