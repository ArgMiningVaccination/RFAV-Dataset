This petition includes new published evidence and scientific research findings supporting the request to add \"Anxiety\" as a qualifying condition that were not present in the \"General Anxiety Disorder\" petition. This petition should be reviewed and not rejected for its similarity to an earlier petition due to the new evidence published by the Minnesota Department of Health , the Massachusettes Department of Health and other peer -reviewed medical research attached and included. The number one condition that medical cannabis patients report that cannabis allieviates symptoms is Anxiety. Cannabis helps patients with Anxiety more than it helps allieviate chronic pain. It is for this reason and the reasons below that Anxiety should be added to the list of qualifying debilitating medical conditions for which medical cannabis may be used. Anxiety is a debilitating condition that affects the whole person, including treatment of other conditions. https://www.mass.gov/report/massachusetts -department-of-public -health- marijuana-research Health Study (MBHS) A legislative mandate required the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to conduct a baseline study to investigate marijuana use in Massachusetts. The report published confirms the consensus that marijuana use improves mood and or mental health for a large percentage of people. Page 148: Results from this survey suggest that respondents appear to be treating a wide range of medical conditions, and often more than one at a time. The top 5 medical conditions being treated were anxiety (60% or all respondents) , chronic pain (46%), insomnia (43%), depression (42%), and stress (41%), and the average number of conditions being treated by medical marijuana is 4.7. In the 1999 National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine report on marijuana, the National Academy of Science found that thorough medical research shows that marijuana reduces anxiety for 165 movement disorders most often considered for marijuana or cannabinoid therapy are dystonia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Tourette's syndrome. Movement disorders are often transiently exacerbated by stress and activity and improved by factors that reduce stress. This is of particular interest because for many people marijuana reduces anxiety. In a study of medical marijuana patients in Arizona, many patients reported significant relief levels of anxi ety. (REF #13) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26317379 367 medical marijuana patients in Arizona were surveyed. 181 patients reported using medical marijuana to experience relief from Anxiety General relief from Anxiety symptoms was 82.9% with medical marijuana, Relief by medical marijuana compared to other medications was 79.3% for Anxiety Less frequent use of other medications was 85.9% for Anxiety Patients who suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder find relief of anxiety with medical cannabis. PTSD is a qualifying condition in Hawaii and other states. It makes logical sense to allow people who do not have PTSD to gain relief of anxiety by adding anxiety to the list of qualifying conditions. In a small percentage of people, medical cannabis can aggravate their anxiety. For the majority of people, cannabis reduces anxiety. This contraindication is similar to other anti -anxiety prescriptions, for whom a small percentage, their anxiety can be aggravated. This is not a reason to reject a qualifying condition, merely a reality of using any medication. Some epilepsy medicines make seizures worse or more frequent for example. Marijuana is safer than all prescription medications and most of OTC medications. Cannabis has less side effects, and no severe, toxic or dangerous side effects compared to all of the prescription medications used to treat Anxiety. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental -health-medications/index.shtml For example Benzodiazepines commonly used as anti anxiety medications, are responsible for hundreds of deaths each year in the United States. https://www.drugabuse.gov/related -topics/trends -statistics/overdose -death -rates https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2014/04/10/anxiety -reduction-exploring-the-role -of-cannabinoid-receptors/ Relief of anxiety and stress is one of the most common reasons that people give for using marijuana Anti-Anxiety medication Ativan may be implicated in Chris Cornell's suicide. http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/ativan- what-you-need-to-know -about-anxiety -pills-w483638 A safety profile of Medical Marijuana can be found in the first year report of the Minnesota medical marijuana program. The Minnesota Department of Health surveyed 1500+ medical marijuana patients enrolled in the program. (REF #98) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/firstyearreport.html Adverse Side Effects: At this point, the safety profile of the medical cannabis products available through the Minnesota program seems quite favorable. Approximately 20-25% of enrolled patients report negative physical or mental side effects of some kind, with the majority - around 60% - reporting only one and 90% reporting three or fewer. The vast majority of adverse side effects, around 90%, are mild to moderate in severity. An assessment of the 30 patients reporting severe side effects, meaning \"interrupts usual daily activities,\" found no apparent pattern of patient age, medical condition, or type of medical cannabis used. The most common adverse side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, and fatigue. Fortunately, up to the present no serious adverse events (life threatening or requiring hospitalization) have been reported. Medical Marijuana's mild to moderate side effects of dry mouth, drowsiness and fatigue are easily tolerated by the vast majority of patients. The Mayo Clinic website has assembled dosage information on Medical Marijuana. http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs -supplements/marijuana/dosing/hrb -20059701 In the latest petition to add Anxiety to Ohio's medical marijuana program, the New Jersey Department of Health's final decision on a petition to add anxiety in New Jersey was included. (REF 96) https://med.ohio.gov/Portals/0/Publications/Medical%20Marijuana%20Petitions%202019/0133%20- %20Anxiety%20[Rosenberger].pdf?ver=2020-01-28-104750-247 (REF 97) https://www.nj.gov/health/medicalmarijuana/documents/agency decision letters/MMP FAD conditions 012319.p New Jersey's medical cannabis program is similar to Hawaii's medical cannabis program. With similar requirements for petitions to meet. On Ju ly 5, 2016, the Department published the Request for Petitions in the New Jersey Register advising that from August 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016, it was accepting petitions to establish additional medical conditions as \"debilitating\" under the MMP. 43 NJR. 1395(a). The Request for Petitions stated that the Department was seeking petitions in accordance with the Act, which authorizes the Department to include additional debilitating medical conditions under the MMP. In the Request for Petitions, the public was advised that submitted petitions were required to include the following information, pursuant to N.J.A.C. 8:64-53: (1) The extent to which the condition is generally accepted by the medical community and other experts as a valid, existing medical condit ion; (2) If one or more treatments of the condition, rather than the condition itself. are alleged to be the cause of the patient's suffering, the extent to which the treatments causing suffering are generally accepted by the medical community and other e xperts as valid treatments for the condition; (3) The extent to which the condition itself andfor the treatments thereof cause severe suffering, such as severe and/or chronic pain. severe nausea and/or vomiting, or othenrvise severely impair the patient's ability to carry on activities of daily living; (4) The availability of conventional medical therapies other than those that cause suffering to alleviate suffering caused by the condition andlorthe treatment thereof; (5) The extent to which evidence that is generally accepted among the medical community and other experts supports a nding that the use of marijuana alleviates suffering caused by the condition and/or the treatment thereof; and (6) Letters of support from physicians or other licensed healt h care professional knowledgeable about the condition. New Jersey found that Anxiety met the requirements and accepted Anxiety as a qualifying condition. Anxiety Based upon my independent review of the petitions, I am granting those seeking to add anxiety to the MMP. In coming to this conclusion, I reviewed these petitions against the six regulatory criteria cited above and found that the condition meets the requirements for inclusion in the MMP. Regarding the rst factor, which is whether the condition is generally accepted in the medical community as a valid medical condition, I find that anxiety satisfies this criteria. Specically, the American Psychiatric Association defines anxiety and anxiety disorders as conditions characterized by excessive fear and behavioral disturbances. Anxiety results from anticipation of a future threat and may be associated with symptoms of muscle tension, vigilance in preparation for future danger, and overly cautious or avoidant behaviors. Additionally, there are multiple ICD -10-CM codes for anxiety disorders. Because anxiety maintains a common definition in the medical community and has |CD \u201410\u2014CM codes, I nd that anxiety is a valid and recognized medical condition. Under the second factor, I must consider whether the treatments for the condition, rather than the condition itself, are causing the patient's suffering and the extent to which the treatments causing the patient suffering are generally accepted by the medical community and other experts as valid treatments for the condition. From my review of this condition, the generally accepted treatments for anxiety are dependent on the symptoms and the severity of the particular disorder. Mild and moderate forms of anxiety may not require a pharmacologic intervention, but may necessitate other forms of treatment, such as meditation, mindfulness, breathing techniques as well as psychotherapy (counseling) or cognitive therapy.\" The most common classes of medications used to combat anxiety disorders are antidepressants , anti -anxiety drugs, and beta\u2014 blockers.49 Antidepressants are safe and effective but they may be risky for children, teens, and young adults.50 Antidepressants aiso come with a \"black box\" warning \u2014 the FDA's strongest warning \u2014 advising that some people may have suicidal thoughts or make suicide attempts while taking the medication.51 The most common anti -anxiety medications are called benzodiazepines. As noted by the Panel, the common sides effects of benzodiazepines include headache, confusion, tiredness, and in some causes nightmares and memory impairments.52 And, benzodiazepines carry a risk of dependence and addiction.53 Furthermore, the FDA notes that the number of patients who were prescribed both an opioid analgesic and benzodiazepine increased by 41% between 2002 and 2014.54 As a result, the FDA requires black box warnings and patient-focused Medication Guides for prescription opioid analgesics, opioid -containing cough products, and benzodiazepines to inform the patient about the serious risks associated with using these medications at the same time.55 Thus, I find that the treatments for anxiety are recognized and accepted by the medical community as the treatments forthis condition and relate to the suffering of the patient. As for the third factor, which is whether the condition itself andfor the treatments thereof cause severe suffering, such as severe andior chronic pain, severe nausea andlor vomiting or othenntise severely impair the patient's ability to carry on activities of daily living, I nd that both the anxiety condition itself as well as the treatments for this condition cause severe suffering for patients. Specifically, anxiety may lead to problems that negatively impact an individual's activities of daily iiving and quaiity of life and may lead to suicide and depression. Anxiety disorders can also cause signicant distress or interfere with social, occupational, and other areas of functioning. In fact, an estimated 31.1% of US. adults experience an anxiety disorder at some time in their lives.56 Medications, in some instances, may exacerbate the symptoms and are associated with debilitating side effects that can prevent a patient from engaging in activities of daily living, thereby diminishing one's quality of life. Accordingly, I nd that both the condition of anxiety as well as the therapies to treat it cause severe suffering. Under the fourth factor, I must evaluate the availability of conventional medical therapies, other than those that cause suffering, to alleviate the patients suffering caused by the condition and or the treatment thereof. As discussed above, mild and moderate forms of anxiety may be treated with meditation, mindfulness, breathing techniques as well as counseling or cognitive therapy that can be effective. Progression to medication therapy may be initiated; however, in both instances, one must consider the therapeutic response. Failure to respond to therapies or side effects associated with treatments may result in signicant impacts on quality of life. As such, I find that there is an absence of medicaIIy -accepted, alternative medical therapies to the conventional therapies currently prescribed for migraine that cause suffering. Regarding the fth factor, which is whether there is generally accepted evidence in t he medical community that the use of marijuana alleviates suffering relating to the condition, I find that cannabis is generaliy accepted as an effective treatment for anxiety. The Panel discussed medical evidence that cannabis may exacerbate anxiety symptoms or that an effect related to cannabis may be associated with anxiety, such as dependence and cravings. Literature suggests that individuals with anxiety sensitivity may be more likely to turn to cannabis as a mechanism for coping with stress, which may in turn lead to problematic use behaviors.57 However, the Panel further discussed a review published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2017, which found that there is limited evidence that cannabidiol is an effective treatment for the improvement of anxiety symptoms, which was assessed by a public speaking test utilizing individuais with social anxiety disorders.58 On balance, the Panel recommended adding anxiety as an allowable condition under the MMP as research suggests that it could be helpful to some patients with this condition. I agree. While marijuana may not be effective for all anxiety sufferers, there is research evidencing that it may be helpful to some, especially those with social anxiety disorders. Thus , I find that there is acceptance in the medical community that marijuana is likely to relieve the suffering associated with some anxiety conditions. However, like any medical condition, the use of medical marijuana to treat anxiety must be explored by the medical professional treating the patient to determine whether it is the best and most appropriate course of treatment for the patient. As for the nal factor, which is whether there were letters from physicians or other licensed health care professionals knowledgeable about the condition supporting the inclusion of anxiety under the MMP, I nd that the petitions were submitted with support from medical professionals. Based upon the above analysis, | find that the condition of anxiety is \"debilitating\" and that medical marijuana is more likely than not to be potentially beneficial to treat or alleviate the debilitating effect of this condition. As such, I nd that anxiety should be added to the MMP. In a previous qualifying condition petition for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the Director of Health at the Hawaii Department of Health rejected adding the condition to the medical marijuana program. The main reason being that there is a lack of peer-reviewed scientific evidence showing beneficial use to treat GAD. This idea that peer -reviewed scientific evidence needs to conclusively show medical benefit or else no other qualifying conditions could be approved is wrong; due to the political nature of marijuana. Please allow me to explain. The Hawaii medical cannabis law was created based on medical and anecdotal evidence. Anecdotal evidence was accepted because there is a lack of scientific research on the benefits of marijuana. Due to cannabis's placement in schedule 1 of controlled substances in both state and federal laws. Quoting from the Hawaii Medical Cannabis Law: https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2000/acts/Act228 SB862 HD1 .htm There is sufficient medical and anecdotal evidence to support the proposition that these diseases and conditions may respond favorably to a medically controlled use of marijuana. This lack of research is due to the funding of marijuana research being regulated by NIDA, the National Institute of Drug Abuse. NIDA's purpose is investigating the abuse potential of drugs, including cannabis, with focus solely on trying to prove the negatives of marijuana use. Since NIDA funds negative effects of marijuana research, research is granted on the flimsiest of theories and has corrupted and biased science. Forcing researchers to chase more NIDA grants for research to ensure they continue to have jobs. Negative research findings are promoted wildly by NIDA when they are published. Even if the methodology of the study is flawed beyond belief. Even when other researchers try to duplicate the results and fail, NIDA continues to promote the flawed study as though it still has merit. An example of this can be found on NIDA's website https://www.drugabuse.gov/news -events/nida -notes/2016/08/study-questions suggests that the twins' IQ was affected by factors that twins share in their genes or family background, rather than factors in which they differed (e.g., drug use). A further analysis, comparing the impact of marijuana use on fraternal versus identical twins, suggested that family -wide environmental influences are more decisive than genes for determining IQ trajectory. NIDA, without any evidence to back up the statement, goes on: These findings contrast but are not entirely inconsistent with those of an earlier study that linked teen-onset regular marijuana use to IQ deficits in the fourth decade of life (see Early -Onset, Regular Cannabis Use Is Linked to IQ Decline). The researchers say that although their evidence indicates that marijuana exposure does not cause persistent loss of intellectual function up to age 20, prolonged regular exposure for decades might do so. NIDA contradicts itself often, and continues to promote failed theories that bear no relationship to reality. Especially trying to say that marijuana is a gateway drug. https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research -reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway -drug These findings are consistent with the idea of marijuana as a \"gateway drug.\" However, the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, \"harder\" substances. A more sinister theory promoted by NIDA, the DEA, and even physicians is that marijuana use increases the risk of Schizophrenia. This is so unbelievable that it is a slap in the face of science. Simply looking at reality, the larger numbers of people using, or admitting to use of marijuana, the large number of registered medical cannabis patients in the USA (roughly 1,000,000 to 2,000,000) and the flat schizophrenia rates as reported by the NIH and WHO completely invalidate all peer -reviewed published research on the topic of marijuana causing schizophrenia. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/schizophrenia.shtml https://www.who.int/news -room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia In fact, a percentage of people diagnosed with schizophrenia use marijuana to reduce anxiety and help with symptoms. People with more severe schizophrenia use more marijuana, this is the basis for the theory that marijuana causes more severe symptoms of schizophrenia. Similar thinking is used against patients who have more severe pain, that marijuana somehow makes pain worse for patients and they have to use more marijuana to gain pain relief. Instead of the observable theory that people with more severe pain use more marijuana to treat their more severe pain than people who have less severe pain. No one makes the theory that aspirin makes pain worse, because people with more pain use more aspirin. Bad science. The whole point of a state medical marijuana law is that the federal government has engineered a catch-22 circular logic loop about marijuana. States, mostly via people's ballot initiatives have sideswiped the FDA in approving a medicine. This is because the FDA has adopted a policy of only endorsing and approving of monotherapies , e.g. one or two isolated and specific chemicals per approved medicine. There is another policy to reject crude botanical medicines due to variations from plant to plant. These comments by the FDA are found in the DEA response to a petition to reschedule marijuana to schedule 2 and in congressional testimony. Even if a company submitted an IND to the FDA to study marijuana for the treatment of a disease, it would be rejected by the FDA on both of those policies. The catch-22 comes when patients, nurses, physicians, governors, senators and representatives suggest that marijuana be investigated as a medicine. In congressional testimony, the FDA says we need more research before endorsing that. NIDA says we need more research before utilizing marijuana as a medicine. The DEA says we need more research before marijuana could be considered a medicine. So, if everyone agrees we need more research, where exactly is the research? Individual physicians have attempted to research the benefits of marijuana within universities. What happens is that, at every turn, approval to study is blocked, delayed and rejected. See for example the 10 years of trying to study medical marijuana for treatment of PTSD in veterans. https://www.stripes.com/marijuana-ptsd-study -concludes -after -10-years -of-planning-research-1.570986 Sisley and her team had to gain approval and support from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse to initiate the research - a process that lasted years. One study took several years just to begin. After NIDA provided marijuana for research that was full of seeds, stems and mold. https://health.hawaii.gov/medicalcannabisregistry/files/2017/08/Generalized -Anxiety -Disorder-0 8.09.17- Redacted.pdf The GAD petition submitted in 2017 included anecdotal evidence, peer -reviewed patient surveys, marijuana use reports and other information. It was rejected by the director due to not having enough peer -reviewed scientific research. One reason given for the rejection was that there was \"no specific evidence to GAD\". This is why exact specific conditions and waiting for peer -reviewed medical research will never work as an administrative rule for reviewing qualifying condition petitions. There will never be medical marijuana research that specifically mentions each of the hundreds of conditions that include anxiety as a symptom. Research studies are done with one drug and one condition. A rejection for not having a specific condition mentioned seems more like a pedantic nitpick and less like a legitimate reason when both GAD and anxiety share anxiety as the core symptom. This GAD petition rejection uses the same reason the federal government does not approve of medical marijuana. If this requirement barrier of peer -reviewed research was erected, no state would have a medical marijuana program. Due to the federal policies which are a de facto prohibition on research for medical marijuana benefits. These state medical marijuana programs were created because the federal government failed to do research, and continues to prohibit new research. While the reality is that cannabis is a non toxic medicine, has always been a medicine and always will be a medicine. Anxiety was also included with a bill in the Hawaii legislature to add qualifying conditions. The Department of Health testified, and in opposing the bill, the DOH stated it would rather include conditions via the petition process. The HDOH also gave another reason, that the dept wanted to delay adding the condition until dispensaries were active. Try naming another medication that is delayed and kept illegal because the department was waiting for a pharmacy to open. The DOH needs to stop these petty games played with sick people' s lives. (REF #95) https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2018/testimony/SB174 TESTIMONY CPH 02 -08-17.pdf This is another wrong-headed approach to the process, and ignores why and what the medical marijuana law does. Allow me to explain the purpose of the law and the role of the DOH in it. From the Hawaii medical cannabis law: The legislature is aware of the legal problems associated with the legal acquisition of marijuana for medical use. However, the legislature believes that medical scientific evidence on the medicinal benefits of marijuana should be recognized. ... Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to ensure that seriously ill people are not penalized by the State for the use of marijuana for strictly medical purposes when the patient's treating physician provides a professional opinion that the benefits of medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks for the qualifying patient. The whole point of the medical marijuana program is not to endorse, nor recommend medical marijuana to patients. The purpose of the law is to NOT PENALIZE patients using medical marijuana with recommendations from their physicians. To protect patients from the laws prohibiting the use of marijuana. Said another way, it is not the Department of Health's role to become the FDA and research medical marijuana. It is not the DOH's role to judge if medical marijuana is a medicine or not. It is not the DOH's role to decide which conditions marijuana is beneficial for either. That role is solely for a patient to decide if medical marijuana works for their conditions or not. Physicians have a role to make sure the patient's health is first priority over any medication. The DOH's only role in the petition process is to protect medical marijuana patients from arrest. People are currently illegally using marijuana to treat their conditions, specifically anxiety. The DOH has the power to protect these patients by adding qualifying conditions. Instead, the DOH has assumed the role of the FDA, denying petitions and opposing adding conditions legislatively. Waiting for peer -reviewed medical evidence that by all accounts is not coming within the next two decades. This delay and denial of the reality of medical marijuana patients conditions needs to stop. (3) Describe the extent to which the medical condition is generally accepted by the medical community as a valid, existing medical condition . For best results , please cite research , published evidence, or scientific findings AND attach a PDF copy to your submittal. Indicate specific Iines , page, section. Please use standard AMA format as outlined in the instructions. Anxiety is accepted by the medical community as a valid existing medical condition affecting millions of Americans each year. The CDC, NIH and Veterans Affairs all have in-depth websites dedicated to anxiety and treatment. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any -anxie ty-disorder.shtml The wide variety of anxiety disorders differ by the objects or situations that induce them, but share features of excessive anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Anxiety disorders can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, school work, and relationships. Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS -R), Figure 1 shows past year prevalence of any anxiety disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 or older.1 An estimated 19.1% of U.S. adults had any anxiety disorder in the past year. Past year prevalence of any anxiety disorder was higher for females (23.4%) than for males (14.3%). An estimated 31.1% of U.S. adults experience any anxiety disorder at some time in their lives. Anxiety affects a large portion of the people in the United States, costing billions of dollars in medical treatment costs. https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/basics/burden.htm Anxiety: Anxiety disorders, which include panic disorder, generalized anxiety disor der, post-traumatic stress disorder, phobias, and separation anxiety disorder, are the most common class of mental disorders present in the general population. The estimated lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder is over 15%, while the 12-month prevalence is more than 10%. Prevalence estimates of anxiety disorders are generally higher in developed countries than in developing countries. Most anxiety disorders are more prevalent in women than in men. One study estimated the annual cost of anxiet y disorders in the United States to be approximately $42.3 billion in the 1990s, a majority of which was due to non-psychiatric medical treatment costs. This estimate focused on short -term effects and did not include the effect of outcomes such as the inc reased risk of other disorders. Veterans suffer from Anxiety and related disorders. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15127904/ Results: Veterans of the first Gulf War reported a markedly higher prevalence of current anxiety disorders than nondeployed military personnel (5.9% vs. 2.8%; odds ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.3- 3.1), and their anxiety disorders are associated with co -occurring psychiatric disorders. Posttrauma tic stress disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder were each present at rates nearly twice expected. In our multivariate model, predeployment psychiatric treatment and predeployment diagnoses (posttraumatic stress disorder, depre ssion, o r anxiety) were independently associated with current anxiety disorder. Participation in Gulf War combat was independently asso ciated with current posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. (4) Describe the symptoms and other physiological or psychological effects experienced by an individual suffering from the medical condition or its treatment and the extent to which these symptoms and physiological or psychological effects are debilitating. Note :\"Debilitating\" generally means impairing the ability of a person to accomplish activities of daily living . For best results , please cite research , published evidence, or scientific findings AND attach a PDF copy to your submittal. Indicate specific lines, page, section. Please use standard AMA format as outlined in the instructions. Anxiety can cause a person to withdrawal from talking to other people or even going outside. Anxiety can diminish or completely debilitate a person from interviewing for a job, making day to day decisions, making personal relationships or thriving. Instead of dealing and treating anxiety, the world instead decided to call anxiety being an introvert. An \"introvert\" is a \"shy, reticent person\". In other words, a person who has so much anxiety that they would rather hide than speak to someone else. Shyness is anxiety. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/social -anxiety -disorder -more -than-just-shyness/index.shtml The reason this petition is for \"Anxiety\" and not \"social anxiety disorder\" is because each year there seems to be a newly named disorder with the core symptom being anxiety. Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Seasonal Affective disorder, PTSD. Anxiety is the common condition. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any -anxiety -disorder.shtml Any Anxi ety Disorder with Impairment Among Adults Of adults with any anxiety disorder in the past year, degree of impairment ranged from mild to severe, as shown in Figure 2. Impairment was determined by scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale. Among adults with any anxiety disorder, an estimated 22.8% had serious impairment , and 33.7% had moderate impairment.1 A majority of people with any anxiety disorder experienced mild impairment (43.5%).1 1. Harvard Medical School, 2007. National Comorbidity Survey (NCS). (2017, August 21). Retrieved from https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/index.php. Data Table 2: 12-month prevalence DSM -IV/WMH -CIDI disorders by sex and cohort. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181171/ Although the principal symptoms of anxiety disorders include fear, excessive worry, nervousness, and obsessions, a multitude of physical symptoms also may be present. These somatic symptoms \u2014which include heart palpitations, gastrointestinal problems, sweating, fainting, and chronic pain \u2014ca n confound the diagnosis and resist all forms of medical management, unless the underlying anxiety source is identified and treated. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can be expensive for the patient, physician, and society: unnecessary tests and ineffective treatments increase medical costs, and anxiety symptoms may lead to loss of income and productivity, financial dependence, and even suicide. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anxiety -disorder -symptoms 11 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders Many people experience anxiety at some point in their lives. In fact, anxiety is a very normal response to stressful life events like moving, changing jobs or having financial troubles. However, when symptoms of anxiety become larger than the events that triggered them and begin to interfere with your life, they could be signs of an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders can be debilitating, but they can be managed with proper help from a medical professional. Recognizing the symptoms is the first step. Here are 11 common symptoms of an anxiety disorder, as well as how to reduce anxiety naturally and when to seek professional help. 1. Excessive Worrying One of the most common symptoms of an anxiety disorder is excessive worrying. The worrying associated with anxiety disorders is disproportionate to the events that trigger it and typically occurs in response to normal, everyday situations ( 1Trusted Source ). To be considered a sign of generalized anxiety disorder, the worrying must occur on most days for at least six months and be difficult to control ( 2Trusted Source ). The worrying must also be severe and intrusive, making it difficult to concentrate and accomplish daily tasks. People under the age of 65 are at the highest risk of generalized anxiety disorder, especially those who are single, have a lower socioeconomic status and have many life stressors ( 3Trusted Source ). 2. Feeling Agitated When someone is feeling anxious, part of their sympathetic nervous system goes into overdrive. This kicks off a cascade of effects throughout the body, such as a racing pulse, sweaty palms, shaky hands and dry mouth ( 4). These symptoms occur because your brain believes you have sensed danger, and it is preparing your body to react to the threat . Your body shunts blood away from your digestive system and toward your muscles in case you need to run or fig ht. It also increases your heart rate and heightens your senses ( 5Trusted Source ). While these effects would be helpful in the case of a true threat, they can be debilitating if the fear is all in your head. Some research even suggests that people with anxiety disorders are not able to reduce their arousal as quickly as people without anxiety disorders, which means they may feel the effects of anxiety for a longer period of time ( 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source ). 3. Restlessness Restlessness is another common symptom of anxiety, especially in children and teens. When someone is experiencing restlessness, they often describe it as feeling \"on edge\" or having an \"uncomfortable urge to move.\" One study in 128 children diagnosed with anxiety disorders found that 74% reported restlessness as one of their main anxiety symptoms ( 8Trusted Source ). While restlessness does not occur in all people with anxiety, it is one of the red flags doctors frequently look for when making a diagnosis. If you experience restlessness on the majority of days for more than six months, it may be a sign of an anxiety disorder ( 9Trusted Source ). 4. Fatigue Becoming easily fatigued is another potential symptom of generalized anxiety disorder. This symptom can be surprising to some, as anxiety is commonly associated with hyp eractivity or arousal. For some, fatigue can follow an anxiety attack, while for others, the fatigue can be chronic. It's unclear whether this fatigue is due to other common symptoms of anxiety, such as insomnia or muscle tension, or whether it may be related to the hormonal effects of chronic anxiety ( 10Trusted Source ). However, it is important to note that fatigue can also be a sign of depression or other medical conditions, so fatigue alone is not enough to diagnose an anxiety disorder ( 11Trusted Source ). 5. Difficulty Concentrating Many people with anxiety report having difficulty concentrating. One study including 157 children and teens with generalized anxiety disorder found that more than two -thirds had difficulty concentrating ( 12Trusted Source ). Another study in 175 adults with the same disorder found that almost 90% reported having difficulty concentrating. The worse their anxiety was, the more trouble they had ( 13Trusted Source ). Some studie s show that anxiety can interrupt working memory, a type of memory responsible for holding short -term information. This may help explain the dramatic decrease in performance people often experience during periods of high anxiety ( 14Trusted Source , 15Trusted Source ). However, difficulty concentrating can also be a symptom of other medical conditions, such as an attention deficit disorder or depression, so it is not enough evidence to diagnose an anxiety disorder. 6. Irritability Most people with anxiety disorders also experience excessive irritability. According to one recent study including over 6,000 adults , more than 90% of those with generalized anxiety disorder reported feeling highly irritable during periods when their anxiety disorder was at its worst ( 16Trusted Source ). Compared to self -reported worriers, young and middle-aged adults with generalized anxiety disorder reported more than twice as much irritability in their day-to -day lives ( 17Truste d Source ). Given that anxiety is associated with high arousal and excessive worrying, it is not surprising that irritability is a common symptom. 7. Tense Muscles Having tense muscles on most days of the week is another frequent symptom of anxiety. While tense muscles may be common, it's not fully understood why they're associated with anxiety. It is possible that muscle tenseness itself increases feelings of anxiety, but it is also possible that anxiety leads to increased muscle tenseness, or that a third factor causes both. Interestingly, treating muscle tension with muscle relaxation therapy has been shown to reduce worry in people with generaliz ed anxiety disorder. Some studies even show it to be as effective as cognitive behavioral thera py (18Trusted Source , 19Trusted Source ). 8. Trouble Falling or Staying Asleep Sleep disturbanc es are strongly associated with anxiety disorders ( 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source , 23Trusted Source ). Waking up in the middle of the night and having trouble falling asleep are the two most commonly reported problems ( 24Trusted Source ). Some research suggests that having insomnia during childhood may even be linked to developing anxiety later in life ( 25Trusted Source ). A study following nearly 1,000 children over 20 years found that having insomnia in childhood was linked to a 60% increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder b y age 26 ( 26Trusted Source ). While insomnia and anxiety are strongly linked, it is unclear whether insomnia contributes to anxiety, if anxiety contributes to insomnia, or both ( 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source ). What is known is that when the underlying anxiety disorder i s treated, insomnia often improves as well ( 29Trusted Source ). 9. Panic Attacks One type of anxiety disorder called panic disorder is associated with recurring panic attacks. Pani c attacks produce an intense, overwhelming sensation of fear that can be debilitating. This extreme fear is typically accompanied by rapid heartbeat, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea and fear of dying or losing control ( 30Trusted Source ). Panic attacks can happen in isolation, but if they occur frequently and unexpectedly, they may be a sign of panic disorder. An estimated 22% of American adults will e xperience a panic attack at some point in their lives, but only about 3% experience them frequently enough to meet the criteria for panic disorder ( 31Trusted Source ). 10. Avoiding Social Situations You may be exhibiting signs of social anxiety disorder if you find yourself: Feeling anxious or fearful about upcoming social situations Worried that you may be judged or scrutinized by others Fearful of being embarrassed or humiliated i n front of others Avoiding certain social events because of these fears Social anxiety disorder is very common, affecting roughly 12% of American adults at some point in their lives ( 32Trusted Source ). Social anxiety tends to develop early in life. In fact, about 50% of those who have it are diagnosed by age 11, while 80% are diagnosed by age 20 ( 33Trusted Source ). People with social anxiety may appear extremely shy and quiet in groups or when meeting new people. While they may not appear distressed on the outside, inside they feel extreme fear and anxiety. This aloofness can sometimes make people with social anxiety appear snobby or standoffish, but the disorder is associated wit h low self -esteem, high self -criticism and depression ( 34Trusted Source ). 11. Irrational Fears Extreme fears about specific things, such as spiders, enclosed spaces or heights, could be a sign of a phobia. A phobia is defined as extreme anxiety or fear about a specific object or situation. The feeling is severe enough that it interferes with your ability to function normally. Some common phobias include: Animal phobias: Fear of specific animals or insects Natural environment phobias: Fear of natural events like hurricanes or floods Blood-injection-injury phobias: Fear of blood, injections, needles or injuries Situational phobias: Fear of certain situations like an airplane or elevator ride Agoraphobia is another phobia that involves fear of at least two of the following: Using publ ic transportation Being in open spaces Being in enclosed spaces Standing in line or being in a crowd Being outside of the home alone Phobias affect 12.5% of Americans at some point in their lives. They tend to develop in childhood or the teenage years and are more common in women than men ( 35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source ).

Sertraline The most common side effects of sertraline are: Sleepiness Nervousness Insomnia Dizziness Nausea Tremor Skin rash Constipation Upset stomach Loss of appetite Headache Diarrhea Abnormal ejaculation Decreased interest in sexual activity Dry mouth Increase in sweating, known as diaphoresis Weight loss Possible serious side effects of sertraline include: Irregular heartbeats Serious allergic reactions Worsening of depression Serotonin syndrome Hyponatremia Abnormal bleeding Priapism (prolonged erection) Decreased liver function Suicidality Activation of mania in patients with bipolar disorder Important side effects are irregular heartbeats, allergic reactions and activation of mania in patients with bipolar disorder. If sertraline is discontinued abruptly, some patients experience side effects such as: Abdominal cramps Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Headaches Lightheadedness Dizziness Diminished appetite Flu-like symptoms Sweating Chills Sleep disturbances Memory impairment A gradual dose reduction of sertraline is recommended when therapy is discontinued. Venlafaxine WARNING Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in short -term studies in children, adolescents, and young adults with depression and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of venlafaxine or any other antidepressant in a child or adolescent must balance this risk with the clinical need. Patients who are started on therapy should be closely observed for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Venlafaxine, like most antidepressants, can cause: Nausea Headaches Anxiety Insomnia Drowsiness Loss of appetite Other side effects that can occur are: Dizziness Ejaculation disorder Sweating Dry mouth Weight lo ss Increased blood pressure can occur, and blood pressure should be monitored. Seizures have been reported.

Selected quotes and transcribed tables are taken from the following research and presented below. 1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998228/ Ninety -seven per cent of respondents used cannabis primarily for chronic pain. Average pain improvement on a 0- 10 pain scale was 5.0 (from 7.8 to 2.8), which translates to a 64% relative decrease in average pain. Half of all respondents also noted relief from stress/anxiety , and nearly half (45%) reported relief from insomnia. Most patients (71%) reported no adverse effects, while 6% reported a cough or throat irritation and 5% feared arrest even though medical cannabis is legal in Hawai'i. No serious adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that Cannabis is an extremely safe and effective medication for many chronic pain patients. Cannabis appears to alleviate pain, insomnia, and may be helpful in relieving anxiety. Cannabis has shown extreme promise in the treatment of numerous medical problems and deserves to be released from the current Schedule I federal prohibition against research and prescription. 2. https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477 -7517-2-18 Approximately three quarters of participants (71%) claimed to have experienced a return of their symptoms or condition on stopping cannabis, especially: pain (53% of those who claimed areturn of symptoms), depression or anxiety (30%), insomnia (11%), spasm (10%) and nausea/vomiting https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2007.09.002 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the benefit of nabilone in pain management and quality of life improvement in 40 patients with fibromyalgia. There were significant decreases in the VAS, FIQ, and anxiety in the nabilone treated group at 4 weeks. There were no significant improvements in the placebo group. The treatment group experienced more side effects per person at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Nabilone appears to be a beneficial, well -tolerated treatment option for fibromyalgia patients, with significant benefits in pain relief and functional improvement. 4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2683812/ Thematic analysis revealed that these teens differentiated themselves from recreational users and positioned their use of marijuana for relief by emphasizing their inability to find other ways to deal with their health problems, the sophisticated ways in which they titrated their intake, and the benefits that they experienced. These teens used marijuana to gain relief from difficult feelings (including depression, anxiety and stress), sleep difficulties, problems with concentration and physical pain. 5. https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2011.587700 Of 1,746 patients, 37.8% self-reported therapeutic benefits from medical marijuana for anxiety. 16.9% of patients self-reported therapeutic benefits from medical marijuana for panic attacks. 6. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6117575 The results of the study showed a dramatic improvement in anxiety in the nabilone group when compared with placebo (P less than 0.001). Side effects reported were dry mouth, dry eyes, and drowsiness. Patients did not report any of the subjective \"altered state\" experience of marihuana. 7. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857739 Following Ethics Committee approval, HIV -positive individuals attending a large clinic were recruited into an anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire study. Up to one-third (27%, 143/523) reported using cannabis for treating symptoms. Patients reported improved appetite (97%), muscle pain (94%), nausea (93%), anxiety (85%). 8. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5101100/ Cannabidiol oil, an increasingly popular treatment of anxiety and sleep issues, has been documented as being an effective alternative to pharmaceutical medications. This case study provides clinical data that support the use of cannabidiol oil as a safe treatment for reducing anxiety and improving sleep in a young girl with posttraumatic stress disorder. 9. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24095000 Patients reported using cannabis to treat multiple symptoms, with sleep, pain, and anxiety being the most common. Cannabis was perceived to provide effective symptoms relief across medical conditions. Patterns of use were also consistent across medical conditions. Notable differences were observed with regard to modes of access. 10. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15184623/ Of 21 patients reporting stress, 20 said medical marijuana helped moderate-complete relief. Of 16 patients reporting mood, all 16 said medical marijuana helped moderate-complete relief. The symptoms reported by medical cannabis users to be most effectively relieved were stress, sleep, mood, stiffness/spasm, and pain. 11. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5312634/ Finally, preliminary clinical trials suggest that high-dose oral CBD (150- 600 mg per day) may exert a therapeutic effect for epilepsy, insomnia, and social anxiety disorder. Nonetheless, such doses of CBD have also been shown to cause sedation. 12. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5165161/ In addition, we have assessed the role of the cannabinoid system and marijuana constituents in neuroprotection as well as considered other beneficial effects of marijuana. Marijuana has been shown to improve nonmotor symptoms of PD such as depression, pain, sleep, and anxiety. Moreover, components of cannabis have been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effect due to their anti - inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiexcitotoxic properties. 13. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26317379 367 medical marijuana patients in Arizona were surveyed. 181 patients reported using medical marijuana to experience relief from Anxiety 164 patients reported using medical marijuana to experience relief from Stress. General relief from Anxiety symptoms was 82.9% and 87.2% for Stress, Relief by medical marijuana compared to other medications was 79.3% for Anxiety and 91.6 for Stress. Less frequent use of other medications was 85.9% for Anxiety and 79.1% for Stress. 14. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3285527/ One Hundred Canadian medical marijuana patients were surveyed in 2007-2008. 60.2% said they used medical marijuana to reduce anxiety. 15. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262744/ This exploratory study examined the patterns of medicinal cannabis use among a sample of 128 Australian adults who responded to media stories about this issue. Nearly one in ten (8%) reported no effect on depression or anxiety . More than one in ten (14%) specified that while cannabis could ease their symptoms and enabled them to cope, they realised that it could not cure their underlying condition. Approximately three quarters of participants (71%) claimed to have experienced a return of their symptoms or condition on stopping cannabis, especially: pain (53% of those who claimed a return of symptoms), depression or anxiety (30%) , insomnia (11%), spasm (10%) and nausea/vomiting or lack of appetite (9%). Almost two thirds (62%) of respondents claimed that they decreased or discontinued their use of other medicines when they started using cannabis medicinally. This was more common in males (65% vs. 58% of females) and older participants (aged 50 years +) (70% vs. 59% among younger participants). For some people this was a substantial change, representing a shift away from chronic, high-dose medication use. Perhaps not surprisingly, cannabis was typically perceived as superior to other medications in terms of undesirable effects, and the extent of relief provided . Thus, cannabis was rated to produce equivalent (8%) or worse side effects (3%) by a minority of therapeutic users. It was considered to work \"a bit\" or \"much better\" than other medicines, or to be the only source of relief, by more than three quarters (82%). 16. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189912 In regards to conditions, pain-related conditions were the most common, reported by 53% of participants (n = 144; chronic pain 36%; (n = 98), arthritis 12% (n = 32), headache 5% (n = 14)). The second most prominent class was mental health (eating disorder, PTSD & psychiatric disorder), reported by 15% (n = 41). Other prominent conditions included gastrointestinal disorders (11%, n = 29), insomnia (7%, n = 18) and multiple sclerosis (4%, n = 11). In regards to symptoms; the most highly endorsed were chronic pain (73%, n = 197), stress (60%,n=162), insomnia (57%, n = 155), depression (46%, n = 126) and headache (32%, n = 87). g astrointestinal (GI) issues also featured prominently, with 29% (n = 79) citing appetite loss and another 29% (n = 79) nausea. Cannabis was perceived to be very effective at symptom relief, with 95% (n = 257) reporting that it \"often\" or \"always\" helped alleviate their symptoms. 17. https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.12323 Participants presented with the range of conditions that is generally consistent with surveys of CTP users, the most prominent conditions being pain (32%), mood (i.e. anxiety and depression (18%), arthritis (15%), HIV (10%), gastrointestinal disorder (7%) 18. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5422566/ We previously reported in an earlier survey that of 1,429 respondents, 61% reported using cannabis for managing pain, 58% reported using cannabis for anxiety and 50% reported using cannabis for depression. In the current analysis, these same conditions were also the most commonly reported conditions by respondents. Of the 1,040 participants reporting pain and/or intractable pain, 619 (59.52%) reported depression and anxiety as comorbidities. As such, the odds of reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs were more than one and a half times greater (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.27- 2.16) among those reporting using it to manage pain, anxiety and depression than among those using it to manage only one of the three conditions. This team previously reported that in a survey of 1,429 medical cannabis users, 61% reported c annabis use for pain, 58% reported cannabis use for anxiety and 50% reported using cannabis to manage depression. In 2016, Dale and Stacey reported that those using cannabis for pain were more likely to be substituting for prescription drugs. In 2017, Walsh et al published a review of medical cannabis and mental health to try to better understand how medical cannabis use may impact areas of potential concern for clinicians. \"Relaxation and relief of anxiety\" and \"relief of negative mood\" or depression were among the most widely reported conditions in 60 publications included in their analysis. Because it is common for chronic pain patients to be prescribed combinatorial pharmacotherapy to address comorbidity with depression and/or anxiety, it is largely unknown how often patients may be discontinuing prescription medications when initiating cannabis use. Taken with preclinical data on the role of the endocannabinoid system in stress, pain processing and immune homeostasis, it is clear that future investigation is warranted using controlled trials with human subjects to better understand the role that cannabis may play in treating pain, anxiety, depression and other conditions. 19. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277530/ Most of the respondents (from the clinic and online groups) reported that cannabis improved their mood , pain, muscle spasms, and sleep. 20. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11210205 Of 628 Canadian medical marijuana patients: 463 patients reported using medical marijuana to treat anxiety. This article reports on an exploratory study of medical cannabis users. Interviews were completed with 50 self-identified medical cannabis users recruited through notices in newspapers and on bulletin boards. They reported using cannabis for a variety of conditions including HIV-AIDS-related problems, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, menstrual cramps, migraine, narcotic addiction as well as everyday aches, pains , stresses and sleeping difficulties. However, cannabis was also used to treat menstrual cramps, anorexia, narcotic addiction, migraine, Tourette's Syndrome, lupus, Grave 's Disease, epilepsy, retinitis, chemotherapy -induc ed l oss of appetite, Crohn 's Disease, arthritis and every day aches, pains, stresses and sleeping difficulties. Many reported benefits of cannabis were consistent with those reported elsewhere. Cannabis was typically used for its sedative, analgesic, antispasmodic, appetite stimulating, anticonvulsant and euphor ic properties. These properties were well known in the past century when cannabis was used to treat conditions that required medications with these properties. Although scientific evidence in favor of medical cannabis is limited (Gurley, Aranow & Katz 1998), self-treatment with cannabis could become popular as more users publicize their own experiences. This is especially so if the everyday aches and pains and psychological problems are promoted as medical reasons for using cannabis. 21. https://ww w.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2683812/ The use of marijuana to manage stress and anxiety was described by 12 teens in our sample. Dealing with bullying at school, heavy demands of school work, taxing shifts at work, and just \"giving as much as you can\" along side difficult relationships with parents or guardians, and receiving threats from neighbors all took its toll on these youth. For some, these experiences contributed to high levels of stress and anxiety, and for others uncomfortable levels of anger - both were difficult to manage. Although some had friends they could turn to, marijuana provided an additional source of stress relief that was ready at hand. \"Lots of people know me, know I do pot and they think that I'm a pot head but really the thing they don't realize is that I have a reason for it. It's for my stress and an antidepressant. I get really upset. It [pot] helps me feel better about myself, because you know people don't do that [help me], like my friend [name] can, but nobody else can.\" [Female, 14 years, non-daily use] There was general agreement among the teens that marijuana calmed them down, and helped them feel \"not so nervous\" and \"not so uptight about everything.\" One teen recognized, however, that despite the fact that marijuana could be a very effective stress reliever, it might not work for everyone: \"Well as far as pot goes, the good thing is that it's definitely a stress reliever, hands down. I know lots of people who would be just a complete wreck if they weren't smoking pot but then there's also people who are a complete wreck because they do smoke pot, so it's kind of a hard thing.\" [Male, 16 years, non-daily use] 22. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691841/ While the controversies surrounding cannabis are far from subdued (and are often permeated and masked by conflicting ideological credos), standardized studies on cannabinoids have highlighted that the psychological and behavioral outcomes of this substance are highly variable and range from relaxation, euthymia and heightened sociability to panic, paranoid ideation and psychosis [ 112 - 116 ]. A corollary of this observation is that the high comorbidity rate between cannabis use disorders and psychiatric conditions [ 100 - 105 ] may indicate that cannabis consumption is either a concurring cause or a \"self-therapeutic\" strategy for anxiety and mood disorders [ 117 - 123 ]. The latter interpretation is supported by the observation that anxiety -spectrum disturbances and traumas in early developmental stages are a strong predictor for later cannabis use disorders [ 124 - 127 ]; furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that the anxiolytic effects of THC may partially account for the high prevalence of cannabis use in patients affected by PTSD [ 128 - 131 ] and OCD [ 132 ]. Accordingly, recent clinical studies have shown that THC elicits therapeutic effects in OCD [ 133 ] and trichotillomania, an impulse-control disorder characterized by compulsive hair -pulling [ 134 ]. 23. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604171/ Overall, current evidence indicates CBD has considerable potential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders, with need for further study of chronic and therapeutic effects in relevant clinical populations. 24. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604174/ Although clinical studies in this area are difficult to do, even in countries where the use of cannabis has been allowed for years, there is a clear role for cannabis products in symptom management for these difficult conditions. 25. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22729452 RESULTS: Studies using animal models of anxiety and involving healthy volunteers clearly suggest an anxiolytic -like effect of CBD. Moreov er , CBD was shown to reduce anxiety in patients with social anxiety disorder. CONCLUSION: Future clinical trials involving patients with different anxiety disorders are warranted, especially of panic disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The adequate therapeutic window of CBD and the precise mechanisms involved in its anxiolytic action remain to be determined. 26. https://doi.org/10.2202/1941-2851.1017 1655 Patients reported using medical marijuana for these conditions: Anxiety disorders 18.7% of patients Applicants most frequently reported using medical marijuana for pain relief (82.6%), improved sleep (70.6%), and relaxation (55.6%) . The next most frequently reported benefits included relief of muscle spasms (41.3%), headache (40.8%), relief of anxiety (38.1%) , improved appetite (38.0%), relief of nausea and vomiting (27.7%), and relief of depression (26.1%). Half the applicants (50.8%) reported using marijuana as a substitute for prescription medication and 13.2% reported using marijuana as a substitute for alcohol. 27. https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07061016 Hence, it can be speculated that the anti -obsessive effect observed in our patients may have been a consequence of the glutamate modulation of the cannabinoid dronabi nol. 28. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349825/ The findings from the study indicate that cannabis use is associated with a subsequent changein positive affect, depres sive symptoms and manic symptoms over the course of daily life. No evidence for the use of cannabis to self- medicate minor fluctuations in negative affect or BD symptoms was revealed. Participants in the study were currently well and out of episode. Future research should explore whether the self- medication hypothesis is more relevant to individuals that are in the acute stages of depression or mania. This would be consistent with the broader self - medication hypothesis in BD where individuals have reported finding cannabis useful in the management of their symptoms. 29. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9692379 The authors present case histories indicating that a number of patients find cannabis (marihuana) useful in the treatment of their bipolar disorder. Some used it to treat mania, depression, or both. They stated that it was more effective than conventional drugs, or helped relieve the side effects of those drugs. One woman found that cannabis curbed her manic rages; she and her husband have worked to make it legally available as a medicine. Others described the use of cannabis as a supplement to lithium (allowing reduced consumption) or for relief of lithium's side effects. Another case illustrates the fact that medical cannabis users are in danger of arrest, especially when children are encouraged to inform on parents by some drug prevention programs. An analogy is drawn between the status of cannabis today and that of lithium in the early 1950s, when its effect on mania had been discovered but there were no controlled studies. In the case of cannabis, the law has made such studies almost impossible, and the only available evidence is anecdotal. The potential for cannabis as a treatment for bipolar disorder unfortunately can not be fully explored in the present social circumstances. 30. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898690/ Findings suggest that for some bipolar patients, marijuana may result in partial alleviation of clinical symptoms. Moreover, this improvement is not at the expense of additional cognitive impairment. 31. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17703715 Subjective reports by patients suggest an overall positive effect, but these may be unreliable. We herein report a case in which mood data was prospectively collected over two years of total substance abstinence and two years of extreme marijuana use. Marijuana use did not alter the total number of days of abnormal mood, however, marijuana was associated with an increase in the number of hypomanic days and a decrease in the number of depressed days. Whi le not conclusive, the data suggest that marijuana may indeed have an effect on mood in bipolar patients that needs to be systematically examined. 32. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5652027/ Cannabis use diminishes some of the adverse effects of neurological and psychiatric disorders. 33. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4323143/ These results suggest that cannabis use has clinical implications for the early course of BD (Bipolar Disorder) by increasing mood level. 34. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1368-5031.2005.00271.x Medicinal cannabis use was Reported by patients with chronic pain(25%), multiple sclerosis and depression (22% each), arthritis (21%) and neuropathy (19%).

Minnesota has undertaken the most comprehensive research on the medical cannabis patients in its medical cannabis program in the United States. Including surveys by both the patients and their physicians. Tracking which medical cannabis products they purchase, use and continue using to treat each qualifying condition. The Minnesota Department of Health publishes reports of the medical cannabis patients and how medical marijuana helps them with anxiety. In its first year of reports, the Minnesota DOH published patient comments about the beneficial effects of the medical marijuana. (REF #98) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/firstyearreport.html (REF #94) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/appendixa.pdf Many such comments are found within the above report. Further reports in the following years also track which patients under each condition report benefits of medical marijuana on anxiety. https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/omcreport.html https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/cohort.html (REF #93) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/cohort/2015_2016_benefitspse.pdf The patient self-evaluation is required for patients to complete prior to each medical cannabis purchase. It includes questions to assess symptom severity, some of which are administered to all patients (standard set of 8 symptom measures) and some of which are tailored to symptoms for a given condition (condition-specific symptom measures). Since symptom data is collected prior to each patient's first medical cannabis purchase, symptom changes can be assessed over time and compared to baseline (baseline = patient responses to symptom questions just prior to their first medical cannabis purchase) These reports are useful to show that medical marijuana patients find a greater than 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms, and a large percentage of patients continue to maintain that reduction of anxiety for 4 months.

I also had a Warning of illegal drug use in a urine test from the so called pain clinic I'm required to go to by [CLINIC]By my now ex primary Dr of 20 years. I told the pain clinic when I signed contract not to use illegal drugs that I took cannabis by prescription in medical form thru Dept of Health etc. The Dr said OK, as long as it wasn't in organic form for smoking! He said I was the 1st patient at [CLINIC]to be on legal cannabis. I advised him, I maybe to 1st but surely not the last patient. They said this will be resolved ok but I still was warned for illegal THC drug use, which is upsetting but it will be straightened out. Thank u! Massachusetts published a report on its medical marijuana patients and their benefits. (MBHS) A legisla tive mandate required the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to conduct a baseline study to investigate marijuana use in Massachusetts. The report published confirms the consensus that marijuana use improves mood and or mental health for a large percentage of people. Page 10: Among all respondents, 78% reported positive changes in their mood or mental health, and 67% reported improved physical health. In addition, 83% of respondents reported no negative outcomes/consequences related to their marijuana use. Page 148: Results from this survey suggest that respondents appear to be treating a wide range of medical conditions, and often more than one at a time. The top 5 medical conditions being treated were anxiety (60% or all respondents), chronic pain (46%), insomnia (43%), depression (42%), and stress (41%), and the average number of conditions being treated by medical marijuana is 4.7.

Richard P odolny M.D. James Berg, MD PO Box 371 Hawi , HI 96719 808-889-1822 Barefootmd@gmail.com Aloha, I am licensed medical doctor from the Big Island of Hawaii , board certi fied in both Family Medicine and Integrative Medicine. I have been in practice for over thirty years treating my clients with a reasonable balance between medical and natural approaches to healing. I co-direct a school of natural medicine called the Barefoot Doctors' Academy, a nonprofit organization operating continuously sinc e 1983, devoted to natural approaches to community medicine. In my career, I have been on the clinical teaching faculty of two medical schools, three traditional oriental medical colleges, two massage schools, and lecturer on scientifically oriented natural medici ne. I am writing this letter of support to three petitions submitted to the Hawaii Department of Health which adds depression, anxiety and insomnia to the medical qualification p ermitted f or medical cannabis certification. According to my records, I have taken care of over 6,000 patients in Hawaii who have used cannabis legally . I have taken their testimony, examined them, and followed up with many of them at least annually for the past 15 years. I have seen the medical cannabis program go through many changes , and would especially like to thank the D epartment of Health for their kind and skillf ul transformation of the Medical Cannabis Program since they took the helm from the Narcotics Enforcement Division. They have worked out many of the administrative kinks and have sincerely honored the clinical necessity of cannabis. A few years ago, the y expanded the list of medical qualificat ions, and recognized Post Traumatic Stress Diso rder as a qualification. Th at was the first psychological condition allowed to that da te. There are many conditions that cannabis is helpful for, but there are three conditions that cannabis is especially helpful for, yet even after twenty years of the program, dep ression, anxiety and insomnia remain off the qualification list . Cannabis has been labeled in the past as an \"euphoric agent\" because it relaxes people and helps them feel good. These days we call these kinds of medicines, \"antidepressants\" and \"anti-anxiety medicines\". Let me say emphatically, that I recognize that cannabis can cause the very same negative effects in some people. In my experience, at least 90% of my clients already know h ow cannabis helps their condition. They come and explain to me, their doctor, how it has helped them, and they seek certification so they can use this medicine legally . I want to testify that of all the conditions I have heard the greatest pra ise for the benefits of cannabis from my clients over the past fi fteen years, it has been for this medicine's help with sleep, anxiety and depression. Keeping them off the list seems medically ethical at this point. has laid out in detail, various scientific studies giving evidence beyond my anecdotal testimony for these three ailments. I want to support his petition. As a Medical Cannabis Specialist, I witness the answers to these studies every day in my practice. I believe that depression, anxiety and insomnia are the conditions most helped by cannabis. I hear, patient after patient, testifying to me how they can finally sleep the night through simply by sucking on a medicated lozenge; How one puff can avert a panic attack; How they finally feel bright spirited and motivated. Cannabis ha s been a true blessing for many of my patients with insomnia, anxiety or depression, who have been qualified by another condition that the state recognizes. Unfortunately, that list excludes those without severe pain, nausea, muscle spasms, e tc. Yet they still have a severe problem that they know is help ed by cannabis . Th at is self- evident in their experience. We do no t need more studies to prove to the m that they slept the night through, or didn't escalate into a panic attac k, or that they actually feel happy for the first time in a long time. They know it helps with minimal side effects and that is pr oof e nough to them. In this case, scien ce and politics needs to catch up with the clinical experience. As a practicing physician , I have seen medical cann abis be used far more safely than any pharma ceutical anti- depressant, anti - anxiety med , or sleeping pill commonly prescribed for insomnia, depression an d anxiety . One day, I predict that cannabis , or an an alogue , will be the medical standard for the first line of attac k for mild to moderate depression, anxiety and insomnia. I speak for th ese sincere patients who already know that canna bis helps them. Please recognize these patient's needs and add depression, anxiety and insomnia onto the list of recogni zed qualifications for medical cannabis certification.

I am a cannabis me dicine spe cialist. I went to Har vard Medical School and trained in Internal Medicine at the Brigham & Women 's Hospital in Boston. I have been in practice for over 25 years, the last nearly decade exclusively focused on cannabis medicine. I am president of the Association of Cannabis Specialists - an international professional organization, and I am an Instruc tor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. In Massachusetts, where I live and practice, we do not have qualifying conditions per se. We are afforded the freedom to treat patients who have any condition that is medically appropriate to treat with cannabis. I think this is an ideal approach that returns the ability and responsibility to follow the science and medical best practices to the physicians who are best able to judge that medical necessity . The literature on medical cannabis specifically for the indications of anxiety, depression, and insomnia is clear. These studies have been presented by the petitioner and I would be happy to address any questions about these that you may have. Cannabis can be very effectively used to treat all three of these problems. Dosing is the critical element dividing success or failure, particularly for these specific conditions. As with any medication, cannabis can be used successfully or it can be misused. Cannabis can be used in conjunction with many conventional medications to achieve better benefit than with either alone. I have personally treated thousands of patients with these specific illnesses, and the results are impressive. As a practical matter, to improve the outcomes for patients in HI, I would suggest greater requirement of clinicians to be specific about dosing and delivery methods, and absolute adherence by the dispensary agents to a clinician's treatment plan. 777 Concord Ave. Ste 104 Cambridge, MA 02138 800-645-0807 www.cannabis-specialists.org Please refer to the Association of Cannabis Specialists' website and the document entitled A Federal Framework of Regulation for Medical Cannabis Use which can equally well be applied to states' programs. I, and the medical literature, strongly support the addition of anxiety, depression, and insomnia to the list of conditions clinicians are able to treat with medical cannabis in HI. I urge you to add these conditions to the approved list.

Cannabis has been reported anecdotally as being beneficial for a number of common symptoms and complications in HIV infections, for example, poor appetite and neuropathy. This study aimed to investigate symptom management with cannabis. Following Ethics Committee approval, HIV-positive individuals attending a large clinic were recruited into an anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire study. Up to one-third (27%, 143/523) reported using cannabis for treating symptoms. Patients reported improved appetite (97%), muscle pain (94%), nausea (93%), anxiety (93%), paresthesia (85%). Many cannabis users (47%) reported associated memory deterioration. Symptom control using cannabis is widespread in HIV outpatients. A large number of patients reported that cannabis improved symptom control. J Pain Symptom Manage 2005;29:358-367. /L502622005 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This has increased the clinical focus on the management of chronic symptoms associated with both HIV and the side effects of antiretroviral medication. Recently, in small sample studies of HIV patients, the medici- nal use of cannabis has been documented as a treatment for varied symptoms.4-7 Symptoms associated with HIV occur as both direct and indirect consequences of the disease process and as a side effect of the antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of the disease. These symptoms include nausea and vomiting, pain (e.g., in a nerve distribution), reduced ap- petite, weight loss, headaches, diarrhea, constipation, anxiety, and depression. Flu-like symptoms and severe myalgia can result directlyVol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 359 Cannabis Use in HIV for Symptom Control from seroconversion early in the disease. Cen- tral pain and peripheral neuropathy can occur as a result of viral-mediated neurotoxicity, sec- ondary to either mitochondrial damage, demy- elination, or low B 12levels, all of which have been observed in patients with HIV. The inflam- mation that occurs as a result of the mito- chondrial damage can result in HIV-related encephalopathy or HIV-related colitis. Symp- toms may also occur secondary to infections or tumors, which have resulted from HIV-related immunosuppression. Examples of this include nausea and dysphagia from esophageal can- dida, or pain from a gastrointestinal lymphoma. Symptoms commonly occurring as a side effect of HIV treatment include renal colic from nephrolithiasis associated with the protease inhibitor, indinavir; painful from use of disturbances from the non- nucleoside inhibitor, efavirenz. Thus, a wide range of symptoms can significantly affect the quality of life of individuals living with HIV as a long-term chronic infection.8,9 It has been recognized that cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is now available as a licensed pharmaceu- tical preparation, can improve appetite and re- lieve nausea and vomiting.10Cannabis plant material not only contains THC but also other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), that may mitigate psychotic mood effects of THC.11 The aim of this study was to measure the patterns and prevalence of cannabis use in pa- tients presenting at a large HIV clinic and to evaluate its beneficial or detrimental effect on symptom control. Methods Subjects Following Ethics Committee approval, HIV- positive patients were recruited into an anony- mous cross-sectional questionnaire survey using a single center. The outpatient clinic provided a walk-in service as well as pre-arranged appoint- ments, including pharmacy and phlebo- tomy sections. All patients entering the clinic were asked to verbally consent to participate in the study. Written consent was not obtained in order to protect patient anonymity. The number of patients who refused to take partwas recorded. Many patients were regular clinic users, had discussed their symptoms with HIV and pain specialists, and were able to distin- guish between the various types of pain de- scribed on the questionnaire. A researcher was available to answer questions (e.g., on the inter- pretation of words). Patients completed the questionnaire while waiting and confidentiality was maintained by enumerating the papers without patient identification. Questionnaire The questionnaire was piloted to refine its content, word use, and format and then issued to patients attending the clinic. The question- naire (see Appendix) was designed to contain close-ended questions with defined yes/no or categorical responses. It was divided into sec- tions. The first included demographics (age, sex, number of years with HIV) and a vali- dated scale to measure degree of disability de- scribed by Sharrack and Hughes.12The second had specific questions concerning the patient's use of cannabis medically to treat symptoms of HIV. These symptoms included those directly related to HIV plus those resulting from their medication. Those who did not use cannabis for medicinal purposes, including those who used it solely for recreation, were not required to continue completing the questionnaire, al- though their demographic details were re- corded. The next section included questions relating to frequency, patterns, and reasons for cannabis use. Then in tabular form, a range of symptoms were listed ( Table 1 ), and against Table 1 Order of Symptom List in Questionnaire as Scored by Patients for Benefit or Detriment Lack of appetite Feeling sick (i.e., nausea) Tremor Depression Anxiety Weight loss Weakness Tiredness Vision dimness Slurred speech Memory loss Constipation Headaches Diarrhea Pain in muscles Nerve pain Tingling Numbness360 Vol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 Woolridge et al. each one, the patient was invited to score bene- fit or detriment as For the symptoms of pain and sensory changes, the questionnaire also contained 'body dia- grams', that is, pain maps, so that the patients could mark where they identified their nerve or muscle pain, tingling and numbness. Analysis Data from the questionnaires were entered into an Access database (Windows 98 version) and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 11.5, SPSS Inc., Chicago). Categorical data comparing the sex differences between the two groups and symptom severity were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test. Be- cause the distribution of age and the number of years with HIV were not normal and had some outliers, the differences in these variables between the two groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Both simple frequency analysis and the sign test were used in assessing the percentage improvement or deterioration in symptoms. Results A total of 523 questionnaires were completed from 565 patients approached. This was a 93% response rate. Of those who completed the study, 143 (27%) used cannabis to treat symp- toms associated with HIV. Physical Data The sex, age, years with HIV, disability, and cannabis user status are shown in Tables 2 and 3 .

Compared with females, males were statistically significantly likely to be cannabis users ( P/H11021 0.01) and those who had the disease for longer and were more disabled were also more likely to be users ( P/H110210.01). When nerve pain was reported on the pain map, it was experienced mainly in the legs, and less in the feet and hands (27, 19, and 15 pa- tients, respectively). Muscle pain was predomi- nantly localized to the legs, but also to the lower back, shoulders and neck (46, 19, and 19 pa- tients, respectively). Tingling and numbness was experienced in the periphery, with the hands and feet being affected (34 and 26 patients, respectively). Patient Choice of Route and Timing for Symptom Control Of the 143 patients who had used cannabis to treat HIV symptoms, 107 (75%) were current users. Within the whole group, smoking was the single route of administration in 101 (71%), and was combined with eating and drinking the plant in 39 (27%); ingestion was the only route in 3 (2%). On a day that cannabis was used, 50 patients (36%) would take it once, 33 (23%) twice, 23 (16%) three times, and 35 (24%) four or more times. Most patients (79/ 143 [55%]) were daily users and 15 (11%) used it weekly. Others reported intermittent adminis- tration during the week. Thus, all patients re- ported using cannabis at least once a week to relieve symptoms. Throughout the day, the majority of patients (91/143 [64%]) took cannabis after 6 p.m. andVol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 361 Cannabis Use in HIV for Symptom Control Table 3 Demographic Differences Between Users and Non-Users of Cannabis for Symptom Control Users n/H11005143 However, an overlapping group (66/143 [46%]) also reported use at any time if necessary. The reasons for taking the cannabis at these times were reported in a struc- tured format, as detailed in Table 4 . A number of reasons related to the time of administration, not least of which was recreational use together with medicinal use. Relief of symptoms of anxi- ety and depression was common, as was general symptom relief. The reported use for relaxation may reflect the time at which it was taken, namely, during the evening. Effect on Symptoms A lack of appetite was the most frequent symptom reported ( Table 5 ) and 97% experi- enced improvement with cannabis use. Pain was the next most frequent, being present in 45% of patients and improved in 94% of them. The collective results demonstrated statistically sig- nificant improvement in half or more patients in symptoms of nausea, anxiety, nerve pain, de- pression, tingling, numbness, weight loss, head- aches, tremor, constipation, and tiredness. Symptoms that were not improved included weakness and slurred speech, and statistically significant memory deterioration was recorded in 47% of users. Discussion The demographic characteristics of our cohort of patients (male:female, 11.2:1) is com- parable with the UK population of HIV-positive Table 4 Reasons for Using Cannabis Purpose n % Treat symptoms 77 54 Aid relaxation 121 85 Reduce anxiety 94 66 Relieve depression 75 52 Reduce symptom frequency 29 20 Increase energy levels 15 11 For a 'high' 62 43patients, which has a male:female ratio of 11.5:1. In addition, their ages and duration of HIV disease were comparable with the general UK data for such patients.13Our sample of 523 patients has the highest response rate and is the largest study of its kind. It com- pares with previous studies, which have had samples ranging from 72 subjects7to 442.6This detailed report of cannabis use for symptom control in a clinically significantly large group of patients can form the basis for more exten- sive investigations using purified and standard- ized cannabis extracts. Despite the fact that cannabis is still illegal, its use for medical purposes appears to be quite widespread. A report from the British Medical Association14stated \"many normally law abiding citizens\u2014probably many thousands in the veloped world\" use cannabis illegally for ther- apy. Wesner15reported from an anonymous mail survey of 123 HIV-positive patients in Honolulu that 36.9% of them used cannabis for therapeutic reasons. Approximately one- quarter of 228 HIV-positive men in the Sydney Men and Sexual Health study reported thera- peutic use of cannabis.16Thirty-two percent (32%) of 72 patients at a clinic in Alabama reported the medical use of marijuana.7These results are comparable to a more recent study carried out in Northern California, in which 33.3% of HIV-positive patients who responded to an anonymous mailed questionnaire used cannabis to treat symptoms associated with their disease.6Our study expanded these findings in a large city clinic population by focusing on the patient's perceived improvement or worsening of symptoms for which cannabis was considered the origin. The large number of patients using cannabis as medicinal therapy for symptoms related to HIV raises a number of issues. First, patients are being left with no alternative but to use a non-medical source of supply, which has the362 Vol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 Woolridge et al.

Second, if part of the plant material has therapeutic efficacy, the source of this material should be standardized and sub- jected to clinical trials so that safe and effective use is advocated. Third, the patient is unlikely to divulge cannabis use to their medical team, so that potential drug interactions with pre- scribed antiretroviral medications may be oc- curring. In addition, in this study, the number of purely recreational users was not determined so that the overall incidence of drug interac- tions may be far greater. The type of drug inter- actions to be considered include loss of cognitive function because it is well-recognized that this is an effect of both cannabis17and anti- retroviral drugs such as efavirenz.18Certainly, the loss of memory reported by these patients is of clinical significance, particularly in the methodological design of clinical trials, and if it is the result of combining preparations, this may be investigated using known standardized cannabinoid therapies. This approach may be one way to reduce additive effects and prevent patients being subject to the effects of unpre- dictable concentrations of illicit drugs. The positive responses to symptom control re- corded in this study, as exemplified in Table 5 , suggest that it is highly probable that canna- binoid medications have a medicinal role in this condition for a number of reasons. First, theyare reported by patients to improve appetite, reduce weight loss, and alleviate nausea.19-23 These effects have been recognized and synthetic THC (dronabinol) is licensed for use in the U.S. for this indication. However, no direct comparison has been attempted with a cannabis plant extract that will contain not only THC but also other cannabinoids, of which CBD is reputed to reduce the adverse effects of THC.24Secondly, pain relief appears to be significant in cannabis users, thereby suggesting a potential target for investigation in the use of cannabinoids as analgesics in HIV patients. Patients have reported various forms of pain with HIV, such as muscular and neuropathic pain, and these were characterized in the pain maps drawn by the patients. Currently available analgesic drugs have limited efficacy, particu- larly for neuropathic pain.25Clearly, there is a need to develop alternative analgesic agents, such as cannabinoids, to improve the choice of therapies. There is animal evidence that canna- binoids have analgesic effects that operate in models of hyperalgesia and allodynia, both indi- cators of discovery of the endogenous cannabinoid sys- tem has led scientists to explore the role of endocannabinoids in chronic pain models.28,29 However, in clinical practice the choice of natu- ral or synthetic phyto- or endo-cannabinoids for clinical trials is very limited. There have been several anecdotal and clinical trial reports thatVol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 363 Cannabis Use in HIV for Symptom Control cannabis plant extract and synthetic THC and related analogues produce pain relief in humans.30-33For this present select group of HIV patients, given the reported symptoms ex- perienced using cannabis plant material, there is a strong concern from the medical commu- nity managing these patients to limit adverse side effects from self-administered drugs and to provide cannabinoids in a formulation and dosing schedule that avoids harm to the patient. For example, there is strong evidence that the smoking route of administration of cannabis is not safe long-term because of the carcinogenic properties of a cannabis cigarette.34 A pattern of cannabis use emerges from this study that is regular, ongoing, and treats the symptoms of HIV patients to their satisfaction. Given the sedative properties of cannabis, it is important to assess whether evening dosing for cannabinoid therapies is more useful or appro- priate. Its sedative effects may be helpful at this time but none were reported as predominant. Presumably there is tolerance to these types of effects.29More importantly, reduction of pain, anxiety, and gastrointestinal upset appears to be the constellation of symptom control sought by these HIV patients, as shown in Tables 4 and 5 . In relation to HIV, there have been anecdotal reports35of patients who were already recre- ational users of cannabis reporting that it im- proved certain symptoms, such as loss of appetite and nausea, as well as pain and general well being. A small, uncontrolled study of 10 symptomatic AIDS patients reported that dro- nabinol might be effective in reducing nausea and increasing appetite.10Where patients are also medicating with antiretroviral agents, the combination of cannabis and protease inhibi- tors may be detrimental by altering viral loads. Thus, the effect of smoking on the viral load of HIV-infected patients was investigated by a short-term randomized placebo controlled trial.36No adverse effects of either therapy were measured with respect to RNA levels, CD4/H11001and CD8/H11001cell counts, or protease inhibitor levels. This brief trial suggests that there are no obvi- ous harmful effects, but these need to be deter- mined using an appropriate route of drug administration and a longer-term study. There is accumulating evidence that suggests that cannabinoids have therapeutic applica- tions in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases,such as multiple sclerosis,37,38Huntington's disease,39and brain injury.40So far, in terms of HIV, the evidence for therapeutic efficacy of cannabinoids is still mainly anecdotal. We have sought to establish if an improvement from can- nabis use, albeit self-administered and not standardized, is seen in symptoms such as pain, appetite, and nausea in a large sample of HIV patients. To do this, we expanded on previous research by determining specifically the variety and groups of symptoms that patients select to modify by their use of cannabis. We also secured a therapeutic timetable in order to predict the frequency of drug administration for the patient's selected symptoms. These results will be important in the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing conventional treatments to cannabis for symp- toms of HIV.

Case Presentation: These symptoms were present in our patient, a ten-year-old girl who was sexually abused and had minimal parental supervision as a young child under the age of five. Phar - maceutical medications provided partial relief, but results were not long-lasting, and there were major side effects. A trial of cannabidiol oil resulted in a maintained decrease in anxiety and a steady improvement in the quality and quantity of the patient's sleep. Discussion: Cannabidiol oil, an in - creasingly popular treatment of anxiety and sleep issues, has been documented as being an effective alternative to phar - maceutical medications. This case study provides clinical data that support the use of cannabidiol oil as a safe treatment for reducing anxiety and improving sleep in a young girl with posttraumatic stress disorder. INTRODUCTION Cannabidiol (CBD) oil is a naturally oc - curring constituent of industrial hemp and marijuana, which are collectively called cannabis. CBD oil is 1 of at least 85 can - nabinoid compounds found in cannabis and is popular for its medicinal benefits. After tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD oil is the second-most-abundant compo - nent cannabis. Other names for CBD oil, CBD oil, or CBD-rich cannabis oil. Con - sidered to be generally safe, CBD has been used medicinally for decades. However, CBD is not medical marijuana and should be distinguished from high-CBD strains of medical marijuana, which do contain THC, such as \"Charlotte's Web.\" The most abundant compound in can - nabis, THC is also a cannabinoid. The THC component induces the psychoac - tive effect, \"high.\" A cannabis plant has different amounts of CBD and THC depending on the strain and thus provides different recreational or medicinal effects. The cannabinoid profile of industrial hemp or medical marijuana is ideal for people looking for the medical benefits of CBD without the \"high\" of the THC. The mechanism of action of CBD is multifold.1-3 T wo cannabinoid receptors are known to exist in the human body: CB1 and CB2 receptors. The CB1 recep-tors are located mainly in the brain and modulate neurotransmitter release in a manner that prevents excessive neuronal activity (thus calming and decreasing anxiety), as well as reduces pain, reduces inflammation, regulates movement and posture control, and regulates sensory perception, memory, and cognitive func-tion. a2 An endogenous ligand, anan - damide, which occurs naturally in our bodies, binds to the CB1 receptors through the G-protein coupling system. CBD has an indirect effect on the CB1 receptors by stopping the enzymatic breakdown of anandamide, allowing it to stay in the sys-tem longer and provide medical benefits. 4 CBD has a mild effect on the CB2 recep-tors, which are located in the periphery in lymphoid tissue. CBD helps to mediate the release of cytokines from the immune cells in a manner that helps to reduce inflam - mation and pain. 2 Other mechanisms of action of CBD include stimulation of vanilloid pain recep - tors (TRPV-1 receptor), which are known to mediate pain perception, inflamma-tion, and body temperature. 5 In addition, CBD may exert its anti-anxiety effect by activating adenosine receptors which play a significant role in cardiovascular function and cause a broad anti-inflammatory effect throughout the body. 5 At high concentra - tions, CBD directly activates the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor, thereby conferring an antidepressant effect. 6 Cannabidiol has been found to be an antagonist at the po-tentially new third cannabinoid receptor, GPR55, in the caudate nucleus and puta - men, which if stimulated may contribute to osteoporosis. 7 Since the 1940s, a considerable number of published articles have dealt with the chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical effects of CBD. 8 The last de- cade has shown a notable increase in the scientific literature on CBD, owing to its identification for reducing nausea and vomiting, combating psychotic disorders, reducing inflammation, decreasing anxi-ety and depression, improving sleep, and increasing a sense of well-being. 9-12 Find- ings presented at the 2015 International Cannabinoid Research Society at its 25th Annual Symposium reported the use of CBD as beneficial for kidney fibrosis and inflammation, metabolic syndrome, over - weight and obesity, anorexia-cachexia syn-drome, and modification of osteoarthritic and other musculoskeletal conditions. 13-16 Although studies have demonstrated the calming, anti-inflammatory, and relaxing effects of CBD, clinical data from actual cases is minimal. This case study offers evidence that CBD is effective as a safe alternative treatment to traditional psy - chiatric medications for reducing anxiety and insomnia. 17 CASE PRESENTATION A ten-year-old girl presented in Janu - ary 2015 for a reevaluation of behaviors related to her diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) secondary to sexual Scott Shannon, MD, ABIHM, is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Fort Collins.

Her chief issues included anxiety, insomnia, outbursts at school, suicidal ideation, and self-destructive behaviors. Her grandmother, who has permanent custody of the patient and her younger brother, accompanied her. Our patient had been seen for an initial evaluation in January 2012 and received a diagnosis of PTSD secondary to sexual abuse on the basis of her history, clinical observations, and behaviors (Table 1). Her father had died 6 months earlier in a motor vehicle accident, and our patient's maternal grandparents became her perma - nent guardians. Before her father's death, our patient had no supervision from her father and very little supervision from her mother. An 11-year-old boy had molested her when she was 3 years old. Her medi - cal history included her mother having methadone addiction, alcoholism, bipolar disorder, and depression. Her mother used marijuana her entire pregnancy with the girl. The patient presented in January 2012 as displaying aggressive, disobedient, im - pulsive, and sexually inappropriate behav-iors. She also demonstrated low self-esteem and anxiety and had poor sleep (restless, interrupted, and unable to sleep alone). Workup during 2012 included labora - tory studies, which ruled out a thyroid dysfunction and an iron or vitamin D deficiency. The patient was started on a Table 1.

CBD = cannabidiol; DHEA = dehydroepiandrosterone; Permanente Journal/Perm J 2016 Fall;20(4):16-005 CASE REPORTSEffectiveness of Cannabidiol Oil for Pediatric Anxiety and Insomnia as Part of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Case Report regimen of 1 mg/night of melatonin, which helped her sleep duration. Three grams of inositol 3 times a day and 500 mg/d of eicosapentaenoic fish oil were also helpful in reducing her anxiety. A trial of cloni - dine was implemented, which resulted in hallucinations and thus was discontinued. The patient was switched to a regimen of 25 mg of imipramine at bedtime to de - crease her anxiety, which appeared to be helpful. Counseling sessions were started. The patient continued psychotherapy for 3 years, but she was not seen again in our clinic until the return visit in January 2015, when she was not receiving any of her medications and supplements. At the patient's return in January 2015, she demonstrated the same prominent symptoms as at her initial presentation. At that time, the initial treatment in - cluded the following supplements and medications to assist with her sleep and anxiety: melatonin, 5 25 mg/night. Our patient demonstrated slight gains but was still hav - ing outbursts at school and was reportedly difficult to manage at home. In addition, her underlying anxiety continued. Cannabidiol oil was explored as a po - tential additional treatment to help her insomnia and anxiety, but we deferred for two months while we waited for a response from other interventions. The grandmother preferred reducing the phar - macologic load given her granddaughter's failure to respond long term to psychiatric medications. In March 2015, CBD oil was recom - mended as a potential additional treatment to help her insomnia and anxiety, and her grandmother provided full informed consent. Our patient was administered the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children 18 and the Screen for Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED)19 before taking the CBD oil and each month afterward for the next 5 months. Test scores on the Sleep Distur- bance Scale for Children and Screen for Anxiety Related Disorders demonstrated an improvement (Table 2). A trial of CBD supplements (25 mg) was then initiated at bedtime, and 6 mg to 12 mg of CBD sublingual spray was administered during the day as needed for anxiety. A gradual increase in sleep quality and quantity and a decrease in her anxiety were noted. After 5 months, the patient was sleeping in her own room most nights and handling the new school year with no difficulties. No side effects were observed from taking the CBD oil. DISCUSSION Studies repeatedly recognize the preva- lence of an anxiety-provoked sleep disor - der after a traumatic experience.20 Our patient was definitely experiencing this phenomenon, which was aggravated by daily stressful activities. The main finding from this case study is that CBD oil can be an effective com- pound to reduce anxiety and insomnia secondary to PTSD. A review of the lit- erature suggests some benefits from the use of CBD because of its anxiolytic and sleep-inducing effects.9 Animal studies support use of this treatment and report that \" CBD may block anxiety-induced [rapid eye movement] sleep alteration via its anxiolytic effect on the brain.\" 21 The strength of this particular case is that our patient was receiving no phar - maceutical medications (other than non - prescription diphenhydramine) but only nutritional supplements and the CBD oil to control her symptoms. Her scores on the sleep scale and the anxiety scale consistently and steadily decreased during a period of 5 months (see Table 2). She was ultimately able to sleep through the night most nights in her own room, was less anxious at school and home, and dis - played appropriate behaviors. The patient's grandmother (her caregiver) reported: \"My granddaughter's behaviors are definitely better being on the CBD. Her anxiety is not gone, but it is not as intense and she is much easier to be around. She now sleeps in her own room most of the time, which has never happened before.\" Further study will need to be conducted to determine the permanency of our pa- tient's positive behaviors and how long she will need to continue taking the CBD oil. We do not have a reasonable foundation to recommend dosing from the scientific literature. However, in our experience, this supplement given 12 mg to 25 mg once daily appears to provide relief of key symptoms with minimal side effects. Our patient did not voice any complaints or discomfort from the use of CBD. We routinely asked about headache, fatigue, and change in appetite or agitation in ad - dition to conducting a routine psychiatric evaluation. Although CBD is considered generally safe, 17 the long-term effects are yet to be studied. The ultimate goal is to gradually taper her off the use of CBD oil and transition our patient into lifelong coping strategies such as yoga, meditation, and various other therapeutic activities. v a GW Pharmaceuticals is the founder of the Cannabinoid Research Institute, directed by Philip Robson, MD.

We report ndings from a large cross-sectional study of the use of CTP in Canada and compare use across medical conditions and across authorized and unauthorized users.Methods: We examined cannabis use history, medical conditions and symptoms, patterns of current use of CTP, modes of access and perceived effectiveness among 628 self-selected Canadians consumers of CTP. Participants were recruited from medical cannabis dispensaries and from organizations that assist users of CTP. Results: Patients reported using cannabis to treat multiple symptoms, with sleep, pain, and anxiety being the most common. Cannabis was perceived to provide effective symptoms relief across medical condi- tions. Patterns of use were also consistent across medical conditions. Notable differences were observed with regard to modes of access. Conclusion: Across medical conditions respondents reported using cannabis to effectively address diverse symptoms. Results indicate a substantial disconnect between the therapeutic use of cannabis and research on the risks and benets of such use; particularly with regard to the anxiolytic and sedative use of cannabis. Authorized and unauthorized users exhibited few meaningful differences with regard to med- ical conditions and patterns of use, but faced substantial differences regarding access. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Cannabis has a long history of medical use (Abel, 1980; Earleywine, 2005; Iverson, 2008 ), and after decades of marginal- ization the therapeutic properties of cannabis and cannabis derivatives are receiving increased attention (Earleywine, 2005; Holland, 2010; Lucas, 2008 ). Indeed, robust and growing evidence indicates that cannabis has medical benets for diverse conditions and an acceptable risk prole (Joy, Watson, & Benson, 2003 ). In response to legal recognition of the constitutional rights of Canadi- ans to access cannabis for therapeutic purposes (CTP), the federal government enacted the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations and Corresponding author.

This program authorizes two cat- egories of individuals to possess cannabis for medical purposes; Category 1 includes symptoms associated with HIV/AIDS, arthri- tis, spinal cord injury or disease, cancer, epilepsy, or MS, whereas Category 2 includes other symptoms and conditions assessed by a physician and a specialist. Those authorized can purchase dried cannabis from Health Canada, can purchase seeds to grow cannabis, or designate a person to grow cannabis on their behalf. In addition, medical cannabis dispensaries that operate under an ambiguous legal status provide CTP and related services to over 50,000 patients across Canada (Lucas, 2008 ). Despite widespread concern with the efciency of the Health Canada program (Holland, 2010 ), registration has grown expo- nentially from under 500 registrants in 2002 to over 26,000 in 2012 (Health Canada, 2012a ).

Walsh et al. / International Journal of Drug Policy xxx (2013) xxx - xxx suggest that 400,000 to 1,000,000 Canadians use CTP (Health Canada, 2011 ). Diverse reasons for use and multiple modes of access complicate the characterization of use of CTP, and health care professionals have expressed concern regarding the dearth of infor- mation on CTP; a recent Canadian Medical Association-sponsored survey reported that over 80% of physicians wanted more informa- tion on therapeutic indications, clinical guidelines, and risks and benets of CTP (CMA, 2012 ). Several studies have examined CTP use among Canadians. A regional survey reported that approximately 2% of adults used CTP in the past year, primarily to relieve nausea and pain (Braitstein et al., 2001 ), and a more recent national survey estimated that one million Canadians, or 4% of those aged 15 and older, used cannabis to treat self-dened medical conditions in the previous 12 months (Adlaf, Begin, & Sawka, 2005 ). Studies of persons liv- ing with HIV/AIDS report rates of 15-30% use of CTP, primarily for treatment of nausea, pain, and mood-related symptoms (Belle-Isle & Hathaway, 2007; Ware, Rueda, Singer, & Kilby, 2003 ). Studies of patients with MS and patients with chronic pain report simi- lar results; approximately 15% of respondents report use of CTP with high levels of perceived effectiveness for diverse symptoms including nausea, pain, and mood (Belle-Isle & Hathaway, 2007; Ware et al., 2003; Clark, Ware, Yazer, Murray, & Lynch, 2004 ). Stud- ies of CTP from the US, Europe, and Australia report ndings that are consistent with those of Canadian studies; CTP is perceived to be an effective treatment for symptoms including pain, nausea, and negative mood (Grotenherman & Schnelle, 2003; Dillon, 2005; Ware, Adams, & Guy, 2005 ). In sum, patient-centered research provides evidence for the acceptability and perceived effectiveness of CTP. However, sub- stantial knowledge gaps remain and health care professionals have explicitly called for further research to better specify the param- eters for appropriate use of CTP (CMA, 2012 ). Indeed, to date no studies have directly compared use of CTP across medical condi- tions or across modes of access (i.e., authorized vs. unauthorized). In the present study we report demographic characteristics, medi- cal conditions and symptoms, reasons for use, perceived effects, and authorized and unauthorized modes of accessing CTP among Cana- dians. Comparing users of CTP across symptoms and across medical conditions with regard to patterns of use, and perceived effective- ness may help direct future controlled studies of the efcacy of CTP for specic conditions, and inform the development of tailored CTP regimens. In addition, comparing authorized and unauthorized CTP users may elucidate factors that underlie patient adoption of the Canadian CTP program, and help to guide the renement of the complex process of CTP distribution and monitoring. Method Design We obtained cross-sectional data in 2011-2012 from 628 self- selected current CTP users. Participants were recruited from two contexts; national participants completed the survey online from the location of their choice, and local participants completed the survey at a cannabis dispensary in the Interior region of British Columbia (BC). This recruitment strategy was designed to allow for comparison of the relatively less controlled online national condi- tion with the conrmed CTP users queried in-person in the local condition. A total of 702 national participants completed the con- sent form, of whom 541(77%) reported current CTP use. All 87 local participants who completed the consent form reported current CTP use. The national survey was promoted via organizations and mediaTable 1 Demographics.

To preserve condentiality, no identifying data (i.e. IP addresses) were collected for national par- ticipants. The local group was comprised of dispensary members who were either authorized to possess cannabis through Health Canada or had documented conrmation of a medical condition for which CTP is indicated. No conrmation of medical condition was provided for national participants; however such conrmation is required to obtain Health Canada authorization and to obtain dispensary membership. Participants in the local group were com- pensated $10 and were aided by research assistants; participants in the national group were not assisted or nancially compensated. The survey was designed to be completed in less than one hour, and consisted of a total of 414 adaptive questions administered online without forced response. The survey was organized hierar- chically such that many items were contingent on prior responses; as a result, respondents were presented with diverse item sets and response rates for specic items, and total response times varied accordingly. The survey was developed based on previous research, and on consultations with a community research board comprised of CTP patients and experts, and includes questions drawn from a prior study of CTP use (Belle-Isle & Hathaway, 2007 ). It queried access, perceived effectiveness, patterns and history of cannabis use, medical diagnoses and symptoms, mood, and demographics (a copy of the survey is available upon request from the rst author). The study was approved by the Behavioural Research Ethics Board of the Okanagan campus of the University of British Columbia. All categorical data were compared using X2. In light of varying response rates across items, total number of responses is reported for each analysis. Due to the large number of comparisons all sig- nicance testing was conducted at the p < .01 level to minimize the likelihood of interpreting chance results while maintaining power (Nakagawa, 2004 ).

Note: Sleep Disorders, Attention Decit Disorder, Fibromyalgia, Hepatitis C, Parkinson's Disease, Wilson's Disease, Scleroderma, Tourette's Syndrome, and unspecied Psychotic Disorder Conditions each comprised less than 2% of the sample and were aggregated into the category 'Other'. The anxiety and mood disorders category included 35 participants who reported a primary illness/condition of anxiety, 34 who reported depression and 40 who reported both anxiety and depression. Comparisons of these groups indicated equivalent proles with regard to demographic characteristics, health, and use of CTP, and were therefore aggregated for statistical analyses; n = 502 * = difference between proportion Health Canada Authorized and Unauthorized p < 01. dispensary (n = 63) to national participants who reported BC resi- dency and accessing CTP via dispensary (n = 53). Analysis indicated no differences with regard to quantity or frequency of cannabis use, and indicated substantial similarity with regard to primary medi- cal condition; the only difference was a smaller proportion of local respondents reporting gastrointestinal (GI) condition as primary (X2= 8.94 (1), p < .01). This broad similarity between in-person con- rmed users of CTP (i.e. local ) and online respondents increased our condence in the validity of online responses. Demographics Comparisons of the sample to values drawn from the Cana- dian 2006 Census of Population (Statistics Canada, 2006 ; Table 1) indicated that male, White, and Aboriginal participants were over- represented. The users of CTP were also younger, had a higher income, and were more likely to have completed high school. The regional distribution was consistent with participation in the Health Canada program (Health Canada, 2012b ). Medical conditions and symptoms Participants were queried regarding a single primary condition treated with cannabis (Fig. 1). Participants also checked all applica- ble symptoms (Table 2) they treated with cannabis from a list. The mean number of symptoms patients endorsed treating was 6.74 (n = 605, SD = 3.00, Median = 6.00, Interquartile range = 4.00-8.00). Symptoms reportedly treated with CTP by fewer than 10% of the sample include high blood pressure (9%), tics (8%), regulating blood sugar (7%), seizures (6.%), bladder dyscontrol (6%) and impotence (6%). Aggregate examination across condition indicated that pain, anxiety, and sleep problems were the most frequently endorsedsymptoms; 57% reported use to address all three symptoms, and 99% endorsed treating one or more of the three. Symptoms treated with cannabis varied across condition (Table 2). Use to address pain symptoms was more prevalent among individuals whose primary conditions were pain-related (i.e., chronic spinal and non-spinal pain, arthritis). Chronic spinal pain participants were more likely to report treating muscle spasms. Participants with arthritis were more likely to report use for inflammation and ocular pressure, and less likely to report use to address anxiety and appetite. Participants who identied mood and anxiety disorders as their primary condition were more likely to use cannabis to address mental health-related symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, aggression, mania/psychosis), and were less likely to treat pain, inflammation, and muscle spasms. Participants who identied HIV/AIDS or GI as their primary conditions were more likely to treat symptoms of nausea and appetite, and HIV/AIDS was associated with less treatment of pain and aggression. Over- all, cannabis was perceived to provide effective symptoms relief; 72% (n = 439) reported that CTP was always helpful and an addi- tional 24% (n = 147) described it as often helpful. The proportion of participants who described CTP as always helpful was relatively consistent across conditions. The only difference across groups was relatively lower endorsement of always helpful (55%) by partici- pants with HIV/AIDS (X2= 10.04 (1), n = 593, p < .01). Over half (57%, n = 358) of participants reported using other medications to address the symptoms they were treating with CTP. Of these, 79% (n = 281) described CTP as having fewer side effects than the concurrent treatment. Use patterns History of non-therapeutic cannabis use prior to thera- peutic use was reported by 82% (n = 441) of participants.Please cite this article in press as: Walsh, Z., et al.

Mean age was 17.30 years (n = 540, SD = 7.08, Median = 16, Interquartile range = 14.00-18.00) for rst use and 28.35 years (n = 538, SD = 11.25, Median = 25, Interquartile range = 19.00-37.00) for rst therapeutic use. Individuals with and without history of non-therapeutic use did not differ with regard to demographic characteristics, or conditions and symptoms. Most participants who reported prior use reported increased use with the initiation of therapeutic use; 33% reported a large increase and 32% a small increase, whereas 7% reported a large decrease and 10% a small decrease. Aggregate analyses indicated that 40% (n = 167) of users fell into the modal quantity of use category of more than 14 grams per week , and that 42% (n = 226) fell in the modal frequency of use group reporting 2-3 uses per day. Among the group that used more that 14 grams per week, the median weekly amount used was 28 grams (Interquartile range = 21-45). Comparisons of the six medical conditions that each account for 5% or more of the sample (Table 3) indicated no difference with regard to modes of use and few differences in patterns of use; a larger proportion of individuals identifying HIV/AIDS as primary condition were among the groups with lowest quantity and frequency of use, and those who identied anxiety and/or depression as primary conditions were less likely to fall in the most frequent use group. Overall health quality was also associated with frequency of use such that participants who described their overall health as fair orpoor (34%, n = 161) were overrepresented in the most frequent use group (X2= 8.31 (1), n = 473, p < .01). Access Aggregate examination indicated that 32% (n = 167) of respon- dents had Health Canada authorization to possess CTP. An additional 12% (n = 64) had applications in process, and 3% (n = 13) had applied and been rejected. The proportion of authorized indi- viduals varied across condition (Fig. 1); individuals who identied anxiety and/or depression as primary condition were less likely to be authorized (X2= 13.13 (1), n = 502, p < .01), whereas a greater proportion of MS (X2= 11.08 (1), n = 502, p < .01) and GI (X2= 8.68 (1), n = 502, p < .01.) participants were authorized. Most partici- pants reported using more than one mode of accessing CTP; the mean number of access modalities was 1.89 (n = 500, SD = .88, Median = 2.00, Interquartile range = 1.00-2.00). Authorization was a determinant of access (Fig. 2): the mean number of access modalities for authorized individuals was 2.11 (n = 162, SD = .98, Median = 2.00, Interquartile range = 1.00-3.00) compared to 1.78 (n = 337, SD = .81, Median = 2.00, Interquartile range = 1.00-2.00) for unauthorized users (F (1, 497) = 16.26, p < .01). Authorized users were more likely to access CTP via Health Canada (X2= 11.88 (1), n = 443, p < .01), to grow for themselves (X2= 31.42 (1), n = 493, Table 3 Characteristics of cannabis use by condition.

Discussion Canadians use cannabis to treat diverse conditions and symp- toms in a manner that only partially overlaps with the federally authorized program. There is considerable consistency with regard to patterns of use and reported effectiveness; nearly all respon- dents used cannabis to treat pain, anxiety, or sleep disturbances, and over half used it to treat all three symptoms. We also observed consistency across participants with and without histories of non- therapeutic cannabis use, which suggests that, with regard to CTP, individuals who may enjoy non-therapeutic use of cannabis were not different with regard to therapeutic application of cannabis from those participants who may have been less likely to expect extra-therapeutic benet. The substantial minority of respondents who were federally authorized to possess cannabis exhibited few differences from unauthorized users with regard to symptoms treated and patterns of use, but differed considerably with regard to mode of access. Most respondents reported using CTP to treat conditions that are explicitly listed within the federal program; however, a large contingent also reported use for other conditions. Comparisons of symptoms treated across conditions indicated high levels of con- gruence (e.g., respondents with pain-related conditions were more likely to use cannabis to address pain symptoms), but also reflected substantial consistency across conditions. Specically, use to treat sleep disturbances, and to a lesser extent anxiety and depres- sion, was consistently high across conditions. However, despite widespread use for anxiolytic and sedative purposes, participants who reported anxiety or depression as primary reason for CTP use were less likely to have obtained federal authorization to access CTP. This may be due to the absence of these conditions among those explicitly listed by the federal program, but may also reflect accentuated stigma associated with the use of cannabis to address mental health issues. Indeed, stigma has been identied as asubstantial barrier to accessing care for mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety (Brown et al., 2010 ), and this may be compounded by the considerable stigma associated with use of CTP (Bottorf et al., 2013 ) to create a substantial barrier to accessing treatment. Research that further elucidates the appropriateness of using cannabis to treat anxiety and depression is required to guide effective treatment and help to reduce stigma. Patterns of use were also consistent across medical conditions, with the only notable difference being slightly lower levels of use among respondents with HIV/AIDS, a difference which may be due to intermittent use to address nausea. Most participants reported initiating non-therapeutic use prior to use of CTP, and noted increased levels of use associated with the transition to thera- peutic use. This reported increase is consistent with our observation that the median level of therapeutic use exceeds typical levels of non-therapeutic use (Reinarman, Cohen, & Kaal, 2004; Hazekamp et al., 2013 ; but see also Hazekamp & Heerdink, 2013 ), and sug- gests a potentially meaningful distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic use. In contrast, the relative consistency of use among CTP-users suggests that CTP regimens might transfer well across conditions, and enjoy good adherence. The most pro- nounced differences across respondents involved modes of access, such that unauthorized users were much less likely to access CTP from authorized, or semi-authorized (i.e. dispensaries) sources. This discrepancy contrasts with the pronounced similarity between authorized and unauthorized users on indicators of health and use of CTP, and suggests that the current system of authorization may not be discriminating among qualitatively different groups. The primary limitations of this study are common to online medical surveys such as potential for multiple responses from a single respondent, a potentially unrepresentative sample, and lack of physician conrmation of medical conditions. In addition, response bias related to participant self-selection, and recruit- ment through organizations that support medical cannabis patients likely resulted in overrepresentation in our sample by individ- uals who respond favourably to CTP. In light of this potential bias, our characterization of the therapeutic use of cannabis should be interpreted with caution pending replication from research that employs a more systematic recruitment approach. However, these limitations are counterbalanced by several methodologicalPlease cite this article in press as: Walsh, Z., et al.

Conclusions This was the largest and most comprehensive study to date of the therapeutic use of cannabis in Canada. We draw three primary conclusions from the data. First, reasons for use and perceived effectiveness were generally consistent across medical conditions; respondents overwhelmingly reported using cannabis to effectively address pain, sleep disturbance, and anxiety. Second, further research is required to address the substantial discon- nect between the therapeutic use of cannabis and research on the risks and benets of such use. This is particularly evident with regard to the anxiolytic and sedative use of cannabis; extrapo- lation from our sample to the national population of CTP users suggests levels of use for anxiolytic and sedative purposes that may be comparable to the number of Canadians who currently use benzodiazepine and other sedatives (Kassam & Patten, 2006 ). Such widespread use suggests a need for the systematic evaluation of the effectiveness and adverse effects of cannabis for the treat- ment of these conditions, as well as comparisons of cannabis with the widely-used pharmaceutical products that currently represent frontline treatments. Finally, our ndings highlight the apparent discrepancy in access to cannabis across CTP users. Authorized and unauthorized users exhibit few meaningful differences with regard to medical conditions and patterns of use, but face sub- stantial differences regarding access; many seriously ill Canadians (Bottorf, Bissell, Balneaves, Oliffe, Capler & Buxton, other negative outcomes asso- ciated with accessing cannabis from illegal markets. At the time of this writing the federal medical cannabis program is undergoing substantial structural changes. The present study provides a base- line for assessing the impact of these changes, the most important of which must surely involve providing a program that facilitates informed, safe, legal, and affordable access to a source of CTP for ill Canadians.

Clark, MD, FRCPC; M.A. Ware, FRCPC Abstract\u2014To estimate the patterns and prevalence of cannabis use among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 220 patients were surveyed in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Seventy-two subjects (36%) reported ever having used cannabis for anypurpose; 29 respondents (14%) reported continuing use of cannabis for symptom treatment. Medical cannabis use wasassociated with male gender, tobacco use, and recreational cannabis use. The symptoms reported by medical cannabisusers to be most effectively relieved were stress, sleep, mood, stiffness/spasm, and pain. NEUROLOGY 2004;62:2098-2100 Published reports spanning 100 years suggest that people with spasticity may experience relief withcannabis. 1The epidemiology of cannabis use among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is not well de-scribed. A recent postal survey (60% response rate)of 420 patients with MS from southern Alberta, Can-ada in 2000 estimated that 16% of patients had usedcannabis for therapeutic purposes. 2We report the results of a 2002 survey in which we evaluated thepatterns and prevalence of cannabis use in Halifax,Nova Scotia. Methods. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was de- signed to collect information on demographics (age, gender, years with MS, and medications used) and medicinal and recreationalcannabis use. Subjective cannabis effects were documented using5-point Likert scales on a range of symptoms, including spasticity,pain, mobility, sleep, and mood. Side effects experienced wererecorded. Information on doses used, means of administration,frequency, and duration of use was collected. In addition, strengthof commitment to use cannabis in the future was recorded. TheQueen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre Research Ethics Com-mittee approved the study protocol and questionnaire. A sample size of 144 was calculated to be sufficient to detect an estimated prevalence of 10% with a 2.5% standard error. To ac-count for 20% refusals and those who incorrectly filled in forms,we aimed to administer 175 questionnaires; 220 forms were pre-pared and administered at the study site. Data were double entered and validated using standard proce- dures by a central data management agency (GEREQ, Quebec,Canada). Missing values constituting /H110215% of the total were not included in summary statistics. Analyses were conducted usingstatistical software (Stata version 8.0, Houston, TX). Data are presented as summary statistics (means and medi- ans) as appropriate. Ordered categorical data (e.g., degree of reliefand severity of side effects) were summarized as proportions (e.g.,number of patients indicating moderate to complete relief com-pared with total responses). The prevalence and patterns of can-nabis use were estimated and analyzed by cross-tabulating theresponses from medicinal cannabis users and others with respectto demographic characteristics. Continuous normally distributeddata were compared using Student's t-test. Categorical data werecompared using Pearson /H9273 2tests. Ordered categorical data were analyzed using Mantel-Haenzel tests. Significance was set at the95% level, and all tests were two sided. Results. Two hundred five questionnaires were returned (93% response rate). The demographic characteristics of the subjects are shown in table 1. Subjects are showncategorized by their medicinal cannabis use status. Ever-use of cannabis for medical purposes was found to be sig-nificantly associated with male gender (p /H110050.03), use of tobacco (p /H110210.001), and recreational use of cannabis ( p/H11005 0.009). Perceived effects and side effects. The 34 medical users rated the overall effectiveness of cannabis; more than halfof these subjects reported cannabis as being very effective(2, not effective; 2, slightly; 10, somewhat; and 20, veryeffective). The perceived effectiveness of cannabis on indi-vidual symptoms is shown in table 2. Cannabis use wasreported to reduce the number of doses of routine medica-tion taken by 14 subjects, whereas 19 reported that canna-bis had no effect on the number of doses of routinemedication used. Of the 34 medical cannabis users, 15 reported no overall side effects, 10 reported very mild side effects, 8 reportedmoderate side effects, and 1 reported strong side effects.No subject reported severe side effects. The most commonside effect was \"high,\" which was reported by 24 subjects,followed by drowsiness by 20, dry mouth by 14, paranoiaby 3, anxiety by 3, and palpitations by 3.

No subject stated that symptoms got worse withcannabis use. Patterns of cannabis use. Of 34 medical cannabis us- ers, 15 reported only rare use, whereas 7 reported weeklyuse, 4 reported daily use, and 8 reported use more thanonce per day. Seventeen subjects had used cannabis in thepast 24 hours; 4 had used in the past week; 3 had used inthe past month; 5 had used in the past year; and 5 had notused in more than a year. Thirty-two subjects gave information on single-dosesize: the most common was an entire joint (14 subjects);three or four puffs at a dose was reported by 13 subjects;and one to two puffs was reported by 4 subjects. One sub-ject stated that he smoked more than one joint per dose. Ofthe 12 who consumed cannabis orally, 11 stated that theyused/H110211 g at each dose. The most common time of use was at night (29 subjects), followed by late afternoon (22), earlyafternoon (8), before noon (7), and morning (6). Discussion. This survey demonstrates a preva- lence of current medicinal cannabis use among pa- tients seeking treatment at the MS clinic in NovaScotia of 14%. This is consistent with data recentlypublished from Alberta, Canada, which found a cur-rent use prevalence of 16%. 2Medical use is report- edly effective for pain, stress, sleep, mood, andmuscle spasm, consistent with reports from theUnited Kingdom and the United States, 3as well as Canada.2The use of cannabis for stress and anxiety is reported in other populations, such as patientswith HIV/AIDS and chronic noncancer pain, and em-phasizes the need to better address these symptomsin clinical practice. 4 Clinical trials of cannabinoids in MS have not been consistent in demonstrating beneficial effects.One small randomized controlled trial in 13 patientswith MS found that doses of tetrahydrocannabinol(THC) /H110227.5 mg reduced patient reports of spasticity compared with placebo. 5Reductions in tremor6andTable 1 Demographic characteristics of 205 patients with multiple sclerosis by cannabis use VariableMedical cannabis use Ever, n /H1100534 Never, n /H1100577 Missing, n /H1100594 Total pValue n% n % n % n % Age in years 0.1 /H1134945 years 23 21 43 39 45 40 111 56 /H1102245 years 11 12 32 36 45 51 88 44 Gender 0.04 Male 10 30 13 39 10 30 33 16 Female 24 14 63 37 82 49 169 84 Tobacco use /H110210.001 Yes 24 39 21 34 16 26 61 30 No 9 6 55 39 76 54 140 70 Duration of MS 0.7 /H1134910 years 17 15 43 39 51 46 111 56 /H1102210 years 17 20 32 37 38 44 87 43 Use of medication for pain/ mood/sleep/spasms0.5 Yes 22 18 44 37 53 45 119 59 No 12 15 31 38 39 48 82 41 Recreational use of cannabis 0.009 Yes 19 26 53 72 2 3 74 36 No 14 19 53 89 3 8 131 64 Missing 1 1 5 5 89 94 Table 2 Self-reported effects of cannabis on multiple sclerosis symptoms by 34 medicinal cannabis users Symptom nNone-mild reliefModerate-complete relief Stress 21 1 20 Sleep 18 1 17Stiffness 17 1 16Mood 16 0 16Spasm 15 1 14Pain 12 2 10Weight loss 5 1 4 June (1 of 2) 2004 NEUROLOGY 62 2099pendular nystagmus7during cannabis smoking have also contrast, cannabis (1.54% THC) increased pos- tural tracking errors among 10 patients with MS and 10 healthy control subjects, especially in the patientswith MS. 8In a recent randomized controlled trial of 16 patients comparing an oral cannabis extract withoral THC and placebo, cannabinoid treatment didnot reduce spasticity or improve subjectiveimpressions. 9 A large randomized controlled trial (n /H11005660) re- cently compared the effects of oral cannabis extractswith pure oral THC and placebo. The study found nodifference with respect to the primary outcome mea-sure (modified Ashworth score) but did note signifi-cant subjective improvements in pain, spasm, andsleep. 10 In the meantime, patients with MS continue to use cannabis to manage their symptoms. What canwe learn from these patients? First, that pain andspasticity are not the only reasons for use, and theeffects of cannabis on mood, sleep, and stress areimportant areas of therapeutic need and should beaddressed in clinical trials. Second, there is a widevariance in doses used. Our study found doses rang-ing from single puffs to /H110221 g at a time. This may be explained in part by different potencies of availablecannabis, with lower-potency preparations requiringlarger doses, or by variation between individuals intolerability or symptom severity. Clinical trials ofcannabis for MS will need to include early dose-finding phases and allow for considerable intersub-ject variability in dose adjustments. Third, cannabisappears to be well tolerated, although some subjectsexperienced intolerable side effects and deteriorationof symptoms. Access to cannabis emerged as an im-portant obstacle in the use of this drug for medicalpurposes. In conclusion, the current study found that pa- tients with MS use cannabis for a range of symp-toms. Health care providers should ask about, and beprepared to discuss, the use of this drug with theirpatients. Coupled with emerging evidence regardingthe subjective effectiveness of cannabis on MS symp-tomatology, further exploration of the utility of can-nabinoids in MS is warranted. References 1.

Controversies surrounding legal, ethical, and societal implica - tions associated with use; safe administration, packaging, and dispensing; adverse health consequences and deaths attributed to marijuana intoxication; and therapeutic indications based on limited clinical data represent some of the complexities associ - ated with this treatment. Marijuana is currently recognized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's (DEA's) Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act (Controlled Substances Act) of 1970 as a Schedule I controlled substance, defined as having a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medici - nal use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety data for use of the treatment under medical supervision.1 Cannabis is the most commonly cultivated, trafficked, and abused illicit drug worldwide; according to the World Health Organization (WHO), marijuana consumption has an annual prevalence rate of approximately 147 million individuals or nearly 2.5% of the global population.2 In 2014, approximately 22.2 million Americans 12 years of age or older reported current cannabis use, with 8.4% of this population reporting use within the previous month.3,4 General cannabis use, both for recreational and medicinal purposes, has garnered increas - ing acceptance across the country as evidenced by legislative actions, ballot measures, and public opinion polls; an October 2016 Gallup poll on American's views on legalizing cannabis indicated that 60% of the population surveyed believed the substance should be legalized.5 Further, a recent Quinnipiac University poll concluded 54% of American voters surveyed would favor the legalization of cannabis without additional constraints, while 81% of respondents favored legalization of cannabis for medicinal purposes. 6 Limited data suggest that health care providers also may consider this therapy in certain circumstances.7-9 In the United States, cannabis is approved for medicinal use in 28 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico as of January 2017.10 The use and acceptance of medicinal cannabis continues to evolve, as shown by the growing number of states now permitting use for specific medical indications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has considered how it might support the scientific rigor of medicinal cannabis claims, and the review of public data regarding safety and abuse potential Dr. Bridgeman is a Clinical Associate Professor at the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, in Piscataway, New Jersey, and an Internal Medicine Clinical Pharmacist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE Cannabis is a plant-based, or botanical, product with origins tracing back to the ancient world. Evidence suggesting its use more than 5,000 years ago in what is now Romania has been described extensively.13 There is only one direct source of evidence (6-tetrahydrocannabinol [6-THC] in ashes) that cannabis was first used medicinally around 400 ad.14 In the U.S., cannabis was widely utilized as a patent medicine during the 19th and early 20th centuries, described in the United States Pharmacopoeia for the first time in 1850. Federal restriction of cannabis use and cannabis sale first occurred in 1937 with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act.15,16 Subsequent to the act of 1937, cannabis was dropped from the United States Pharmacopoeia in 1942, with legal penalties for possession increasing in 1951 and 1956 with the enactment of the Boggs and Narcotic Control Acts, respectively, and prohibition under federal law occurring with the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.1,17,18 Beyond criminalization, these legislative actions contributed to creating limitations on research by restricting procurement of cannabis for academic purposes. In 1996, California became the first state to permit legal access to and use of botanical cannabis for medicinal pur - poses under physician supervision with the enactment of the Compassionate Use Act. As previously stated, as of January 1, 2017, 28 states as well as Washington, D.C., Guam, and Puerto Rico will have enacted legislation governing medicinal cannabis sale and distribution; 21 states and the District of Columbia will have decriminalized marijuana and eliminated prohibition for possession of small amounts, while eight states, including Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia, will have legalized use of marijuana for adult recreation. 10,19 THE MEDICINAL CANNABIS DEBATE As a Schedule I controlled substance with no accepted medicinal use, high abuse potential, concerns for dependence, and lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision\u2014 along with a national stigma surrounding the potential harms and implication of cannabis use as a gateway drug to other substances\u2014transitioning from a vilified substance to one with therapeutic merits has been controversial. The United States Pharmacopoeia and the FDA have considered the complexities Disclosures: The authors report no commercial or financial interests in regard to this article.

Like some herbal preparations or supplements, however, medicinal cannabis may similarly pose health risks associated with its use, including psychoactive, intoxicating, and impairing effects, which have not been completely elucidated through clinical trials. Proponents argue that there is evidence to support botani - cal medicinal cannabis in the treatment of a variety of conditions, particularly when symptoms are refractory to other therapies; that beneficial cannabinoids exist, as evidenced by single-entity agents derived from cannabis containing the compounds THC and cannabidiol (CBD); that cannabis is relatively safe, with few deaths reported from use; that therapy is self-titratable by the patient; and that therapy is relatively inexpensive compared with pharmaceutical agents.20-22 Opponents of medicinal can- nabis use argue, in part, that well-designed randomized trials to confirm benefits and harms are lacking; that it has not been subject to the rigors of the FDA approval process; that standardization in potency or quantity of pharmacologically active constituents is absent; that adverse health effects relate not only to smoking cannabis but to unmasking mental health disorders, impairing coordination, and affecting judgment; that standardization does not exist for product packaging and controls to prevent inadvertent use by minors or pets; that there is a potential for dependence, addiction, and abuse; and that costs pose a potential burden. 23-25 Regardless of personal views and perceptions, to deny or disregard the implications of use of this substance on patient health and the infrastructure of the health care system is irre- sponsible; clinicians must be aware of these implications and informed about how this therapy may influence practice in a variety of health care settings, including acute care. PHARMACOLOGY Endocannabinoids (eCBs) and their receptors are found throughout the human body: nervous system, internal organs, connective tissues, glands, and immune cells. The eCB system has a homeostatic role, having been characterized as \"eat, sleep, relax, forget, and protect.\"26 It is known that eCBs have a role in the pathology of many disorders while also serving a protective function in certain medical conditions.27 It has been proposed that migraine, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and related conditions represent clinical eCB deficiency syndromes (CEDS). Deficiencies in eCB signaling could be also involved in the pathogenesis of depression. In human studies, eCB system deficiencies have been implicated in schizophrenia, multiple scle - rosis (MS), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, anorexia, chronic motion sickness, and failure to thrive in infants.28 The eCB system represents a microcosm of psycho- neuroimmunology or \"mind-body\" medicine. The eCB system consists of receptors, endogenous ligands, and ligand metabolic enzymes. A variety of physiological processes occur when can - nabinoid receptors are stimulated. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is the most abundant G-protein-coupled receptor. It is expressed in the central nervous system, with particularly dense expression in (ranked in order): is in non-neuronal cells, such as adipocytes and hepatocytes, connective and musculoskeletal tissues, and the gonads. CB2 is principally associated with cells governing immune function, although it may also be expressed in the central nervous system. The most well-known eCB ligands are released demand from cell membrane phospholipid precursors. This \"classic\" eCB system has expanded with the discovery of secondary receptors, ligands, and ligand metabolic enzymes. to different extents, as ligands at GPR55, GPR18, GPR119, and several transient receptor potential ion channels (e.g., TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPA1, TRPM8) that have actions similar to capsaicin.28 The effects of AEA and 2-AG can be enhanced by \"entourage com - pounds\" that inhibit their hydrolysis via substrate competition, and thereby prolong their action through synergy and augmen - tation. Entourage compounds include N-palmitylethanolamide (PEA), N-oleoylethanolamide (SEA), and cis-9-octadecenoamide (OEA or oleamide) and may represent a novel route for molecu - lar regulation of endogenous cannabinoid activity.29 Additional noncannabinoid targets are also linked to canna - bis. G-protein-coupled receptors provide noncompetitive inhibi - tion at mu and delta opioid receptors as well as nor epinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Ligand-gated ion channels create allosteric antagonism at serotonin and nicotinic receptors, and enhance activation of glycine receptors. Inhibition of calcium, potassium, and sodium channels by noncompetitive antagonism occurs at nonspecific ion channels and activation of PPAR and PPAR at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors is influenced by AEA. 30 THC is known to be the major psychoactive component of cannabis mediated by activation of the CB1 receptors in the central nervous system; however, this very mechanism limits its use due to untoward adverse effects. It is now accepted that other phytocannabinoids with weak or no psychoactivity have promise as therapeutic agents in humans. The cannabinoid that has sparked the most interest as a nonpsychoactive component is CBD.31 Unlike THC, CBD elicits its pharmacological effects without exerting any significant intrinsic activity on CB1 and CB2 receptors. Several activities give CBD a high potential for therapeutic use, including antiepileptic, anxiolytic, anti- psychotic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. CBD in combination with THC has received regulatory approvals in several European countries and is under study in registered trials with the FDA. And, some states have passed legislation to allow for the use of majority CBD preparations of cannabis for certain pathological conditions, despite lack of standardiza - tion of CBD content and optimal route of administration for effect.32 Specific applications of CBD have recently emerged in pain (chronic and neuropathic), diabetes, cancer, and neuro-Medicinal Cannabis: History, Pharmacology, and Implications for the Acute Care P&T \u00ae March 2017 Vol. 42 No. 3Medicinal Cannabis: History, Pharmacology, and Implications for the Acute Care Setting Within the shifting legal landscape of medical cannabis, different methods of cannabis administration have impor - tant public health implications. A survey using data from Qualtrics and Facebook showed that individuals in states with medical cannabis laws had a significantly higher likelihood of ever having used the substance with a history of vaporizing marijuana (odds ratio [OR], 2.04; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-2.58) and a history oral administration of edible mari- juana (OR, 1.78; 99% CI, 1.39-2.26) than those in states without such laws. Longer duration of medical cannabis status and higher dispensary density were also significantly associated with use of vaporized and edible forms of marijuana. Medical cannabis laws are related to state-level patterns of utilization of alternative methods of cannabis administration. 34 DRUG INTERACTIONS Metabolic and pharmacodynamic interactions may exist between medical cannabis and other pharmaceuticals. Quantification of the in vitro metabolism of exogenous a significant role in the primary metabolism of THC and CBN, whereas 2C19 and 3A4 and may be responsible for metabolism of CBD.40 Limited clinical trials quantifying the effect of the exogenous cannabinoids on the metabolism of other medications exist; however, drug interaction data may be gleaned from the prescribing information from cannabinoid-derived pharma ceutical products such - taining THC and CBD resulted in an increase in the maximum serum concentration and area under the curve for both THC and CBD by 1.2-fold to 1.8-fold and twofold, respectively; coadministration of rifampin is associated with a reduction in THC and CBD levels.40,41 In clinical trials, dronabinol use was not associated with clinically significant drug interactions, although additive pharmacodynamic effects are possible when it is coadministered with other agents having similar physi- ological effects (e.g., sedatives, alcohol, and antihistamines may tricyclic antidepressants, stimulants, and tachycardia).41 Additionally, smoking cannabis may increase theophylline metabolism, as is also seen after smoking tobacco. 40,42 ADVERSE EFFECTS Much of what is known about the adverse effects of medic- inal cannabis comes from studies of recreational users of marijuana.43 Short-term use of cannabis has led to impaired short-term memory; impaired motor coordination; altered judgment; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses.44 Long- term or heavy use of cannabis, especially in individuals who begin using as adolescents, has lead to addiction; altered brain development; cognitive impairment; poor educational outcomes (e.g., dropping out of school); and diminished life satisfaction.45 Long-term or heavy use of cannabis is also associ - ated with chronic bronchitis and an increased risk of chronic psychosis-related health disorders, including schizophrenia and variants of depression, in persons with a predisposition to degenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease. Animal studies indicate that a high dose of CBD inhibits the effects of lower doses of THC. Moreover, clinical studies suggest that oral or oromucosal CBD may prolong and/or intensify the effects of THC. Finally, preliminary clinical trials suggest that high-dose oral CBD (150-600 mg per day) may exert a therapeutic effect for epilepsy, insomnia, and social anxiety disorder. Nonetheless, such doses of CBD have also been shown to cause sedation.33 PHARMACOKINETICS AND ADMINISTRATION The three most common methods of administration are inhalation via smoking, inhalation via vaporization, and inges- tion of edible products. The method of administration can impact the onset, intensity, and duration of psychoactive effects; effects on organ systems; and the addictive potential and negative consequences associated with use.34 Cannabinoid pharmacokinetic research has been challeng- ing; low analyte concentrations, rapid and extensive metabo-lism, and physicochemical characteristics hinder the separa- tion of compounds of interest from biological matrices and from each other. The net effect is lower drug recovery due to adsorption of compounds of interest to multiple surfaces.35 The primary psychoactive constituent of marijuana\u20149-THC\u2014 is rapidly transferred from lungs to blood during smoking. In a randomized controlled trial conducted by Huestis and colleagues, THC was detected in plasma immediately after the first inhalation of marijuana smoke, attesting to the efficient absorption of THC from the lungs. THC levels rose rapidly and peaked prior to the end of smoking.36 Although smoking is the most common cannabis administration route, the use of vaporization is increasing rapidly. Vaporization provides effects similar to smoking while reducing exposure to the byproducts of combustion and possible carcinogens and decreasing adverse respiratory syndromes. THC is highly lipophilic, distributing rapidly to highly perfused tissues and later to fat. 37 A trial of 11 healthy subjects administered 9-THC intravenously, by smoking, and by mouth demonstrated that plasma profiles of THC after smoking and intravenous injection were similar, whereas plasma levels after oral doses were low and irregular, indicating slow and erratic absorption. The time courses of plasma concentrations and clinical \"high\" were of the same order for intravenous injection and smoking, with prompt onset and steady decline over a four-hour period. After oral THC, the onset of clinical effects was slower and lasted longer, but effects occurred at much lower plasma concentrations than they did after the other two methods of administration. 38 Cannabinoids are usually inhaled or taken orally; the rectal route, sublingual administration, transdermal delivery, eye drops, and aerosols have been used in only a few studies and are of little relevance in practice today. The pharmaco kinetics of THC vary as a function of its route of administration. Inhalation of THC causes a maximum plasma concentration within minutes and psychotropic effects within seconds to a few minutes. These effects reach their maximum after 15 to 30 minutes and taper off within two to three hours. Following oral ingestion, psychotropic effects manifest within 30 to 90 minutes, reach their maximum effect after two to three hours, and last for about four to 12 hours, depending on the dose.39 Vol. 42 No. 3 March 2017 P&T \u00ae 183Medicinal Cannabis: History, Pharmacology, and Implications for Care Setting such disorders.46-48 Vascular conditions, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack, have also been associated with cannabis use.49-51 The use of cannabis for management of symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and MS, has provided data related to impaired cognition in these individuals.52,53 A systematic review of published trials on the use of medical cannabinoids over a 40-year period was conducted to quantify adverse effects of this therapy. 54 A total of 31 studies evaluat- ing the use of medicinal cannabis, including 23 randomized controlled trials and eight observational studies, was included. In the randomized trials, the median duration of cannabinoid exposure was two weeks, with a range between eight hours and 12 months. Of patients assigned to active treatment in these trials, a total of 4,779 adverse effects were reported; 96.6% (4,615) of these were not deemed by authors to be serious. The most common serious adverse effects included relapsing MS (9.1%; 15 events), vomiting (9.8%; 16 events), and urinary tract infections (9.1%; 15 events). No significant differences in the rates of serious adverse events between individuals receiving medical cannabis and controls were identified (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.78-1.39). The most commonly reported non- serious adverse event was dizziness, with an occurrence rate of 15.5% (714 events) among people exposed to cannabinoids.54 Other negative adverse effects reported with acute cannabis use include hyperemesis syndrome, impaired coordination and performance, anxiety, suicidal ideations or tendencies, and psychotic symptoms, whereas chronic effects may include mood disturbances, exacerbation of psychotic disorders, can- nabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, and neuro cognitive impairments, as well as cardiovascular and respiratory condi- tions.52 Long-term studies evaluating adverse effects of chronic medicinal cannabis use are needed to conclusively evaluate the risks when used for an extended period of time. MEDICINAL USES Cannabis and cannabinoid agents are widely used to alleviate symptoms or treat disease, but their efficacy for specific indica - tions is not well established. For chronic pain, the analgesic effect remains unclear. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted examining cannabinoids in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain, including smoked cannabis, oro mucosal extracts of cannabis-based medicine, nabilone, dronabinol, novel analogue.55 Pain con- ditions included neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed chronic pain. Fifteen of the 18 included trials demonstrated a significant analgesic effect of cannabi- noids compared with placebo. Cannabinoid use was generally well tolerated; adverse effects most commonly reported were mild to moderate in severity. Overall, evidence suggests that cannabinoids are safe and moderately effective in neuropathic pain with preliminary evidence of efficacy in fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. 55 While there is not enough evidence to suggest routine use of medicinal cannabis for alleviating chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting by national or international cancer societ - ies, therapeutic agents based on THC (e.g., dronabinol) have been approved for use as an antiemetic in the United States for a number of years. Only recently has the efficacy and safety of cannabis-based medicines in managing nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy been evaluated. In a review of 23 random - ized, controlled trials, patients who received cannabis-based products experienced less nausea and vomiting than subjects who received placebo.56 The proportion of people experiencing nausea and vomiting who received cannabis-based products was similar to those receiving conventional antiemetics. Subjects using cannabis-based products experienced side effects such as \"feeling high,\" dizziness, sedation, and dysphoria and dropped out of the studies at a higher rate due to adverse effects com - pared with participants receiving either placebo or conventional antiemetics. In crossover trials in which patients received cannabis-based products and conventional antiemetics, patients preferred the cannabis-based medicines. Cannabis-based medi - cations may be useful for treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that responds poorly to conventional antiemetics. However, the trials produced low to moderate quality evidence and reflected chemotherapy agents and antiemetics that were available in the 1980s and 1990s. With regard to the management of neurological disorders, including epilepsy and MS, a Cochrane review of four clinical trials that included 48 epileptic patients using CBD as an adjunct treatment to other antiepileptic medications concluded that there were no serious adverse effects associated with CBD use but that no reliable conclusions on the efficacy and safety of the therapy can be drawn from this limited evidence. 57 The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has issued a Summary of Systematic Reviews for Clinicians that indicates oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing patient-reported spasticity scores and central pain or painful spasms when used for MS.58 THC is probably effective for reducing patient-reported spasticity scores but is likely ineffective for reducing objective measures of spasticity at 15 weeks, the AAN found; there is limited evi - dence to support the use of cannabis extracts for treatment of Huntington's disease, levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease, or reducing tic severity in Tourette's.58 In older patients, medical cannabinoids have shown no efficacy on dyskinesia, breathlessness, and chemotherapy- induced nausea and vomiting. Some evidence has shown that THC might be useful in treatment of anorexia and behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia. The most common adverse events reported during cannabinoid treatment in older adults were sedation-like symptoms. 59 Despite limited clinical evidence, a number of medical condi - tions and associated symptoms have been approved by state legislatures as qualifying conditions for medicinal cannabis use. Table 1 contains a summary of medicinal cannabis indica - tions by state, including select disease states and qualifying debilitating medical conditions or symptoms. 10,60,61 The most common conditions accepted by states that allow medicinal cannabis relate to relief of the symptoms of cancer, glaucoma, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and MS. A total of 28 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico now allow comprehensive public medical marijuana and cannabis programs.10 The National Conference of State Legislatures uses the following criteria to determine if a program is comprehensive: 1.

Access to marijuana through home cultivation, dispensa - ries, or some other system that is likely to be implemented; 3. Allows a variety of strains, including more than those labeled as \"low THC;\" and 4. Allows either smoking or vaporization of some kind of marijuana products, plant material, or extract. Some of the most common policy questions regarding medical cannabis now include how to regulate its recommendation and indications for use; dispensing, including quality and standard - ization of cultivars or strains, labeling, packaging, and role of the pharmacist or health care professional in education or administration; and registration of approved patients and providers. REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS The regulation of cannabis therapy is complex and unique; pos - session, cultivation, and distribution of this substance, regardless of purpose, remain illegal at the federal level, while states that permit medicinal cannabis use have established individual laws and restrictions on the sale of cannabis for medical purposes. In a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice memorandum to all U.S. attorneys, Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole noted that despite the enactment of state laws authorizing marijuana pro - duction and sale having a regulatory structure that is counter to the usual joint efforts of federal authorities working together with local jurisdictions, prosecution of individuals cultivating and distributing marijuana to seriously ill individuals for medicinal purpose has not been identified as a federal priority.62 There are, however, other regulatory implications to con - sider based on the federal restriction of cannabis. Physicians cannot legally \"prescribe\" medicinal cannabis therapy, given its Schedule I classification, but rather in accordance with state laws may certify or recommend patients for treatment. Medical cannabis expenses are not reimbursable through government medical assistance programs or private health insurers. As previ - ously described, the Schedule I listing of cannabis according to federal law and DEA regulations has led to difficulties in access for research purposes; non practitioner researchers can register with the DEA more easily to study substances in Schedules II-V compared with Schedule I substances.63 Beyond issues related to procurement of the substance for research purposes, other limitations in cannabis research also exist. For example, the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California-San Diego had access to funding, marijuana at differ - ent THC levels, and approval for a number of clinical research trials, and yet failed to recruit an adequate number of patients to conduct five major trials, which were subsequently canceled.64 Unforeseen factors, including the prohibition of driving during the clinical trials, deterred patients from trial enrollment. The limited availability of clinical research to support or refute thera - peutic claims and indications for use of cannabis for medicinal purposes has frequently left both state legislative authorities and clinicians to rely on anecdotal evidence, which has not been subjected to the same rigors of peer review and scrutiny as well-conducted, randomized trials, to validate the safety and efficacy of medicinal cannabis therapy. Furthermore, although individual single-entity pharmaceutical medications, such as dronabinol, have been isolated, evaluated, and approved for use Medicinal Cannabis: History, Pharmacology, and Implications for the Acute Care Setting by the FDA, a plant cannot be patented and mass produced by a corporate entity.65 Despite this limitation, some corporations, including GW Pharmaceuticals, are mass producing cannabis plants and extracting complex mixtures or single cannabinoids for clinical trials.65 The complex pharmacology related to the numerous substances and interactions among chemicals in the cannabis plant coupled with environmental variables in cultiva - tion further complicate regulation, standardization, purity, and potency as a botanical drug product. RELEVANCE TO HOSPITAL PRACTITIONERS Although the public has largely accepted medicinal cannabis therapy as having a benefit when used under a provider's supervi - sion, the implications of the use of this substance when patients transition into the acute care setting are additionally complex and multifaceted. The Schedule I designation of cannabis causes hospitals and other care settings that receive federal funding, either through Medicare reimbursement or other federal grants or programs, to pause to consider the potential for loss of these funds should the federal government intercede and take action if patients are permitted to use this therapy on campus. Similarly, licensed practitioners registered to certify patients for state medicinal cannabis programs may have comparable concerns regarding jeopardizing their federal DEA registrations and ability to prescribe other controlled substances as well as jeopardizing Medicare reimbursements. In 2009, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommended that enforcement of federal marijuana laws not be a priority in states that have enacted medicinal cannabis programs and are enforcing the rules and regulations of such a program; despite this, concerns persist. The argument for or against the use of medicinal cannabis in the acute care setting encompasses both legal and ethical considerations, with the argument against use perhaps seeming obvious on its surface. States adopting medical cannabis laws may advise patients to utilize the therapy only in their own residence and not to transport the substances unless absolutely necessary.66 Further, many acute care institutions have policies prohibiting smoking on facility grounds, thus restricting the smoking of cannabis, regardless of purpose or indication. Of note, several Canadian hospitals, including Montreal's Jewish General Hospital and Quebec's Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, have permitted inpatient cannabis use via vaporization; the pharmacy departments of the respective institutions control and dispense cannabis much like opioids for pain. Canada has adopted national regulations to control and standardize dried cannabis for medical use.67,68 There are complicated logistics for self-administration of medicinal can - nabis by the patient or caregiver; in particular, many hospitals have policies on self-administration of medicines that permit patients to use their own medications only after identification and labeling by pharmacy personnel. The argument can be made that an herb- or plant-based entity cannot be identified by pharmacy personnel as is commonly done for traditional medicines, although medicinal cannabis dispensed through state programs must be labeled in accordance with state laws. Dispensing and storage concerns, including an evaluation of where and how this product should be stored (e.g., within the pharmacy department and treated as a controlled substance, by security personnel, or with the patient); who should admin - Vol. 42 No. 3 March 2017 P&T \u00ae 187ister it, and implications or violations of federal law by those administering treatment; what pharmaceutical preparations should be permitted (e.g., smoked, vaporized, edible); and how it should be charted in the medical record represent other logistical concerns. Inpatient use of medicinal cannabis also carries implications for nursing and medical staff members. The therapy cannot be prescribed, and states may require physicians authorizing patient use to be registered with local programs. In a transition into the acute care setting from the community setting, a different clinician who is not registered could be responsible for the patient's care; that clinician would be restricted in ordering continuation of therapy. Despite the complexities in the logistics of continuing medici - nal cannabis in the acute care setting, proponents of palliative care and continuity of care argue that prohibiting medicinal can - nabis use disrupts treatment of chronic and debilitating medical conditions. Patients have been denied this therapy during acute care hospitalizations for reasons stated above.69 Permission to use medicinal cannabis in the acute care setting may be depen - dent on state legislation and restrictions imposed by such laws. Legislation in Minnesota, as one example, has been amended to permit hospitals as facilities that can dispense and control cannabis use; similar legislative actions protecting nurses from criminal, civil, or disciplinary action when administering medical cannabis to qualified patients have been enacted in Connecticut and Maine.70-73 Proposed legislation to remove restrictions on the certification of patients to receive medicinal cannabis by doctors at the Department of Veterans Affairs was struck down in June; prohibitions continue on the use of this therapy even in facilities located in states permitting medicinal cannabis use.74 CONCLUSION Despite lingering controversy, use of botanical cannabis for medicinal purposes represents the revival of a plant with historical significance reemerging in present day health care. Legislation governing use of medicinal cannabis continues to evolve rapidly, necessitating that pharmacists and other clini - cians keep abreast of new or changing state regulations and institutional implications. Ultimately, as the medicinal cannabis landscape continues to evolve, hospitals, acute care facilities, clinics, hospices, and long-term care centers need to consider the implications, address logistical concerns, and explore the feasibility of permitting patient access to this treatment. Whether national policy\u2014particularly with a new presidential administra - tion\u2014will offer some clarity or further complicate regulation of this treatment remains to be seen. REFERENCES 1.

Introduction Marijuana, the crude product (dried flowers, stems, seeds, and leaves) derived from the cannabis sativa plant, consists of more than 85 phytocannabinoids [1, 2]. The term phy- tocannabinoids Among WhileCBD is a nonpsychoactive anxiolytic, andneuroprotective the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and receptor 2 (CB2). Unlike 9-THC,CBDhasantagonistic/inverseagonisticpropertyat CB1 receptor and appears to modulate 9-THC-associated side effects including anxiety, tachycardia, and hunger [3]. CBD also appears to potentiate the effect of endocannabi- noids by inhibiting their inactivation, thereby alleviating psychoticsymptom[6].Despite the placement of marijuana in the schedule 1 categoryundertheUSFederalControlledSubstanceAct[7]and the US Federal Government's continued opposition onits legalization, 24 states and Washington DC have enactedlaws allowing marijuana to treat certain medical conditions[8]. The range and types of disease conditions for whichmedical marijuana have been approved vary from state tostate. The most common disease conditions approved by thestates /_0053), is a schedule III drug, which is indicated in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis as well as anorexia associatedwith weight loss in AIDS patients. A synthetic cannabinoid,nabilone (Cesamet /_0053) ,i sas c h e d u l eI Id r u gt h a ti si n d i c a t e d for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated withcancer chemotherapy. Another cannabinoid, Cannabidiol(Epidiolex /_0053), is in a clinical for the treatment of drug- resistantepilepsyinchildren[9].Aphytocannabinoidprepa-ration, nabiximols (Sativex /_0053), has been approved for theHindawi Publishing Corporation Parkinson's Disease Volume 2016, Article ID 1279042, 19 pages http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/12790422 Parkinson'sDisease treatmentofspasticityduetomultiplesclerosisinanumber of countries States. Nabiximols is anextractof Cannabissativa LthatconsistsofmainlyTHCand CBD[10,11]. Although recent studies have provided strong evidence for the therapeutic benefit of medical marijuana [12-16], increasingaccesstocannabisand/orcannabinoidscanresult in side effects such as addiction, respiratory illness, andd e c l i n ei nc o g n i t i v ep r o c e s s i n g .C a n n a b i su s eh a sb e e nindicatedasapotentialcause,aggravator,ormaskerofmajorpsychiatric symptoms, including psychotic, depressive, andanxietydisorders,particularlyinyoungpeople[17-19].Othernegative effects include working memory deficits, reducedattention and processing speed, anhedonia, abnormal socialbehavior, and susceptibility to mood and anxiety disor-ders [20, 21]. While adult users seem comparatively resis-tant to cannabis-induced behavioral and brain morphologicchanges, the individuals who start using cannabis duringtheirearlyteenscanhavemoresevereandmorelong-lastingeffects[22]. The target of medical marijuana and its constituents is the endocannabinoid system, which is involved in themodulation of a number of physiological functions. Theendocannabinoidsystemincludestheendocannabinoids,thecannabinoid receptors, and the enzymes involved in thebiosynthesis and inactivation of the endocannabinoids [23]Thecannabinoidreceptorsaremainlyexpressedinthecentralnervous system and the immune system, but they have alsobeenidentifiedinanumberofotherpartsofthebodyinclud-ingthecardiovascularsystem,theperipheralnervoussystem, the reproductive system, and the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its wide distribution and effects on a range of biologicalprocess, the cannabinoid system has become an attractivetarget for the development of drugs that can potentially beusedforthetreatmentofanumberofpathologicalconditionsincluding mood disorders and movement disorders such asPD [24]. Components of the endocannabinoid system areabundantinthestriatumandotherpartsofthebasalgangliaa n dp l a yac ru c i a lr o l ei nm od ul a ti n gd o p a m i n ea cti v i t ya n dmotorfunctions[25-27]. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder following Alzheimer's diseaseand the 14th leading cause of death in all age groups int h eU n i t e dS t a t e s[ 2 8 ] .Th ep r e v a l e n c eo fP Di n c r e a s e sw i t ha g ea n di ss h o w nt ob eh i g h e ri nm a l e st h a nf e m a l e si nsome age groups [29]. The number of people with PD isprojected at approximately 9 million by 2030 in the 15 mostpopulous countries in the world [30, 31]. NeurologicallyPD is characterized by the destruction of dopaminergiccells in the pars compacta region of the substantia nigrain the midbrain, resulting in dopamine deficiency in then e r v et e r m i n a l so ft h es t r i a t u mi nt h ef o r e b r a i n[ 3 2 ] .Th e s echanges cause impairments not just to the motor systembut also to the cognitive and neuropsychological systems [33]. The nigrostriatal pathway is one of the dopamine pathways in the brain that regulates movement. The exactcauseforthelossofneuronalcellsisunknown,andthetriggerof dopaminergic degeneration seems to be multifactorialincluding environmental factors and genetic susceptibilities[34-36]. Clinically, PD is characterized by resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability [32,34, 37, 38] and it is also associated with a number ofnonmotor symptoms including depression, anxiety, consti-pation,orthostatichypotension,fatigue,andsleepdisorders,as well as, in advanced disease, dementia [39-44]. Although dopaminedeficiencyaccountsforthemajormotorsymptoms ofthedisease,lossofnoradrenergicandserotoninergicnerveterminalsinthelimbicsystemmayaccountforseveralofthenonmotorfeaturesseeninParkinson'sdisease[45,46]. Current therapy involves treatment of motor symptoms of PD through replacement of dopamine deficiency [47].This includes (1) enhancement of the synthesis of braindopamine by administration of levodopa, a dopamine pre-cursor, (2) direct stimulation of dopamine receptors, (3)decreasing dopamine catabolism, and (4) stimulation ofdopaminereleaseandinhibitionofdopaminereuptakefrompresynaptic sites. Another therapy involves restoring thenormal balance of cholinergic and dopaminergic actions onthebasalgangliausinganticholinergicdrugs[47-49]. However these drugs treat only motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and are associated with a number of adverse effects. Long-term use of levodopa, the mainstaytherapy for PD, is associated with monoamineoxidase B (MAO-B) well as inhibitors of catechol-o-methyltransferase, COMT(tolcapone and entacapone), are used mostly to reduce the motor fluctuations associated with levodopa therapy due to their levodopa-sparing effect [54-59]. Several dopamine agonists including pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, apomorphine are used as monotherapy in early stage ofParkinson disease or as adjunctive therapy with levodopa in patients with advanced PD in order to reduce motor fluctuations[56,60-64].Inadditiontotheirlimitedefficacy on motorsymptomsand their adverse effects, effectondiseaseprogression.Therefore,thereisanurgentneedfor thedevelopmentofsaferdrugsthattreatboththemotorand nonmotor symptoms PD as well as drugs that slow the progressionofthedisease. Medical marijuana has been demonstrated to improve motorsymptomsincludingtremor,rigidity,andbradykinesiaas well as nonmotor symptoms such as pain and sleepdisorders of PD in observational studies [65]. Survey ofPD patients in Colorado, USA, also indicated the beneficialeffects of marijuana in alleviating nonmotor symptoms one of the major constituentsof marijuana, has been shown to be effective in the treat-ment of psychosis and sleep disorders in PD patients [67- 69]. Another phytocannabinoid, 9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (9 - T H C V ,T H C V ) ,w a ss t u d i e di na n i m a ld i s e a s em o d e l of PD and found to have neuroprotective and symptom-relieving effects [70]. Therefore, marijuana may provide an alternative or add-on therapy for Parkinson's disease. In addition, Parkinson's disease has been listed as one of thediseaseconditionsforwhichmedicalmarijuanaisallowedinConnecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, NewParkinson'sDisease 3 Mexico, and New York. However, it may also be covered underchronicillnessesinseveralotherstates. In this review we seek to investigate any scientific evi- dence that indicates the potential use of marijuana and/orits components for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Thereview aims to (i) examine briefly current treatment andthe unmet need of PD therapy, (ii) assess the role of thecannabinoid system in the modulation of movement andneuroprotection, (iii) look at the mechanism of action ofmarihuanaconstituentsinthemodulationofmovementandPD-associateddisorders,(iv)assessotherbeneficialeffectsofmarihuanathatcontributetotheameliorationofPD,and(v)gatherscientificevidenceontheclinicalbenefitofmarijuanaand/oritsconstituentsinPDpatients. 2. Marijuana and Its Influence on the Endocannabinoid System Cannabis has been used to treat disease since ancient times. Marijuanaisderivedfromthe CannabissativaL. plant.Mar- ijuanacontainstheactivechemicalsknownascannabinoids.Atleast85cannabinoidshavebeenidentifiedasuniquecom-pounds in Cannabis [1]. The therapeutic potential of many oftheseligandsstillremainslargelyunexploredpromptinga need for further research. The chemicals responsible for themedicinaleffectsofmarijuanaareD9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD) [71, 72]. THC psychoactive ingredient, acting primarily upon the centralnervous system where it affects brain function. CBD is the majornonpsychoactiveingredientincannabisandproduces neuroprotective and potential to alleviate motordisordersbyreducingmotorimpairmentsandneurondegen-eration [75]. In addition, cannabinoids have been shownto be effective in preclinical studies involving excitotoxicity,oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and motor complica-tionsassociatedwithPD[76]. Some cannabinoids (endocannabinoids or ECBs) are foundinthebody.Initially,ECBswerediscoveredinthebrainand subsequently in the periphery in humans and animals.Endocannabinoids are produced by cultured neurons [77],microglia, and astrocytes [78]. ECBs interact with the endo-cannabinoid system and aid in regulation of memory, plea-sure, concentration, thinking, movement and coordination, sensory and time perception, appetite, and pain [24, 79, 80]. The ECBs activate two guanine nucleotide-binding CB1 receptors are primarily in centralandperipheralneuronsandCB2receptorsarepredominantlyfound in immune cells [82]. CB1 receptors are importantm e d i a t o r si ns i g n a l i n gp a t h w a y sa n dh a v eb e e ni d e n t i fi e don both glutamatergic and gamma -aminobutyric (GABA) neurons [83]. It is believed that one important role of theneuronal CB1 component is to modulate neurotransmitterreleaseinamannerthatmaintainshomeostasisbypreventingthedevelopmentofexcessiveneuronalactivityinthecentralnervoussystem[82].Animalmodelsillustratethatactivation oftheCB1receptorbytheirendogenousligandscanresultinprominentneuroprotectiveeffectsandmaypreventepilepticseizures [84]. Other studies suggest that activation of CB1receptorsoffersneuroprotectionagainstdopaminergiclesionand the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias [85]. CB2 receptors are closely related to CB1 and are mainly expressedonTcellsoftheimmunesystem,onmacrophagesand B cells, and in hematopoietic cells [86]. They are alsoexpressed on peripheral nerve terminals where these recep-tors play a role in antinociception and the relief of pain[87]. In the brain, CB2 receptors are mainly expressed bymicroglialcells,wheretheirroleremainsunclear[88]. at TRPV1 [90]. AEA is localizedin the brain and periphery [91]. In AEA showshigh distribution in the hippocampus, striatum,andbrainstemandtoalesserextentinthecerebralcortexandcerebellum [92]. Lower concentrations of AEA are found inhumanserum,plasma,andcerebrospinalfluid[93].Similarly,2-AGisobservedinboththebrainandperiphery,althoughitsconcentration is almost 150 times higher in brain comparedtothatofAEA[92,94,95].2-AGhasgreaterpotency,stability,and agonistic activity at CB1 and CB2 receptors comparedto that hydrolase (FAAH) [100]. It has also receptors in the striatum, suggesting thatthe endocannabinoid system acts as THC have been identified,such as lowering ocular pressure, inhibiting smooth musclecontractions, and increasing appetite [102]. When smoked,THCisrapidlyabsorbedfromthelungsintothebloodstreamand has an effect on the cannabinoid receptors. The centralnervous system and specific areas of the brain contain thehighest concentration of cannabinoid receptors. Therefore,cannabisorTHCadministrationcancreateanoverexcitationofthesystemthatresultsinalteredperceptions,pleasure,and mood[103]. Unlike THC, CBD has little affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors but acts as an indirect antagonist of cannabinoidagonists. While this should cause CBD to reduce the effectsof THC, it may potentiate THC's effects by increasing CB14 receptor density or through another CB1-related mechanism [73]. CBD is also an inverse agonist of CB2 receptors. CBDcan counteract some of the functional consequences of CB1activation in the brain, possibly by indirect enhancementof adenosine A1 receptors activity through equilibrativenucleoside transporter (ENT) inhibition [73]. CBD helps to augment some of THC's beneficial effects, as it reduces the psychoactivity of THC, enhances its tolerability, and widensTHC'stherapeuticwindow[104]. Other cannabinoids can also contribute to the cannabis medicinal effects. Studies in experimental models and hu-manshavesuggestedanti-inflammatory,neuroprotective,anx-iolytic, and antipsychotic properties of chemicals extractedfrommarijuana[6,15,82,105,106]. 3. Cannabinoids and Parkinson's Disease 3.1.ChangesintheCannabinoidSysteminParkinson'sDisease.Recent data from several studies indicate the importantrole of the endocannabinoid system in Parkinson's disease. The components of the endocannabinoid system are highly expressed in the neural circuit of basal ganglia, which ispart of a complex neuronal system. This neuronal system coordinates activities from different cortical regions that directly or indirectly participate in the control of movement [107, 108]. In dominant role in controlling transmission at synapses between cortical and striatal neurons, in mediating the induction of a particular form of synaptic plasticity, and in modulatingbasalgangliaactivityandmotorfunctions[110]. The progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons that occursin PD leads to lower striatal levels of dopamine. These lowlevels of dopamine result in the alterationof the equilibriumbetween the direct and the indirect basal ganglia pathwaysandECBsignaling[111]. The cannabinoid signaling system mentioned above experiences a biphasic pattern of changes during the pro-gression of PD [112]. Early and presymptomatic malfunction little evidenceofneuronaldeath,areassociatedwithdesensitization/down-regulation of CB1 receptors and aggravation of variouscytotoxic insults such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, andglial activation [113]. However, intermediate and advanced stages of PD, characterized by a deep nigral degeneration and manifestation of major Parkinsonian symptoms, areassociatedwithupregulatoryresponsesofCB1receptorsandthe endocannabinoid [113]. This could CB1 ligands in alleviating common PDsymptoms. In the brain, CB1 receptors are expressed by GABAergic neuronsinnervatingtheexternalandinternalsegmentsoftheglobuspallidusandthesubstantianigra[114-116].CB1recep-tors are also Parkinson's diseaseshow an increase in the density of CB1 receptors, levels ofendogenous ligands, and CB1 same time, activation of presynapticCB1receptorsintheexternalsegmentsoftheglobuspalliduscan increase local GABA levels by reducing GABA reuptakefrom striatal to the of the substantia nigra [114,116, 118]. Based on these evidences, it is thought that thefunctionofthebasalganglianeuronalsystemiscontrolledbyECB. The presence of endocannabinoid systems in differentneural structures and their interaction with dopaminergic,glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurotransmitter signalingsystems make the components of Endocannabinoid signaling is also bidirectionally the basal ganglia [118].The [114, 115]. In animal models, CB1 and D2dopamine receptors share a common pool of G proteins,suggesting the link of their signal transduction mechanisms[124, 125]. In addition, D2 receptor stimulation resulted inrelease of ECBs in the striatum [101]. However, stimulationofCB1receptorscompletelyinhibitedD1-dopaminereceptormediatedactivationofadenylylcyclaseanddecreasedGABAreleasefromstriatalafferentsofdopaminergicneuronsofthesubstantianigraresultinginanincreasedfiringofthesecells[114-116]. Another receptor involved in control of movement is transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), whichis expressed in Studies have revealed that motorbehavior can be suppressed by the activation of vanilloidreceptors [98, 99], suggesting that TRPV1 receptors mightplayaroleinthecontrolofmotorfunction. 3.2. Preclinical Data on the Endocannabinoid System as a Target for Parkinson's Disease Therapy. The association of cannabinoids with regulation of motor functions is wellestablished[132-135].Theeffectofthecannabinoidsonmotoractivity depends on the impact of the endocannabinoidsystemonthedopaminergic,glutamatergic,andGABAergicsignaling systems throughout the basal ganglia [112, 136].The high density of cannabinoid, dopamine, coupled with ECBs within the basal gangliaand cerebellum suggests a potential therapeutic role for theParkinson'sDisease 5 cannabinoids in the control of voluntary movement and in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease [98, 99,121, 137]. Additional indications of an important role of theendocannabinoidsysteminthecontrolofmovementinvolvean inhibitory action of cannabinoids through fine tuning ofvarious classical neurotransmitters activity [138], prominent changes in transmission of ECBs in the basal ganglia [139], and alteration of the as CB1 availabilityin the substantia nigra [85, 112, 119, 120, 140, 141]. These datasupport the idea that cannabinoid- based compounds act onvital pathways of endocannabinoid transmission and there-foremightbeoftherapeuticinterestduetotheirpotentialtodiminishmotorsymptomsinextrapyramidaldisorderssuchasParkinson'sdisease[27,76,142]. Research with cannabinoid agonists and antagonists demonstrates that the cannabinoids can modulate motoractivity and produce alterations in corresponding molecularcorrelates [129, 143-145]. It been cannabinoid ago-nistsexertapowerfulmotorinhibitioninlaboratoryspecies[129, 144, 146-149]. This hypokinetic was shown to bemediated by the activation of CB1 receptors in neurons ofthebasalgangliacircuitry[88,137,141,150-152].Stimulationof the CB1 receptor by a synthetic cannabinoid HU-210decreased spontaneous activity [148]. In a gender study THC produced an increase int y r o s i n eh y d r o x y l a s ea c t i v i t yi np a r k i n - n u l lm a l em i c e( amodel of early stages of PD) and caused a motor inhibitionthatwassignificantlygreatercomparedtowild-typeanimals[122]. Treatment with THC inhibited motor activity andproduced catalepsy in rats [109, 144, 146, 147] and ring immobility in mice [157]. In THC diminished the motor inhibition caused by 6-hydroxydopamine[70]andpotentiatedthehypokineticeffectof reserpine in rats more than 20-fold [135]. However, ina primate model of Parkinson's disease THC did not affectlocomotoractivitybutincreasedbradykinesia[125]. Administration of WIN 55,212-2 increased stimulation GTP 120].WIN 55,212-2 produced a dose-dependent reduction of thespontaneous motor activity and catalepsy in mutant Syrianhamsters,increasedantidystonicefficacyofbenzodiazepines[158], and significantly reduced the antikinetic effects ofquinpirole in the and activity bradykinesiain extracellulardopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens shell of ratsby the activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system[167]. This dopamine increase was receptor antagonist rimonabant [167]. However,recent to acti- vate vanilloid VR(1) receptors and that the activation of these receptors might also be responsible for changes innigrostriataldopaminergicactivityandanandamide-induced hypokinesia [168-170]. AEA produced a tonic facilitation of glutamate release in the substantia nigra via stimulation of VR1receptors,indicatingtheinvolvementofthisreceptorin motor and cognitive functions of the dopaminergic system[171]. Preclinical data have shown that AEA decreased the activityofnigrostriataldopaminergicneuronsandproduced hypokinesia that was completely reversed by an antagonist of vanilloid-like receptors, capsazepine [129]. Additionalstudies have demonstrated inhibited ambulationand stereotypic behavior, increased inactivity, and of vanilloid VR 1receptors, livanil, on locomotion in mice, suggesting a common mechanismof action for the two compounds [170]. Treatment withanandamide lowered motor activity with the maximal inhi-bitionbyapproximately85%andproducedhypothermiaandanalgesiainmice,increasedtheinactivitytime,andmarkedlydecreased the ambulation and the frequency of spontaneousnon-ambulatory activities in rats [146, 147, 172, 173]. More-over,AEAproducedadecreaseinspontaneousmotoractivityinlaboratoryanimalssimilartothereportedactionsofTHC[129, 145, 170]. The hypokinetic Tissue concentrations of endocannabinoids are impor- tant for producing motor effects. Levels and activities of AEA and 2-AG can be manipulated by inhibition of FAAH enzyme, the action of which is reduced in experimentalmodelsofPD[153,175].Animalstudieshaveshownthatthe FAAHenzymeinhibitor[3-(3-carbamoylphenyl)phenyl]N- cyclohexylcarbamate (URB597) magnified and prolonged a rapid, brief dopamine increase that was produced by AEA [167]. Additional studies have confirmed that FAAH inhibi-tion remarkably increases AEA tissue levels but reduces 2- AGlevels[176,177].TodeterminewhetherFAAHinhibition has beneficial impact on PD symptoms the effect of the FAAH inhibitor, in MPTP- not of L- DOP A,andr ed ucedthemagnitudeofh yperactivitytolevelsequivalent to those seen in normal animals [178]. In PDmice URB597 prevented induced motor impairment [179].Moreover,otherFAAHinhibitors,JNJ1661010andTCF2,alsohave reveal nouscannabinoidagonistsactivatethedopaminergicsystema n dp l a yav e r yi m p o r t a n tr o l ei nm o d u l a t i o no fm o t o rbehavior [180]. In addition to the effects on movementactivity, cannabinoid agonists have demonstrated neuropro-t e c t i v ep r o p e r t i e s ,s u g g e s t i n gt h a tt h ec a n n a b i n o i d sh a v eapromising pharmacological profile for not only improvingParkinsonian symptoms but also delaying PD progression[70,85,181-183]. The CB1 receptor antagonists can also influence move- mentsyndromesofParkinson'sdiseasesuggestingthatmod-ulation of the CB1 signaling system might be valuable intreatmentofmotordisorders.InastudywithPDratsrimon-abant(SR141716A),aselectiveantagonistofCB1receptorshass h o w nt h ep o t e n t i a lt oa c ta sa na n t i h y p o k i n e t i ca g e n tb yenhancing glutamate release from excitatory afferents to 167] and also increased thelocomotoractivityinmiceandratspreexposedtoTHC[170,185]. produced a LID [136]. of SR141716A with resulted in significantly than administration of levodopa alone [136, 160].

Thecannabinoidpharmacologicmanipulationrepresents a promising therapy to alleviate movement disorders andlevodopa-induceddyskinesias.Thus,CB1antagonistsappeartohaveantiparkinsonianeffects,whilecannabinoidreceptoragonists may be useful in the treatment of motor complica-tionsinParkinson'sdisease. 3.3. Effect of Cannabinoids on Patients with Movement Dis- orders.Cannabis and related compounds have created sig- nificantresearchinterestasapromisingtherapyinneurode- generative and movement disorders. The successful use of tinctureof Cannabisindica intreatingPDwasfirstdescribed in Europe by Gowers [193]. Despite the lack of controlledstudies,thereisevidencethatcannabinoidsareoftherapeutic value in the treatment of tics in Tourette syndrome, some formsoftremoranddystonia,choreainHuntington'sdisease,thereductionoflevodopa-induceddyskinesiainParkinson's disease,andParkinsoniansyndromes[194-201]. A study with smoked cannabis queried 339 PD patients indicated that marijuana produced significant improvementofgeneralPDsymptomsin46%ofthepatients;31%ofthemreportedimprovementinrestingtremor,38%reportedrelieffrom rigidity, 45% defined reduced bradykinesia, and the patients alleviated dyskinesias [202]. (>50ng/ml) of the THC primary 11-HO-THC, was associated with relief from PDsymptoms [202]. The dose and frequency of the cannabisadministrations were important in relieving PD symptoms.Smoked cannabis also produced a statistically significantimprovement in tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia as wellas improvement in sleep and pain scores in 22 PD patients [65]. In another study, smoked cannabis was responsible for a significant improvement in the mean total motor UnifiedParkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, tremor,rigidity, and bradykinesia in 17 patients with PD [203]. Onedose of smoked marijuana provided symptoms relief for upto3hours[203].Moreover,bothstudiesreportedsignificantimprovement of nonmotor symptoms of PD, such as painand sleep [65, 203]. However, smoked marijuana did notreduceParkinsoniansymptomsin5patientswithidiopathicParkinson's disease and severe tremor [204]. A clinical trialin 19 PD and 6 patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesiademonstrated that oral cannabis extract was ineffective foralleviatingparkinsonismordyskinesia[205].Parkinson'sDisease 7 Few studies have evaluated the effects of CBD on PD symptoms. In a pilot study CBD lowered total UPDRSscoresandsignificantlyreducedpsychoticsymptomsin6PDpatients with psychosis [67]. In another study CBD admin-istration produced no improvement in measures of motorand general symptoms in 21 PD patients er en tmea n total scores in the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, 39comparedtotheplacebogroup[68,69].OralCBDimproveddyskinesia by up to 30% without a worseningof the parkinsonism in PD patients [206]. CBD withdrawalcausedseveregeneralizeddystonia[206]. Clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the e ff e c to fas y n t h e t i cc a n n a b i n o i dn a b i l o n e .O r a ln a b i l o n esignificantlyreduceddyskinesiawithoutaggravatingparkin-sonism in seven PD patients with severe L-DOPA-induceddyskinesia[207].Inanotherstudy,nabiloneproduceda22%reduction in levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD patients[208]. Nabilone showed butalso against bradykinesia in PD patients [209]. Some othercannabinoidrelatedcompoundssuchasCE178253,OEA,andHU-210 have also been reported to be efficacious againstL-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and bradykinesia in PD [199,2 0 9 ] .H o w e v e r ,S R1 4 1 7 1 6d i dn o ti m p r o v eP a r k i n s o n i a nmotordisabilityinPDpatients[210].TheAmericanAcademyof Neurology (AAN) review deemed marijuana \"probablyineffective\" for treating L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia [211].Theseconflictingresultsindicatetheneedformoreresearchinthisarea. Several clinical studies have been performed to evaluate t h ee ff e c to fm a r i j u a n ao nd y s t o n i a .I n h a l e dc a n n a b i sh a s provided a marked reduction in dystonia and complete painrelief in patients with right hemiplegic painful dystonia.Moreover, the patients have been able to completely opioid use [212]. Smoked cannabis also improvedidiopathicdystoniaandgeneralizeddystoniaduetoWilson'sdisease [213, 214]. In a preliminary study, administration ofC B Dr e s u l t e di na5 0 %i m p r o v e m e n ti ns p a s ms e v e r i t ya n dfrequency in a patient with blepharospasm-oromandibulardystonia [215] and amelioration of the dystonic also improved dystonia tremor and patients with Parkinson's disease [200]. Another cannabiscompound, THC, produced a reduction of abnormal move-mentpatternsina14-year-oldgirlwithmarkeddystonia[216]and decreased intensity of myoclonic movements in a 13-year-oldboywithathetosisandmyoclonicmovements[216].In contrast to these findings, one study found no significantreductionindystoniafollowingtreatmentwithnabilone[165,166]. Studies have looked at the potential benefits of medical marijuana and cannabinoids for the treatment of Hunt-ington's disease (HD). Nabilone versus placebo showed a treatment difference of 0.86 for total motor score; 1.68 for chorea; 3.57 the in HD patients [217].However, in previous study nabilone was found to increasechoreatic movements in patients with HD [197, 198]. AAN guideline examining the efficacy of marijuana for treatingchorea in HD stated nabilone can be used for modestdecreases in HD chorea [218]. Available data regarding theeffect of CBD on HD symptoms are inconsistent. CBDproducedimprovement(20-40%)inthechoreicmovements inHDpatients[219].However,alatterstudydidnotconfirm the earlier finding [220]. A comparison of the effects ofCBD and placebo on chorea severity in neuroleptic-freeHD patients indicated no significant or clinically importantdifferences[220]. Few studies have indicated that marijuana and THC can reduce tics and associated behavioral disorders in patientswith Tourette's syndrome (TS) TS symptoms [222].Followingmarijuanaadministration82%ofTSpatients( = 64) reported a reduction, or complete remission of motor and vocal tics, and an amelioration of premonitory urgesand obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCB) in one case study[223]. Administration of THC to a boy with TS improvedticsandenhancedshort-intervalintracorticalinhibitionandthe prolongation of the cortical silent period [224]. TCHsignificantly reduced tics and improve driving ability in aTourette's patient [225]. Treatment with THC lowered themean C1 specific over nonspecific binding ratio ( 3)f r o m 0.30to0.25insixTSpatients,althoughthedifferencewasnotsignificant. However 3clearly declined in a patient with a markedclinicalresponse[226].Todate,therehavebeenonlytwo controlled trials that investigated the effect of THC on TS [194], both of which reported a significant improvement ofticsandOCBafterTHCadministration[195,196]. Consideringtherelevanceofthesedata,theneedforalter- native treatments for PD motor and nonmotor symptoms,medicalmarijuana,orrelatedcompoundsmayprovideanewapproachtothetreatmentofParkinson'sdisease. 4. Beneficial Effects of Cannabinoids in the Amelioration of Nonmotor Symptoms and Progression of Parkinson's Disease 4.1. Neuroprotective Actions of Cannabinoids. Cannabinoids have been shown to have neuroprotective effect due to theirantioxidative, anti-inflammatory actions and their exitotoxicity. as THC and CBD can provide neuroprotection against the in vivoandinvitrotoxicityof6-hydroxydopamineandthiswasthoughttobeduetotheirantioxidativepropertyormodula-tionofglialcellfunctionoracombinationofboth[182].Stud-iesfoundthatCBDwasabletorecover6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopamine depletion and also induced upregulationof Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase, which is a against oxidative stress [70, 191, 227].The reported in and decreases stress, inflammation, and cell death in thekidneys [228]. Another study has also emphasized a anion produced of dopaminergic neurons in thePD brain [229]. The mechanism by which CBD acts toreduce NADPH oxidase expression and inhibit oxidativeinjury within the PD brain has yet to be confirmed butit seems to act through mechanisms independent of CB1 or CB2 receptors [76]. However, data obtained from recent studies have hinted towards a direct relationship betweent h eC B 1r e c e p t o ra n dm i t o c h o n d r i a lf u n c t i o n si nt h eb r a i n[230]. The phenolic ring moieties in displayantioxidantactivityguardingagainstglutamate-inducedneu-rotoxicity oxidative damage indicating that CBD is a potentantioxidant [232]. Taken together, these discoveries supportthe hypothesis that treatment with cannabinoids havingantioxidant effects may modulate mitochondrial reactiveoxygenspeciesproduction[233]inthePDbrain. I n fl a m m a t i o nh a sb e e ns h o w nt ob eac r u c i a lp a t h o - logical factor responsible for the demise of dopaminergicneurons in PD [234-236]. Glial cells appear to play a keyrole in neuroinflammation, since higher levels of activatedmicroglia are reported in the substantia nigra of patientswith PD compared to brains of [237, 238].Cannabinoids anti-inflammatory activities bysuppressing toxic cytokine Increased CB2 receptor expression in nigral cellsand stimulation of these receptors protect dopaminergicneurons from microglia-induced inflammation and regulate neuronal survival [70]. The cannabinoids are known to be able to activate the CB2 receptor, which mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of the compounds and preserve cellsfrom excessive apoptosis. Recent evidence substantiates anti-inflammatory properties and canproduce beneficial effect in acute inflammation and chronicneuropathic states [5, 247, 248]. THC demonstrates anti-inflammatory effect via activation of the CB1 receptor [249-251]. In addition, cannabinoids provide anti-inflammationeffect by reducing the vasoconstriction and restoring bloodsupply to the injured area [252]. All these data supportthat cannabinoids are potentially effective compounds forthe treatment of neuroinflammatory conditions, includingneurodegenerativediseaseslikePD. Marijuana may prevent brain damage by protecting againstneuronalinjury.Thereareafewmechanismsbywhichcannabinoids provide neuroprotection. One of the mech-anisms involves an induction/upregulation of cannabinoidCB2receptors,mainlyinreactivemicroglia,andregulatestheinfluence of these glial cells on homeostasis of surroundingneurons [253]. In combination with the increased antitoxiceffects observed in cell cultures containing glia, this sug- gests that immunomodulation produced by CB2 receptor activation may play a primary role in the neuroprotectivepropertiesofcannabinoids[182].Anothermechanismofneu-roprotectionisactivationofCB1receptors.Lossofdopamin-ergic neurons and greater degree of motor impairment inC B 1k n o c k o u tm i c eh a v eb e e nr e p o r t e d[ 8 5 ] .C a n n a b i n o i d s activating the CB1 receptor are antiexcitotoxic due to sup-pressionofglutamatergicactivitywithasubsequentdecreasein calcium ion influx and eventual nitric oxide production[254-256]. Sativex-like combination of phytocannabinoidshas been demonstrated to produce neuroprotective effect via interaction with both CB1 and CB2 receptors [134, 257]. In addition, THC reduced neurons in the substantia nigra [70] and exhibitedneuroprotective effect by activation of the PPAR receptors [258]. Overall, these data suggest that cannabinoids areneuroprotectiveinacuteandchronicneurodegenerationandcan delay or even stop progressive degeneration of braindopaminergic system, a process that cannot be preventedcurrently. 4.2. Analgesic Effect of Cannabinoids. Pain is a relevant and often underestimated nonmotor symptom of PD [259, 260].Pain affects more that 50% of people with this disorderand can cause extreme physical, psychological, and socialdisorders and worsen Parkinsonian disability [261, 262].Different treatment options are used to treat PD pain [262-265].However,thesemedicationshavesignificantsideeffects a n dd on o tp r o v i d eu n i v e r s a le ffi c a c y[ 2 6 4 ,2 6 5 ] .C a n n a b i s is well known as a pain-relieving plant. The cannabinoidreceptorsinthecentralandperipheralnervoussystemshavebeenshowntomodulatepainperception[266,267]. Several clinical studies have been performed to inves- tigate the effect of marijuana or cannabinoids on pain.Smoked cannabis significantly reduced neuropathic painintensityaswellassignificantlyimprovedmooddisturbance,physical disability, and quality of life in HIV-patients [268].Cannabis was effective at ameliorating neuropathic pain inpatients with central and peripheral neuropathic pain [269].Inhaled cannabis significantly reduced pain intensity (34%)compared to placebo in a clinical trial of painful polyneuropathy (DSPN) [270]. Whole plant significantly decreased chronic pain intensity aswell as sleep disturbance in multiple sclerosis patients [272,273]. Oromucosal nabiximols (1:1 combination of the THCand CBD) produced a reduction in pain intensity scores inpatientswithneuropathicpain[274]. These findings are consistent with other discoveries supporting the efficacy of cannabis in relieving pain. Theanalgesic effect of cannabinoids has been reviewed [75, 211,275-281].Thereviewoftheliteraturesuggeststhatmarijuanaand/or cannabinoids may be efficacious for pain relieving invariousdiseasestatesincludingPD. 4.3. Antidepressant Effect of Cannabinoids. Depression is one of the common nonmotor symptoms of PD and theestimatedratevarieswidely,withanaverageprevalenceofupto 50%. [282-284]. Despite its association with poor healthoutcomes and quality of life, depression in PD patients isunderdiagnosed and undertreated [285-287]. Studies haveindicated that the endocannabinoid system is involved inParkinson'sDisease 9 t h er e g u l a t i o no fm o o da n de m o t i o n a lb e h a v i o r ,a n dt h e loss or blockade of the endocannabinoid signaling systemresults in depressive symptoms [288]. For example, the CB1receptor antagonist rimonabant has been shown to inducesymptoms of anxiety and depression [289-291]. In addition,p o l y m o r p h i s mo ft h eg e n et h a te n c o d e st h eC B 1r e c e p t o r has been associated with depression in PD [292]. In animal models, low level of THC produced antidepressant activityand increased serotogenic activity via activation of the CB1receptor [293]. Animal studies have also shown that inhibi-tionofhydrolysisoftheendocannabinoidanandamideexertsantidepressiveeffect[294]andresultedinanincreasedsero-tonergicandnoradrenergicneuronalactivityinthemidbrain.Currently available antidepressant drugs act via increasing serotoninand/ornoradrenalinelevels.These,andmanyother studies, indicate that the cannabinoid system is a potential target for the development of novel antidepressant drugs.Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that people who used cannabis daily or weekly exhibit less depressed mood and more positive effect than nonusers of cannabis [295]. Other studies have shown an association between heavy cannabis use and depressive symptoms. However, it is notclear whether the increased depressive symptoms are due to cannabis use or other factors that increased the risk of both depression and heavy use of cannabis [296]. Therefore,moderate use of cannabis in PD patients may help alleviate depressivesymptomsandimprovequalityoflife. 4.4. Effect of Cannabinoids on Sleep Disorders. Sleep disor- ders are common in PD patients and negatively affect thequality of life. The reported prevalence ranges from 25% to 98% and this wide variation could be due to differ- ences in study design and diagnostic tools used [297]. Thecauses of the sleep disturbances in PD are multifactorialand include neurodegeneration and the medications usedto treat motor symptoms of PD [298]. Various sleep disor-ders including rapid eye movement sleep disorder,insomnia,sleepfragmentation,excessivedaytimesleepiness,restlesslegssyndrome,andobstructivesleepapneahavebeendescribed in PD patients [299, 300]. Cannabidiol, the majornonpsychoticcomponentofmarijuana,hasbeenreportedtoimprove rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in PDpatients[68,69].Marijuanahasalsobeenshowntoimprovenonmotor symptoms of PD including sleep [65]. In clinicaltrials involving 2000 patients with various pain conditions,nabiximols has been demonstrated to improve subjectivesleep parameters [301]. Thus, marijuana could tsb yallevia tingsleepdisordersandpain. 5. Summary Cannabisandrelatedcompoundshaverecentlybeenstudiedas promising therapeutic agents in treatment of neurode-generative and movement disorders including Parkinson'sdisease. In this review we have examined the potentialbenefits of medical marijuana and cannabinoids in thetreatmentofbothmotorandnonmotorsymptomsaswell asin slowing the progression of the disease. We have looked into any scientific evidence that indicates the potential useof marijuana and/or related compounds for the treatment ofPD. Current treatments of PD provide only relief of motorsymptoms and are associated with adverse effects such asdyskinesia. In addition, these therapies do not slow the progressionofthedisease.Therefore,thereisanurgentneed for safer drugs that can treat both motor and nonmotorsymptoms of PD as well as drugs that slow the progressionofthedisease. In spite of the placement of marijuana in schedule 1 categoryundertheUSFederalControlledSubstanceAct,24statesandW ashingtonDChaveenactedlawsallowingtheuseof marijuana to treat a range of medical conditions. Parkin-son's disease has been listed as one of the disease conditionsforwhichmedicalmarijuanaisallowedinanumberofstates.Research studies have provided evidence for the potentialeffectivenessofmedicalmarijuanaanditscomponentsinthetreatmentofPDascannabinoidsactonthesameneurologicalpathwaythatisdisruptedinParkinson'sdisease.Involvementof the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of motorbehavior, the localization of the cannabinoid receptors inareas that control movement, and the effect of cannabi-noids on motor activity indicate that cannabinoids can bepotentially used in the treatment of movement disorders.Cannabinoid agonists and antagonists have been shown tomodulate the endocannabinoid system and modify motoractivity.Cannabinoidreceptorantagonistsappeartoproduceantiparkinsonianeffectswhilecannabinoidreceptoragonistsexert a powerful motor inhibition and may be useful in the treatment of motor complications. In addition, we have assessed the role of the cannabinoid system and marijuanaconstituents in neuroprotection as well as considered otherbeneficial effects of marijuana. Marijuana has been shownto improve nonmotor symptoms of PD such as depression,pain, sleep, and anxiety. Moreover, components of cannabishave been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effect duetotheiranti-inflammatory,antioxidative,andantiexcitotoxicproperties. Due to combination of the above mentionedbeneficial effects, cannabis may provide a viable alternativeor addition to the current treatment of Parkinson's disease.However, there are concerns regarding the use of medicalmarijuana including lack of standardization and regulation,imprecise dosing, possible adverse effects, and medicationinteractions. Further studies are needed to provide moredataonefficacy,safety,pharmacokinetics,andinteractionsofcannabinoids.

Troutt, N.M.D. & Matthew D. DiDonato, Ph.D. Abstract \u2014 Many advances have been made toward understanding the benets of medical cannabis. However, less is known about medical cannabis patients themselves. Prior research has uncovered many important patient characteristics, but most of that work has been conducted with partici- pants in California, who may not represent medical cannabis patients throughout the United States. Furthermore, it is unknown if medical cannabis legalization, which typically imposes strict regula- tions on cannabis cultivation and sale, impacts patients' experiences acquiring and using cannabis. The goal of this study was to address these limitations by (1) examining the characteristics, perceptions, and behaviors of medical cannabis patients in Arizona; and (2) questioning participants with a history of cannabis use regarding their experiences with cannabis before and after legalization. Patients in Arizona share many characteristics with those in California, but also key differences, such as average age and degree of cannabis consumption. Participants also had positive perceptions of the effect of medical cannabis legalization, reporting that feelings of safety and awareness were higher after legal- ization compared to before. The results are discussed in relation to evidence from patients in other states and in terms of their potential policy implications. Keywords \u2014 Arizona, medical cannabis, medical cannabis legalization, patient characteristics, perceptions Support for the use of cannabis for medical purposes is growing throughout the United States. To date, 23 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws legaliz- ing medical cannabis, and 16 states have similar legislation under consideration. Recent polls also show that the major- ity of Americans believe that cannabis should be legal- ized for medical purposes (Anderson Robbins Research & Shaw & Company Research 2013 ; Associated Press- CNBC 2010 ), and the popularity of this sentiment has Medical Marijuana Research Institute, Mesa, AZ. Please address correspondence to William D. Troutt, 10613 N. 2008; email: drtroutt@yahoo.comincreased over time (Anderson Robbins Research & Shaw & Company Research 2013 ). Support may be on the rise, in part, due to research that shows the potential therapeutic effects of medical cannabis. Animal studies, for example, show that cannabis-derived extracts mitigate cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (Aviello et al. 2012 ) and have antidepressant-like effects (Jiang et al. 2005 ). Studies also show that cannabis may be benecial for humans. Bar-Sela and colleagues ( 2013 ) found that nausea, vomiting, weight loss, sleep disorders, and pain were reduced in cancer patients after 6-8 weeks of cannabis use. Studies also show that cannabis signicantly reduces chronic pain (see Lynch and Campbell 2011 ), Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 1 Volume 00 (00), Xxxx - Xxxx 2015 Downloaded by [Ecole Hautes Etudes Commer-Montreal] at 15:35 01 September 2015 Troutt & DiDonato Medical Cannabis in Arizona inflammatory bowel disease (Allegretti et al. 2013 ), post- traumatic stress disorder (Greer, Grob, and Halberstadt 2014 ), and seizure disorders (Lorenz 2004 ). Although many advances have been made in under- standing the benets of medical cannabis, less is known about US medical cannabis patients themselves. Demographically, most patients are White, male, and approximately 35 to 45 years of age (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Grella, Rodriguez, and Kim 2014 ; Ryan-Ibarra, Induni, and Ewing 2015 ; Aggarwal et al. 2013 ; Ilgen et al. 2013 ; Nunberg et al. 2011 ; Reinarman et al. 2011 ; Aggarwal et al. 2009 ;R e i m a n 2009 ; O'Connell and Bou- Matar 2007 ; Harris et al. 2000 ). Most patients report medicating with cannabis daily (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Ilgen et al. 2013 ; Reinarman et al. 2011 ; O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007 ), consuming six to nine grams of cannabis per week (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Reinarman et al. 2011 ; O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007 ), and prefer inhalation as the method of consumption (O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007 ). Studies also show that the majority of patients use medical cannabis to relieve pain. However, patients also report using cannabis to treat a variety of other conditions, including anxiety, sleep apnea, hypertension, incontinence, and depression (Aggarwal et al. 2013 ; Nunberg et al. 2011 ; Reinarman et al. 2011 ). Generally, patients report that med- ical cannabis is effective for helping them manage their condition(s) (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Ryan-Ibarra, Induni, and Ewing 2015 ; Aggarwal et al. 2013 ; Harris et al. 2000 ). For example, Aggarwal and colleagues ( 2013 ) found that, on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 indicated absolute symptom control, patients reported that cannabis provided symptom control in the range of 7 to 10 across a vari- ety of conditions. Patients also often reduce their use of other medications (i.e., prescription and over-the-counter drugs) when using medical cannabis (Nunberg et al. 2011 ; Aggarwal et al. 2009 ;R e i m a n 2009 ,2007 ). Though these studies are informative, one limitation is that most were conducted with samples of patients living in California. California patients may not represent those living in other areas of the country because the regula- tions that govern patients in California are different from those in other states. For example, residents of California may legally obtain medical cannabis to treat a number of ailments, including any chronic or persistent condition that considerably limits major life activities or that, if not alleviated, may compromise the patient's safety or health (California Senate Bill 420 2003 ). Because the list of con- ditions for which the legal medical use of cannabis is granted in other states is often less inclusive, patients from these states may differ from those in California. Considering that medical cannabis has been legalized in many states, there is an opportunity to paint a more com- prehensive picture of American medical cannabis patients by conducting similar studies in other geographic locations.Scientists have begun to conduct such research through the examination of patients living in Washington State (Aggarwal et al. 2013 ,2009 ) and Michigan (Ilgen et al. 2013 ). Our rst goal was to continue this line of research by studying medical cannabis patients in Arizona. To aid comparisons with previous research, we assessed patient characteristics, behaviors, and perceptions that have been examined in prior studies. These included patterns of use (e.g., frequency of consumption, amount of consumption, preferred method of consumption), degree of relief expe- rienced when using medical cannabis, and use of other medications. In addition to the limited research on medical cannabis patients outside of California, to our knowledge there has been no systematic examination of patients' perceptions of the outcomes of medical cannabis legalization. One objec- tive of legalizing cannabis for medical use is to safeguard its acquisition and production, which often involves strict regulation of its cultivation and sale. For instance, the rules and regulations of the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program require that those authorized to operate medical cannabis dispensaries and cultivation facilities enact strict security policies and procedures (Arizona Department of Health Services Medical Marijuana Rules 2012 ). In addi- tion, many dispensaries and facilities employ third-party laboratories to test cannabis products for possible contami- nants. However, it is unknown if such regulations translate to changes in patient safety or product quality. Because individuals who use cannabis medicinally are those most affected by these regulations, surveying patients regarding their experiences purchasing and using medi- cal cannabis may uncover the changes legalization has had on patient safety and product quality. In particular, patients with a history of using cannabis medicinally prior to legalization can provide their perspective on the changes that legalization has generated. The second goal of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of mea- sures invoked to regulate and secure the cultivation and sale of medical cannabis by examining the perceptions of patients that used cannabis medicinally prior to legal- ization. Patients were asked to compare their perceptions of safety, product knowledge, and the effectiveness of cannabis for treating their condition(s) before and after legalization. Because of the regulations imposed with the legalization of medical cannabis, we hypothesized that patients would feel greater safety, have better knowledge, and that cannabis effectiveness would be greater after legalization. METHOD Participants and Procedures Participants were 367 patients recruited from four medical cannabis dispensaries located throughout Arizona. The majority of the patients were male (63.8%), and Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 2 Volume 00 (00), Xxxx - Xxxx 2015 Downloaded by [Ecole Hautes Etudes Commer-Montreal] at 15:35 01 September 2015 Troutt & DiDonato Medical Cannabis in Arizona ranged from 18 to 83 years of age ( M=45.78 years; SD=13.76 years). Most of the patients were White (86.4%), whereas the rest were Hispanic (6.3%), Black (2.5%), Native American (1.9%), Asian (0.8%), or Other (2.1%). These gures are similar to those reported by the Arizona Department of Health Services ( 2014 ) for this patient population. To protect patient condentiality, the authors did not directly contact patients, but approached dispensary owners to request assistance in recruiting participants. Dispensary owners informed their patients of the study, and interested patients were directed to a website that provided infor- mation about the research, including a description of the study, an explanation of patients' rights as participants, and information regarding the collection and storage of participant responses (i.e., responses were anonymous and would be stored on a password-protected server and /or computer only accessible to the researchers). If the patient agreed to participate, he or she checked a box indi- cating his or her agreement and the survey questions appeared. Measures Patient conditions. Participants were asked to select from an extensive list of conditions for which they use medical cannabis to control or treat. For each condition selected, participants completed subsequent questions and rated them on ve-point Likert-type scales regarding the degree of relief experienced overall (1 =No relief at all; 5=Almost complete relief), the degree of relief compared to other medications (1 =Much less relief; 5 =Much more relief), and the use of other medications since using medical cannabis (1 =I use other medications much less frequently; 5 =I use other medications much more fre- quently). Higher scores indicated greater relief or more frequent use of other medications. Patterns and methods of cannabis use. Patients reported on the frequency (\"On average, how frequently do you medicate with medical cannabis?\": \"Less than once per month\" to \"Several times per day\") and amount (\"On average, how much medical cannabis do you con- sume in a month?\": \"Less than one gram\" to \"More than one ounce\") of consumption. Patients also completed a single-item measure regarding their preferred method of consumption (smoking, edibles, tinctures, vaporizing, raw consumption, or oils). Perceptions of prior medical cannabis users. Participants were asked if they had used cannabis to treat their condition(s) before its legalization in Arizona. Those who replied \"yes\" were asked to complete four additional items. These items included the perceived safety of acquiring cannabis (\"Compared to when you did not have a medical marijuana card, acquiring cannabis as a medical marijuana card holder feels\": 1 =Much more dangerous; 5 =Much safer), knowledge of straincharacteristics (\"Compared to when you did not have a medical marijuana card, your knowledge of what strain you are acquiring and its characteristics is\": 1 =Much worse; 5 =Much better), condence in a safe product (\"Compared to when you did not have a medical marijuana card, your condence that you are receiving a safe, uncon- taminated product is\": 1 =Much lower; 5 =Much higher), and product effectiveness for treating their condition(s) (\"Compared to when you did not have a medical marijuana card, the effectiveness of the cannabis you receive to treat your condition is\": 1 =Much worse; 5 =Much better). RESULTS The conditions for which patients reported using med- ical cannabis are displayed in Table 1 . Consistent with pre- vious research, the majority of patients reported suffering from chronic pain. Other commonly reported conditions included anxiety, depression, headaches, insomnia, muscle spasms, nausea, and stress. Figure 1 shows the distributions of patients for fre- quency of cannabis use ( Figure 1A ), consumed per month ( Figure 1B ), and preferred method of cannabis consumption ( Figure 1C ). The large majority of patients (83.7%) reported using medical cannabis several times per week or more, with most using medical cannabis daily (61%). Most patients consumed one-half of an ounce of cannabis or less per month (78.1%), and the most popu- lar method of consumption was inhalation (i.e., smoking or vaporizing; 67.2%). Perceived Effectiveness of Medical Cannabis Patients' perceptions of the effectiveness of medical cannabis for treating their condition(s) are presented in Table 1 . The values reflect the percent of patients who reported experiencing, overall, a lot of relief oralmost complete relief from their symptoms and conditions when using medical cannabis (second column), a little more relief ormuch more relief from medical cannabis compared to other medications (third column), and using other medica- tions a little less frequently ormuch less frequently when medicating with cannabis (fourth column). For many of the conditions, patients reported that cannabis was effective for helping them manage their ail- ments. For example, at least 70% of patients reported experiencing a lot of relief oralmost complete relief for 24 of the 42 conditions. Similarly, for 27 of the 42 con- ditions, at least 70% of patients reported experiencing a little more relief ormuch more relief from medical cannabis compared to other medications. Finally, at least 70% of patients reported using other medications a little less frequently ormuch less frequently f o r2 4o ft h e4 2 conditions.

Patient Characteristics, Perceptions, and Behaviors Consistent with research in other states (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Aggarwal et al. 2013 ; Ilgen et al. 2013 ; Nunberg et al. 2011 ; Reinarman et al. 2011 ; Aggarwal et al. 2009 ;R e i m a n 2009 ; O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007 ; Harris et al. 2000 ), participants in the present study were mostly White men. Average patient age, approximately 46 years, differed from that in other states. For exam- ple, average ages reported in studies of patients from California range from 28 to 41 years (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Grella, Rodriguez, and Kim 2014 ;R e i m a n 2009 , 2007 ; Harris et al. 2000 ). Average patient age is somewhat higher in Colorado (42 years of age; Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment 2014 ) and Washington State (41 to 47 years of age; Aggarwal et al. 2013 ,2009 ). In Michigan (46 years of age; Murphy 2013 ) and Montana (47 years of age; Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services 2014 ), average patient age more closely approximates that of Arizona. State-level variation in the average age of medical cannabis patients may in part be explained by the condi- tions that qualify a person to use medical cannabis in each state. For example, the qualifying conditions in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Michigan, and Washington State are less inclusive than those in California, and are generally limited to more debilitating diseases. Individuals who suf- fer from more serious conditions may also be older, which may account for higher average patient ages in states other than California. The variability in these statistics under- scores the risk of generalizing ndings from patients living in California to those residing in other states and highlights the importance of studying patients throughout the United States. State-level differences in regulations also present an opportunity to explore how such regulations shape patient characteristics. A potential avenue for future work may be to study and compare patients in all states that have legal- ized the medical use of cannabis, ideally using a national sample to aid state-level comparisons. Participants in the present study reported that, on average, they consumed cannabis on a daily basis and that inhalation was the preferred method of consump- tion, patterns of use that reflect those found in prior work (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Ilgen et al. 2013 ; Reinarman et al. 2011 ; O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007 ). However, previous research shows that patients consume between Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 5 Volume 00 (00), Xxxx - Xxxx 2015 Downloaded by [Ecole Hautes Etudes Commer-Montreal] at 15:35 01 September 2015 Troutt & DiDonato Medical Cannabis in Arizona FIGURE 2 Distributions of patient responses, by percentage, of their current experiences acquiring and knowledge of medical cannabis compared to their experiences before legalization: (A) the perceived safety of acquiring cannabis; (B) knowledge of medical cannabis characteristics; (C) perceived condence in a safe product; and (D) perceived effectiveness of cannabis for treating their condition(s). 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90% Much More DangerousSomewhat More the SameSomewhat BetterMuch Bette rKnowledge B.

This is in contrast to the ndings of the present study, which show that 78% of patients consumed 0.5 ounces of cannabis per month or less. State-level differences in average patient age, in par- ticular, may affect variation in consumption. Patients in Arizona are, on average, older than those in California, and older patients may consume less cannabis than younger patients. Evidence from the present study supports this hypothesis, as there is a small, but signicant, nega- tive correlation between age and the amount of consumed per month ( r= .11, p<.05). Relatedly, Grella and colleagues ( 2014 ) found that younger patients visited dispensaries more frequently than older patients. Although there are likely other factors that contribute to consumption disparities, these ndings also highlight the importance of studying medical cannabis patients across the US.Patients reported using medical cannabis to treat a variety of conditions. The most commonly reported con- ditions included chronic pain, muscle spasms, nausea, anx- iety, arthritis, depression, headaches, insomnia, and stress. Patients also reported that cannabis was effective for treat- ing the symptoms of many of these conditions, ndings that are consistent with previous research (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Ryan-Ibarra, Induni, and Ewing 2015 ; Aggarwal et al. 2013 ; Harris et al. 2000 ). This effectiveness included feelings of general relief and relief compared to other medi- cations. The conditions for which the highest proportions of patients reported relief included alcohol dependency, anx- iety, bowel distress, depression, insomnia, muscle spasms, and stress. Furthermore, patients reported using other medi- cations less frequently when using cannabis. This is consis- tent with ndings from other studies of patient perceptions (Reiman 2007 ,2009 ; Nunberg et al. 2011 ; Reinarman et al. 2011 ), as well as a study of opiate overdose mortality, which showed that states with legalized medical cannabis had signicantly lower opiate overdose mortality compared Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 6 Volume 00 (00), Xxxx - Xxxx 2015 Downloaded by [Ecole Hautes Etudes Commer-Montreal] at 15:35 01 September 2015 Troutt & DiDonato Medical Cannabis in Arizona to those without legalized medical cannabis (Bachhuber et al. 2014 ). Medical cannabis may benet Arizona patients suf- fering from a variety of conditions. This conclusion has potential policy implications, as patients report deriv- ing benet not only for conditions that fall under the list of conditions that qualify a person to use medical cannabis (e.g., cancer, chronic pain, muscle spasms), but also for conditions that are not listed (e.g., anxiety, depres- sion, insomnia). Ofcials in Arizona previously considered research on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Greer, Grob, and Halberstadt 2014 ) in their decision to include PTSD among Arizona's qualifying conditions. Thus, of- cials may consider the ndings from the present study, in conjunction with other research, to determine the suit- ability of expanding the list of qualifying conditions in Arizona. Legalization and Patient Experiences The present study was, to our knowledge, the rst to examine the effect of legalization on patient's experi- ences with medical cannabis. Regarding safety, the major- ity of patients reported feeling safer acquiring medi- cal cannabis after legalization, and their condence that they were acquiring a safe, uncontaminated product was higher. Patients also reported that their knowledge of the strains they acquired was better and that the cannabis they acquired after legalization was more effective for treating their condition(s) than the cannabis they acquired before legalization. These ndings show that the Arizona medical cannabis program has had some success, as regulations have pro- vided a safe environment for patients to acquire a safe and high-quality product. However, the potential negative effects of medical cannabis legalization were not assessed in the present study. For example, participants in other studies have reported difculties affording legal medi- cal cannabis (Aggarwal et al. 2009 ), a factor which may preclude some individuals from taking advantage of the program, leaving them seeking other, potentially illegal means of cannabis acquisition. Other factors, such as limits on the amount of cannabis that can be purchased or legalissues related to medical cannabis use, may also have negative consequences for some segments of the patient population. The results of this study should be considered in light of some limitations. First, participant recruitment was con- ducted through medical cannabis dispensaries. Although this is a common method of recruitment (e.g., Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Grella, Rodriguez, and Kim 2014 ; Aggarwal et al. 2013 ;R e i m a n 2009 ,2007 ; Harris et al. 2000 ), such samples may have a positive bias for medical cannabis, as individuals who medicate with cannabis but for whom it was not effective are unlikely to be available to participate. However, at least one study using a large, representative sample of current and former medical cannabis users reported similar ndings (Ryan-Ibarra, Induni, and Ewing 2015 ), lending validity to the results of the present study and those of previous research. Second, relatively few patients reported using medical cannabis for some of the conditions. Although this is not surprising, given the low incidence of some conditions, conclusions should be tem- pered for these conditions with respect to the effectiveness of medical cannabis for providing relief and /or for use as a substitute for other medications. Finally, patients' expe- riences acquiring and their knowledge of medical cannabis before and after legalization were assessed retrospectively, using a single measurement time-point. Despite these limitations, this study has signi- cance for understanding the characteristics, behaviors, and perceptions of Arizona medical cannabis patients. Additionally, it highlights the importance of studying patients throughout the US and understanding the poten- tial effects of state-level regulatory differences on patient populations. The ndings regarding the effectiveness of cannabis for treating various conditions have potential policy implications for the state of Arizona, as patients reported that cannabis was effective for treating condi- tions that currently do not qualify individuals for med- ical cannabis use. Furthermore, the results showed that the majority of patients report positive experiences as a result of legalization, although more work is needed to fully understand the consequences of Arizona's medical cannabis program.

Although Health Canada has conducted a small number of stakeholder consultations, the federal government has never polled federallyauthorized cannabis patients. This study is an attempt to learn more about patient needs, challenges andexperiences with the MMAD. Methods: Launched in the spring of 2007, Quality of Service Assessment of Health Canada 's Medical Cannabis Policy and Program pairs a 50 question online survey addressing the personal experiences of patients in the federal cannabis program with 25 semi-guided interviews. Data gathering for this study took place from April 2007 to Jan. 2008, eventually garnering survey responses from 100 federally-authorized users, which at the time representedabout 5% of the patients enrolled in Health Canada 's program. This paper presents the results of the survey portion of the study. Results: 8% of respondents report getting their cannabis from Health Canada, while 66% grow it for themselves. >50% report that they frequent compassion clubs or dispensaries, which remain illegal and unregulated in Canada. 81% of patients would chose certified organic methods of cultivation; >90% state that not all strains are equallyeffective at relieving symptoms, and 97% would prefer to obtain cannabis from a source where multiple strains areavailable. Of the 48 patients polled that had tried the Health Canada cannabis supply, >75% rank it as either \"1\"or \"2\"on a scale of 1-10 (with \"1\"being \"very poor \", and 10 being \"excellent \"). Discussion: 72% of respondents report they are either \"somewhat\" or \"totally unsatisfied \"with Canada 's medical cannabis program. These survey results and relevant court decisions suggest that the MMAR are not meeting theneeds of most of the nation 's medical cannabis patient community. It is hoped this research will help inform policy changes that will better address the needs of Canada 's critically and chronically ill medical cannabis patient population, including the integration of community-based dispensaries into this novel healthcare delivery model. Keywords: medical cannabis, Marihuana Medical Access Regulations, Health Canada, cannabis dispensary Background According to the United Nations Office for Drug Con- trol and Crime Prevention (2001) [1] cannabis is themost popular illicit substanc e in the world. Despite the high rate of recreational use and over 5000 years ofmedical use, there has never been a substantiated caseof death resulting from cannabis overdose [2]. However,the therapeutic use of cannabis remains highly contro-versial, and only a few Western nations have introducedpolicies or programs to al low legal access to medical cannabis. The Canadian government currently allows for limited access to medical cannabis through the MarihuanaMedical Access Regulations (MMAR), which are admi-nistered by Health Canada 's Marihuana Medical Access Division (MMAD). These cour t-ordered regulations are Correspondence: philippe.lucas1969@gmail.com Center for Addictions Research of BC, University of Victoria, TechnologyEnterprise Facility, Room 273, 2300 McKenzie Ave, Victoria, BC, V8P 5C2, CanadaLucas Harm 2012, 9:2 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/2 \u00a9 2012 Lucas; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Initially established in res ponse to patient needs and ineffective or non-existent federal medical cannabis poli-cies, community-based medical cannabis dispensarieshave become the main suppliers of medical cannabis inboth Canada and in many of the 14 U.S. states that havelegalized the medical use of cannabis [3,7]. In Canada, community-based dispensa ries, otherwise known as \"compassion clubs \"currently supply over 30,000 criti- cally or chronically ill Canadians with medical cannabis [8]. Although Canadian dispensaries continue to operate without legal sanction or pr otection, recent research s u g g e s t st h a tt h i sp a t i e n t - c e n tered healthcare delivery model builds social capital and provide patients with asafe supply of cannabis within a supportive environmentthat 's conducive to healing [3,7,5]. A Brief History of Cannabis as a Medicine The medical use of cannabis can be traced back at least5000 years. The oldest reports originate in China andEgypt. It appears in a medical context in the Vedas,India 's oldest religious text, and there are reports of its use as a medicine from fragments of Assyrian texts dat-ing back to 700 B.C. The famous Chinese doctor HuaT'uo (approx. 100 A.D.) reportedly made use of a wine and cannabis mixture as an anesthetic for surgical operations [9]. There are numerous reports of the medicinal proper- ties of cannabis from early in the nineteenth century, the most famous of which is an 1839 report titled \"on the Preparations of the Indian Hemp, or Gunjah \"by the Irish doctor William B. O 'Shaughnessy in which he describes diverse applicatio ns for cannabis, including rheumatism, rabies, cholera, tetanus, cramps and delir- ium tremens [10]. A few years later Ernst Freiherr von Bibra published the renown \"Narcotics and the Human Being \", devoting thirty pages to the therapeutic use of cannabis preparations and hashish [11]. By the late 19 thCentury, cannabis-based preparations were manufactured and marketed by Burroughs-Well-come & Co. In England; and Bristol-Meyers Squib,Parke-Davis, and Eli Lilly in North America. The devel- opment of vaccines to prevent the spread of common infectious diseases, the in creased use of opiates (with the introduction of the hypodermic syringe), and thediscovery of aspirin at the end of the nineteenth andearly twentieth century resulted in cannabis-based medi-cines losing their prevalence in the market place andWestern pharmacopoeia [2].In Canada, the non-medical use of cannabis was out- lawed as part of the Opium and Narcotics Drugs Act of1923, largely based on a series of misleading articleswritten by Emily Murphy for MacLean 'sM a g a z i n e in the early 1920 's which claimed cannabis turned people into [12]. The US 1941 and stated that can- nabis can be used for treating fatigue, coughing,rheumatism, asthma, delirium tremens, migraine head-aches, and the cramps and depressions associated withmenstruation [13,2]. Although modern research into therapeutic applica- tions for cannabis has been seriously stymied by its pro-hibition in most of the Western world, extensive anecdotal reports and a growing body of laboratory and clinical research suggest that it may have many medic-inal uses, including hunger stimulation for wasting syn-drome; anti-emetic and anti-nausea properties in AIDSor cancer chemotherapy; anti-spasmodic properties forMS, epilepsy and other neurological dysfunctions; redu-cing intra-ocular eye pressure in glaucoma; and analge-sic properties in a large number of chronic pain conditions [14-16]. Recent research has found that can- nabis can reduce the use of pharmaceutical drugs andeven be an effective treatment for addiction [17-20]. Medical Cannabis Access in Canada Although the Canadian Addiction Survey suggests thatabout 1 million Canadians use cannabis for medical pur-poses [5], as of January 2010 the MMAD had only authorized 4884 people in Canada to use cannabis leg- ally [21]. Additionally, the federal supply of cannabisproduced by a company called Prairie Plant Systemssince 2000 remains highly problematic due to a lack ofstrain selection, controversial production methods, andpatient concerns over the quality and safety [3-5]. Problems of safe access were noted by the Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs in their final report on cannabis from 2002, stating that: while a process that authorizes the possession and production of marijuana has been established inCanada, this has not ensured that cannabis is suita-bly available to those in need... we have come to theconclusion that the MMAR have become a barrierto access. Rather than providing a compassionate framework, the regulations unduly restrict the avail- ability of cannabis to those who may receive healthbenefits from its use [22]. According to this report, one of the main reasons for the small number of applicants to the program is reluc-tance by physicians to act as gatekeepers to medicinalLucas Harm Reduction Journal 2012, 9:2 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/2Page 2 of 11cannabis. Citing a perceived lack of information on dosage, side effects, and alternate routes of administra-tion to smoking, both the Canadian Medical Associationand the Canadian Medical Protection Agency (whichinsures nearly 95% of Canada 's physicians) have warned against the therapeutic use of cannabis, and have recom- mended that doctors not participate in the federal pro- gram. For example, a CMA press release dated July 9 th, 2003, declares: The CMA has consistently raised concerns about thelack of evidence-based decisions to support theMedical Marijuana Access Regulations, \"said Dr. Dana Hanson, President of the CMA. \"Our unease over use of medical marijuana has been ignored inthis new policy. Physicians should not be the gate-keeper for a substance for which we do not haveadequate scientific proof of safety or efficacy [23]. Such warnings have been a particular deterrent for medical specialists, whose support was initially necessaryfor all applicants to the program that were neither term- inally ill nor likely to die in the next 12 months, such as those suffering from MS, HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C(terminal patients only required the support of a singlephysician). In addition, specialists were simply not avail-able in many smaller rural communities. When com-pounded by the bureaucratic hurdle of filling out a 29-page application that sometimes took in excess of 12months for Health Canada to process, the challenges to participation in this program ranged from onerous to impossible for many potential applicants. Health Canada officially amended the MMAD applica- tion process in 2005 to remove the requirement of asupportive specialist under most circumstances. How- ever, the new \"simplified \"application form was now 33 pages long, and potential applicants continue to faceresistance from the medical community. The burden of this difficult application process is apparent in compar-ing the MMAD with the state-run Oregon MedicalMarijuana Program (OMMP), one of twelve state-admi-nistered medical cannabis programs in the U.S.Although both programs originated in 1999 and havesimilar medical requirements for registration, Oregon 's simple two page application process has led to the regis-tration of 23,873 participants as of October 2009 (as compared to just over 4000 in Canada during the same period) - despite having a population one-tenth that cannabis for therapeu- tic use upon a valid recommendation or confirmation ofdiagnosis from a licensed healthcare practitioner, andreflect a patient-centered response to the suffering of critically and chronically ill Canadians who might bene-fit from the medical use of cannabis [3-5,7]. During the late 1980 's, as rates of HIV and AIDS b e g a nt or i s ei nS a nF r a n c i s c o ,af e wu n d e r g r o u n dd i s - pensaries began offering a safe source of cannabis to those needing it for medical purposes were establishedby compassionate people living with HIV/AIDS anddrug policy reform activists. With the successful passagein 1996 of a state ballot initiative called \"Proposition 215\" , California became the first U.S. state to allow for the legal medical use and distribution of cannabis.Within a few weeks dozens of these \"compassion clubs \" opened, and although they often had varied policies andpractices, their common goal was facilitating access to asafe supply of cannabis for medical users [25]. Sincethen, over 1000 community-based medical cannabis dis-pensaries have opened up in California [26], and it isestimated that they currently supply over 250,000 stateauthorized patients [27]. Similar organizations haveemerged all over the world, and in Canada and the U.S. these dispensaries remain the main source of cannabis- based medicines for therapeutic use [3]. In Canada, a loose network of community-based dis- pensaries provide over 30,000 critically and chronicallyill Canadians access to a safe supply of cannabis withinan environment conducive to healing [8]. AlthoughCanadian dispensaries continue to operate without legalsanction or protection, comm unities, law enforcement, and criminal courts across Canada have shown supportand tolerance for compassion clubs that self-regulate toensure their services are strictly for medical purposes[3-5] Quality of Service Assessment of Health Canada 's Medical Cannabis Policy and Program Although Health Canada hosted a stakeholder consulta- tion in 2003 to address some of the early constitutional and bureaucratic deficiencies of the MMAR, the opinionof patients registered with the MMAD has never beenofficially polled by the federal government in any sys-tematic manner. This survey is an attempt to addressthe dearth of information abou t actual patient experi- ences with medical cannabis and Health Canada 's program. The study was funded by the McMaster Arts Research Council, and ethics approval was granted by theMcMaster Research Ethics Board. Data gathering tookplace from April 2007 to Jan. 2008, eventually garneringsurvey responses from 100 fe derally-authorized users, which at the time represented about 5% of the patientsenrolled in Health Canada 's program. The 50 item self- administered survey combines multiple choice andLucas Harm Reduction Journal 2012, 9:2 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/2Page 3 of 11open-ended questions, and includes items informed by validated questionnaires like the Short-Form PatientSatisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18) and a 2005 ques-tionnaire designed by Belle-Isle and the Canadian AIDSSociety to identify barrier s to medical cannabis experi- enced by Canadians affected by HIV/AIDS [5,6]. In addition to basic socio-demographic data, survey ques- tions generated by the researcher to address the historyof involvement and experiences with the federal pro-gram, cannabis use patterns, and specific symptoms andconditions that cannabis has relieved. For privacy reasons Health Canada does not make a list of federally authorized medical cannabis patientsavailable to the public, so recruiting for this study was conducted through online and hard mail outreach to medical cannabis patient internet discussion groups andcommunity-based dispensar ies. In order to ensure that survey participants were fede rally authorized patients, respondents were asked to ty pe in a specific word only found on the authorized user ID card supplied byHealth Canada as a password to access the online ques-tionnaire. Although the identity of survey respondents will be kept completely anonymous, participants were also asked to supply the registration number from theirHealth Canada medical cannabis ID card to allow forfuture verification/authentication if necessary. Demographic Data Study participants were > 78% male and 20.4% female,and > 87% were 35 or older. Over 93% report that they are Caucasian, with 3 participants identifying as First Nations, 2 as Metis, and 1 as \"black \"(n = 97). In terms of income 36.8% make less than $20,000, and > 61%make less than $30,000, so this is a group that is wellbelow the medium income in Canada, which may be theresult of physical disabili ties stemming from serious and/or chronic medical cond itions. Although a medical expanse income tax claim can be filed for the cost of cannabis purchased from the government, or produced by individuals or their designated grower, there is cur- rently no reimbursement of the actual costs of medicalcannabis. In light of these findings, it is unsurprisingthat 46.3% of respondents state that they can \"never \" afford enough cannabis to relieve their symptoms.Despite the low-income levels, 77.8 had graduated fromhigh school, and 22.3% had a university degree (Table 1). According to Statistics Canada, this is slightly higher than the Canadian average; the 2006 Census found thatjust over 76% of Canadians had graduated from highschool, and that 18% had a university degree equivalentto a Bachelor 's or higher [28]. Although there is no way to verify that this limited sample is representative of participants in the MMAD, arecent study by Reinarman et al assessing populationcharacteristics of 1746 California-based medical canna-bis patients offers some useful comparisons. Reinarmanet al found that 72.9% of their sample was male, withthe researchers theorizing that the underrepresentationof women may be related to the gender-distribution ofcertain kinds of sports or wo rkplace injuries, as well as the \"...double stigma women face in seeking MM (medi- cal marijuana) - for using an illicit drug and for violatinggender-specific norms against illegal behavior in general\"[19]. Additionally, Reinarman et al found this population to be of slightly higher education levels than the generalpopulation, with 93.1% reporting at least high schoolgraduation, and 23.8% having a post-secondary degree, which is also similar to this Canadian survey. Patient Use Patterns and Preferences While the overwhelming majority of participantsreported using cannabis r ecreationally prior to their medical use, > 20% were cannabis-na\u00efve prior to using itmedically (n = 89). The average years of medical use isjust over 10 years, which may be reflective of the older p a t i e n tp r o f i l ea n da d d i t i o n a l l ys u g g e s t st h a tm a n y patients have been using cannabis for far longer thanHealth Canada 's federal program has been in existence. When asked to check off all the major symptoms forTable 1 Demographics of Federally Authorized, Medical Cannabis Patients Female 20.4% Male and Non-University Education 33.3% University (Undergrad, BA) 18.2% University (MA, Reduction Journal 2012, 9:2 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/2Page 4 of 11which they used medical cannabis, most cited multiple symptoms: pain re depression, 56.8% cited nauseareduction/vomiting, cited mood improvement,43.2% cited desire to manage/gain weight, 42% cited reduction in spasticity/tremors, and 23.9% cited side- effects of other medications. Of interest is the highnumber of individuals using cannabis for relaxation,anxiety reduction, depression and mood improvement,suggesting that patients with physical health conditionsmay also be self-medicati ng for mental health issues and/or general improvements in their quality of life (Fig-ure 1). In terms of personal use patterns, over 94% stated that they use it every day, which is considerably higher thanthe 67% reported by Reinarman et al from their Califor-nia patient survey [19]. Ove r 88% smoke cannabis, and 71.6% report that they eat it. Over 52% have used vapor-izers, 18.2% use tinctures and, unlike Europe, less than4% mix it with tobacco. While the rate of smoking issimilar to the Reinarman et al sample, which found that 86.1% smoke cannabis [19], the comparatively higher use v. 24.4%) and vapori-zers (52% v. 21.8%) in the Canadian sample may suggesta greater level of concern and mitigation for potentialhealth impacts associated with smoking within theCanadian patient population [29] (Figure 2). This healthawareness may also explain why 80.7% of respondentsprefer to use cannabis grown using certified organic cul-tivation methods, whereas 19.3% either don 't care (14.5%) or prefer non-organic cultivation (4.8%). In terms of patient preferences and treatment efficacy, 90.9% report that not all strains are equally effective atrelieving their symptoms. As a result, 97.6% would pre-fer to obtain cannabis from a source that offers a \"large selection of different strains \"rather than 1 or 2 strains, and over 90% would prefer to have access to raw canna-bis as well as other methods of ingestion like baked goods, tinctures, and hashish, compared with 9.8% who would prefer a cannabis-only outlet. This creates a starkcontrast between access through Health Canada andthrough community-based dispensaries. While HealthCanada offers a single strain of raw cannabis and noalternatives to smoking, dispensaries make multiplestrains and methods of ingestion other than smokingavailable to patients, including edibles, oils, tinctures, salves, and even oromucosal sprays [3]. When pharma- ceutical like Marinol (dronabinol), Cesamet Figure 1 Major Symptoms . Bar graph of self-reported major symptoms treated with cannabis by survey participants (n = 88).Lucas Harm Reduction Journal 2012, 9:2 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/2Page 5 of 11(nabilone) and Sativex, 34.9% had tried Cesamet, 33.7% h a dt r i e dM a r i n o l ,a n d1 4 %h a dt r i e dS a t i v e x .4 3 %h a dnot tried any of the above, and 81.5% stated that didn 't use any of these pharmaceuticals on a regular basis. Patient Access to Medical Cannabis When asked how they obtain cannabis, only 8.2% ofrespondents report getting their cannabis from HealthCanada (although nearly half state that they have triedthe federal supply), while 80% grow it for themselves orhave it grown for them by a Designated Producer. Over50% report that they frequent compassion clubs or dis-pensaries, 38.8% report getting it from a friend, and > 22% get their medicine from street dealers (Figure 3). When asked how they would rank the quality of the cannabis from their regular source, 87.8% rank it as 7 or above in a scale of 1-10, with 1 being \"Very Poor \",a n d 10 being \"Excellent \". By comparison, of the 41 patients who have tried the federal cannabis supply, over 75%rank it as either 1 or 2 on a scale of 1-10. While 3r e s p o n d e n t sr a n k e di ta se i t h e ra6 ,7 ,o r8 ,n oo n e ranked it any higher (Figure 4). Since Health Canada 's cannabis supply went through some modest improvements in regards to the size of the grind, humidity level, and amount of THC in August2004, respondents were asked when they tried this can-nabis. Of the 39 who answered this question, 37 (or >94%) used the federal supply between 2005-2007, and 2used it before that. As such, it can be deducted that thegeneral dissatisfaction with the quality of the federal cannabis supply is based on patient experiences with the most recent \"improved \"version of this product. W h e na s k e dw h a tt h e i rs i n g l ep r e f e r r e ds o u r c ef o r medical cannabis would be, 65.1% stated that theywould like to grown their own, 24.1% cited dispensaries,6% would like to get their medicine from a pharmacy,4 . 8 %w o u l dl i k et og e ti tf r o maf r i e n d ,w h i l en e i t h e rstreet dealers nor Health Canada were cited by a single patient as their preferred source. This is highly relevant since Health Canada 's proposed regulatory changes include removing the right f or individuals to produce their own cannabis, despite this being the preferredoption cited by most study participants and the optionchosen by the majority of patients in the federal pro-gram [30]. As of January 2010 (the latest statistics avail-able on the Health Canada website) 3576 out of 4884 - or over 73% - of federally authorized patients chose to p r o d u c et h e i ro w nm e d i c i n eo rt oh a v eaD e s i g n a t e dProducer do so for them [21]. If Health Canada intendsto make this program more patient-centered, removing Figure 2 Methods of Ingestion .

Patient Experiences With Health Canada Marihuana Medical Access Division Of study participants, nearly half (49.3%) became feder- ally authorized patients in 2004 or later, while 50.7%joined the program prior to 2004. When asked if theyhad difficulty finding a physician to support their appli-cation, exactly 50% said \"yes \", and 50% answered \"no\", reflecting the diversity and unpredictability of medicalsupport available throughout Canada. In terms of pro-cessing applications, 35.3% had theirs completed by Health Canada within 2-4 months, and 29.4% state that it took 60 days or less. However, 35.2% of participantssuggest that it took over 4 months, with 17.6% citingthat they waited over 12 months for their application tobe processed. This suggests that for those suffering fromserious or terminal conditions, processing times wouldbe a significant concern and may not be quick enoughto allow some patients to legally use cannabis in end-of- life situations. The following set of 6 questions put three statements with positive connotations and 3 statements with negative connotations to survey respondents, and are based onstandardized and validated Short-Form Patient SatisfactionQuestionnaire (PSQ-18) traditionally used to evaluatehealth service delivery at hospitals, clinical and insurancecompanies. In addressing the statement \"I find the applica- tion for a federal authorization simple and uncompli-cated \", \"(42.5%), suggest- ing that for most patients the federal application process isonerous and challenging. When asked to comment on thestatement \"Employees at Health Canada 's MMAD act too businesslike and impersonal towards me \",5 4 \"or agreed \". In regards to the statement \"I am dissatisfied with the service I receive from Health Canada in regards to myuse of medical cannabis \", 68.9% \"agree\" disagree\" . However, when asked if \"Employees at Health Canada 's MMAD treat me in a friendly and courteous manner \", respondents were split, with 35.6% \"agreeing \"or \"strongly Figure 3 Access to Cannabis . Bar graph showing how survey participants access medical cannabis (n = 85).Lucas Harm Reduction Journal 2012, 9:2 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/2Page \"or \". When the statement \"Ih a v ef u l l confidence in the ability of the Health Canada employees that administer this program \"was put to patients, 76.8% \"disagreed \"or \"strongly agreeing \"with the statement, and 17.4% stating that they were \"uncertain \". Finally, when asked \"I am able to get help from Health Canada in regards to mymedical use of cannabis whenever I need it \",8 . 2 % \"agreed or \"strongly agreed 70.6% \"disagreed \"or \"strongly disagreed \", with 21.2% uncertain. The final question of the sur vey asked participants to rate their overall satisfaction with Health Canada 's med- ical cannabis program, and 15.1% of or \"totally unsatisfied \"(51.2%) (Figure 5). This suggests a very poor patient perception of the service quality atHealth Canada Marihuana Medical Access Division,with many potential improvements in application pro-cessing times, cannabis selection and quality and overallresponsiveness to patient queries and concerns. In a federally-funded report titled \"Our Rights, Our Choice,' which examined the human rights, ethical and legal challenges faced by peo ple living with HIV/AIDSwho choose to use medical cannabis, the Canadian AIDS Society found that although between 14 to 37% of people living with HIV/AIDS used cannabis to addresstheir condition, many had faced hurdles accessing thefederal program. The CAS report states that: access to the federal program remains hindered by barriers such as a lack of awareness of the program 's existence, mistrust in the government, misinforma- tion about the program and difficulty in finding aphysician to support their application. Thousands ofseriously ill Canadians must therefore choosebetween breaking the law to use the therapy of theirchoice, or going without, which in many cases com-promises their well-being and quality of life [6]. The results of this federally authorized medical canna- bis patient survey support the findings of the CAS studyand other research into the MMAR/MMAD [3-5]. Discussion Creating policies and procedures for safe patient accessto medical cannabis has proven to be a challenge inCanada and around the world. In the U.S., the 14 statesthat allow for the legal use of cannabis continue to Figure 4 Assessing Health Canada 's Cannabis Supply . Bar graph showing levels of satisfaction with the Health Canada medical cannabis supply on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being \"very poor \"and 10 being \"excellent \"(n = 45).Lucas Harm Reduction Journal 2012, 9:2 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/2Page 8 of 11struggle to protect patients, address access issues, and mitigate community concerns, all of which is made allthe more complicated by ongoing resistance and active legal threats by the federal government [7]. In Canada, patients face multiple challenges to safe access: 1) resis-tance from the medical community to act as gatekeepersto the program; 2) an onerous application process; 3) avery limited and much-criticized cannabis supply; 4)limited income and a lack of national cost-coverage; and5) ongoing social prejudice against the use of medicalcannabis [3-6]. Results fro m this survey suggest that reducing bureaucratic obstacles while increasing patientoptions for access would result in greater levels ofpatient participation and overall satisfaction with thefederal program. While there is a remarkable diversity in the demo- graphics and medical conditions of cannabis patients,some common themes emerge from this research. It isclear that patients 'would like to have a choice of many different strains and forms of ingestion in order to moresafely and effectively address their many different symp-toms and conditions. Since cost continues to be a signif-icant obstacle for patients with low or fixed income,provincial or federal cost-reduction or coverage policiesshould be implemented [5, 6]. The high bureaucratic burden on both patients and physicians is reducing par-ticipation in the program, so allowing healthcare provi- ders to treat cannabis like any other medicine would likely improve uptake and might also alleviate some ofthe social stigma associated with the therapeutic use ofcannabis. Since this study and Health Canada' s own sta- tistics [21] show that the majority of participants in theCanadian federal program chose to produce their ownmedicine, policies and pr ocedures should be put in place that maintain the optio n of personal production while also ensuring that both patients and communitiesare protected from the dangers of poorly-cultivated can-nabis. This could range from basic information fromHealth Canada on safe production practices to electricalinspections at the municipal level. Additionally, withover half of respondents currently accessing cannabisthrough dispensaries and growing evidence that theseorganizations build social ca pital and provide an envir- onment that is conducive to health and healing [3-7],the federal government should work with dispensariesto develop regulations that would incorporate this com-munity-based model of access into Canada 's medical cannabis program. Figure 5 Overall Satisfaction with Health Canada Medical Cannabis Program . Bar graph of overall level of satisfaction with Health Canada 's medical cannabis program reported by survey participants (n = 86).Lucas Harm Reduction Journal 2012, 9:2 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/2Page 9 of 11Finally, many of the challenges faced by the MMAD could have been addressed or avoided through a more robust and active strategy for patient engagement andinvolvement. Although there are many stakeholdersdirectly or indirectly affected by the federal medical can-nabis program - municipalities, police, physicians, etc. - the key stakeholders are the Canada 's critically or chronically ill who could or do benefit from the use of cannabis. Unfortunately, the short history of theMMAR/MMAD shows that the needs and concerns ofpatients has all too often been ignored or overshadowedby other interests and concerns [3-6]. The future suc-cess of this cutting-edge program will depend largely onthe willingness of the federal government to create a truly patient-centered approach to medical cannabis access, including active and ongoing engagement withend-users, support for research into the potential harmsand benefits of medical cannabis, and increased optionsfor patients, potentially through the regulation of com-munity-based dispensaries. There are a few limitations to this study. Although participants represented about 5% of the patient popula- tion in the program at the time of the survey there is no way to know how representational this cohort is to therest of the participants in the MMAD since HealthCanada has never released any demographic informationabout federally authorized users. Additionally, sincerecruiting was largely done online and through medicalcannabis patient lists and groups, it is possible that thismore active population has a higher level of dissatisfac- tion with the federal program. However, the general demographics of participants in this study is similar tothose identified by Reinarman in a recent U.S.-basedstudy [19], and many of the patient needs and chal-lenges that came to light in this survey support previousresearch on Canada' s medical cannabis population and associated federal program [3-6]. It is hoped that thissurvey, which represents the first polling ever conducted solely on federally authorized patients in Canada, will assist policy-makers here and abroad develop morepatient-centered strategies for safe access to medicalcannabis.

Australians who currently use ca nnabis medicinally do so illegally and without assurances of quality control. Given the dearth of local information on this issue, this study explored the experiences of medical cannabis users. Methods: Australian adults who had us ed cannabis for medical purp oses were recruited using media stories. A total of 147 respondents were screened by phone and anonymous questionnaires were mailed, to be returned by postage paid envelope. Results: Data were available for 128 participants. Long term and regular medical cannabis use was frequently reported for multiple medical conditions including chronic pain (57%), depression (56%), arthritis (35%), persistent nausea (27%) and weight loss (26%). Cannabis was perceived to provide \"great relief\" overall (86%), and substantial relief of specific symptoms such as pain, nausea and insomnia. It was also typically perceived as supe rior to other medications in terms of undesirable effects, and the extent of relief provided. Howeve r, nearly one half (41%) experienced conditions or symptoms that were not helped by its use. Th e most prevalent concerns related to its illegality. Participants reported strong support for their use from clinicians and family. There was almost universal interest (89%) in participating in a clin ical trial of medical cannabis, and strong support (79%) for investigating alternative delivery methods. Conclusion: Australian medical cannabis users are riskin g legal ramifications, but consistent with users elsewhere, claim moderate to substantial benefits from its use in the management of their medical condition. In addition to strong public support, medical cannabis users show strong interest in clinical cannabis research, including the investigation of alternative delivery methods. Background While cannabis has long been part of folk pharmacopeia, there is a burgeoning body of research on its therapeuticpotential. This has largely drawn on scientific advances inour understanding of the pharmacology of cannabis, and its complex interactions with the central nervous system, particularly endogenous brain reward pathways [1]. Inaddition to basic experimental research, case reports, sur-veys of people using cannabis for medical conditions and prospective clinical trials of cannabis-based medicines areconsolidating the evidence that cannabis may play a rolein the management of some medical conditions. Authori-tative reviews of this evidence indicate that cannabis has therapeutic potential for conditions such as HIV- and can- cer-related wasting, nausea and vomiting resulting fromPublished: 04 October 2005 Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 doi:10.1186/1477-7517-2-18Received: 17 August 2005 Accepted: 04 October 2005 This article is available from: http:// www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/2/1/18 \u00a9 2005 Swift et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

While current research reveals exciting therapeutic oppor- tunities, there is an ongoing debate about the virtues ofobtaining such benefits from the complex chemical cock-tail contained in the whole plant or from one or more components isolated and developed into a synthetic phar- maceutical product. This debate cross-cuts importantissues such as the difficulties of reliable dosing whenusing the natural product, whether the potential harms ofsmoking cannabis due to its ease of titration overshadowits therapeutic benefits, and whether different medical conditions will respond more favourably to the whole plant or to different constituents in isolation or combina-tion. However, underlying these issues is the reality thatmost people who use cannabis medicinally do so by usingblack market supplies of an illicit drug. As with the opiates, evaluations of the therapeutic poten- tial of cannabis occur in the context of a vigorous political debate on the use of an illicit drug with dependencepotential for medicinal purposes. This situation is clearlyevident in the United States, where there is an ongoinglegal challenge by the Federal Government over the States'rights to allow cannabis to be used by registered medical users. Despite Canada's recent decision to provide a con- trolled supply of natural cannabis to registered users, andapprovals for the marketing of Sativex, a pharmaceuticalcannabis extract, in some countries, currently most userswould rely on home-grown cannabis, or suppliesobtained from friends, families, dealers and medical com- passion clubs. To date, there has been little interest in Australia in for- mally investigating the therapeutic potential of cannabisor investigating the practices of current medical users. In1999 the NSW State Government commissioned a Work- ing Party to investigate the issue and recommend research and legislative options. Among their recommendationswere: controlled clinical trials of cannabis, investigationsinto delivery methods other than smoking, surveys of cur-rent medical cannabis users and legislative amendmentsto allow compassionate use [4]. Subsequently, in 2003the NSW Government announced it would conduct clini- cal trials, but despite generating significant publicity, there has been no further commitment by the NSW Gov-ernment on this issue. The 2004 National Drug StrategyHousehold Survey found widespread public support formedical cannabis use, with 68% supporting a change inlegislation to permit use for medical purposes and 74% supporting a clinical trial of medicinal cannabis use [5]. It is not known how many people use cannabis for medici-nal purposes in Australia. Those who do use it engage inan illegal behaviour and risk arrest. Those that rely onblack market supplies use a product of unknown source and quality. Several surveys in the US, UK, Germany and Canada [6- 12] have reported perceived improvements in a variety ofmedical conditions following cannabis use. However, weknow very little about the experiences of Australian users, and how they compare to findings in other studies. These authors are aware of only two unpublished Australianstudies conducted in northern NSW; in 1998 a survey of202 users recruited at the Nimbin HEMP Embassy [13],and in 2003 a survey of 48 members of a medical canna-bis information service [14]. This paper presents the results of a study of 128 users, which aimed to learn more about their patterns of use,experiences and concerns, and interest in participating ina medical cannabis trial. Methods Sample The sample comprised 128 people who used cannabis formedical purposes. To be eligible for the study, participantshad to be living in Australia and to be currently using/have previously used cannabis for medical purposes.While the study targeted residents of Australia's most pop- ulous state, NSW (pop: approximately 6.7 million), we did not exclude participants from other parts of Australia(total pop: approximately 20 million). As it is not known how many Australians use cannabis for medical purposes it was not possible to obtain a repre- sentative sample of such users. As this was an exploratory study to see who responded to a general call for participa-tion in the survey, we did not target groups representingpeople with specific medical conditions (e.g., HIV/AIDS,multiple sclerosis) or hospital departments known to treatpatients who may benefit (e.g., oncology, chronic pain clinics). Participants were primarily recruited from oppor- tunistic media stories between November 2003 andAugust 2004, in newspapers, on radio and television. Inaddition, the Medical Cannabis Information Service(MCIS) in Nimbin, NSW, offered to tell its membersabout the survey and the International Association forCannabis as Medicine (IACM), in Germany, placed the questionnaire on its website. A total of 147 enquiries were received between December 2003 and August 2004 by telephone and email andapproximately 170 questionnaires distributed (some peo-ple requested multiple copies to distribute). For example, the media stories generated enquiries from several GPs who said they would inform certain patients of the study.Of the 131 questionnaires returned, 128 were used foranalysis (75% of questionnaires sent out). Of the threeHarm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 3 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)discarded questionnaires, one respondent was a recrea- tional cannabis user and two had never used cannabis. Questionnaire The survey comprised an anonymous mail-out question-naire, adapted from one developed by the MCIS in a recent study of its members [14]. Several issues were cov- ered, including medical conditions/symptoms experi-enced, patterns of medical cannabis use, symptom reliefand effects of use, comparison of cannabis to other medi-cations, source and legal concerns (e.g., arrest), other con-cerns over use, opinion of family, friends and medical personnel, and interest in participating in a cannabis trial. The final version incorporated comments from research-ers and clinicians interested in this issue. Procedure The study received ethics approval from the University ofNew South Wales Social/Health Human Research Ethics Advisory (HREA) Panel. Interested persons were screened for eligibility over the phone and informed of the purposeof the survey; assurances of anonymity and confidentialitywere provided. Questionnaires were mailed to partici-pants, completed anonymously and returned in astamped, self-addressed envelope. Addresses were destroyed when the questionnaire was posted.Analyses Data were entered into SPSS (Version 12.0.1). As this was an exploratory study with a small sample size, this paperreports descriptive statistics only. Percentages are pre-sented for categorical data; means (for normally distrib-uted) and medians (for skewed data) are presented for continuous data. While data are usually presented on the overall sample, gender and age differences are presentedfor some variables, where they are of interest. Results Demographics The sample was 63% male. Participants had a median ageof 45 yrs (range 24-88), with almost one third (31%)aged 50 years or over, and one in ten (9%) aged 60 yearsplus. While the study targeted NSW residents (who repre-sented 58% of participants), responses came from acrossAustralia, especially Queensland (15%) and Victoria(12%). Residents of other States and Territories each com- prised less than 3% of participants. Participants reported a wide range of medical conditions and symptoms associated in the literature with the use ofmedicinal cannabis (Table 1), most commonly chronicpain (53%) and arthritis (38%). Approximately one in five reported (22%), weight loss (21%) and per- sistent reported (60%). Up to 35other conditions/symptoms were listed, commonlyTable 1: Conditions/symptoms experienced, duration, and conditions/symptoms requiring cannabis relief (n = 128).

It is important to note that we did not ask participants to distinguish between primary symp- toms/conditions for which they sought treatment (e.g.,cancer) and conditions which may have been secondaryto this (e.g., depression) or consequent to treatment (e.g.,chronic nausea). Multiple conditions (mean = 3.7, SD =2.1, range = 1-10), of lengthy duration, were the norm, with three quarters (84%) reporting more than one con- dition and two thirds (67%) at least three conditions.Congruent with this picture, cannabis was used to relievemultiple symptoms (median = 3, range = 1-12), espe-cially chronic pain (57%), depression (56%), arthritis(35%), persistent nausea (27%) and weight loss (26%).Patterns of medical cannabis use Participants had first tried cannabis for medical purposesat a median age of 31 years (range = 14-77). More thanone quarter (29%) had discovered its therapeutic benefitsas a spin-off from recreational use; others had tried it fol-lowing concerns about the side-effects of their medica-tions (14%), or a belief their medications or treatment were ineffective (13%), or had acted on the recommenda- tion of a medical practitioner (10%) or friend (10%). Table 2 presents data on patterns of medical use. Most (85%) were currently using cannabis therapeutically, evenif sporadically. For those who had stopped, the main rea- sons were: their inability to obtain a regular supply (9/19 people), its illegality (7/19), cost (7/19) and disliking theside effects or route of use (each 3/19). Of those usingintermittently, many reported their use would be moreregular if it were more readily availability and cheaper. Medical use was typically long-term and regular. Use of less than one year was uncommon (12%), with more than half (61%) having used it for at least six years; one in fivereported very long-term use (more than 20 years). Mostused at least weekly (75%), and more than half (59%)used almost daily or daily. Approximately one in five(22%) specified they used it \"as required\" for their condi- tion (e.g., when pain was severe). Women tended to report shorter term use than men (52% vs. 31% citing useof 5 years or less). It was most common for participants' medical use to be stable (22%) or largely unchanged since they started (17%), although it was most common for the amount used to vary according to their condition (35%). Aboutone in ten indicated some increase in dose had beenrequired (12%), while few reported a decrease (5%).Women tended to report more variable (44% vs. 29% ofmen) or short term use (15% vs. 6% of men); men tended to report an increase in the amount needed (17% vs. 4% of women). In addition to medical use, three quarters (80%) of partic- ipants had used cannabis recreationally. Recreational usewas less common among older participants (75% and97% of recreational users were aged less than 50 years and 65 years, respectively). For almost half (46%), use in the past year had been solely medicinal, but the remainderreported recent recreational use - 29% in the past week,19% in the past month and a further 6% in the past year. Route of use While most people had tried multiple routes for relief,overall smoking was the route most commonly reported(91%). Approximately half the sample (49%) alsoTable 2: Patterns of medical cannabis use (n = 128 unless specified) Total (%)Male (%)Female (%) Current use 85 86 83 Length of use <1 year 12 9 171-5 yrs 27 23 356-10 yrs 20 26 10 11-15 yrs 9 10 8 16-20 yrs 10 10 10>20 yrs 21 23 19 Frequency of use (n = 126) several times a day 39 45 296-7 days/wk 24 19 31 1-5 days/wk 14 14 13 less than weekly 2 3 2very seldom 2 1 2as required 20 18 23 Method(s) of use (n = 127) eaten as cooked recipe 49 48 50drunk as tea 7 8 6 smoked as cigarette (joint) 65 58 77 smoked as dry pipe (chillum) 24 28 19smoked as water pipe (bong) 54 58 46vaporiser 8 11 2eaten as leaf/flower matter 3 4 2 Most helpful method of use (n = 126) eaten as cooked recipe 16 15 17 drunk as tea 2 3 2smoked as cigarette (joint) 31 26 40smoked as dry pipe (chillum) 10 13 4smoked as water pipe (bong) 33 36 29vaporiser 2 3 2 other 6 5 6Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 5 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)smoked tobacco, and two thirds (64.1%) mixed their can- nabis with tobacco. Eating cannabis in cooked recipes was also very prevalent (49%). While vaporisers are not readily available in Aus-tralia, 8% had used them. In addition, four people hadused tinctures and one used it topically in the bath or as a cream for a skin condition. Overall, smoking was also considered to be the most helpful route of use for symp- tom relief (74%), although concerns about this route ofuse were widespread. Consistent with Australian researchon preferred route of use and age [15], older users (aged50 years +) typically found joints the most helpful method of use (41% vs. 26% of younger users), while younger users preferred the use of waterpipes (43% vs.13% of older users). When asked to comment on the good and bad points of different methods of ingestion the most consistentresponse was that smoking of any form, particularly with tobacco, was detrimental to respiratory function (and health). This was of particular concern to non-smokers,some of whom did not know how to cook cannabis reci-pes. Despite attracting the bulk of negative comments, itspopularity seemed to lie with its instant effect, its ease oftitration and cost-effectiveness compared to the oral route. It seemed to \"do the job\". Eating was seen to be a much healthier option - it was \"safer\", tasty when cookedin a recipe, less obvious than smoking and could be donevirtually anywhere. Some people liked its slow onset andlong-lasting effects, but others claimed difficulties withtitration and slow onset made it expensive and ineffective for rapid symptom relief. Effects of cannabis use When asked to rate the overall effects of cannabis on a Lik- ert scale ranging from \"I feel a lot worse\" to \"gives perceived relief\" (86%) or a little relief (14%). No one believed it had been detrimental to their condition or symptoms. Positive ratings were (\"great\" or \"good\" relief) were also typical for its ability to relieve specific symptoms (Table3). In addition, several other symptoms were noted,primarily insomnia (13% used for insomnia; of these 82% derived \"great\" relief). Approximately three quarters of participants (71%) claimed to have experienced a return of their symptoms orcondition on stopping cannabis, especially: pain (53% ofthose who claimed a return of symptoms), depression or anxiety (30%), insomnia (11%), spasm (10%) and nau- sea/vomiting or lack of appetite (9%).Only one in ten (11%) participants reported symptoms they believed were unrelated to their medical condition upon stopping cannabis, citing symptoms congruent withcannabis withdrawal such as anxiety or mood disturbance(including paranoia), insomnia, loss of appetite, restless-ness and vivid dreams. Comparison with other medicines Almost two thirds (62%) of respondents claimed thatthey decreased or discontinued their use of other medi-cines when they started using cannabis medicinally. Thiswas more common in males (65% vs. 58% of females)and older participants (aged 50 years +) (70% vs. 59% among younger participants). For some people this was aTable 3: Symptom relief (n = 128) Symptom relief required...* Total (%)Male (%)Female (%) Nausea relief 48 56 44 Of these, received: great relief 53 51 62 good relief 44 46 35 no effect 3 3 4 Pain relief 83 83 83Of these, received: great relief 55 49 65good relief 45 52 35 no effect 0 0 0 Ability to cope emotionally 66 70 60 Of these, received: great relief 45 40 54good relief 54 58 46no effect 1 2 0 Appetite stimulant 51 55 44 Of these, received: great relief 52 55 48good relief 46 46 48no effect 2 0 5 Decrease in spasms/tremor 39 36 44Of these, received: great relief 43 43 43 good relief 55 54 57no effect 2 4 0 Relief through relaxation 83 88 75Of these, received: great relief 72 69 78 good relief 28 31 22 no effect 0 0 0 * No-one reported their condition was made worseHarm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 6 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)substantial change, representing a shift away from chronic, high-dose medication use. Perhaps not surprisingly, cannabis was typically perceived as superior to other medications in terms of undesirableeffects, and the extent of relief provided (Table 4). Thus, cannabis was rated to produce equivalent (8%) or worse side effects (3%) by a minority of therapeutic users. It wasconsidered to work \"a bit\" or \"much better\" than othermedicines, or to be the only source of relief, by more thanthree quarters (82%). Two participants made the interest-ing comment that cannabis worked differently to other medicines, so could not be directly compared. Despite the very positive response to the use of cannabis, nearly one half (41%; 36% of men and 50% of women)found it did not help certain conditions/symptoms.Almost one third (29%) said cannabis was less effectivefor certain types of pain, or extreme pain, with a further 12% specifying migraine or headache pain. Nearly one in ten (8%) reported no effect on depression or anxiety.More than one in ten (14%) specified that while cannabiscould ease their symptoms and enabled them to cope,they realised that it could not cure their underlying condi-tion. Younger participants were more likely than older participants to claim a condition not helped by cannabis (45% vs. 32% of those aged 50 years +).Supply issues Participants obtained medical cannabis from multiplesources (median = 1, range = 1-6; 44% had two or moresources), especially friends or family (58%) and dealers(42%). A substantial proportion grew their own (38%)while few (6%) obtained it from a compassion club or cooperative. Among those who purchased cannabis, the median weekly outlay was $50 (range = $1-$500, n = 95). When asked to comment on the variability of the canna- bis they used, those who could obtain a consistent supplyof high quality cannabis that suited their needs were in theminority. Typically, participants noticed variability along a number of lines, such as potency, effectiveness, intoxica- tion and side-effects, which made titration difficult. Whilesome noted the importance of factors such as the part ofthe plant used (e.g., leaf versus head/buds), strain (e.g.,sativa versus indica ), soil and climate, the overwhelming responses focussed on hydroponic versus soil-grown can- nabis (\"bush bud\" or cannabis versus purchased cannabis. Hydroponic cannabis was almost universally unpopular and was avoided where possible - despite its greaterpotency, it was also considered shorter acting, produced greater tolerance and worse side-effects than other canna- bis. By comparison, soil-grown cannabis was perceived toTable 4: Comparison of cannabis with oth er medications (n = 128 unless specified).

However, it was also perceived as harder to get. Home grown canna-bis was seen as the best method of obtaining a consistent,safe supply of medicinal quality. A common response wasthat purchased cannabis was not to be trusted, and thatunscrupulous growers who were more concerned with yield and greed compromised the quality of their crop with chemicals such as growth hormone and pesticides. Concerns A minority (13%) had no concerns over their medical can-nabis use. Concerns over potential health effects (32%) or the risk of dependence (21%) were overshadowed by those relating to its illegal status (76%), the fear of beingarrested (60%) and cost (51%). Indeed, one quarter(27%) claimed to have been arrested, cautioned or con-victed in relation to their medical cannabis use, with thisoutcome more commonly reported by men (31% vs. 19%of women) and younger users (30% vs. 16% of users aged 50 years +). Other concerns mentioned (15%) were: the stigma of using, issues around parenting, pregnancy andrelationships, availability, quality and difficulties in doseadjustment. Support from others and interest in clinical trial Most participants had a regular doctor (90%) and about ahalf had a regular specialist (55%). Virtually all (90%)had informed a clinician of their therapeutic use, typicallyreporting a supportive response from GPs (75% of thosetold), specialists (74%) and nurses (81%). Family andfriends were largely considered supportive of the partici- pant's use (71%). Not surprisingly, there was widespread support for Gov- ernment provision of cannabis to patients in a variety ofcircumstances. At least three quarters supported the sup-ply of cannabis to any patient who was permitted to use it by being registered under a Government scheme (82%); more specifically, those patients who: could not afford tobuy it on a regular basis (82%), could only purchase it onthe black market (81%), couldn't ensure a consistent sup-ply (75%), or were worried about quality control issues(77%). More than half endorsed the supply of patientswho did not know anyone capable of growing it (72%), were concerned about hydroponically grown cannabis (72%), or who needed a supply quickly (66%). Although not all participants were NSW residents, there was almost universal interest (89%) in participating in aclinical trial, in which a controlled supply of cannabis was grown and provided to registered medical cannabis users. There was also strong, although lesser, interest in tryingalternative delivery methods such as a spray or tablet(79%).While for some people, the availability of any cannabis- derived product that worked was their prime concern, alternative delivery methods were considered attractive asthey obviated the necessity to smoke, removed concernabout engaging in illegal behaviour and having to accessthe black market, and were more portable and acceptablethan smoking. The main caveats on an alternative were that it was easy to titrate, quick, efficient, reliable and nat- ural or safe - sprays and vaporisers were mentioned spe-cifically by some as preferable to pills in this regard. Aclear theme was the desire to keep the holistic, naturalproperties of cannabis rather than produce a chemical/synthetic drug with numerous binding and carrying agents. Nevertheless, there was recognition that different medical conditions may require different approaches,such as different active agents (e.g., THC versus other can-nabinoids), strains or methods (e.g., slow release pill ver-sus fast-acting spray). The main reason for not supporting alternatives appeared to be that using the whole plant in its natural state was perceived to be the best method. In addition, for some theritual of cannabis use was perceived as part of its medici-nal benefit. There was also concern at political interfer-ence and its potential for exploitation and corruption in atrial. Discussion This exploratory study examined the patterns of medicinalcannabis use among a sample of 128 Australian adultswho responded to media stories about this issue. Firstly,we need to acknowledge its limitations. As we do not know how many Australians use cannabis medicinally or their characteristics, we relied on the recruitment of vol-unteers through purposive sampling. Instead of targetinga particular group we used media stories disseminatedwidely on the radio, television and in newspapers toattract a cross-section of people. Thus, these results may not be representative of the experiences of all medicinal users, and may be affected by selection bias by excludingthose who did not have access to these media, who didnot wish to or could not contact us or did not return thequestionnaire. We also attracted participants whose expe-riences with medical cannabis were typically positive, sothey have little to tell us about people who have not found cannabis helpful or pleasant therapeutically. However, they still provide important information on these people'sexperiences, and raise important issues regarding the useof black market supplies of the cannabis plant and thedevelopment of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. As thequestionnaire was self-completed, there was potential for misunderstanding of the questions. However, the word- ing was straightforward, contact details were provided inthe event of misunderstanding, and the results wereremarkably consistent across participants, which encour-Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 8 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)ages us that the questions were understood. Despite being anonymous, several participants provided us with contact details in case further information was needed, and wroteadditional comments about their experiences and atti-tudes. In addition, many of the findings are remarkablyconsistent with the findings of other local and interna-tional studies, as indicated below. People in this study reported regular, ongoing medical use over quite long periods - with 61% using for more thanfive years and 20% reporting very long-term use of morethan 20 years. However, as Ware and colleagues noted intheir study of almost 1000 medical users [10], this was a group of chronically ill people with multiple long-stand- ing conditions. The perceived need for alternative or addi-tional symptom relief may reflect the fact that we recruiteda sample of particularly entrenched medicinal cannabisusers who were dissatisfied with conventional treatments,that medicinal cannabis use is more likely to consideredan option by people who find conventional treatments and medications unsatisfactory, or that many had been exposed to its perceived medical benefits quite early dueto their recreational use. Larger studies addressing a broadcross-section of users may better answer this question. Consistent with the literature on the conditions for which cannabis has been indicated, chronic pain, arthritis, per- sistent nausea and weight loss were among the most com-mon conditions for which cannabis relief was sought.However, depression was the most common condition:m o r e t h a n h a l f ( 5 6 % ) u s e d c a n n a b i s t o r e l i e v e d e p r e s -sion, and two thirds (66%) used it to cope emotionally, universally obtaining great or good relief. Other studies have also reported cannabis use for the relief of depres-sion, although not at this level [8-10,14]. The relationshipbetween depression and cannabis use is controversial,with recent literature indicating that cannabis use may beimplicated in depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviours This would suggest that regular medicinal use may be contraindicated by placing people at risk of depres- sion or self-harm. However, we do not know the type oraetiology of the depression cited by our participants.Many may have experienced depression and stress associ-ated with their physical condition, which may have beenalleviated along with any physical relief. The risk may also be greatest among heavy, younger users and those who may already be vulnerable to mental ill health due to theirlife circumstances [16-18]. Medical cannabis use patternsmay not typically be regular enough to pose a great risk.Regardless, it is important that people considering the useof medical cannabis are aware of the risks of use [19]. A recent paper [20] has suggested that THC and cannabid- iol, two major components of cannabis, may help allevi-ate bipolar disorder, recommending a pharmaceuticalproduct would be a safer option than crude cannabis, in which the balance of components is variable. Consistent with local and international research on peo- ple with a variety of medical conditions [8-12,14], mostparticipants claimed moderate to substantial benefitsfrom cannabis, both in terms of their overall condition and management of individual symptoms. It was typically considered more effective and less aversive than othermedications in managing their condition(s), the symp-toms of which commonly re-emerged upon stopping(71%). While their use was often complementary to othermedications and treatment, 62% had decreased or discon- tinued use of other medications when they commenced medicinal cannabis use. Nevertheless, cannabis was not apanacea - it did not help all conditions, particularly cer-tain types of pain, and there was recognition that while itsubstantially improved quality of life it was not a cure.This is not necessarily surprising, as overall well-being andspecific symptoms have multiple causes and can be affected by several factors, and is borne out by recent con- trolled clinical trials, for example, on chronic pain [21]. As others have reported (e.g., [8-10] we also found that in addition to medical use, recreational use was common:most (80%) had used cannabis recreationally, with about one half (54%) of these reporting some recent use. Indeed, 29% had discovered its therapeutic potentialthrough their recreational use. One participant raised theissue that part of the therapeutic effect for them was theritual of use and the \"high\" experienced [6]. Thisdemonstrates the difficulty of precisely identifying the therapeutic component when people are using the natural plant matter, and will continue to present a challenge forthe development of cannabis pharmaceuticals. Whilesome people may find the illegality, route of use and psy-choactive effects of natural cannabis undesirable and pre-fer a manufactured pharmaceutical product, several in this survey claimed to prefer the holistic delivery of all the compounds present when using the natural plant. Weneed to know more about the effect of the different activechemicals on medical conditions and how their therapeu-tic potential is mediated by the context of use. Nonetheless, this was not simply a sample of recreational users, especially as we attracted many older users who used exclusively for medical reasons (75% of those aged50 years+). They did not fit the recreational user stereo-type, were willing to take the risk of using an illicit drug,exposure to the illicit drug market and the possibility ofarrest to gain symptom relief. Indeed, the most common concern over medicinal use was its illegality, fear of arrest and cost (all >50%). One quarter (27%) of participantshad experienced legal ramifications due to their use. Sev-eral people commented that they had no alternative thanHarm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 9 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)using an illegal drug, claiming that other medicines with negative and toxic effects (e.g., opiates) were legally pre- scribed, and that if nothing else worked for them they hadthe right to access cannabis without fear or stigma. Severalmade pleas for medical cannabis use to be treated as amedical, rather than a legal, issue, as their health andquality of life were at stake. Smoking was the most common method of use; in addi- tion, many were tobacco smokers or mixed cannabis withtobacco. Given the similarities between cannabis andtobacco smoke this is of particular concern for peoplewho are ill, especially those with compromised immune systems. Despite acknowledgement of the risks of smok- ing and concerns expressed over its effects, it was consid-ered the most helpful route of use. While eating wasperceived as much healthier, until satisfactory solutionsare achieved on titration and dosing issues, smoking willno doubt continue to be a popular method of obtainingrelief. Cannabis dependence was a concern for one in five partic- ipants (21%). This study provided indirect evidence thatparticipants were unlikely to experience withdrawalsymptoms on ceasing medical use, but this was only acrude measure. While the risk of dependence is probably low when used medicinally, this risk needs to be weighed up with the other concerns of the patient - for example, itmay be low on the list of concerns for those with terminalillness [19]. Finally, participants reported that family and friends were likely to know about and support their medical cannabis use. These data also indicate that the medical profession isencountering, and frequently supporting, patients whouse cannabis for symptom relief. Given their central rolein the management of illness, it is important that clini-cians are educated about the effects of cannabis, in order to assist patients in making informed decisions about their treatment. There was also clearly great interestamong participants in a clinical trial and scope to investi-gate methods of delivery that avoid the health concernsassociated with smoking cannabis, keeping in mind thatsome participants were reluctant to use a pharmaceuticalproduct. In addition to distrust of unscrupulous partici- pants in the black market, some were also distrustful of Government's motives and role in therapeutic research. Itis therefore vital that any clinical trials are conducted in arigorous, independent manner. Conclusion Overall, these findings are consistent with those of othersurveys, in revealing the perceived effectiveness of canna-bis for the relief of symptoms associated with several med-ical conditions. While a small study, it has severalimplications. Firstly, people are risking the use of an illicit drug for its perceived therapeutic effects, and in some cases being arrested. Secondly, they are informing theirclinicians about their medical use and frequently receiv-ing support, highlighting the importance of ensuring cli-nicians are informed about cannabis. Finally, in additionto strong public support, medical cannabis users show strong interest in clinical cannabis research, including the investigation of alternative delivery methods.

One of the primary changes in the new program has been to move from a single Licensed Producer (LP) of cannabis to multiple Licensed Producers. This is the rst comprehensive survey of patients enrolled in the MMPR. Methods: Patients registered to purchase cannabis from Tilray, a federally authorized Licenced Producer (LP) within the MMPR, were invited to complete an online survey consisting of 107 questions on demographics, patterns of use, and cannabis substitution effect. The survey was completed by 271 respondents. Results: Cannabis is perceived to be an effective treatment for diverse conditions, with pain and mental health the most prominent. Findings include high self-reported use of cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs particularly pharmaceutical opioids (30%), benzodiazepines (16%), and (25%), cigarettes/tobacco (12%), and illicit drugs (3%). A signicant percentage of patients (42%) reported accessing cannabis from illegal/unregulated sources in addition to access via LPs, and over half (55%) were charged to receive a medical recommendation to use cannabis, with nearly 25% paying $300 or more. Conclusion: The nding that patients report its use as a substitute for prescription drugs supports prior research on medical cannabis users; however, this study is the rst to specify the classes of prescription drugs for which cannabis it is used as a substitute, and to match this substitution to speci c diagnostic categories. The ndings that some authorized patients purchase cannabis from unregulated sources and that a signicant percentage of patients were charged for medical cannabis recommendations highlight ongoing policy challenges for this federal program. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Background The past two decades have witnessed a resurgence of interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabis, with several nations and jurisdictions developing regulations to allow for access to cannabis for medical purposes (Fischer, Murphy, Kurdyak, Goldner, & Rehm, 2015 ). One potential salutary consequence of these developmentsis the substitution of cannabis for other substances (Allsop et al., 2014; Lucas et al., 2013, 2016 ). Indeed, examinations of juris- dictions with legal access to medical cannabis have reported reductions in negative health outcomes associated with the use of other substances, such as opioid overdose (Bachhuber, Salone, Cunningham, & Barry, 2014 ), and cannabis substitution has been forwarded as a mechanism to help explain these public health benets. Consistent with this proposal, several large surveys conrm that medical cannabis users report substituting cannabis for other medications (Lucas, 2012a; Lucas et al., 2013, 2016; Reiman, 2009 ). Although extant surveys have provided broad evidence of cannabis substitution, the extent to which cannabis is* Corresponding author at: Social Dimensions of Health, University of Victoria, 3800 Finnerty Rd., Victoria, BC, V8P 2017 Elsevier rights reserved.International Journal of Drug Policy 42 (2017) 30-35 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect International Journal of Drug Policy journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locat e/drugpo used to substitute for distinct classes of substances by distinct patient groups has not been systematically examined from a patient-centred perspective. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by examining the extent to which physician- authorized medical cannabis users report using cannabis as a substitute for speci c classes of substances, and by disaggregating this examination according to condition-based patient group. We also add to the nascent literature on medical cannabis use by describing patient characteristics, patterns of use and barriers to access. In 2001 Canada become one of the rst nations to develop a program to allow access to cannabis for medical purposes. The program has undergone numerous convolutions, culminating in the 2014 establishment by Health Canada of the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) (Walsh et al., 2013 ), and ultimately in the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations in August 2016. One of the primary changes of the MMAR was the authorization of multiple Licensed Producers of cannabis: as of August 2016 >30 federally authorized Licensed Producers provide hundreds of strains of cannabis, as well as cannabis extracts to approximately 67,075 patients (Ofce of Medical Cannabis, 2016 ). The ACMPR adds regulations by which patients can produce their own cannabis, an option that was removed in the transition from MMAR and MMPR, and subsequently re-established through a court decision (Allard et al. v. Canada). In contravention of the MMPR/ACMPR, a large number of patients access cannabis through community-based outlets known as dispensaries or compassion clubs, as well as from friends and other sources. In addition, although many Provincial medical colleges expressly forbid physicians from charging patients for providing patients with medical cannabis prescriptions, 3rd party patient aggregator services have emerged that provide cannabis prescriptions, occasionally in exchange for a substantial fee. To date, the prevalence of this practice among clients of LPs has not been explicitly examined. In addition to providing a more granular examination of cannabis substitution, this study also adds to the growing literature chronicling patterns of medical cannabis use and user characteristics using a novel sampling methodology: whereas prior studies generally queried self-identi ed medical cannabis users who may not have obtained physician authoriza- tion (Lucas, 2012b; Lucas et al., 2013; Walsh et al., 2013 ), to our knowledge this is the rst study since the establishment of the MMPR to include only those medical cannabis users with conrmed physician authorization to access cannabis for thera- peutic purposes. Design and methods A password protected 107 question online cross-sectional survey was made available in French and English for a 2 week period in July 2015 to patients of Tilray \u2014a licensed producer of cannabis. 1310 participants were notied of the opportunity to participate in this study via direct email to patients that had opted in to receive online communication from Tilray upon registration. Participants were compensated $10 credit for Tilray cannabis. The study was approved by Institutional Review Board Services, and gathered data on demographics, patient experiences, patterns of use, and cannabis substitution effect. Respondents were not forced to answer a given question in order to proceed to the next and as such the number of recorded responses varies across items. All reported percentages are based on number of responses rather than on the entire sample; we accompany all reported percentages with number of responses.Findings The survey was started by 301 participants, and completed by over 90% of respondents (n = 271). The 30 non-completers only lled out the demographic section of the study, and based on this information did not differ on age, gender, education, income or work status compared to those that completed the survey. The primary demographics of respondents corresponds with the greater Tilray patient population but was more male and Caucasian, single, disabled and of lower income than the general Canadian population, with over-representation in Western Canada and Ontario, and under-representation in Quebec (see Table 1 for demographic characteristics). While an increasingly common medical treatment, cannabis is often used for symptom relief rather than as a curative agent, therefore it's important to distinguish between the primary conditions for which cannabis is ofcially prescribed by a physician, and the speci c symptoms for which patients report relief. For example, while a patient might report having a prescription for MS, the list of symptoms impacted might include chronic pain, spasticity, and insomnia. In this survey, respondents could select a single primary condition from a drop-down list, but could then select multiple symptoms affected by the medical use of cannabis. In regards to conditions, pain-related conditions were the most common, reported by 53% of participants (n = 144; chronic pain 36%; (n = 98), arthritis 12% (n = 32), headache 5% (n = 14)). The second most prominent class was mental health (eating disorder, PTSD & psychiatric disorder), reported by 15% (n = 41). Other prominent conditions included gastrointestinal I disorders (11%, n = 29), insomnia (7%, n = 18) and multiple sclerosis (4%, n = 11). In regards to symptoms; the most highly endorsed were chronic pain (73%, n = 197), stress (60%, n = 162), insomnia (57%, n = 155), depression (46%, n = 126) and headache (32%, n = 87). Gastrointes- tinal (GI) issues also featured prominently, with 29% (n = 79) citing appetite loss and another 29% (n = 79) nausea. Cannabis was perceived to be very effective at symptom relief, with 95% (n = 257) reporting that it \"often \" or \"always \" helped alleviate their symptoms. Patterns of use The mean age of initiation was 18.50 (SD = 7.42) for recreational use and 34.13 (SD = 13.74) for medical use, as determined by responses to the question \"How old were you when you rst used cannabis \" followed by \"How old were you when you rst used cannabis for medical purposes? \". It is notable that participants readily distinguished between their recreational and medical use of cannabis, with recreational cannabis use preceding medical use for 81% (n = 220) of respondents, with 16% (n = 44) reporting no history of recreational cannabis use, and 3% (n = 7) reporting precedence of medical use prior to recreational use. In regard to frequency, 88% (n = 238) reported using cannabis at least daily, and the modal amount used per day was 1-2 g, with 29% (n = 79) using a larger amount. In regard to methods of use, 90% (n = 243) had tried joints, 86% (n = 234) vaporizers, 76% (n = 207) oral/edibles (such as baked goods, butter, tincture, etc.) and 16% (n = 44) had used cannabis- infused topical ointments. Regarding primary methods of use, vaporizers proved most popular (38%, n = 102), followed by joints (25%, n = 67), oral/edibles (14%, n = 37), waterpipe/bongs (12%, n = 33), pipes (11%, n = 30), and topicals (1%, n = 2). Regarding preferred method, vaporization was rated most highly by a plurality (44%, n = 119), with oral/edibles second (23%, n = 63). Respondents overwhelmingly reported that not all strains/types of cannabis were \"equally effective \" at relieving symptoms (77%, n = 210): 82%P. Lucas, Z. Walsh / International Journal of Drug Policy 42 (2017) 30-35 31(n = 222) reported a preferred cannabis type; 25% (n = 68) indicas, 21% hybrids (n = 56), 18% favoring strains high in cannabidiol (CBD) (n = 50), and 18% sativas (n = 48). While many Licensed Producers continue to identify cannabis by these phenotypes (Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica ) in keeping with classi cations found in the black market, there is a growing academic debate about whether these classi cations represent real and distinct genetic classi ca- tions, with evidence suggesting that the label of indica or sativa is not consistent with the actual genetics of many of these strains (Sawler et al., 2015 ). However, evidence that cannabinoids and terpenes are found at different ratios within each distinct cannabis phenotype supports the subjective differences between strains commonly reported by patients. Cannabis substitution effect Overall, 71% (n = 186) of participants report substituting cannabis for either prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco/nicotine or illicit substances, with 63% reporting substitution forprescription medication (n = 166), 25% for alcohol (n = 66), 12% for tobacco/nicotine (n = 31), and 3% for illicit substances (n = 9). To facilitate interpretation of substitution for prescription medications, pharmaceuticals were classed into the following 4 categories: opioids, benzodiazepines, antidepressants and a category of other medication that included diverse substances that were less frequently endorsed (e.g., NSAIDs, Methylpheni- date). Respondents were allowed to report up to three medications for which they substituted cannabis; of those who explicitly listed prescription substitution 59% (n = 92) reported substituting for a single class of medications, 33% (n = 52) reported substituting for two classes, and 8% (n = 13) reported substituting cannabis for three classes. The most common form of substitution was for opioids (32%, n = 80), followed by benzodiazepines (16%, n = 40), and antidepressants (12%, n = 31) (Table 2). The reasons most frequently ranked as being most important for substituting cannabis for prescribed medications were \"less adverse side effect \" (39%, n = 68); \"cannabis is safer \" (27% n = 48), and \"better symptom management \" (16%, n = 28).Table 1 Demographics.

Walsh / International Journal of Drug Policy 42 (2017) 30-35Supplementary analyses examined variation across diagnostic groups, and indicated that respondents who used cannabis for pain- related conditions were more likely to substitute cannabis for opioids (42% (n = 57) vs. 20% (n = 23), x2= 13.78(1), p < 0.01),whereas respondents who used cannabis to address mental health were more likely to substitute cannabisfor benzodiazepines (31% (n = 12) vs.13% (n = 28), x2= 7.75(1), p < 0.01) and for antidepressants (26% (n = 10) vs. 10% (n = 21), x2= 7.69(1), p = 0.01) (Fig. 1). Our data suggested no relationship between age, amount of cannabis used, mode of administration, access or affordability on substitution effect. Access Although all respondents accessed cannabis from Tilray, 21% (n = 56) also reported purchasing cannabis from another Licensed Producer, 25% (n = 67) purchased from dispensaries, 18%(n = 47) from a friend, and 8% (n = 20) buy from an illicit dealer. In total, 42% (n = 111) of respondents reported accessing from one or more unregulated sources. Regarding cost, 44% (n = 118) spend less than $250 monthly and 78% (n = 212) spend less than $500 per month on cannabis, whereas 4% spend $1000 or more (n = 11). Capacity to \"often \" or \"always \" afford to buy enough cannabis to relieve symptoms was reported by 40% (n = 109), leaving 60% (n = 162) who report \"sometimes \" or \"never \" affording sufcient cannabis. Similarly, 53% (n = 146) reported choosing between medical cannabis and other necessities (food, rent, other medicines . . . ) in the past year due to nances. Only 3% (n = 7) cited having 3rd party insurance coverage, and another 3% (n = 8) reported getting the cost of cannabis covered through Veterans Affairs Canada. Findinga supportive physicianwasareportedchallenge,with 31% (n = 78) having changed doctors in relation to medical cannabis use, and 55% reporting feeling discriminated against by their doctor becauseofmedical cannabis use (n = 139). Paying a physicianorclinic a fee for recommendations to use medical cannabis was reported by 55% (n = 140), with a modal price of between $300 -99 (n = 50) and94% (n = 131) paying $100 or more. It is therefore unsurprising that 29% (n = 75) reported that obtaining an authorization to use medical cannabis was \"difcult\" or \"very difcult\". Interpretation The nding that patients using cannabis to treat pain-related conditions have a higher rate of substitution for opioids, and that patients self-reporting mental health issues have a higher rate of substitution for benzodiazepines and antidepressants has signif- icant public health implications. In light of the growing rate of morbidity and mortality associated with these prescription medications (Bachhuber et al., 2014 ; Fischer, Rehm, Goldman, & Popova, 2008 ), cannabis could play a signicant role in reducing the health burden of problematic prescription drug use. Indeed, a recent study of US states that have legalized medical cannabis, found that the number of prescriptions signicantly dropped for drugs that treat pain, depression, anxiety, nausea, psychoses, seizures and sleep disorders, with the annual number of doses prescribed for chronic pain falling by more than 11% per physician (Bradford & Bradford, 2016 ). Additionally, according to Veterans Affairs Canada, a recent signicant increase in the use of medical cannabis by patients is paralleled by a nearly 30% decrease in the use of benzodiazapines and a 16% decrease in the use of opioids (Hager, 2016 ). Moreover, the nding that cannabis might be used to substitute for multiple medications is particularly promising in light of concerns patients may have regarding adherence to complex pharmaceutical regimens, and attendant side effects (Brown & Bussell, 2011; Ingersoll & Cohen, 2008 ; Sylvestre, Clements, & Malibu, 2006 ). Indeed, tolerability of side effects was identi ed as a prominent reason for cannabis substitution. The nding that medical cannabis is used primarily to treat chronic pain is consistent with past research (Ware et al., 2010 ; Ware, Wang, Shapiro, & Collet, 2015 ). However, the extensive self- 051015202530354045 All (n = 253) Pain (n=137) Mental Health (n=39)Opioids Benzodiazapines An/g415depressants Other Medica/g415on Fig. 1.

Walsh / International Journal of Drug Policy 42 (2017) 30-35 33reported use to treat mental health conditions and associated symptoms represents a novel and interesting trend, and suggests that the conceptualization of cannabis as deleterious to mental health may not generalize across conditions or populations. Studies currently underway to investigate cannabis for the treatment of PTSD, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions may soon provide more information on these potentially promis- ing treatment options. Our nding that most patients use 2 grams or less is consistent with past research (Carter, Weydt, Kyashna-Tocha, & Abrams, 2004 ; Clark, 2013 ; Hazekamp, Ware, Muller-Vahl, Abrams, & Grotenhermen, 2013 ). To our knowledge, this is the rst patient survey to report vaporization as the primary method of ingestion, and non-smoked forms of ingestion as primary and preferred methods of ingestion. This marks a health conscious shift in medical cannabis use under the MMPR that may be attributed to a few factors: since patients in the MMPR require a physicians support to access medical cannabis, they may be more likely to be focused on safer methods of ingestion than non-MMPR patient populations; improvements in vaporizer technology and associated reductions in cost, patient outreach and education initiatives focused on safe and responsible use by cannabis vendors, and ongoing restrictions on smoking in the public realm. Cannabis is rather unique as a therapeutic treatment in that many patients report some permeability between recreational and medical use (Walsh et al., 2013 ). However, unlike opioids where medical use via prescription often precedes recreational use and dependence (Fischer et al., 2008 ), the pathways between the medical and recreational use of cannabis are reversed, with previous recreational use often a precursor to prescription medical use, while the reverse is rarely the case. Although most respondents in this study had experience with recreational cannabis use prior to initiation of medical use (81%, n = 220), transition from medical use to recreational use was only reported by 7 participants (<3%), which is suggestive of a low risk of abuse associated with medical cannabis. Addition- ally, with so many patients reporting use for the relief of mental health conditions like stress, insomnia and depression, much of this medical use is ultimately focused on improving psycholog- ical well being and quality of life. This perhaps blurs the lines between traditional biomedical approaches to disease and more holistic approaches (such as yoga or naturopathic medicine) used as adjunct treatments to address the symptoms, side- effects and psychological impacts of long-term illness/disability and/or the modern pressures of every day life. This is supported by previous research that has found that patients who use medical cannabis often cite depression and anxiety as a primary symptoms for which they seek relief, regardless of their actual medical condition (Bonn-Miller, Boden, Bucossi, & Babson, 2014 ; Ogborne, Smart, Weber, & Birchmore-Timney, 2000 ; Walsh et al., 2016 ), as well a growing amount of preclinical research supporting the use of CBD as a potential treatment for both anxiety (Blessing, Steenkamp, Manzanares, & Marmar, 2015 ) and depression (Linge et al., 2015 ). Despite the legal protection and quality control offered through the MMPR, 42% of participants report accessing cannabis from unregulated sources which may be due to restrictions imposed on LPs by the MMPR during that period. At the time of this survey, LPs were only allowed to provide raw cannabis flowers, whereas other sources may have provided a diverse array of extracts and edibles. Since that time regulations have been altered to allow LPs to produce extracts, and to once again produce their own cannabis supply. Future research may determine whether this regulatory revision alters patient behaviour in regards to access through unregulated sources.In light of consistent evidence that many lower income patients face affordability issues in regards to the cost of medical cannabis (Belle-Isle et al., 2014 ), the nding that so many patients had to pay high medical fees to gain access medical cannabis is concerning and suggests there may subsequently be an under-representation of low income patients in the MMPR/ACMPR. Conclusions The high rate of substitution for prescription drugs among patients with pain-related and mental health conditions suggests that medical cannabis may be an effective adjunct or substitute treatment to prescription drugs used to treat these conditions. Further research into the comparative efcacy of cannabis relative to front-line treatments for theses conditions is warranted, and longitudinal research would help elucidate the context of cannabis substitution effect, and the potential impact of cannabis substitu- tion on the quality of life of patients (in-progress, Lucas). While the MMPR had only been in place for approximately 15 months when this survey took place, the ndings that some authorized patients continue to purchase cannabis from unregu- lated sources and that a signicant percentage of patients have had to pay high fees for medical cannabis recommendations highlight ongoing policy challenges for the federal medical cannabis program. As Canada 's federal medical cannabis policy continues to evolve (both organically and in response to legal challenges) and as provinces and municipalities seek regulatory solutions to issues like dispensaries, personal production, and private medical cannabis clinics, it will be important to keep tracking the impact of these policy developments on patient access to and experiences with medical cannabis. Limitations The relatively low response rate to the survey (21%) leaves open the possibility this could potentially be an unrepresentative sample. It is not possible to conrm the impact of cannabis substitution on quantity of use of prescription drugs, alcohol or illicit drug use. Additionally, all data regarding the cannabis substitution effect in this study were self-reported by patients and did not benet from biological drug detection to conrm use or non-use of a substance. In light of this potential bias, our characterisation of the therapeutic use of cannabis and/or cannabis substitution effect should be interpreted with caution pending replication by research that employs a more systematic recruit- ment approach, longitudinal monitoring, and biological drug testing. However, these limitations are counterbalanced by several methodological strengths, including the large size of the sample, assurance that all participants were using medical cannabis with the support of a physician, and adherence to established standards for reporting Internet-based surveys (Eysenbach, 2004 ).

Recent years have witnessed increased attention to how cannabis use impacts the use of other psychoactive substances. The present study examines the use of cannabis as a substitute for alcohol, illicit substances and prescription drugs among 473 adults who use cannabis for therapeutic purposes. Design and Methods. The Cannabis Access for Medical Purposes Survey is a 414-question cross-sectional survey that was available to Canadian medical cannabis patients online and by hard copy in 2011 and 2012 to gather information on patient demographics, medical conditions and symptoms, patterns of medical cannabis use, cannabis substitution and barriers to access to medical cannabis. Results. Substituting cannabis for one or more of alcohol, illicit drugs or prescription drugs was reported by 87% ( n=410) of respondents, with 80.3% reporting substitution for prescription drugs, 51.7% for alcohol, and 32.6% for illicit substances. Respondents who reported substituting cannabis for prescription drugs were more likely to report difculty affording sufcient quantities of cannabis, and patients under 40 years of age were more likely to substitute cannabis for all three classes of substance than older patients. Discussion and Conclusions. The nding that cannabis was substituted for all three classes of substances suggests that the medical use of cannabis may play a harm reduction role in the context of use of these substances, and may have implications for abstinence-based substance use treatment approaches. Further research should seek to differentiate between biomedical substitution for prescription pharmaceuticals and psychoactive drug substitution, and to elucidate the mechanisms behind both.

Introduction The medical use of cannabis can be traced back at least 5000 years [1,2], and by the late 19th century, cannabis-based preparations were widely marketed for medical use [3]. A variety of social and technological developments led to the stigmatisation and marginalisation of cannabis by the 1920s [4,5], and bythe 1940s, the international implementation of canna- bis prohibition put an end to nearly all research into the use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes (CTP). The past decade has witnessed an increased interest in the therapeutic properties of cannabis, and a growing body of laboratory and clinical research attests to the many uses of cannabis-based medicines for diverse symptoms and conditions [6-9].

Legal access to cannabis might affect the broader social costs related to the use of both licit and illicit psychoactive substances, and a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of cannabis use must recognise potential effects on the use of other psychoactive substances such as prescription drugs, alcohol and illicit substances. Substitution effect Substitution of psychoactive substances can be concep- tualised within the context of behavioural economics, whereby commodities may have substitution, comple- mentary or independent interrelationships with regard to rates of human consumption. In a seminal investiga- tion of substitution and addictions, Hursh and col- leagues [11] noted several factors that may affect substitution of one psychoactive substance for another, including changes in policy that affect availability, and changes to legal risk and associated repercussions. Population-level studies have identied substitution resulting from shifts in the legal risk associated with the use of a particular substance, such as decriminalisation [12]. In regards to psychoactive/pharmacological [11] add that 'pharmacological thera- pies for the treatment of drug abuse can also be conceptualised as alternative commodities that either substitute for illicit drug use (e.g. agonist therapy) or reduce the potency of illicit drugs directly (e.g. narcotic antagonist therapy)' (p. 25). Prominent examples of the harm-reducing potential of substituting one psychoac- tive substance for another include the prescription use of methadone as a substitute to injection heroin use [13] and the use of nicotine patches to curb or stop tobacco smoking [14]. Additionally, the cannabis extract nabiximols [Sativex (http://www.gwpharm.com/ Sativex.aspx)] has been investigated as a potential agonist for cannabis withdrawal in a treatment-seeking cohort, nding buccal drawal symptoms, placebo was as effective in promot- ing long-term reductions in use [15]. The use of cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs, alcohol and other substances has been identied in a number of studies. Deliberate cannabis substitution has been reported by heroin and pharmaceutical opiate users [16]. A number of smaller studies have also found that cannabis appears to reduce the cravings for other drugs of dependence like crack cocaine [17], alcohol[18] and opiates [19-21], and may improve some treat- ment outcomes for substance dependence [22]. A com- plementary line of research has found that cessation of cannabis use is associated with increased use of other substances like alcohol and cigarettes [15,23]. The effectiveness of cannabis as a substitute for other substances has been proposed to reflect diverse neurochemical and cognitive processes [17]. From a patient perspective, recent surveys of CTP users in Canada and the USA identied less withdrawal, fewer side effects, and better symptom management as primary reasons for cannabis substitution [6,18,24]. Medical cannabis in Canada In Canada, several court cases have upheld the rights of patients to choose cannabis as medicine (e.g. R. v. Smith, 2013; R. v. Beren and Swallow, 2009; Hitzig et al. v. Canada, 2003; R. v. Parker, 2000;W akeford v. Canada, 2000), and the 2001 Marihuana Medical Access Regula- tions established means for Canadians to obtain legal authorisation to possess CTP. Despite widespread concern with the efciency of the Health Canada pro- gramme [25-28], registration has grown from fewer than 500 registrants in 2002 to over 26 000 in 2012 [29]. However, the Marihuana Medical Access Regula- tions have been noted for presenting substantial barriers to access [25-28], and fewer than 10% of the estimated one million Canadian individuals who use CTP are authorised through the federal programme [28,30,31]. The authorised versus unauthorised status of users of CTP represents a legal risk factor that might be expected to influence substitution. Ability to afford CTP has also been identied as an important factor that affects access [25,31], and may therefore be expected to impact substitution. Addition- ally, several studies have identied analgesia as a promi- nent reason for using CTP, and cannabis has several potential advantages relative to widely used opiate analgesics including fewer side-effects, a lower risk of dependence, and no possibility of fatal overdose [20]. Therefore, those who use cannabis to address pain- related conditions might be expected to report rela- tively higher rates of substitution for prescription drugs for pain. History of problematic substance use might also influence rates of substitution, as indivi- duals working to maintain abstinence from other substances may be more likely to use cannabis as a substitute [19]. In sum, prior research has identied cannabis as a potential substitute for other substances among CTP and community samples, however no studies have examined the extent to which cannabis substitution varies according to theoretically important factors such as authorisation to possess cannabis, affordability \u00a9 2015 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other DrugsCannabis substitution 327of cannabis, substance use history, medical condition, and age. We expect that higher levels of access asso- ciated with authorised status and with greater affordability of CTP will be associated with increased likelihood of cannabis substitution for prescription drugs, alcohol, and illicit drugs, and that younger patients will be more likely to report substitution effect for alcohol and illicit substances due to the higher rates of use of these substances in those under 40 years old in the general population. Finally, we predict that individuals with histories of problematic substance use will report higher rates of substitution for alcohol and illicit substances. Methods Participants were 473 self-identied current users of CTP drawn from the Cannabis Access for Medical Purposes Survey (CAMPS) [32], with complete data regarding use of cannabis as a substitute. CAMPS is the largest polling of Canadian medical cannabis patients to date, and involved the administration of multi-part questionnaire of 414 forced choice and open-ended items that queried demographic information, medical conditions and symptoms, and patterns of cannabis use. Participants were surveyed in 2011-2012 online or in person at a medical cannabis dispensary. The study and survey were developed with the assistance of a community research board, and recruitment was assisted by dispensaries, by organisations that serve people who use CTP (e.g. Canadian AIDS Society, Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network), and by social media and traditional media reporting on the project. The study was reviewed and approved by the Behav- ioural Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia. Respondents were 68% men, 90% European-Canadian and 9% Aboriginal. Ages ranged from 17 to 78 years, with a median age of 40. Partici- pants presented with the range of conditions that is generally consistent with surveys of CTP users, the most prominent conditions being pain (32%), mood (i.e. anxiety and depression; 18%), arthritis (15%), HIV (10%), gastrointestinal disorder (7%) (Table 1; see Walsh et al., 2013 [32] for a detailed account of CAMPS methodology and participant characteristics). Substitution was measured using three dichotomous items (yes/no), each of which referred to a distinct class of substance. Participants were asked if they had sub- stituted cannabis for: (i) prescription drugs; (ii) alcohol; and (iii) illicit substances. Positive responses branched to a follow-up query asking participants to rank six reasons for substitution as follows: less adverse side effects from cannabis ,less withdrawal symptoms with cannabis ,the ability to obtain cannabis versus other drugs ,social accept- ance of cannabis is greater than other drug ,better symptommanagement from cannabis than from alcohol or other drugs , and an other category, which was followed by space for an open response. This approach and the selection of items for the substitution reasons are derived from prior studies of substitution [6,18]. Participants were asked to indicate the single pri- mary condition treated with cannabis, as well as any number of primary symptoms cannabis use alleviated (Figure 1). We created a dichotomous pain condition variable by aggregating respondents who identied the primary condition treated with CTP as spinal pain, non-spinal pain, or arthritis ( n=220), and comparing these participants to an aggregation of all other condi- tions ( n=241). A large contingent of these non-pain respondents nonetheless endorsed pain among the symptoms for which they used CTP (71%, n=171), therefore, we conducted supplementary analyses com- paring those who endorsed treating pain with CTP among a list of symptoms (83%, n=390) with those who did not endorse treating pain with CTP (17%, n=82). We also compared those who used cannabis primarily to treat the depression oranxiety (n=81) to anTa bl e 1 .

Approxi- mately, one-third of respondents had obtained federal authorisation to possess cannabis (32%, n=152), and we used a dichotomous authorisation variable to compare authorised versus unauthorised patients. Par- ticipants were queried regarding ability to afford CTP, and were divided into those who could always oroften afford CTP (46%, n=214) and ornever afford CTP (54%, n=252).We also com- pared respondents with a history of treatment for problematic alcohol or other substance use (15%, n=71) to those with no such history (85%, n=402). Finally, we examined self-reported reasons for substi- tution and associations between substitution and quan- tity of cannabis use. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between these vari- ables and dichotomous indices of (presence/absence) the three types of substitution. All signicance tests were two-tailed. Results Substituting cannabis for one or more of alcohol, illicit drugs, or prescription drugs was reported by 87% (n=410) of respondents, with 36% ( n=168) only one class 25% (n=118) substituting for two classes, and 26% (n=124) substituting for all three classes. Examination by class of drug (Table 2) identied substitution for prescription drugs as the most commonly reported form of substitution (80%), followed by alcohol (52%), and illicit substances (33%). The most commonly endorsed reasons for substitution were 'less adverse side effects' (51%, n=208), followed closely by 'better symptom management' (49%, n=199). Amount used Median weekly amount of cannabis used was 14 g. Comparisons based on a median split of higher versuslower quantity users indicated that quantity of use was not associated with differences in the observed levels of any of the three forms of substitution; for prescrip- tion drugs [odds ratio illicit drugs 95% CI=0.60-1.45). Medical condition Participants who identied pain-related conditions as the primary reason for using CTP were more likely to report substituting cannabis for prescription drugs (OR =1.99, 95% CI =1.23-3.21), but did not differ with regard to rates of substituting cannabis for alcohol (OR =1.01, 95% CI =0.76-1.59), or illicit substances (OR =0.96, 95% CI =0.65-1.42). Supplementary analyses comparing those who endorsed pain as a symptom treated with CTP to those who listed a non- pain-related primary condition treated with CTP pro- duced a parallel pattern of results: those who used CTP to treat pain were more likely to substitute cannabis for prescription drugs (OR =1.92, 95% CI =1.12-3.30), and did not differ from respondents who did not endorse CTP use for pain with regard to substituting cannabis for alcohol (OR =1.03, 95% CI =0.64-1.66) or illicit substances (OR =1.30, 95% CI =0.77-2.20). Participants who used CTP primarily to treat depres- sion or anxiety did not differ from other partici- pants with regard to prescription drugs (OR =1.49, 95% CI =0.77-2.89), alcohol (OR =1.35, Comparison of authorised versus unauthorised status indicated that authorised users (Table 2) were margin- ally less likely to substitute cannabis for alcohol (OR =0.63, 95% CI =0.43-0.93), and did not differ with regard to substituting for prescription drugs (OR =1.45, 95% CI =0.87-2.41), or illicit substances (OR =0.92, 95% CI =0.61-1.39). Affordability Respondents who reported substituting cannabis for prescription drugs were moderately more likely to report difculty affording sufcient quantities CTP (OR =0.59, 95% CI =0.37-0.94). Affordability was not related to substitution for alcohol (OR =0.75, 95% CI=0.52-1.08) or for HIV/AIDS GI Alcohol Illicit drugs Rx drugs Figure 1.

Age Respondents who substituted cannabis for prescription drugs were younger [M =38.58 standard deviation (SD) =12.57] than those who did not engage in this class of substitution [M =44.26 (SD =13.90)], (OR cannabis for alcohol were younger [M=36.65 (SD =12.99)] than those who did not engage in this class of substitution [M =42.84 (SD =12.26)], (OR =0.96, 95% CI =0.95-0.98), for illicit sub- stances [M =36.50 (SD =12.55)] were younger than those who did not engage in this class of substitution [M=41.13 (SD =13.01)] [M =42.84 (SD =12.26)], (OR =0.97, 95% CI =0.96-0.99). Discussion The results of this study are consistent with a growing body of research suggesting that cannabis use may play an important role in the use of prescription drugs, alcohol and illicit substances. Although we identied generally high rates of substitution across all patients, we also identied variability in rates of substitution across substances and contextual factors. Specically, using cannabis for pain relief was associated with sub- stituting cannabis for prescription medications; having a history of treatment for substance use was associatedwith substituting for illicit substances; and younger age was associated with higher rates of substitution across all substances. We also found that respondents who used CTP without authorisation were more likely to use cannabis as a substitute for alcohol, whereas those substituting cannabis for prescription drugs were more likely to have difculty affording cannabis. The high rate of substitution for prescribed sub- stances, particularly among patients with pain-related conditions, suggests that further research into cannabis/ cannabinoids as a potentially safer substitute for or adjunct to opiates is justied, and adds to research suggesting this phenomenon is robust across samples [6,20]. This includes a study by Bachhuber et al. that examined the association between the medical cannabis laws in US states and opiate overdose deaths, which found nearly 25% lower mean annual rates of opioid overdose mortality among states that allowed medical cannabis, noting that the protective influence of medical cannabis regulation grew stronger over time [33]. The recent rise of addiction to pharmaceutical opiates in Canada and around the world and an asso- ciated increase in opiate-related morbidity and mortal- ity [34-36] highlights the importance of exploring this context for substitution and its potential public health impacts. The nding that cannabis was substituted for alcohol and illicit substances suggests that the medical use of cannabis may play a harm reduction role in the context of use of these substances, and could have implications for substance use treatment approaches requiring absti- nence from cannabis in the process of reducing the use of other substances. Furthermore, public policies informed by evidence that cannabis might be a substi- tute for alcohol [12,18,23,37] could have an impact on overall rates of alcoholism, as well as alcohol-related automobile accidents, violence, and property crime [38]. The novel nding that patients under 40 reported a higher rate of substitution than older patients poten-Ta bl e 2 .

Lucas et al. 330tially reflects more established patterns of substance use among older patients. In addition, younger patients typically use more psychoactive substances in the rst place, leading to greater opportunities for substitution [30]. This nding suggests that older patients might benet from education regarding the potential of can- nabis to serve as a substitute for prescription drugs, alcohol, and illicit substances and indicates that future research on cannabis substitution should consider the age of the sample. The nding that higher rates of substituting cannabis for prescription drugs was associated with lower ability to afford cannabis warrants consideration, and may reflect increased demand\u2014and therefore higher cost\u2014 for cannabis related to use for this purpose. Such an interpretation is consistent with our nding that affordability was inversely associated with substitution of prescription medications, as such medications are subsidised in Canada, making them generally less expensive than cannabis. In contrast, alcohol and illicit drugs may be more expensive than cannabis, and there- fore substitution of cannabis for these substances would not be expected to be associated with nancial stress. Indeed, as we did not nd that cannabis substitution for prescription medications was associated with the use of a greater quantity of cannabis, ndings related to eco- nomic pressure suggests that affordability might limit cannabis use, adding to research that highlights the importance of affordability for maximising efcient access to cannabis [25,31]. The nding of higher levels of substituting cannabis for alcohol among unauthorised users was surprising, as prior research identied few differences between authorised and unauthorised Canadians who use CTP [32]. We propose that the actual government-regulated authorisation process may have led to a formalisation of medical cannabis use among authorised patients, lim- iting their reported reasons for the use of medical can- nabis to those recognised and approved by their physician and Health Canada. However, further research that directly queries this issue is required to conrm this hypothesis. Limitations The limitations of this study are common to online medical surveys, such as the potential for multiple responses from a single respondent, a potentially unrepresentative sample, and lack of physician conr- mation of medical conditions. Since no data was gath- ered on the extent of self-reported substitution, it is not possible to determine how much actual prescription drug, alcohol or illicit drug use was substituted for, and variable time frame for retrospective reporting may impact the reliability of recall. Furthermore, responsebias related to participant self-selection and recruit- ment through organisations that support medical can- nabis patients likely resulted in overrepresentation of individuals who respond favourably to the medical use of cannabis. Additionally, all data regarding the canna- bis substitution effect in this study were self-reported by patients and did not benet from biological drug detection to conrm use or non-use of a substance. In light of this potential bias, our characterisation of the therapeutic use of cannabis and/or cannabis substitu- tion effect should be interpreted with caution pending replication by research that employs a more systematic recruitment approach and biological drug testing. However, these limitations are counterbalanced by several methodological strengths, including the size of the sample, the inclusion of an in-person subsample, and adherence to established standards for reporting Internet-based surveys [39]. Conclusions Taken together, our ndings provide additional evi- dence for the widespread nature of cannabis substitu- tion and suggest potentially fruitful avenues for further research that elucidates the complex interaction between cannabis use and the use of other substances. In particular, as the therapeutic and recreational uses of cannabis continue to be normalised, research that explicitly investigates contexts and motives for substi- tution, particularly in younger adults, might help to maximise the health benets of this emerging phenom- enon. Further research is needed to better estimate the extent of substitution, and to specify differences in sub- stitution across prescription drugs (i.e. opiates, benzodiazepines, anti-inflammatories), and other sub- stances such as tobacco and caffeine. To this end, we recommend the development of a psychometrically valid instrument to facilitate the reliable assessment of cannabis substitution across diverse samples, contexts and substances.

Emerging data suggest that use and abuse of prescription drugs may be decreasing in states where medical cannabis is legal. The aim of this study was to survey cannabis users to determine whether they had intentionally substituted cannabis for prescription drugs. Methods: A total of 2,774 individuals were a self-selected convenience sample who reported having used cannabis at least once in the previous 90 days. Subjects were surveyed via an online anonymous questionnaire on cannabis substitution effects. Participants were recruited through social media and cannabis dispensaries in Washington State. Results: A total of 1,248 (46%) respondents reported using cannabis as a substitute for pre- scription drugs. The most common classes of drugs substituted were narcotics/opioids (35.8%), anxiolytics/benzodiazepines (13.6%) and antidepressants (12.7%). A total substitutions were reported or approximately two drug substitutions per affirmative respondent. The odds of reporting substituting were 4.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.87-5.43) greater among medical cannabis compared with non-medical users and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.27-2.16) greater among those reporting use for managing the comorbidities of pain, anxiety and depression. A slightly higher percentage of those who reported substituting resided in states where medical cannabis was legal at the time of the survey (47% vs. 45%, p=0.58), but this difference was not statistically significant. Discussion: These patient-reported outcomes support prior research that individuals are using cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs, particularly, narcotics/opioids, and independent of whether they identify themselves as medical or non-medical users. This is especially true if they suffer from pain, anxiety and depression. Additionally, this study suggests that state laws allowing access to, and use of, medical cannabis may not be influencing individual decision- making in this area. Keywords: cannabis, marijuana, prescription drugs, pain, analgesics, opioid Introduction The past two decades have brought about a prodigious change in state laws and social policies regarding the use of cannabis for medical and other purposes. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia currently enforce legalized medical cannabis laws. Eight of these states and the District of Columbia have also legalized cannabis for recreational use. 1 Among other factors, these legislative and policy changes have resulted in shifts in social acceptance and cannabis use patterns in the US population, some of which have been driven by a growing understanding of the medicinal value of cannabis. 2Correspondence: James M Corroon Jr Center for Medical Cannabis Education, 428 8th Street, Del Mar, CA 92014, USA Tel +1 858 367 0393 Email jamie@corroon.comJournal head recto: Cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs - a cross-sectional studyDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S134330Journal of Pain Research 2017:10submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 990 Corroon Jr et al According to the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ), past-month use of cannabis has risen steadily each year in the general population from 5.8% in 2007 to 8.4% in 2014. In 2015, an estimated 22.2 million of >265 million Americans aged 12 years reported having used cannabis in the past month (8.3%). 3 In addition to changing use patterns, recent research sug- gests that physicians' drug prescribing patterns may also be changing in states with legalized medical cannabis. Bradford and Bradford 4 reported a drop in filled prescriptions in such states between 2010 and 2013 for drugs under Medicare Part D for the treatment of conditions such as pain, anxiety, depression and others. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued federal guidelines on the long-term use of opiates, noting concerns that there may be negative unintended consequences associated with dose reduction, such as patients switching to the use of heroin. 5 An alternative for patients with chronic pain is switching to the use of cannabis to navigate dose reduction and to treat their pain and/or comorbid conditions outright. 6 A recent open-label, prospective study suggests that medical cannabis may decrease opioid use and benefit patients with treatment-resistant pain. 7 Here, we analyzed self-reported data for frequency of prescription drug substitution with cannabis use across sociodemographic characteristics, prescription drug class, state legalization policies for medical cannabis and global quality of life health scores. Methods Survey The institutional review board (IRB) of Bastyr University approved the protocol. Procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2008. Documentation of consent was waived in accordance with Department of Health & Human Services regulation 45 CFR 46.117(c) by the IRB of Bastyr Univer - sity on the basis that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm. The only record linking the subject with the research would be the consent document, and thus, the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. A literature review was conducted to identify existing epidemiological surveys of cannabis use. 8-13 The authors developed a novel questionnaire by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of existing surveys to meet the goals of this study. Drafts were circulated to physician researchers and cannabis users for feedback in an iterative process. The final survey consisted of 44 structured questions answered by yes/no, multiple choice, open-ended response fields and rating scales. 14 These included patient- reported outcomes (PROs) using the PROMIS\u00ae Global Health 10-item short form (part of a National Institutes of Health [NIH] initiative to produce validated, self-reported item banks for physical, mental, emotional and social health) to measure overall well-being. Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure tool allowing participants to directly enter responses. 15 Subjects were a self-selected convenience sample who accessed the survey through links posted on the Center for the Study of Cannabis and Social Policy and Bastyr University websites, a Facebook page, flyers in Washington State can-nabis dispensaries or word of mouth from December 2013 to January 2016. Recruitment strategies included Bastyr University medical students circulating the survey through their own social media, by distributing IRB-approved fliers to local medical cannabis dispensaries in Washington State, through public lectures describing the questionnaire at King County Library Systems locations, in an article written for an online Cannabis magazine and through an article posted to an online group located at momswithms.org. The only inclusion criterion was having used cannabis at least once in the past 90 days. A total of 31 respondents from the 2,864 respondents were deemed ineligible and excluded based on this criterion. Another 14 were excluded for failure to answer the eligibility question. To minimize risk to participants, no identifying information was collected. Individuals were given the opportunity to provide a five-digit code that enabled repeat responses to be identified with only the first response analyzed. A total of 389 (10.4%) individuals failed to provide this code and were included in the final analysis. A total of 45 repeat responders were identified and deleted, leaving a total of 2,774 eligible respondents. Individuals were told that they could skip any question(s) they did not wish to answer. Those who refused to provide a five-digit code were included based on the rationale that fear of lost anonymity is more likely to motivate response refusal than repeat participation. Data sources and measurement Prescription drug substitution was evaluated by asking survey respondents, \"Have you ever used cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs (yes/no)?\" If the respondent answered in the affirmative, an open-ended response field was available with the instructions, \"Please list prescription drugs that you have substituted cannabis for:\". If a specific number of prescription drugs were entered into the open-ended response field, values were coded as the Journal of Pain Research 2017:10submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 991 Cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs - a cross-sectional study number of drugs per category. For example, \"opiate pain killers (Roxicet, Percocet, Vicodin) and benzos (Xanax)\" was counted as three substitutions in the drug category of narcotics/opioids and one substitution in the drug category of benzodiazepines. If a specific number of prescription drugs were not entered, values were coded as the number of drug categories. For example, \"opiates and pain killers, muscle relaxants, anti-anxiety meds and depression meds\" was counted as one substitution for the following four drug categories: narcotics/opioids, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics and antidepressants. All nonspecific drug mentioning \"anxiety\" (e.g., \"anxiety meds\") were categorized as anxiolytics and then combined with drugs in the benzodiazepines category to form the broader category of anxiolytics/benzodiazepines. Combination drugs were recorded in multiple categories where appropriate, except for combinations of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Generic values like \"pain were categorized as narcotics/opioids, as opposed to NSAIDs/non-opioid analgesics. Generic values like \"prescription headache medication\" were categorized as anti-migraine, despite the absence of language confirming the headaches were actually migraines. Drugs available over the counter (OTC), and entered with specific names, were recorded as prescription drugs. For example, \"ibuprofen\" was assumed to be prescrip-tion ibuprofen, given the nature of the question(s) in the survey. Type of cannabis use was determined by asking the question, \"What kind of user do you consider yourself to be?\" Respondents were given four, non-mutually exclusive and \"religious (e.g., Rastafari)\". For the purposes of this analysis, medical cannabis users were defined as those respondents identified as either \"medically indicated, recommended by licensed provider\" or \"medically indicated, self-prescribed\", including those who were also identified as a \"recreational user\". Data analyses Data analyses were conducted using SAS University Edition (SAS 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Univariate and bivariate comparisons were conducted using PROC FREQ and chi-square tests. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to estimate strength of association using PROC LOGISTIC. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores were calculated using the recom-mended scoring method that calibrates each score to a US national mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. 16 T -scores were calculated for only those respondents who answered all questions of the short form. Mean differences between PROMIS mental health and PROMIS physical health scores were computed using a two-sample t -test using PROC TTEST. Statistical significance was assessed using an alpha value of 0.05. Figures were produced using Microsoft Excel for Mac, version 15.27. Results Demographics A total of 2,774 respondents were included in the final study population. A majority of respondents were males (55.72%), aged <36 years (62.71%), Caucasian (86.13%), residing in the US (83.02%) and identifying themselves as medical cannabis users (59.81%; Table 1). All 50 US states and >42 countries were represented in the survey. Just over half of respondents reported residing in the following states: Washington (32.50%), California (8.47%), Oregon (5.89%) or Colorado (4.27%). A total of 1,248 respondents, or ~46% of respondents, responded affirmatively to the question, \"Have you ever used cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs?\" The odds of reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs increased with age, up to 65 years of age (Table 2). The odds of reporting substituting were 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.40) greater among females than males and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.00-2.48) greater among Native American/Asian/Pacific Islanders than Caucasians. Geographically, the odds of reporting substituting were greater among those residing in Canada (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.82-1.76) and lesser among those residing in Europe (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.72-1.21) as compared to those residing in the US. These geographical comparisons were not statistically significant. Substitution for prescription drugs A total of 1,248 respondents reported a total of 2,473 substi-tutions of prescription drugs. This represents approximately two drug substitutions per affirmative respondent. The most common classes of drugs substituted were narcotics/opioids (35.8%), anxiolytics/benzodiazepines (13.6%) and antidepressants (12.7%; Figure 1). Substituting narcotics/opioids was 2.6 times more frequent than substi-tuting cannabis for anxiolytics/benzodiazepines, the second most commonly substituted drug category.Journal of Pain Research 2017:10submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 992 Corroon Jr et al Medical versus non-medical users The odds of reporting substituting were 4.59 (95% CI, 3.87-5.43) times greater among self-identified medical cannabis as compared to non-medical cannabis users. Approximately one-quarter (24.43%) of non-medical users reported substituting cannabis for prescription drugs (Table 2). The relationship between user type (ie, medical or non- medical) and frequency of reported substitution was assessed independently for males and females and for different catego-ries of age. The odds of substituting were more than six times greater (OR, 6.09; 95% CI, 4.65-7.80) among female medical users than among female non-medical users. Similarly, the odds were 3.7 times (95% CI, 2.91-4.57) greater among male medical users. A trend in the odds of substituting among medical users was also seen with increased age (Table 3).Table 1 Sociodemographic characteristics of survey respondents during 2016 (n=2,774) Characteristic n (%) Gender Male 1,529 (55.72) Female 1,215 (10.00) >$150,000 208 (7.76) Missing 94 Highest level of education Less than eighth grade 9 (0.33) Grade 9-11 90 (3.28) High school/GED (14.74) Bachelors 793 (28.94) Masters 234 (8.54) Doctorate 132 (4.82) Missing 34 Age (years) 21 49 Current employment Full time 1,425 (52.10) Part time 577 (21.10) Unemployed 372 (13.60) Retired 116 (4.24) Disabled 245 (8.96) Missing 39 Race/ethnicity Caucasian 2,354 (86.13) Black/African-American 45 (1.65) Hispanic 99 (3.62) Native American 36 (1.32) Asian/Pacific Islander 43 (1.57) Other 156 (5.71) Missing 41 Geography US 2,234 (83.02) Canada 110 (4.10) Europe 266 (9.90) Other 81 (3.01) Missing 83 Type of user Medical 1,659 (59.81) Non-medical 1,115 (40.19) Have you ever used for prescription drugs?

Of the 1,040 participants report-ing pain and/or intractable pain, 619 (59.52%) reported depression and anxiety as comorbidities. As such, the odds of reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs were more than one and a half times greater (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.27-2.16) among those reporting using it to manage pain, anxiety and depression than among those using it to manage only one of the three conditions.States with legalized medical marijuana A slightly higher percentage of those who reported substitut - ing resided in states where medical cannabis was legal at the time of the survey (47% vs. 44%, p=0.47). This difference was not statistically significant. PROMIS Global Health The 10-item short form developed and published by PROMIS was used to arrive at a bottom-line indicator of self-reported health status. By summing the physical and mental health scores separately (using only participants with complete data on each subscale), the standard PROMIS raw score to T -score conversion allowed for comparing our sample with the general population. The distributions are standardized such that a score of 50 represents the mean for the US gen-eral population, with an SD of 10 points. A total of 1,186 respondents (43%) provided complete information for the 10-item short form. For mental health, the sample scored 39.34 (SD= 5.05; 95% CI, 39.15-39.53). For scored 40.26 (SD=3.94; 95% CI, 40.11-40.41), placing these respondents below average for global mental health and global physical health as compared with the general population. Those reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs scored similar to the overall sample population (mental health, mean: 39.75 of the PROMIS raw scores (i.e., non-T -score-converted scores), those who reported substitut-ing had slightly higher mental health scores (mean difference: 0.31; p<0.001) and slightly lower physical health scores 0PPIsAntipsychoticsAntimigraineAntiemeticsMuscle relaxantsSedatives/hypnoticsOthersNSAIDs/non-opioid analgesicsAntidepressantsAnxiolytics/benzodiazepinesNarcotics/opiates 886 337 313 238 209 144 94 70 63 54 50 23Anticonvulsants 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 Figure 1 Number of reported prescription drug substitutions, by drug category, during 2016 (n =2,473).

Sensitivity analysis A total of 389 respondents failed to provide a 5-digit code anonymously identifying themselves as unique respon-dents. When excluded from the analysis, the percentage of respondents reporting ever using cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs increased from 45.55% (n=1,248) to 46.28% (n=1,094), an increase of 1%. The odds of reporting substituting among medical users versus non-medical users decreased from 4.59 (95% CI, 3.87-5.43) to 4.54 (95% CI, 3.78-5.45), a decrease of 1.5%. Finally, while the total number of prescription drug substitu-tions by drug category decreased from 2,473 to 2,160, the per respondent substitution ratio remained two substitutions per respondent. Discussion The purpose of this study was to examine whether, and how often, cannabis users report substituting cannabis for prescription drugs. Overall, these PROs underscore four key points: 1) individuals are substituting cannabis for prescrip-tion drugs, independent of whether they identify themselves as medical users (medical users are doing so at almost five times the odds of non-medical users) and independent of legal access to medical cannabis; 2) this practice increases in frequency with age, up to 65 years, and is more common in females, particularly female medical users, and Native American/Asians/Pacific Islanders; 3) the most common classes of substitution were narcotics/opioids, anxiolytics/benzodiazepines and antidepressants; and 4) the odds of reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs were more than one and a half times greater among those reporting the use of cannabis to manage pain, anxiety and depression than among those using it to manage only one of these three conditions. Stated differently, pain, anxiety and depression seem to represent a comorbidity triad that is associated with greater substitution frequency. These data are in line with previous research suggesting that cannabis is commonly used as a substitute for prescrip-tion drugs. For example, in 2013 and 2016, Lucas et al 17,18 found that 68% of 259 and 87% of 410 physician-authorized medical cannabis users in Canada reported substituting can-nabis for alcohol and illicit or prescription drugs, respectively. In 2017, Lucas and Walsh 19 found that 63% of 271 such subjects reported substituting cannabis for prescription drugs such as opioids (30%), benzodiazepines (16%) and antide-pressants (12%), representing the same top three categories as data presented here. These findings also agree with our previous data showing that medical cannabis users report using cannabis most frequently to manage pain, anxiety and depression. 6 The present study contributes to a greater under - standing of substitution across specific classes of prescription drugs in a largely US-based sample, in a much larger cohort and cross-section, occurring among both medical and non-medical subjects, and in areas without legal access. While the results of research on the effects of cannabis for medical use have been largely mixed, our previous study indicated that patients reporting using cannabis for managing pain are experiencing adequate symptom relief. 6 In 2016, Boehnke et al conducted a survey at a medical cannabis dispensary and found a 64% decrease in opioid use among those reporting using cannabis for chronic pain (n= 118). Respondents also reported a reduction in other classes of drugs, including antidepressants and NSAIDs, as well as a for mean difference for mean 2 PROMIS Global Health short form: physical and mental health scores (mean [SE]; Maximum score =20 for each domain.

This team previously reported that in a survey of 1,429 medical cannabis users, 61% reported cannabis use for pain, 58% reported cannabis use for anxiety and 50% reported using cannabis to manage depression. 6 In 2016, Dale and Stacey21 reported that those using cannabis for pain were more likely to be substituting for prescription drugs. In 2017, Walsh et al published a review of medical cannabis and mental health to try to better understand how medical cannabis use may impact areas of potential concern for clinicians. \"Relaxation and relief of anxiety\" and \"relief of negative mood\" or depression were among the most widely reported conditions in 60 publications included in their analysis. 22 Because it is common for chronic pain patients to be prescribed combinatorial pharmacotherapy to address comorbidity with depression and/or anxiety, it is largely unknown how often patients may be discontinuing prescrip-tion medications when initiating cannabis use. 21 Doctors need to have open communication with their patients regarding these matters in order to ensure that the medical community does not repeat the prescribing mistakes made in the past with opioid pharmacotherapy, namely, unchecked use of medical cannabis that leads to adverse events and abuse. 23 Furthermore, these preliminary data can serve to drive pro-spective research focused on whether cannabis can assist in opioid tapering protocols so that doctors can offer patients science-based guidance. Importantly, older individuals may be substituting can- nabis for prescription drugs at a higher rate than the general population, a finding in line with previous research. 4 There are very little data on the impact of cannabis use in elderly popu-lations. Our data show a trend toward increased substitution with age, perhaps not surprisingly, as older populations are more likely to be prescribed prescription drugs, particularly psychotropic medications. 24,25 We previously reported that medical cannabis users are evaluating cannabis products for the presence of a secondary, non-intoxicating cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), ~40% of the time. 6 CBD does not have the same action at the can- nabinoid receptor as 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary intoxicating constituent in cannabis. To avoid adverse effects, particularly in elderly populations, the application of CBD-dominant cannabis varietals and preparations may be warranted. There is a need for more research on mental health disorders and cannabis use, particularly with a focus on CBD rather than THC-dominant cannabis. 22 This informa- tion is needed for doctors to be able to adequately participate in conversations with their patients, regardless of age, about the role that medical cannabis may play in managing mental health conditions. 26 We previously reported on gender differences in cannabis use and effects, highlighting the need for focused research on this topic. 27 Importantly, there is evidence of differences in endocannabinoid system function across gender.28-30 Here, we report that female users may be more likely to substitute cannabis than male users (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.40) and that female medical users may be much more likely to substitute cannabis than female non-medical users (OR, 6.09; 95% CI, 4.65-7.80). These findings are interesting given that females reported significantly less frequency and quantity of use in our previous study. In that study, women were more likely to report use for anxiety, nausea, anorexia and migraine headaches than men. Taken together, these findings provide preliminary data for future studies on gender-based differ - ences in cannabis use and effects. This study showed a nonsignificant difference between the proportion of individuals reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs in states with legalized medical can-nabis versus states where cannabis remains illegal (47% vs. 44%, p=0.47). This finding suggests that state laws allowing access to, and use of, medical cannabis may not be influenc-ing individual decision making in this area. This finding is in contrast to other studies showing that the use of prescrip-tion drugs fell in states once medical cannabis laws were implemented. 4 This finding has public health implications and should be explored further. As compared with the general population, survey respon- dents scored below average for global mental health and global physical health on the PROMIS 10-item short form. This association deserves further attention to determine whether individuals with lesser mental/physical health are using cannabis as a medical therapy or whether cannabis use is negatively affecting mental/physical health. Given the current nationwide epidemic of prescription opioid-related abuse, addiction and death, there is an urgent need for alternatives with efficacy and safer toxicology pro-files. 31 It is important to note that active \"substitution\" with cannabis may be a conscious decision to reduce harm caused by narcotics. 32 Not only may opioid therapy prove ineffec- tive for some patients but it may also induce serious adverse reactions that complicate management, including allodynia or opioid-induced hyperalgesia, also known as \"paradoxi-cal pain\". 33 Chronic pain is an \"expensive\" condition, both Journal of Pain Research 2017:10submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 996 Corroon Jr et al economically and socially, yet existing pharmacotherapeutic interventions are not always adequate.34-36 Taken with pre- clinical data on the role of the endocannabinoid system in stress, pain processing and immune homeostasis, it is clear that future investigation is warranted using controlled tri-als with human subjects to better understand the role that cannabis may play in treating pain, anxiety, depression and other conditions. 37-46 Limitations The study population was a self-selected convenience sample, and it is possible that individuals with favorable opinions of, and experiences with, cannabis are more likely to have responded to the questionnaire than those with negative opinions and experiences. This, when considered with the predominance of males, Caucasians and individuals aged <35 years, indicates that our sample may not be representa-tive of the general population. In addition, PROs are subject to reporting bias. 47,48 Another limitation of this study was the method by which prescription drug information was collected. The availability of an open-ended response field enabled narrative responses that made accurate categorization difficult. In some instances, this limitation may have resulted in undercounting. For example, a response of \"a variety of SSRIs\" was counted as one drug substitution in the drug category antidepressants. In other instances, it may have resulted in overcounting. For example, a response of \"opiate pain killers (Roxicet, Percocet, Vicodin)\" was counted as three substitutions in the drug category of narcotics/opioids, yet the respondent may have only substituted cannabis for \"Vicodin\" after previously trying \"Roxicet\" and \"Percocet\". Additionally, drugs that are available both OTC and via prescription (e.g., ibuprofen) were counted as prescription substitutions, given the nature of the question. The substitution count for these OTC drugs would be overestimated if these drugs were not prescribed. Data for determining the proportion of individuals report- ing substituting cannabis for prescription drugs in states with legal versus illegal medical cannabis policies were analyzed as of December 31, 2016. Several states may not have had legal medical cannabis policies at the time an individual completed the survey, but did have such policies at the time of analysis, which may falsely increase the proportion of those reporting substituting in states with legalized medical cannabis. Conclusion These data contribute to a growing body of literature sug-gesting cannabis, legal or otherwise, is being used as a substitute for prescription drugs, particularly prescription pain relievers. According to the CDC, 259 million prescrip-tions for pain relievers were written by health care providers in 2012. 49 In 2015, two million Americans aged 12 years had a substance use disorder that involved prescription pain relievers. 50 The CDC also reports that overdoses from prescription opioids are a \"driving factor\" in the increase in opiate overdose deaths over the past 15 years. Such deaths have more than quadrupled in the same time period with >20,000 overdose deaths attributable to prescription pain relievers alone. 51 Despite the illegality of cannabis in many states and the lack of professional guidance on dosing, routes of delivery and inadequate standardization or quality control for medical use, individuals are taking it upon themselves to augment, or discontinue, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs in favor of a largely unregulated herbal one.

Abstract Introduction: Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a chronic pelvic pain condition largely refractory to treatment. Cannabis (marijuana) use has been reported for a wide variety of chronic pain conditions, but no study has examined prevalence of cannabis use, symptom benefit or side effects, or frequency in CP/CPPS. Methods: Participants were recruited from an outpatient CP/ CPPS urology clinic (n = 98) and online through the Prostatitis Foundation website (n = 244). Participants completed question - naires (demographics, CP/CPPS, depression, cannabis). Results: The clinic sample included Canadian patients and the online sample included primarily American patients. Due to differ - ences, groups were examined separately. Almost 50% of respon-dents reported using cannabis (clinic n = 49; online n = 89). Of the cannabis users, 36.8% of clinic and 75% of online respondents reported that it improved their symptoms. Most of the respondents (from the clinic and online groups) reported that cannabis improved their mood, pain, muscle spasms, and sleep. However, they did not note any improvements for weakness, fatigue, numbness, ambula-tion, and urination. Overall, the effectiveness \"somewhat/very effective\" (57% clinic; 63% online). There were no differences between side effects or choice of con- sumption and most reported using cannabis rarely.Conclusions: These are the first estimates in men suffering from CP/ CPPS and suggest that while cannabis use is prevalent, its medical use and benefit are unknown. This is an understudied area and the benefit or hazard for cannabis use awaits further study. Introduction Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is characterized by pain in the perineum, pelvic, and supra - pubic areas or the external genitalia with variable degrees of voiding or ejaculatory disturbances. 1,2 The prevalence 2.2%-16%), with a 6.7% median.3 CP/CPPS symptoms do not routinely remit, with 66% of community-based samples experiencing symptoms 1 year later, 4 and patients showing no changes in pain, disability, or catastroph - izing over 2 years later.5 CP/CPPS etiology is unclear and medical treatments are largely ineffective.6 Medications (anti - microbials, alpha-blockers, anti-inflammatories), as well as phytotherapy, biofeedback, thermal therapies, and pelvic floor training have been examined 7 and may provide mild benefit,6 but most men continue to experience chronic pain. Physicians may use opioids to manage CP/CPPS pain, but their efficacy is limited and physicians fear tolerance, mis-use, and side effects, such as nausea/vomiting or sedation. 8 Chronic pain patients are turning to alternate forms of symp - tom relief, yet no research on this is available for CP/CPPS. Cannabis sativa has been used for pain and symptom relief for thousands of years. In Canada and several American states, patients use medical cannabis for severe intractable illnesses. As an addition to opioid treatment for chronic pain, vaporized cannabis results in pain reduction without alter-ing plasma opioid levels. 9 Moreover, 71% of the available randomized controlled studies concluded that cannabinoids were associated with pain relief, with low adverse effects, and good tolerance. 10 Cannabis may be used in conjunc - tion with or substitute for prescription opiates resulting in reduced opiate use. 11 Wide ranging types, quantities, and frequency of cannabis use for pain relief have been reported, with chronic non-cancer pain patients reporting previous use (15%) or current use (10%). 12 We examined cannabis prevalence among men experi - encing CP/CPPS-like symptoms from a tertiary care urology department and from an online group. Although previous work has not examined cannabis use in CP/CPPS, it was expected that use would echo previous pain studies. 12 We also solicited patient self-reports on the side effects or poten - tial benefits, frequency, and indication of future cannabis use. A survey of cannabis (marijuana) use and self-reported benefit in men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndromeOriginal researchCUAJ November-December 2014 Volume 8, Issues 11-12 E902Tripp et al. Methods Participants/procedure Identical online and outpatient surveys were administered to an online community-based sample and a tertiary care outpatient CP/CPPS clinic sample. All participants remained anonymous and received no financial compensation. Clinic patients were approached after their appointments and briefed about this Research Ethics Board-approved study. Interested participants then provided written consent and received a package (letter of information, debriefing form, questionnaires, postage-paid return envelope) to complete and mail back. The online sample was recruited through the Prostatitis Foundation. 13 Participants were a self-selected \"availability\" sample from site visitors. All participants were required to read and write in English. All questionnaires were in English. Measures Demographics Participants completed questions on demographics (age, CP/CPPS diagnosis, health problems, tobacco use, medication use). Medical symptoms The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) 14 assessed prostatitis-like symptoms and their impact on daily life (pain, urinary symptoms, qual - ity of life) providing a score range from 0 to 43. The self-administered NIH-CPSI provides a valid, psychometrically robust outcome measure. 14 Confirmation of CP/CPPS cases was based on NIH-CPSI pain/discomfort in perineum and/or with ejaculation and NIH-CPSI total pain score of 4 (0-21), used in the community 15-17 and in the general population18 studies. Depression The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)19 is a reliable and valid self-report measure using 9 items to assess depres - sive symptoms. An item sum was used for the indexation of depression. Experience with cannabis We used a 21-question descriptive survey on experience with cannabis; questions were binary (yes/no), multiple choice, and rating scales. Questions included whether participants had ever used cannabis, the purpose of use, relief of pain/effects with use, potential side effects, usage frequency, and usage method. 12 Participants rated personal experience with different modes of delivery using Likert scale-style responses. Data analysis Scores were excluded if >15% of the items were missing on measures. Participants who provided 85% of items on a particular measure had the missing items imputed using means replacement procedures. 20 As a check on generaliz- ability, primary comparisons between the online and clinic data were computed for age and domains of NIH-CPSI (qual - ity of life pain, urinary), and the PHQ-9. If outcomes differed significantly, online and clinical samples would be exam - ined separately. Due to the exploratory nature, unadjusted t-tests and descriptive analyses (chi-square) were used to evaluate differences between cannabis users and non-users. Results The total sample of participants was comprised of an online self-reported CP/CPPS sample (n = 376) and a tertiary care outpatient CP/CPPS clinic sample (n = 100). Two participants were excluded from the clinic sample and 35% (n = 132) of the online sample was excluded due to incomplete data. In the end, we had 244 online and 98 clinic participants. Missing data pattern for the online group was random. The online group was on average 10 years younger than the clinic group (p < 0.001), with an average age of 44.57 (standard deviation 13.96) for the full sample (Table 1). The clinic sample was Canadian and the online sample was primarily American. The online group reported more depressive symptoms, pain, poorer quality of life, and worse symptom scores (Table 2). For the remaining analyses, samples were examined across groups. Most of clinic (63.3%) and online (79.1%) participants reported a score of 4 or above on prostatitis cut scores ( 2 = 9.24, p = 0.013). While the clinic and online groups did not differ in terms tobacco use (2 = 1.17, p = 0.340), the online group (63.1%) consumed more medi - cation for pain, mood, sleep, or spasms than the clinic group (47.4%) ( 2 = 7.00, p = 0.01). There were no group differ - ences when asked if they had ever used cannabis ( 2 = 0.87, p = 0.390) (yes 50% clinic, 44.3% online). Examining only those previously using, 36.8% clinic and 75% of the online groups reported that cannabis improved their symptoms ( 2 = 7.63, p = 0.006). Participants were questioned whether cannabis use made their symptoms \"worse/no better\" to \"slightly/much better\" (Table 3). The large majority of online and half of clinic par - ticipants reported that cannabis improved their mood by a CUAJ November-December 2014 Volume 8, Issues 11-12 E903cannabis use in \"slightly/much better\" degree (Fisher's exact test p = 0.026). Across both groups, cannabis' effects made pain \"slightly/ much better\" (2 = 2.48, p = 0.619), as with muscle spasms (2 = 0.51, p = 0.474), sleep ( 2 = 0.54, p = 0.461), and a borderline majority for nausea (2 = 0.51, p = 0.474). Also a minority of participants reported \"slightly/much better\" improvement in weakness ( 2 = 3.11, p = 0.078), fatigue (2 = 3.40, p = 0.065), numbness ( 2 = 1.16, p = 0.281), ambulating 2 = 0.64, p = 0.423), and urination (Fisher's exact test p = 0.432). When asked on overall effectiveness of cannabis for CP/CPPS, most participants (57% clinic, as \"somewhat/very effec - tive\" ( 2 = 7.89, p = 0.051). There was an even distribution of side effects reported by the groups, with most suggesting \"none' to \"mild\" side effects from cannabis use (70.3% clinic, 70.8% online) ( 2 = 0.05, p = 0.972) (Table 4). Also, if offered a choice, participants reported similar preferences for cannabis method across groups ( 2 = 1.99, p = 0.370), but smoking was a leading choice. There were no differences when asked about the pre - ferred form of cannabis they had used ( 2 = 2.59, p = 0.274), although most participants listed herbal option (buds, sin - semilla, hydrophonic). In current cannabis users, frequency did not differ between groups ( 2 = 0.27, p = 0.88), with most respondents using \"rarely\" (73.3% clinic, 77.3% online). Discussion This is the first study to document the initial prevalence and patterns of cannabis use in men suffering from CP/CPPS from an outpatient urology clinic and online. Almost 50% of participants used cannabis and almost 3/4 reported using it for symptom relief. These figures are bigger than those in other studies. 12 The samples were treated as separate during analyses because the online group was younger, reported greater depression, pain, and diminished quality of life. Interestingly, while examining only those having used can-nabis, fewer clinic respondents reported benefit compared to the online group. This almost doubling of the reported benefit by the online group may be related to symptom/dis-ease severity differences in this study. The present data can-not describe factors underlying differences in benefit across groups, but this study is consistent with the suggestion that chronic pain is associated with lifetime marijuana use. 21 Physicians should be aware and question patients on cannabis use. Despite a lack of information on the mecha-nisms of glycinergic cannabinoids for pain, cannabidiol, a major nonpsychoactive component of cannabis, suppressed chronic inflammatory pain in mice. 22 Furthermore, the use of cannabis was not associated with analgesic tolerance in rats. 22 It appears that cannabinoids' anti-inflammatory action Table 1.

However, no improvements were in weakness, fatigue, numbness, or ambulation. Improved symptoms for some patients might reflect the shared effects that pain/muscle spasm can have in regard to improving sleep and ultimately mood. Current research shows that unresolved chronic pain, continuing disease, obesity, and sleeping problems predict the persistence of pain, while issues like mood are weakly associated. 24 Of other note, cannabis use was not helpful for urinary symptoms, which can be very bothersome in patients with CP/CPPS. This survey showed that the side effects of cannabis appear minimal, with most patients reporting \"none' to \"mild\" side effects. More detailed information on the amount of canna-bis use, the types used (medical vs. other) would be impor-tant to provide a more detailed pattern of examining benefits. If offered a choice on how to use cannabis, participants reported smoking as the preferred methods - this is similar with other studies. 25 There were no differences by groups - the herbal form was endorsed by most respondents. In regard to current frequency of use, most participants reported using cannabis \"rarely;\" further study into usage patterns may shed some light on whether participants use cannabis primarily to manage pain flares or muscle spasms, or to aid with sleep. If usage is associated with intermittent pains, as flares, then that may reflect the rarity of reported use. Our study has its limitations. This initial survey cannot qualify the benefits/risks of cannabis use in CP/CPPS, and simply suggests rates for further comparison. Sample size was an issue in some analyses because finer detail in ques-tions, such as symptom benefit, had to be collapsed into 2 categories (\"worse/no change\" and are necessary to gather more accurate patterns of use and benefit. Although our samples were not randomized or stratified, they represent tertiary care outpatient males diagnosed with CP/CPPS, as well as community-based men with CP/CPPS-like symptoms. More online participants reported a prosta-titis cut score. Perhaps the clinic men experienced reduced symptoms under the care of a specialist, but there was no opportunity to verify this in our study. Future research should also collect healthcare utilization and previous treatments prior to the onset of cannabis use. This data would allow contrasts and provide insight into medical comorbidities prior to cannabis use. It would also be interesting to exam-ine the associations between psychological pre-cannabis use pain-associated comorbidities, like catastrophizing, and patterns of use. Conclusion This is the first study to examine and report on cannabis usage and benefit in participants with CP/CPPS from a ter-tiary care and community \"availability\" sample. The current data suggest that almost 50% of men with CP/CPPS-like symptoms have used cannabis in their lifetimes and that a minority of clinic patients versus most online participants reported cannabis benefit. Future research should examine larger representative samples to further document usage patterns, fuller CP/CPPS symptom benefit, and associated factors with usage in predictive models. The ultimate study would be a randomized controlled trial prospectively evalu - ating the efficacy and safety of cannabis compared to either placebo or an active comparator.

Smart, Ph .D.*; Timothy Weber, B.A.** & Carol Birchmore-Timney, M.A.** Abstract- This article reports on an exploratory study of medical cannabis users. Interviews were completed with 50 self-identified medical cannabis users recruited through notices in newspapers and on bulletin boards. They reported using cannabis for a variety of conditions including HIV\u00ad AIDS-related problems, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, menstrual cramps, migraine. narcotic addiction as well as everyday aches, pains, stresses and sleeping difficulties. A majority also used cannabis for recreational purposes, and many were longer-term cannabis users. However, there were some notable exceptions. Almost all smoked cannabis and many did so two to three times a day. Few admitted negative experiences with cannabis, although some problems evident to the researchers were not clearly admitted. Those who told their doctors about their medical cannabis use found doctors noncommittal or supportive. The results raise questions about the definition of medical cannabis use and about policies that might be developed to accommodate such use. Limitations of the study are noted and further research suggested. Research priorities include population surveys, studies involving larger, more representative samples of medical cannabis users and studies of medical cannabis use among people with HIV-AIDS. Keywords -cannabis, HIV/AIDs, medical marijuana, self medication Cannabis has a long history of use as a medicine, and during the 19th century extracts of cannabis were recom\u00ad mended by respected physicians for a wide range of medical conditions (Grinspoon & Bakalar 1997). Cannabis was considered anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, anti-asthmatic and anticonvulsant proper\u00ad ties and promoted for the treatment of tetanus, cholera, pruritis, uterine dysfunction, labor and menstrual pains, gout, asthma, neuralgia, rheumatism, convulsions and tThe views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health *Senior Scientist, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, London, Ontario, Canada. **Research Associate, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, London, Ontario, Canada.

Early in the 20th century the use of cannabis fell out of favor with the medical profession due to the dis\u00ad covery of newer, more stable and effective drugs. A \u00b7 synthetic form of THC (dronabinol or marino)) has since been developed for the treatment of nausea associated with chemotherapy and AIDS-related anorexia. However, until recently, cannabis has mainly been used illegally as a recreational drug with the intention of getting high rather than treating medical conditions. Anecdotal and journalistic evidence indicating that cannabis is regaining popularity as a medicine has been accumulating since the 1970s. Personal testimonials from users and statements by lobbyists and some physicians have indicated that cannabis is used by people suffering from glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, mood disorders, and other disorders that cause pain, muscular tension or spasms (Campbell l996). One study of people using a buyers' club Volume 32 (4), October -December 2000 Ogborne ct al. in California showed that many were using cannabis to treat AIDS-related symptoms or for a variety of chronic pain, neurological and psychiatric disorders (Harris, Mendelson & Jones 1998). There are two published studies of medical cannabis use among people with HIV/AIDS. The first was a survey conducted during 1993/94 that involved patients of an AIDS clinic in Alabama (Dansak 1997). Of the 72 patients inter\u00ad viewed, 33 ( 46%) were currently using cannabis and almost all had used it before the onset of AIDS/HIV . Most current users had used cannabis for medical reasons as it had ben\u00ad eficial effects on gastrointestinal conditions such as nausea, vomiting, indigestion and appetite. A few also noted that cannabis helped alleviate depression and two noted that it reduced anxiety. The second study of medical cannabis use by persons with HIV I AIDS was conducted in Hawaii (Wesner 1996) through an AIDS Newsletter. It reached 374 persons affected with AIDS or HIV but only 35% responded, and it is not clear whether respondents were more likely to have used cannabis than nonrespo ndents. Of those who did respond, 36.9% had used cannabis as a therapy for AIDS symptoms; of those who had also used prescription anti-emetics, 80% preferred cannabis. A third of those who had used cannabis medically had not discussed this with their doctors. There are no published surveys of medical cannabis use among people suffering from chemothera py-induced nausea, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy or other physical con\u00ad ditions for which cannabis is said to be helpful. However, several surveys have shown that cannabis use is common among psychiatric patients who often seem to use cannabis to medicate psychiatric symptoms (Beesley & Russell 1997; Timmerman 1997; Mathers et al. 1991; Blackwell, Beresford & Lambert 1987). The prevalence of medical cannabis use is not known except in Ontario, where the results from a province-wide survey of adults aged 18 and over indicate that about 2% had intentionally used cannabis for self-defined medical reasons at least once in the past year. This repre sent 7.6% of those who had ever used cannabis and 22% of those who had used cannabis in the last year. No comparable figures are available from other Canadian provinces or from other countries. The latest national drug survey in Canada was in 1994 and this showed that 7.6% of the adult population had used cannabis in the past year (Smart & Ogborne 2000). However, no questions about medical cannabis use were included. The medical use of cannabis raises new and important medical, social policy and legal issues concerning the rights of people to use an illegal substance for medical reasons. In the United States and in Canada there is considerable pub\u00ad lic support for the medical use of cannabis and for the rights of physicians to recommend cannabis to people who might benefit from it (Lindesmith Centre 1998; Angus Reid Group Journal of Psychoacrive Drugs 436 Who is Using Cannabis as a Medicine 1997). Attempts have also been made to establish buyers' clubs to provide cannabis to those with legitimate medical needs, and several recent court rulings have been in favor of the rights of sick people to use cannabis for medical reasons. More information is therefore needed on the nature and extent of medical cannabis use and on motiva\u00ad tions, characteristics and experiences of those involved. This is especially so because cannabis is used medically by some of the most vulnerable and sickest people. This article reports a study that explores why people use can\u00ad nabis for medical reasons, the effects they get, their methods and patterns of use, their experiences with physicians and their encounters with the Jaw. It provides an analysis of interviews with 50 cannabis users in Toronto. 1 These interviews were conducted to (I) assess the feasibility of a larger study involving medical cannabis users and (2) explore opinions and practices concerning the medical use of cannabis. Implications for further research and for social policy are considered in the discussion. METHODS Those interviewed were recruited mostly through notices placed in newspapers and on bulletin boards at the Addiction Research Foundati on, downtown bookstores. grocery stores, restaurants, and laundromats, AIDS clinics and drop-in centres and an informal buyers' club. These notices invited those who had ever used cannabis for medi\u00ad cal reasons to share their experiences in a confidential interview. A few respondents (Jess than five) were also recruited through contacts with professionals and through the use of snowball sampling. Those who called in response to information about the study and who said that they used cannabis for medical conditions were invited for an inter\u00ad view. Most interviews were conducted at the Addiction Research Foundation. Others were conducted in respon\u00ad dents' homes, at a drop-in centre, or a restaurant; two interviews were conducted by telephone. All those inter\u00ad viewed were paid $10. All interview questions were open-ended and encompassed a range of topics. In this article, the focus will be on: (I) reasons for the medical use of cannabis; (2) other attempts to treat the conditions for which cannabis was used; (3) routes to cannabis use; (4) methods of use; (5) patterns and amounts of use; (6) sources of supply; (7) negative experiences with can\u00ad nabis; and (8) experiences with physicians. RESUL TS Fifty (50) individuals were interviewed over a six\u00ad month period. About 70 others inquired about the study but could not be contacted. Twenty others did not show up for interviews. Of the 50 people interviewed 33 (66%) were male. The average age was 38, with a range from 26 to 57. Volume 32 (4). October -December 2000 Ogborne et al.

Medical Reasons Reported for Cannabis Use I can see clearer ... a little sharper .... Sometimes my eyes Table I shows the conditions for which respondents said they used cannabis. The majority (n=34) reported us\u00ad ing cannabis to treat symptoms of organic illnesses or to treat pains due to accidents or unknown causes. The most common organic illness was HIV I AIDS (n= 11 ). Others (n=9) said they used cannabis for serious psychological problems (clinical depression or chronic anxiety), anorexia (n=2) or symptoms related to narcotic addiction (craving and methadone-rela ted nausea). One person claimed to use cannabis to treat chronic but unexplained nausea. Finally, two reported using cannabis to treat minor medical condi\u00ad tions and cope with everyday stresses. A wide range of symptoms or conditions were report\u00ad edly relieved by cannabis including difficulty sleeping, physical pain, loss of appetite, nausea, seizures, tics and muscle spasms, craving for narcotics, loss of energy, depression and anxiety. Table 2 shows the frequency with which specific symptoms were mentioned. The total num\u00ad ber of symptoms exceeds the number of respondents because many reported using cannabis for two or more symptoms or conditions. Typically nausea and loss of appetite were mentioned together as were depression and anxiety. The reported reasons for taking cannabis varied grea tly: Its mostly for spasms. I use it for relaxing ... I get a lot of pain running all down my neck .... I get a lot of spasms coz of the HIV ... It (cannabis] helps because it relaxes me and gets rid of the muscle pains in my neck.

Treatments Other than Cannabis Tried for Main Conditions and Symptoms Other attempts to treat the symptoms and conditions that motivated self medication with cannabis were quite variable. In some cases it was not clear that alternatives to cannabis had been tried. However, in other cases cannabis was described as superior to other, more conventional, treat\u00ad ments: [I've tried] Dilantin and phenobarbital but they were not controlling the seizures .... I've not used any other medica\u00ad tion (except cannabis) since 1971. (male with epilepsy). Two specialists ... gave me pills ... but they didn't make a noticeable difference .... I've tried health food stuff ... it just takes a little bit [of cannabis] ... to make it (nausea] go away. (female with chronic nausea). So ... I tried ... Prozac. It did not help me . it made me a different person ... very introverted ... withdrawn. (female with migraines and insomnia). I was taking tons of medication a major dose of Anafranil [an antidepressant] and ... Rivatrol (an anticon\u00ad vulsant] and ... they were getting me very lethargic and laid back ... what was happening was it was getting me so stoned and so happy. . my tics didn't go away ... [but] I couldn't give a hoot and hinny ... with Tourette's Syndrome) They [doctors] gave me Tylenol 3s and they made me a bit groggy .... I wanted to work ... I noticed that when I took a Volume 32 (4), October -December 2000 Ogborne et al. bit of marijuana it alleviated the symptoms and allowed me to function normally. (male with repetitive strain injury). I was on Serax [a sedative] once for almost a year but I found that taking Serax made me sick. It made my stomach feel real weird. So I discontinued it .. marijuana makes you feel strange but it's a good kinda strange ... it's not the kinda stone where you're walking around and your head feels like it's 15 miles high. (male with HIV). I tried different pain killers and at first they seemed to be okay but . . they stopped writing prescriptions for me. I found it [the marijuana] helped. It made me motivated and gave me energy and kept me active. (female with back pain). I was taking Valium, diazepam ... like I took it for like three years and then I started smoking marijuana ... I didn't have the same feelings I had when I was taking the Valium. I felt more calm, more relaxed .... It was able to open my appetite to eat. (male suffering from depression). Well, I suffer from depression and when you're really, really, really depressed a joint works a lot better .... I've tned all the antidepressants, like all of them and I've just given up on it. (male with depression). Cannabis was, however, also sometimes used in com\u00ad bination with drug treatments that respondents found helpful. I'm a chronic asthmatic, So ... I'm using it [cannabis] in combination with ... Beclavent which is a long-term steroid and occasional use of Vento! in, an immediate release asth\u00ad matic drug, just for when you're in a crisis situation ... and I find a little marijuana on the side does help. (male with chronic asthma). I fell down a flight of stairs ... and found myself in a lot of pain . . . decided to stop taking the prescribed medication because I ballooned up to 235 pounds .... I'm back to taking Tylenol 3s but I've reduced my intake to more than half since I've started smoking [cannabis ). (Female with chronic pain). Only one person with HIV/AIDS reported being pre\u00ad scribed Marino]\u00ae (synthetic THC) for HIV/AIDS-related anorexia and nausea. However, he claimed that this had no noticeable effects. Apart from the perceived medical advan\u00ad tages of cannabis, some respondents also valued cannabis because it was relatively inexpensive or \"natural\": It [Marino! \u00ae] is like $700 for a month's supply of 90 pills and that's the max you can get. ... So that's why I'd rather buy cannabis on the street with the welfare cheque (male with HIV). Because it's a natural, organic thing, instead of taking these chemical prescriptions which I don't like. I'm a naturalist and I'd rather do something that grows naturally. (female with anorexia, bulimia and depression). I would much rather use something natural-a plant product . than a chemical or pharmaceutical drug coz I found that they have a lot of side effects. (male with Crohn's disease). Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 439 Who is Using Cannabis as a Medicine Routes to Cannabis Use The majority (n=42) of interviewees had at least some experience with cannabis as a recreational drug, and some (n=30) described a long history of recreational use (seven to 35 years). In these cases self-defined, medical cannabis use typically started when recreational use was found to be helpful for medical or psychological problems: I had lost a lot of weight. I was down to like 97 pounds. When I started smoking marijuana I started just smoking it causally ... to be part of the crowd. But, I noticed the more that I smoked, the hungrier I got and the more that I eat, I found the better I sleep. (male with HIV). I used to smoke when I was younger but that was when I guess when I started first smoking it was more recreational, with the guys sort of thing, then I stopped for quite a long period of time-I was a very hyper person. So ... then I decided to smoke it again. (male with insomnia). When I used to smoke it [cannabis] for recreation I was run\u00ad ning a lot of track and field and that's ... when I noticed when I ... pulled muscles and so forth the pain wasn't there at all. (male with migraine). I had tried it for recreational use back as a teenager ... and I found that ... there's times when I was feeling bad with my illness and I'd smoke some and I felt better .... So, urn, I thought that it probably might work for me and ... It worked better than most of the medicine I was taking. (male with Crohn's disease). I've been smoking dope for 24 years. Originally, peer pres\u00ad sure, getting high, now I don't even get high, I smoke it to increase my appetite ... Can't even maintain weight unless I eat five, six times a day. Can't do that unless I smoke a couple of joints. (male with anorexia) . Respondents with no, or very limited previous experi\u00ad ences with cannabis (n=9) started using it medically after reading about it or on the advice of others. Two reported that they first started using cannabis on the advice of a physician: I was drinking beer at the time ... a friend asked me if I wanted to try it and ... was shocked to find out how it made me feel. It was just magic. (male with AIDS). A friend made me some Sleepy Time tea with cannabis in it. (male with Tourette's Syndrome). Dr .... was seeing me for epilepsy suggested that I smoke a joint before I came for the next visit ... and I did. . . he was having trouble controlling the epilepsy. (male with epilepsy). Around four or five years ago I read and even my doctor had suggested that maybe that this was a good thing . . because of my ... problem with wasting. (male with HIV). Methods of Cannabis Use Smoking was the primary and the preferred method for using cannabis either because it was inherently enjoyable or Volume 32 (4), October - December 2000 Ogborne et al. because of its advantages over other methods of use. I just smoke it .... I have tried hash brownies and I've tried marijuana brownies ... but to me the high is not the same . I smoke cigarettes constantly, right? ... to smoke a joint is the same thing as smoking a cigarette except for you're get\u00ad ting a buzz off a joint (male with HIV) I've eaten it in the past. ... I've drank it in tea .... put it in sauces and cooking ... for me immediate effective relief is smoking ... eating is too expensive ... smoking you don't need as much to get the effect what-have-you and it's more immediate too. (male with epilepsy). It's just easy to do [smoking] ... you have to put it and just light it up ... so it's a lot easier . (male on methadone). Some advantages to eating or drinking cannabis were identified: In tea form ... it effects you faster, it's absorbed faster ... but it is a totally different high ..... It's more of a body type stone ... relaxes your body whereas if you smoke it, it still has the same effect but it's more of a head stone as well. (male with Crohn's Disease). I think it's longer lasting [eating or drinking marijuana] . don't have to worry so much about the smell of it. (female with pain from an accident) I worry about the respiratory side effects and the social as\u00ad pects-sometimes .... my partner doesn 't like me to smoke in the house so I step outside and the neighbors can smell it and I'm not always comfortable with that. (male with mul\u00ad tiple HIV-related problems). It [cannabis] can make me lazy. . It makes me cough. (male with depression). What about my lungs and throat and I don't want to be smok\u00ad ing at all. I'm a nonsmoker at heart. (female with chronic pain). Only two respondents said that they never smoked can\u00ad nabis. One was the person with Tourette's Syndrome who reported drinking cannabis in tea. The other was a woman who used cannabis in tea or banana bread for menstrual cramps. One respondent had a novel method of using can\u00ad nabis: I'm mixing it with alcohol. ... crushed up as a paste and rub it on my chest as a plaster for like ... lung infections or colds. (male with migraine). Patterns and Amount of Cannabis Use Thirty five (70%) of respondents typically smoked can\u00ad nabis every day, and among these daily users, the majority smoked two to three times a day. Those using cannabis to stimulate their appetites used it at meal times, while those who ever used cannabis to help them sleep (n=28), used it later in the evenings. Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 440 Who is Using Cannabis as a Medicine Total daily consumption was, however, quite variable. One person reported smoking up to ten joints a day while another said that she made a joint last all day by only tak\u00ad ing a few puffs before meals. Based on reports of the costs of cannabis and typical monthly expendi tures the average monthly consumption was between one and two ounces. with a range from less than one quarter ounce to over three ounces. These estimates included daily users but excluded those who reported growing their own cannabis or getting it free. Thirteen3 respondents reported that, in most cases their use of cannabis was closely associated with symptom re\u00ad lief or avoidance: I start smoking about two weeks before my period begins. (female with menstrual cramps). If I can do without it, I do without it. Even if I have my tics back I do without it. I like to keep it for that special moment . .. when I have to make a presentation ... [at] a board meeting. (male with Tourette's Syndrome). However, in the majority of cases (n=37) cannabis was also used recreationally and the distinction between medi\u00ad cal and nonmedical use was blurred: It's beautiful when you can sit down and smoke a little joint and just get wasted out of your face ... yes we like the high. (male with HIV). Sometimes a friend comes over in the morning of whatever and its like a beer on a Sunday afternoon. . (female with nausea). For those few (n=l3)4 who said they did use cannabis recreationally, the cannabis high was either seen as a medi\u00ad cal benefit or as a state to be avoided. I just go with it ... it makes me feel better you know. once I start feeling better then I know I'm there ... I just look at it as a pleasant side effect ... getting a bit high. (male with Crohn's Disease). The high is the one that gives me the enelg)'. (female with HIV). Don't like getting high because the disorganization gets worse. (male with migraine headaches). Sources and Methods of Supply Almost all respondents obtained cannabis from regu\u00ad lar dealers or friends. However, two reported that they grew their own and one reported going to a buyers' club. It seems more legitima te (going to the buyers' club) than meeting someone on the street ... and you don't know if you're gonna get ripped off or beaten up. (male with HIV). Only two reported that they did not have established sup\u00ad pliers of cannabis and went in search of cannabis whenever Volume 32 (4). October - December 2000 Ogborne et al. they needed it: I have to go and wait for somebody to show up at these places where they sell ... it's too far away and sometimes I go there and they're not there. (female with HIV). I phone people who might know somebody coz nobody I know smokes. So I'm asking them to lean on their friends. (female with chronic pain). Finally, one respondent said that he got cannabis from his doctor: He just gets it for me and I have to come in to get it ... so I never get accosted by anybody. (male with HIV). Negative Experiences Associated with Cannabis Use About a third of those interviewed reported being stopped and searched for cannabis or other drugs and drug paraphernalia at some time. These were typically long-tenn recreational users, but two who saw their use of cannabis use as strictly medical had also been arrested and charged. One won a court case by convincing the judge that the can\u00ad nabis was used for medical reasons, while the second was preparing to challenge a conviction for possession on the same grounds. A third, strict medical user with AIDS had been contacted by the police following a complaint from a neighbor. However, no arrest was made and the respon\u00ad dent felt that the police were \"very humane\" when they suggested that he could avoid upsetting the neighbor by smoking on a private balcony. That cannabis is an illegal drug weighed on the minds of most respondents and they were careful to avoid being arrested. However, medical use was also seen as poten\u00ad tially giving immunity to serious legal consequences: l\"m HIV positive ... What are you going to do? Gonna send me to jaiJ? (male with HIV). Some respondents had been harmed by their use of cannabis, but this was not always acknowledged. One, who saw cannabis and drug use generally in a very positive light, had been severely hurt while riding a bicycle under the influence of cannabis and had since continued a dysfunc\u00ad tional lifestyle involving the heavy use of cannabis and other drugs. Another gave an incoherent account of how can\u00ad nabis had helped him psychologically, but it appeared that some of his problems (anxiety and depression) were drug\u00ad induced. One other responde nt, who suffered from depression, also speculated that this may have been made worse by cannabis use. Having to buy on the street resulted in a financial bur\u00ad den for most interviewees. The appetite stimulant effects of cannabis were negative consequences for two respon\u00ad dents who were not using it for that reason. Most did not see cannabis as having any negative effects. However, the following negative effects were each mentioned by at least lou mal of Psychoactive Drugs 441 Who is Using Cannabis as a Medicine one respondent: rejection by family members, lethargy, apathy, cough or throat irritation from smoking, thirst. loss of concentration, short-tenn memory loss, paranoia, severe intoxication and depression. Many interviewees were using cannabis two or more times a day for a long time and they could be expected to experience withdrawal symptoms if they ever stopped us\u00ad ing. However, none expressed significant concerns about cannabis dependence: I am dependent already, it doesn't bother me. cuz I'm still ok and it helps me lead a healthy life. (female with HIV-related anorexia). No, I'm not concerned about becoming dependent. ... I know it's slightly habit forming but it's not a chemical ad\u00ad diction like cigarettes. (male with Crohn 's Disease). I do get some withdrawal effect ... here is a little bit of con- cern mostly because it's illegal .... if I could just get it at the drugstore I wouldn't have much concern. (male with chronic pain). I think it's more of a psychological addiction than a physical one for me because I've gone days without it. If I became dependent it would be more emotionally than physically . (male with HIV). Experiences with Physicians Only twelve respondents said that they had not told their physicians that they were using cannabis for medical or other reasons. Others had told their physicians and found their reactions mostly noncommittal but sometimes clearly positive. Only three said their doctors discouraged them from using cannabis: Well he [the doctor] doesn't approve of it but in a stupid little way he does approve of it because he knows that from my ... personal experience telling him of just how much good it's done for me. (male with HIV). My psychiatrist is very old school. He's telling me that I can become addicted. . . He would rather see me go through surgery and nerve blocks. (male with chronic pain). Almost all of those with HIV/AIDS had told their phy\u00ad sicians about their use of cannabis and had found physicians to be very understanding and supportive. Physicians were also reported as being sympathetic or supportive of can\u00ad nabis use by at least one respondent suffering from nausea and weight loss associated with methadone treatment, chronic pain, epilepsy, menstrual cramps. Crohn 's Disease. repetitive strain injury, and depression. SUMMAR Y AND DISCUSSION This exploratory study shows that cannabis was being used for a range of medical reasons. Among those interviewed Volume 32 (4), October- December 2000 Ogborne et al. the most common conditions associated with cannabis use were HIV/AIDS-related problems, chronic pain, depression and anxiety. However, cannabis was also used to treat men\u00ad strual cramps, anorexia, py-induced loss of appetite, Crohn 's Disease, arthritis and everyday aches, pains, stresses and sleeping difficulties. Specific symptoms that were report\u00ad edly relieved by cannabis included sleeping difficulties, nausea, loss of appetite, pain, depression and anxie ty, tics and seizures, loss of energy, breathing difficulties, craving for heroin, anger and vision problems. Typically, medical cannabis use followed recreational use and the majority of those interviewed were long-term, and sometimes heavy, recreational users. Most continued to use cannabis recreationally as well as medically. However, the sample also included some people whose use of cannabis was pri\u00ad marily initiated by the desire to treat medical conditions for which other treatments were unsatisfactory. Almost all interviewees smoked cannabis and only two regularly used it in other forms (in tea or baked in a muf\u00ad fin). The majority used cannabis two to three times every day. Cannabis was usually obtained from friends or regular dealers but one person obtained it from his doctor. Respon\u00ad dents were acutely aware that possession of cannabis was illegal and they took precautions to avoid arrest. About a third, mostly those who used cannabis recreationally, had been stopped by police and searched for drugs. Three of those who had only used cannabis for medical reasons had been involved with the police but only two had been charged and one had won a court case. Few admitted negative expe\u00ad riences associated with cannabis use or expressed concerns about being dependent on it. However, some problems that seemed evident to the researchers were not always clearly acknowledged as related to cannabis (accidents, dysfunc\u00ad tional lifestyle, psychological probl ems). Most respondents had told their doctors about using cannabis for medical rea\u00ad sons and their doctors were supportive or noncommittal. Doctors were seen as supportive of cannabis use by most respondents with HIV/AIDS. The present study did not, of course, seek to determine if the reported medical benefits of cannabis were real or imagined or if they should be attributed to placebo effects, other treatments or natural recovery. It is likely that the medical benefits of cannabis were sometimes overstated, especially by long-term recreational users with positive views of cannabis. Although respondents thought that their physicians supported their use of cannabis, it is not known if this was really the case. Some respondents also seemed to ignore negative consequences of cannabis use such as dependence and withdrawal. Many reported benefits of cannabis were consistent with those reported elsewhere. Cannabis was typically used for its sedative, analgesic, antispasmodic, appetite stimu\u00ad lating, anticonvulsant and euphoric properties. Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 442 Who is Using Cannabis as a Medicine properties were well known in the past century when can\u00ad nabis was used to treat conditions that required medications with these properties. Although scientific evidence in favor of medical cannabis is limited (Gurley, Aranow & Katz 1998), self-treatment with cannabis could become popular as more users publicize their own experiences. This is especially so if the everyday aches and pains and psy\u00ad chological problems are promoted as medical reasons for using cannabis. The boundaries of medical cannabis use will be of con\u00ad cern if more medical cannabis cases come to court. In the Canadian cases where medical necessity was successfully used as a defense against a charge for the possession of cannabis, the defendants had chronic and serious medical conditions (epilepsy and AIDS) and were strongly sup\u00ad ported by their physicians. Others who are able to convince the courts that their use of cannabis brings relief to other\u00ad wise untreatable conditions may also do well in court. However, those who use cannabis for less serious con\u00ad ditions that can be successfully treated by other means may not fare so well, especially without a supportive physician. The boundaries of medical use are also of concern if new policies on medical cannabis use are developed. If such use encompasses use for self-diagnosed conditions then policies might be needed to ensure that all those who want to use cannabis for these conditions have access to quality-controlled cannabis products. If on the other hand, medical use is to be defined as use with the approval of a physician, more restrictive access will be needed. At present there are no completely satisfactory ways to deal with the issues of medical cannabis use. Apart from the difficulty of defining \"medical ,\" there are presently many uncertainties about the objective benefits of cannabis as a medicine as well as legitimate concerns about side effects and the risks associated with cannabis smoking. Many issues could eventually be resolved through scien\u00ad tific research, including research on alternative methods of delivery such as nasal sprays. In the meantime, there are humanitarian reasons for devising ways to ensure that the seriously ill who find cannabis helpful can have access to a quality-controlled product. Studies of this sort always have limitations. The sample was small and drawn from one area of one city. Respon\u00ad dents were self-selected. The sampling strategy may have excluded those who were very sick and those who feared being identified as cannabis users. It may also have been biased towards HIV/AIDS cases as notices were put in AIDS clinics. A wider distribution of notices to psychiat\u00ad ric, neurological, pain and cancer treatment centres, clinics, or self-help groups may have attracted a wider range of users or a greater representation of some types. However, the study had limited resources and initially there was a concern that large numbers would come forward for inter\u00ad views, but this was not the case. It took four months before Volume 32 (4), October -December 2000 Ogborne et al. 50 interviews were completed and only about 120 calls about the study were received. It is clearly important to learn more about the extent of medical cannabis use in the general population and in populations at high risk. The present study suggests that priority should be given to studies of cannabis use among people with HIV/AIDS. Issues of concern should be the nature and extent of cannabis use as well as biomedical studies that assess the effects of cannabis on biological sys\u00ad tems. Studies of interactions between cannabis and the drugs used in HIV/AIDS treatment should also be given priority. NOTES I. The notice soliciting the interview referred to mari\u00ad juana and not cannabis on the assumption that most medical Who is Using Cannabis as a Medicine users would refer to cannabis this way. The name cannabis will be used throughout this paper except when quoting respondents who referred to cannabis as marijuana. 2. All quotes use respondents own words.

The purpose of this study was to describe the health concer ns and problems that prompt some adolescents to use marijuana for therapeutic reasons, and thei r beliefs about the risk s and benefits of the therapeutic use of marijuana. Methods: As part of a larger ethnographic study of 63 adolescents who were regular marijuana users, we analyzed interviews conducted with 20 youth who self-i dentified as using marijuana to relieve or manage health problems. Results: Thematic analysis revealed that these teens differentiated themselves from recreational users and positioned their use of marijuana for reli ef by emphasizing their inability to find other ways to deal with their health pr oblems, the sophisticated ways in which they titrated their intake, and the benefits that they experienced. These teen s used marijuana to gain relief from difficult feelings (including depression, a nxiety and stress), sleep difficulti es, problems with concentration and physical pain. Most were not overly concerned about the risks associated with using marijuana, maintaining that their use of marijuana was not 'i n excess' and that their use fit into the realm of 'normal.' Conclusion: Marijuana is perceived by some teens to be the only available alternative for teens experiencing difficult health pr oblems when medical treatments have failed or when they lack access to appropriate health care. Background There is lively public debate surrounding the use of med- ical marijuana. While some remain sceptical about thetherapeutic value of marijuana, there is a growing body ofresearch that emphasizes its salutary effects. The literaturepoints to the use of marijuana among adults to alleviate avariety of symptoms including pain, nausea, muscle spasm, insomnia, anorexia and anxiety as well as the treat- ment of a variety of medical conditions that are bothphysical and psychological [1-5]. However, less is knownabout adolescents' use of marijuana for therapeutic pur-poses.Published: 23 April 2009 Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 doi:10.1186/1747-597X-4-7Received: 3 December 2008 Accepted: 23 April 2009 This article is available from: \u00a9 2009 Bottorff et al; licen see BioMed Central Ltd.

In contrast to the adult literature on marijuana use where therapeutic use is linked to treatment of specific symptoms and illnesses, inthe adolescent literature there is less clarity about how todefine non-recreational uses of marijuana. A motivationally-driven approach is one way that researchers have attempted to understand marijuana use among adolescents [7]. It is proposed that different rea-sons for using marijuana may shape patterns and contextsof use, which in turn may be associated with differentproblems related to use. Social motives for marijuana use,for example, have been associated with patterns of recrea-tional use (e.g., sensation seeking). Coping motives have been used to classify adolescents using marijuana for non- recreation purposes. Differences have been observedamong youth using marijuana for social and coping rea-sons that support the motives framework. In contrast toyouth aged 16-24 years using marijuana for social rea-sons, users of the same age reporting coping motives have been observed to have lower mental health, higher psy- chopathology, more psychosocial distress and morestressful life events than non-cannabis-using youth [8]. Although there is a large body of literature related to rec- reational use of marijuana among adolescents [9,10] less is known about other motivations for the use of mari- juana in this population. Several hypotheses haveemerged related to non-recreational uses of marijuanaamong adolescents. The \"self-medication hypothesis\"[11-14] is most closely associated with the therapeutic useof marijuana. Instrumental use is another term applied to taking drugs for specific pharmacological effects of the substance rather than for pleasure or recreational pur-poses. For example, Glassner [15] examined the notion ofinstrumental drug use in a qualitative study of young drugusers, and found that marijuana was used for its calmingeffects, to relieve tension, and to gain self-confidence. Fur-ther, support for a typology of drug related beliefs that included relief-oriented beliefs [16] was demonstrated in a study of cannabis use in a sample of 285 French highschool students [17]. In this study, four 'positive' relief-oriented beliefs were identified related to how the sub-stance creates relaxation and calms anxiety, reduces suffer-ing, relieves boredom, and makes one feel better. The presence of relief-oriented beliefs was the only predictor of cannabis dependence. Associations between marijuana and psychological prob- lems have also lead researchers to consider other possibleexplanations, including whether marijuana use may rein- force psychiatric symptoms or increase the risk of devel- oping a psychiatric illness later in life [18-21]. A fullunderstanding of marijuana use and its potential adverseeffects, however, will require further research. The trend toward the use of marijuana for therapeutic pur- poses among adults raises questions regarding how this may influence young people's use of marijuana for similar rea-sons. Recent studies suggest that adolescents are aware thatmarijuana is sometimes used to gain relief from physical andpsychological pain [22-24]. Furthermore, there is evidencesuggesting that adolescents may be using marijuana for rea- sons that are analogous to adults who use marijuana for ther- apeutic reasons. For example, young marijuana users withcoping motives report more stressful life events (e.g., deathof a family member or friend), personal injury and illnessthan socially motivated marijuana users and non-users [8].There is also indirect evidence that adolescents with mentalhealth conditions might be seeking relief through marijuana use. In a sample of 992 adolescents in drug treatment pro- grams in four U.S. cities, more than half had at least one co-morbid mental disorder. In total, 72.5% of these youth weredependent on marijuana [25]. Among youth entering outpa-tient treatment programs for cannabis use disorders, 76%were reported to have concurrent mental health conditions [26]. Finally, in a sample of homeless young people in the UK who used a variety of drugs including marijuana, partic-ipants were found to be self-medicating to deal with thestress and problems they encountered including depression,loneliness, and physical problems such as aches and pains[13]. As part of a larger study to understand the culture of fre- quent marijuana use among young people, we were struckby the extent to which some participants spontaneouslydescribed using marijuana to gain relief from symptoms.In order to develop these emergent findings, we con- ducted a focused ethnography in which we examined the ways in which youth use marijuana to seek relief. Methods This study was designed to understand and describe ado-lescents' experiences in using marijuana for therapeuticreasons, and explore how their constructions of these experiences are influenced by social norms. Compared to other types of ethnographic studies, focused ethnogra-phies occur on a smaller scale and seek to examine a spe-cific problem or phenomenon [27]. Typically, focusedethnographies are time-limited, involve a limited numberof participants drawn from a specific population who have experience and understanding directly related to the area of inquiry, and are conducted through selected epi-sodes of participant observation and/or interview [28]. Inthis focused ethnography, both in-depth interviews andparticipant observation were employed.Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 3 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)We drew data from a larger ethnographic study of fre- quent marijuana use among adolescents conducted in two rural and one urban location in British Columbia (BC),Canada. In the study communities, as is the case in muchof BC, marijuana is readily accessible to youth despite thefact that it is illegal to grow, sell or possess. The use of mar-ijuana for medical reasons is legally supported in Canada in limited circumstances; individuals meeting the criteria are provided with cannabis or given a license to grow alimited quantity for personal use. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Uni- versity Behavioral Research Ethics Board. Given the sensi- tivity of the topic and because we successfully argued that teens were able to provide consent for research participa-tion, we did not require parental consent. As a courtesy,we provided the youth with a parent/guardian informa-tion letter which outlined the study's focus as pertainingto attitudes about marijuana use in general. Participantswere told that they could take the letter home if they so chose. Prior to the interviews, written consent was obtained from the participants. Confidentiality wasensured at the outset and participants were informed thatall identifying information would be removed from thedata. Sample In the larger study, participants were recruited by means ofinformation fliers posted at high schools which invitedyouth to share their \"views on marijuana use and teens.\"Youth who expressed interest in participating werescreened for eligibility by the research team. Eligibility cri- teria included being 13-18 years of age and reporting hav- ing smoked marijuana at least once in the previous week.In total, 63 young people participated in the study.Although many youth described \"feeling better\" marijuana on a regular basis specifi- cally to manage, reduce or eliminate unpleasant and uncomfortable feelings or other health problems. Theyconstructed marijuana as a treatment for health problems,often suggesting it had significantly greater benefit thanother medical treatments they had been offered. None ofthese students were legally provided with cannabis formedical treatment or given a licence to grow marijuana for medicinal use. Characteristics of this sub-set of partici- pants are presented in Table 1. The majority of youthusing marijuana for relief were male, and the average ageof initiation of marijuana was 13 years of age. Youth inthis subset were of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Most [n =12] indicated that they were \"Canadian\" or \"Caucasian; \" More specifically, 2 participants identified as First Nations, 6 individuals were part First Nations, 3 of UKdescent and 3 were of European background includingItalian, Croatian, and Ukrainian. Compared to those whoused marijuana for the purpose of relief, those recruited to this study who smoked marijuana for recreational pur-poses (n = 43) smoked marijuana less frequently (averageof 11 days in the last 30 days) and used marijuana moreoften with others. Data Collection The primary source of data was in-depth, semi-structuredinterviews with youth to glean accounts of their experi-ences with marijuana. We used a short questionnaire priorto beginning the qualitative interview to collect demo- graphic data and to assess history of marijuana use and current use. The questionnaire included items related tomarijuana use including age of initiation, use in the lastmonth, frequency and quit attempts. We also collecteddata on the time of day that individuals usually used mar-ijuana. The interviews were conducted using an interview guide. Broad discussion categories included: history and patternof use, the reasons for their use, what they knew aboutmarijuana, the sources of that information as well as con-textual factors related to their use. Open-ended questionswere posed in relation to each of these topics, as required during the interviews. Many of these youth were at ease when talking about their use of marijuana and needed lit-tle prompting. When youth described the use of mari-juana to help them feel better, participants were asked toelaborate further on their experiences. The tape-recorded interviews took place in privacy within the school setting and lasted from 1 to 2 hours. Partici-pants were offered a $20 honorarium. Field notes wereused to record impressions of responses to the interviewTable 1: Description of partic ipants who smoke marijuana for relief (n = 20) Gender Female 7 (35%)Male 13 (65%) Age (years) X = 16 yrs (range 14-18 yrs) Age of initiation (years) X = 13 yrs (range = 10-16 yrs) Frequency of use (days) X = 2 days/mo (range = 2-31 days/mo) Number of times/day 1 - > 5 times/day Time of day of first use Morning 4 (20%)Afternoon 11 (55%)Evening 5 (55%) Marijuana use when alone yes = 16 (80%) Reasons for use* Depression 6Stress/anxiety 12Sleep problems 9Focus/concentration 3 Physical pain 5 * some participants used mari juana for more than one reasonSubstance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 4 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)and the interviewer's assessment of the quality of the interview. In addition, field notes were maintained to record pertinent observations within the school and in thelarger community (e.g., noting school policies regardingmarijuana use at school and the presence of graffiti relatedto marijuana in close proximity of the school; visitingfavourite outdoor settings where some indicated that they preferred to smoke marijuana along with hemp shops where they purchased pipes and bongs and other para-phernalia). Data Analysis All data including transcribed interviews and field notes were reviewed several times by the research team paying close attention to young people's descriptions of experi-ences with the use of marijuana to address uncomfortablefeelings or health problems, and the circumstances thatsurrounded this use. Close readings of the interviews bythe investigative team involved highlighting potentiallyimportant comments, raising questions about the data, and identifying prominent dimensions of participants' experiences. During team meetings, interview data werediscussed and emergent categories were identified to cap-ture experiences related to marijuana use. These categorieswere organized into a coding framework and used to codethe data. All coding was completed by one of the authors who completed a majority of the interviews (BMM). To code the data, we used [29] the NVivo software programdesigned for qualitative analysis of textual data. The pro-gram was also used to retrieve data coded under each cat-egory for a more nuanced analysis by the investigativeteam. Through reflective questioning of these data and detailed comparisons, themes were identified and dis- cussed in team meetings. Results The Context of Using Marijuana for Relief The teens situated their use of marijuana for relief of health problems in the context of difficult life events and illness experiences marked by a lack of supportive familynetworks, unexpected and sometimes traumatic losses ofclose friends or family members, and difficulties atschool. Many indicated that they had few people to turnto help them; for some their parents were having difficultycoping with their own situations of unemployment, sub- stance use, and marriage breakdowns and offered little support. Those living in households with a parent andstep-parent had difficulty coping with unresolved feelingstowards their estranged biological parent. Finally, severalteens who made frequent moves with their families expe-rienced social isolation at school and were subject to being bullied and teased. Experiences with the medical system to address their health problems consistently fell short of the teens' expec-tations; their problems were either not taken seriously or the solutions offered were not helpful. For example, youth who reported they had been prescribed drugs such as Rita-lin, Prozac or sleeping pills, stopped using them becausethey did not like how these drugs made them feel or foundthem ineffective. Despite visits to doctors, prescribedtreatments and, for a few, hospitalizations, many of these teens perceived that they did not receive the help they needed from doctors. A final contextual feature to these teens' lives were their observations of others' use of marijuana to deal with dif-ficult circumstances or symptoms, including, in a few cases, parents and other significant adults in their life. For example, one young man reported that his mother wasusing marijuana while receiving cancer treatment. As heobserved, \"It helped her sleep and calmed her down.\"Others described how they were given advice from otherteens about how marijuana could \"help.\" Together thesecircumstances created a context where teens routinely turned to marijuana to manage physical and psychologi- cal problems in their lives. Marijuana was readily availa-ble, used by others in their network, and was perceived toprovide an effective solution not offered to them from themedical system. Regular Relief:Patterns of Us ing Marijuana for Persistent Problems Most of the participants who consistently used marijuana for relief, smoked it when alone, often several times a day.For some, their day began and ended with using mari-juana; they smoked before leaving home for school and prior to going to bed. Some indicated that they needed to smoke marijuana during the school day to manage symp-toms, and when this occurred it was often in the companyof friends. A few participants smoked marijuana for reliefin adult company that included relatives and \"older\"friends who supported their need to use marijuana to manage symptoms. There were two patterns of marijuana use for relief: inter- mittent and chronic. With intermittent use, youth rou-tinely relied on marijuana to deal with short-termproblems such as stressful situations or limited periods ofphysical pain. One 14 year old male described non-daily use occurring whenever he had a \"really bad day.\" In the case of chronic use, daily marijuana was used for the reliefof identified conditions such as depression, ADHD and toroutinely settle at night or manage sleeplessness. Youngpeople's descriptions of marijuana use for relief wereimbued with language common to using pharmaceuti- cals. A number of these youth indicated how they care- fully titrated their intake; others described their use as\"moderate,\" involving a \"few puffs,\" or just a \"certainamount.\" Through experience, they had learned to honeSubstance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 5 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)ways of using the right amount of marijuana to achieve a state of relief. As one male elaborated, he regulated his intake by mixing his marijuana with tobacco so as to get\"just enough\" marijuana to relieve regular states of agita-tion and high levels of stress. Along with skills at monitor-ing their intake of marijuana, these youth confidentlyshared in-depth knowledge of the strength and associated effects of different strains of marijuana. Explaining the Need to Use Marijuana for Relief The young people in the sub-sample were particularly articulate in describing their \"need\" to use marijuana.They were adamant and confident that marijuana pro- vided relief from their health problems. The decision to smoke marijuana was stated in a straight forward fashion(e.g., \"I started it to make myself feel better\") and justifiedbecause they had a \"reason for it.\" Participants alsoframed their marijuana use in a positive manner; in sodoing, gave credence to the claim that this was the rightcourse of action. As one girl elaborated on her daily use, \"Pot helps me be me.\" Several described unpleasant phys- ical sensations such as feeling \"jittery\" associated with theabsence of marijuana. For these youth, regular marijuanause allowed them relief from these unpleasant symptomsso that they were able to feel \"normal.\" One 18-year oldmale who used marijuana everyday indicated, \"If any- thing, it makes you more normal.\" Of note, he had first started to use marijuana at the age of 13, and smoked itregularly for 5 years typically 4 times a day. For these youth, the purpose of smoking marijuana was not specifically about getting high or stoned, nor was mar- ijuana used for \"pleasure.\" In fact, participants tended to differentiate their own use from peers who were recrea-tional users who smoked marijuana when they were \"par-tying\" or \"socializing.\" As one 16-year old male describedhis use, \"I don't get a strong sense of euphoria, I just calmdown a bit, that's just how it is for me.\" However, there were a few instances when female participants did smoke \"to get high\" for the purpose of \"escaping reality,\" a strat-egy used to remove themselves temporarily from the chal-lenging circumstances that accompanied their daily lives.The participants also distinguished themselves from the\"stoner\" stereotype, whose preferred activities were watch-ing movies or listening to heavy metal music while smok- ing marijuana. Some explanations of using of marijuana to feel better were further bolstered with a focus on use for described\"health\" reasons. As one 16-year old female indicated, herdaily use of marijuana was \"more of a health thing, than to get high.\" She reflected on her history of \"mild depres- sion\" and her difficulties with antidepressants that hadresulted in insomnia and a loss of appetite. She suggestedthat these health issues would re-surface in the absence ofmarijuana, thereby providing solid rationale for her con- tinued use of marijuana. One male situated his marijuana use within a perspective that medications are used to helpdeal with problems. I bet you if I had never been put on Ritalin at a younger age, I might not have had the same opinion of drugs growing up, you know, because I was taught growing up that you take drugs to help you out with your prob-lems, you know. [18 years, non-daily use] Often, marijuana was compared to other substances in a way that suggested marijuana was the best option, further supporting ongoing use of marijuana for relief purposes. Some constructed marijuana as a \"natural\" substance thatwas preferable and considered \"safer\" than many pharma-ceutical alternatives. One 14-year old female discoveredthat marijuana was a better option than dealing with theside effects of pharmaceuticals stating, \"Well, my body, Ihave to be careful what pills I take. I have bad reactions to some medications. My body rejects it and I get really sick.\" Interestingly, one 18-year old who smoked twice a day on21 days during the last month, went as far to describehimself as a \"healthy marijuana user\" adding, \"It's notgood for you, but then again, neither is MacDonald's anda lot of other things.\" The health claims in these descrip- tions served to explain the ongoing use of marijuana for relief. Painful Lives: Types of Symp toms and Distress Requiring Relief In the interviews the teens directly linked their use of mar- ijuana with the management of difficult feelings (includ- ing depression, anxiety and stress), sleep problems,problems with concentration and physical pain. Each ofthese will be described in the following sections. Difficult Feelings Although some teens described using marijuana to dealwith instances of being angry, experiencing a significantdisappointment (e.g., with exam results), being afraid, orto forget the past, the most frequent uses were associatedwith dealing with depression, and managing stress andanxiety. Depression Six participants indicated they were using marijuana spe-cifically to deal with depression and several othersreported knowing teens that were doing the same. Dealingwith difficult personal circumstances was a commontheme for this group of teens and was linked to the loss of significant people in their lives, a family history of depres- sion, financial worries at home, \"fights\" with parents,abuse, and too much \"shit\" in their lives. Several reportedreceiving treatment for depression in the form of antide-Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 6 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)pressants and counseling, sometimes over extended peri- ods, yet with little relief. For others, these options were not available in part because \"nobody wanted to listen\" tothem. As a last resort, these teens had opted to try smokingmarijuana. In a relatively short time, marijuana helpedthem to feel better about themselves, happier and morelike the person they \"wanted to be\" as well as alleviate other problems associated with depression (poor appe- tite, difficulty concentrating, poor sleep). Not all participants agreed about the use of marijuana for depression. One 16-year old male used marijuana to dealwith his unhappiness surrounding the conflict between his mother and father, and worried that he might be using pot too frequently. He reasoned that being happy all ofthe time was not natural, and that there was nothingwrong with being sad and confused sometimes. As aresult, he tried to limit using marijuana to weekends withfriends. Others believed that marijuana should only beused for certain types of depression because of the possi- bility of becoming more depressed by smoking pot: I think it depends on the level of depression that you have. If it's like depressed because you are sick, thenpot is helping you. It's making you happier. But ifyou're depressed about killing yourself, I don't think that it's a good idea to smoke pot just because it could bring you down more. It's hard to say, though, it's dif-ferent for every person, right? That just how it makesme feel. [Female, 17 years, daily use] Stress and anxiety The use of marijuana to manage stress and anxiety wasdescribed by 12 teens in our sample. Dealing with bully-ing at school, heavy demands of school work, taxing shiftsat work, and just \"giving as much as you can\" along sidedifficult relationships with parents or guardians, andreceiving threats from neighbors all took its toll on these youth. For some, these experiences contributed to high levels of stress and anxiety, and for others uncomfortablelevels of anger - both were difficult to manage. Althoughsome had friends they could turn to, marijuana providedan additional source of stress relief that was ready at hand. Lots of people know me, know I do pot and they think that I'm a pot head but really the thing they don't real- ize is that I have a reason for it. It's for my stress andan antidepressant. I get really upset. It [pot] helps mefeel better about myself, because you know peopledon't do that [help me], like my friend [name] can, butnobody else can. [Female, 14 years, non-daily use] There was general agreement among the teens that mari- juana calmed them down, and helped them feel \"not sonervous\" and \"not so uptight about everything.\" One teenrecognized, however, that despite the fact that marijuana could be a very effective stress reliever, it might not work for everyone: Well as far as pot goes, the good thing is that it's defi- nitely a stress reliever, hands down. I know lots of peo-ple who would be just a complete wreck if they weren't smoking pot but then there's also people who are a complete wreck because they do smoke pot, so it'skind of a hard thing. [Male, 16 years, non-daily use] Sleep problems Nine teens in our sample described using marijuana to help them sleep. The \"trouble\" they had with sleeping was a constant problem that many had experienced for years.One 16-year old, who also experienced mild depression,indicated that she \"stopped sleeping for two years.\" Notonly did the problem affect their school performance, butit was deeply disturbing to them. As another femaledescribed, I have a really hard time sleeping. I can lay there for about four to five hours, just laying there. And I justfinally had it, and I just feel like screaming I don't wantto wake anyone up. So I go downstairs and ask mygran or my brother [for some marijuana] or I have a roach or two sitting around. [16 years, non-daily use] Although one teen indicated that she had spoken to her mother about her problems sleeping, others indicatedthat the adults in their lives did not offer any support. I have trouble going to sleep and waking up...My mum wanted to get the doctor to put me on sleeping pillsbut he said at such a young age it would cause like anaddiction to them...I've had these problems since ele-mentary school...I just, I can't go to sleep at night andthen I like to sleep during the day. [Female, 14 years, non-daily use] Many teens turned to pot and found almost immediate benefits in helping them sleep. Likened to a \"magic sleep-ing pill\" by one young male, the teens found it calmedtheir \"busy minds,\" helped them relax and fall asleepquickly. Focus/concentration Three teens reported using marijuana to improve theirconcentration. They explained that they had difficultyfocusing at school and that this affected their school per-formance. As one male explained: Personally, I'm a very fast paced guy and my mind is always rushing, hard to gather my thoughts. I think alot faster than I can speak. I get distracted very easily.Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 7 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)In social studies last year, I would talk and wouldn't do any work. But if I had just a little bit of pot, I could really focus my work. I could sit there and I'd work allday and finish everything and have no homework andbe done by the end of class. [16 years, non-daily use] These young people believed they could \"think better\" when they used marijuana because it allowed them to focus their thinking, and, slow it down in a way that waspreferable. All suggested that these cognitive changes werelinked to improved school performance. One teen, whoself-identified as a having \"attention deficit, hyperactivedisorder\" shared the difficulties he experienced on Ritalin. He began smoking pot when he was 12 years of age and still on Ritalin. Usually my mind is in over gear, right? I'm usually going about a mile a minute and my hands are movingway too fast, and I'm really fidgety. But if I have a puffof marijuana in a moderate use, by moderate I mean one to three to four puffs, depending on the qual- ity....being toned down a bit I find really helps me....If Itry to do homework at home without smoking pot, Ijust can't focus. I'll be looking at my schoolwork and forme with my ADHD this is how it's always been for me.Like school was just a constant story of this scenario before I smoked marijuana. [17 years, non-daily use] Physical Pain Five teens indicated they used marijuana to obtain pain relief, and several others shared similar stories about otheryouth. One male used marijuana to deal with pain associ- ated with rehabilitation after a muscle injury, another used marijuana following an accident where he sustained3 rd degree burns and yet another because of plates in his back due to a car injury. Others suggested that marijuanareduced muscle pain after a hard day of skiing and helpedwith headaches, and that girls used marijuana for men- strual cramps. One 17-year old male used it daily and explained that marijuana \"numbs your systems or senses[and] relaxes your muscles.\" Considering the Risks of Using Marijuana for Relief In spite of experiencing personal benefits from using mar-ijuana for relief, some participants wrestled with their use of marijuana. One girl noted her own problematic use of marijuana that had quickly evolved into relying on it todeal with the regular stress in her life. As she pondered,she commented knowingly that it would be preferable touse it only when her stress level was \"really\" high. I mean I started it, and I'm doing it for the wrong rea- sons...I think if I cut back and only did it when I wasreally stressed out or something, then, you know, really cut back, I think it would be okay. [14 years,non-daily use]Although knowing that it was \"harmful\" to her body, she added that she found it difficult to quit using marijuana. Most youth were aware of the health consequences associ-ated with marijuana use in general and their own use inparticular. They noticed physical symptoms such asdecreased stamina and shortness of breath with physicalactivities, while others worried about weakened immune systems and how it affected their energy level. Some rec- ognized that they were addicted to marijuana. One malewho had been using marijuana for six years framed it assomething that he would address at a later date. \"I'm try-ing to get through school and then worry about mydependency issue with marijuana.\" Others noted that their marijuana use was linked to diffi- culties that they were having at school. One male con-cluded, \"I think it brings marks down in one way andsometimes you don't understand things maybe as easily.\"Others recognized how their use had affected their mem-ory. For a number of the participants, their knowledge of the risks of smoking marijuana was limited and, at times, incorrect. For example, as one 14-year old male who hadstarted smoking marijuana in the past year to relieve mus-cle pain noted, \"It's bad for your lungs, just it's 400 timeslower than tobacco.\" In what appeared to be an effort to minimize their use in the face of health risks, the teens emphasized that theywere not using marijuana \"in excess.\" One 18-year oldsummed up six years of using marijuana by saying, \"Idon't feel that I have a problem,\" adding that \"it doesn'treally have that many side effects.\" Some suggested that the benefits of smoking marijuana outweighed the risks. As noted, for those with difficulties sleeping at night, notbeing able to function the following day when sleepdeprived was agonizing; marijuana use at night was pref-erable and provided a solution to that quandary. How-ever, one male pondered both sides of his use of marijuana in dealing with his depression and was less optimistic: Well, in some ways, it's helped me and some ways it hasn't. It's good when it's there, but when it's not, itkind of makes me sad. So it's hard like to try to keepup with staying happy all the time.[18 years, daily use] Several participants made reference to the contradictions that they saw in their world regarding other licit sub-stances and used that argument to make sense of andpraise the benefits of marijuana over the risks. And the thing is that if it's already used, they're already growing it for people that need it for medical help,then like why not.... Like no one has ever overdosedon marijuana, but people die everyday from alcohol,everyday from cigarettes and everyday from vastSubstance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 8 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)amounts of things that the government has legalized, but they just won't legalize marijuana for some reason. It's never killed anyone, never really hurt anyone, itsaves people's lives and they could make a goodamount of money from it and drop crime rates, whydon't they do it? [Male, 14 years, non-daily use] Discussion The findings of this study provide one of the first in-depthdescriptions of youths' use of marijuana for non-recrea-tional purposes, adding to the growing body of researchon the use of drugs to self-medicate among young people.Teens involved in regular and long-term use of marijuana for relief constructed their use of marijuana as essential to feeling better or \"normal\" in situations where they per-ceived there were few other options available to them.Unlike the spontaneity typically involved in recreationaluse, these youth were thoughtful and prescriptive withtheir marijuana use - carefully monitoring and titratingtheir use to optimize its therapeutic effect. The findings also point to important contextual factors that further support youth's use of marijuana for relief that extendbeyond the availability of marijuana and dominant dis-courses that construct marijuana as a natural product withmedicinal properties. Of key importance in the findings are the unmet health needs of these youth. Health issues such as depression,insomnia, and anxiety were significant problems thatinterfered with these youths' ability to function at school,maintain relationships with family and friends, and feelthat they could live a normal life. The level of distress associated with these health concerns, along with the lack of effective interventions by heath care providers and fam-ily members appeared to leave them with few alternatives.Researchers have reported that when adolescents in ruralcommunities experience barriers to seeking health care,they think they can take care of the problems themselves [30]. Similarly, our study participants believed that their best option was to assume responsibility for treating theirproblems by using marijuana. Unpleasant side effectswith prescribed medications and long, ineffective thera-pies resulted in little hope that the medical system couldbe counted on as beneficial. In contrast, marijuana pro-vided these youth with immediate relief for a variety of health concerns. Nevertheless, the regular use of mari- juana put youth at risk. Cannabis use has been identifiedas a risk factor for mental illness such as psychosis, schiz-ophrenia [21,31,32] and psychiatric symptoms such aspanic attacks [33]. Teens who smoked marijuana at leastonce per month in the past year were found to be three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts than non- users [34], and there is evidence that exposure to cannabismay worsen depression in youth [35]. Marijuana useamong youth has also been associated with other sub-stance use and school failure [36]. What is interesting is that the findings of this study suggest that youth have little awareness of some of these risks; rather, some are usingmarijuana to counteract these very problems (e.g., depres-sion, school failure). Teens' perceptions that their healthconcerns were not addressed suggest that more attentionis needed to assess these issues and ensure that other options are available to them. Parents and health care pro- viders need to make a concerted effort to not only under-stand the pressures and influences on youth [37], but alsogain a better understanding of the effect of youths' healthproblems on their ability to engage in healthy lifestylechoices. Underlying problems related to youth health concerns also need to be addressed. In many situations, the partici-pants' symptoms appeared to be directly related to theirlife circumstances. Along with the challenges inherent inbeing an adolescent in today's complex world, some teenswere also trying to deal with significant losses (death of a close friend or family member), extremely difficult family relationships, disappointments with friends, school andsports, and a fragile family and peer support network. Therisk of substance use increases substantially when youthare attempting to deal with these kinds of situations inisolation. Although marijuana provided the youth with temporary relief, the underlying situation often went unattended - leading the teens into a regular pattern ofuse. Appropriate guidance and targeted support fromcounselors and health care providers must be sensitive tomeeting the needs of youth as they work through such sit-uations and life altering events. In addition, adults work- ing with youth must find better ways to talk with young people about how they are coping with their health issues,including their marijuana use. Based on the experiences ofyouth in this study, there is a wide range of support thatmay benefit youth including counseling, stress manage-ment, social skills training, anger management, study skills, pain management, and sleep hygiene. The youth in this study had minimal access to these types of resources. The influence of the policy environment in Canada related to medical marijuana cannot be dismissed. The youth in thisstudy were familiar with medical marijuana and its sanc-tioned use among those with serious illnesses; some knew individuals in their social network who were medical mari- juana users. In addition, we acknowledge that the availabilityof marijuana in the study settings provided teens with oppor-tunities to try marijuana to relieve symptoms. In localeswhere it is more difficult to access marijuana and penaltiesfor possession of marijuana are harsh, teens with similar symptoms may use other approaches. Despite presenting themselves as being sophisticated users of marijuana, with a rich knowledge of marijuanaSubstance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 9 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)acquired through direct experience, conversations and observations of others, the youth in our study did not appear to be well informed about the therapeutic use ofmarijuana. Targeted education for youth regarding therisks of marijuana and its appropriate use as a therapeuticagent is warranted, including the risks of legal sanctions.However, as Tupper [38] has suggested regarding drug education, fear-based approaches are unlikely to be effec- tive when the reality of youths' observations and experi-ences suggest that few serious consequences stand indirect contrast to the \"facts\" teachers often provide. Alter-native approaches are required that acknowledge the com-plexity of the issues that inform understandings of marijuana. Tupper suggests that drug education be framed using the metaphor of \"drugs as tools\" to allow \"morenuanced understandings of the benefits and harms ofdrugs, depending on who is using them, in what circum-stances, and for what purpose\" (p. 235). This approachmay be useful in education focused on marijuana. This study was conducted in three locations in the prov- ince of British Columbia (BC) Canada and as such maynot be generalized to other contexts. The province of BC isknown for its illicit marijuana production [39]. And, ingeneral the BC public is tolerant of marijuana use andsupport decriminalizing recreational use. In other con- texts, teens might turn to other substances such as alcohol. The findings of this study provide a snapshot of theseteens' use of marijuana. Further research is required toexamine how this therapeutic use evolves over time. Conclusion In summary, this study highlights youths' efforts toaddress their health problems and their experiences inusing marijuana for relief. Marijuana may be perceived bysome teens to be the only available alternative for thoseexperiencing difficult physical or emotional problemswhen medical treatments have failed or when they lack access to appropriate health care. As has been noted in other studies of substance use [40], understanding whyadolescents use particular substances is key in developingappropriate educational and intervention programs.

The main psychoactive ingredient of hemp, 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and its synthetic cannabinoid analogs have been reported to either attenuate or exacerbate anxiety and fear-related behaviors in humans and experimental animals. The heterogeneity of cannabis- induced psychological outcomes reflects a complex network of molecular interactions between the key neurobiological substrates of anxiety and fear and the endogenous cannabinoid system, mainly consisting of the arachidonic acid derivatives anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and two receptors, respectively termed CB 1 and CB 2. The high degree of interindividual variability in the responses to cannabis is contributed by a wide spectrum of factors, including genetic and environmental determinants, as well as differences in the relative concentrations of THC and other alkaloids (such as cannabidiol) within the plant itself. The present article reviews the currently available knowledge on the herbal, synthetic and endogenous cannabinoids with respect to the modulation of anxiety responses, and highlights the challenges that should be overcome to harness the therapeutic potential of some of these compounds, all the while limiting the side effects associated with cannabis consumption. Keywords cannabis; anxiety; CB receptors; endocannabinoids; 9-tetrahydrocannabinol; cannabidiol INTRODUCTION Anxiety is generally defined as an emotional state characterized by maladaptive and excessive emotional responsiveness to potentially dangerous circumstances. The pathological expression of anxiety leads to enduring emotional perturbations with a consistent apprehension towards the possibility of future, vaguely defined negative events [1]. According to the current classification of anxiety disorders in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) [2], the main diagnostic entities in this category are: - generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), featuring general irritability, anxiety attacks, chronic apprehension/anxious expectation and secondary phobic avoidance.

Published in final edited form as: Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov Manuscript Manuscript- panic disorder , characterized by brief (2-10 min) spells of overwhelming anxiety or fear, accompanied by somatic and cognitive symptoms; - social anxiety disorder (or social phobia), defined as extreme agitation in social contexts and avoidance of social situations; - obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by recurrent and intrusive anxiogenic thoughts (obsessions), and stereotyped behaviors (compulsions) aimed at the reduction of the distress caused by the obsessions. - post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in which a prior intense trauma results in a long-lasting anxious response, with re-experiencing/flashback phenomena, avoidance and emotional numbing. In keeping with their different clinical features and phenomenological presentations, these disorders are underpinned by divergent neurobiological alterations and respond to partially different pharmacotherapeutic strategies (outlined in Table 1). A fundamental contribution in our understanding of the neural bases of anxiety disorders and in the development of novel therapies has been afforded by animal models and testing paradigms for anxiety-like behaviors (summarized in Table 2). Over the last decades, converging epidemiological, clinical and preclinical data have pointed to a key implication of cannabis and its endogenous system in the regulation of anxiety. In the following sections, we will present a brief synopsis on cannabinoids and the available classes of related agents, with a specific focus on their anxiolytic potential, and the scientific challenges that should be overcome to fully establish the applicability of such drugs in the therapy of anxiety disorders. HERBAL AND SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS Herbal cannabinoids The three species included in the Cannabis genus (or sub-species, depending on the taxonomic classification; see [3], for a detailed discussion on the issue), sativa, indica and ruderalis , feature at least 85 unique terpenophenolic compounds, collectively named phytocannabinoids [4]. The main classes of phytocannabinoids are outlined in Figure 1. Quantitative analyses of cannabis constituents are usually performed by chromatographic techniques (generally Gas Chromatography, but also Thin-Layer Chromatography, or High- Performance Liquid Chromatography), often coupled with Mass Spectrometry. A detailed description of the instrumental methods used for classification and source tracing of Cannabis products (including DNA identification for forensic and intelligence purposes) is beyond the scope of this review, but can be found in [5-7]. The chemical fingerprinting of hemp products has revealed that the two most abundant phytocannabinoids are 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, also named dronabinol) of Cannabis, THC is a highly lipophilic alkaloid produced mainly in the leaves, flowers and glandular trichomes of the plant. Most of the pharmacological effects elicited by hemp products, including emotional and cognitive changes, analgesia, hypothermia and appetite stimulation, are considered to be reflective of the action of THC as a partial agonist of cannabinoid CB 1 and CB 2 receptors (see below). Additionally, THC has been shown to act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor [8-10]. In contrast with THC, CBD is not psychotropic, but has nevertheless been shown to play a role in the modulation of behavioral effects of cannabis [11]. In fact, the THC: CBD ratio isTambaro 2 Recent Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 25. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptthe main criterion to define different cannabis chemotypes [12] and has been posited to contribute to the variability in neurobehavioral outcomes of marijuana or hashish consumption [13,14]. Interestingly, most cannabis strains encountered in the illegal markets generally have elevated amounts of THC [15]. The different characteristics of THC and CBD are underpinned by their distinct mechanisms of action. Whereas THC has nanomolar affinity for both CB 1 (Ki = 25.1 nmol/L) and CB 2 (Ki = 35.2 nmol/L) receptors, CBD exhibits much lower affinity for either target [16-20]; however, the latter phytocannabinoid was recently found to act as a highly potent antagonist/ inverse agonist of both CB receptors [21], possibly due to a non-competitive mechanism of receptor blockade [22]. Additionally, CBD has been shown to exert some of its actions through other receptors, including the vanilloid receptor VR 1 and the serotonin receptor 5- HT1A (for a general overview of the topic, see [11]). The other main phytocannabinoids, including cannabinol (CBN) (Fig. [4,23], have been shown to exert antibiotic and antiinflammatory properties, but have not been strongly associated with the behavioral effects of Cannabis; nevertheless, the recent discovery that CBG is a highly potent agonist for 2 adrenoceptor and a blocker of serotonin 5-HT 1A receptor [24] underscores the potential importance of these and other alkaloids in the psychoactive profile of cannabis. Synthetic cannabinoids In addition to phytocannabinoids, several classes of synthetic CB receptor agonists have been developed; among these families, the best characterized are the synthetic analogs of THC - such (Fig. 2) - and the including WIN 55,212-2, JWH-015, JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-081 and JWH-398 (for a general review, see [23]). Of these agents, only nabilone has been approved for clinical use as an antiemetic treatment and an adjunct analgesic for neuropathic pain [25]. Other more potent synthetic cannabinoids, such as CP 47,497, HU-210 and most JWH compounds, have regrettably gained great popularity in the market of recreational substances during the last decade, under the generic brand names of \"Spice\" or \"K2\". Unlike THC, which is a partial agonist of CB 1 receptors, these agents are full, high-potency CB 1 receptor activators [26,27], thereby eliciting greater psychotropic effects than THC (as CB 1 receptors are the key mediators of the psychotropic actions of cannabis). This characteristic, together with their legal status (recently revoked across most Western countries, including USA as of March 2011) and lack of available testing procedures for the detection of urinary metabolites, has unfortunately contributed to the great diffusion of \"Spice\" blends in Central and Western Europe, as well as Australasia. ENDOCANNABINOIDS AND THEIR RECEPTORS Following the identification of THC in the 1960s [28], extensive research was devoted to the identification of its biological targets and endogenous counterparts. Both objectives were met around 30 years later, with the characterization of the two major cannabinoid receptors, CB1 [29] and CB 2 [30] as well as the discovery of two most prominent endocannabinoids N- arachidonoylethanolamine (commonly named [32,33] (Fig. 3). CB receptors Although CB 1 and CB 2 receptors only share 44% sequence identity (68% in the transmembrane domains), they are both coupled to G i/o proteins [34] and activated by both anandamide and 2-AG. In line with their metabotropic nature, CB receptors mediate theirTambaro and Bortolato Page 3 Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 25. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptintracellular response through a number of changes affecting signaling cascades, such as inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of G-protein-activated kinases (ERKs) [35,36]. The distribution pattern of CB 1 and CB 2 receptors is strikingly divergent, indicating diverse physiological functions: CB 1 is the most abundant metabotropic receptor in the brain, and is primarily distributed in the synaptic terminals of neurons across all the major structures that regulate emotional responsiveness, perception and memory, including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, septo-hippocampal system, striatum, thalamus, brainstem nuclei 1 receptors are typically located on presynaptic terminals [42,43], but they have also been identified in postsynaptic locations [44,45]. Presynaptic CB 1 receptors are posited to serve critical functions for the regulation of synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release; in particular, they mediate the depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) and depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), consisting in the reduction of -amino-butyric acid (GABA) or glutamate release, respectively, from presynaptic boutons following stimulation of the postsynaptic terminals [46-49]. In general, CB1 activation has been shown to inhibit the neurotransmission of other mediators, including glycine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine and serotonin [50], but the underpinnings of these phenomena have not been completely elucidated. Additionally, CB 1 receptors have been implicated in short- and long-term synaptic depression, in relation to phasic or tonic endocannabinoid release (for a review on these topics, see [51]). The function of CB 1 receptors may vary depending on the specific interactions that they entertain with other molecular targets. For example, CB 1 receptors have been found to associate with other G-protein complex receptors, such as dopamine D2, orexin Ox1, opioid and adenosine A 2a, to form heteromeric complexes (reviewed in [52,53]) The key role of CB 1 receptors as mediators of neurochemical homeostasis in the brain is maintained through a complex regulation of their expression. For example, these receptors are subjected to a rapid internalization (via clathrin-coated pits) following their binding with full agonists; on the other hand, the receptors are also recycled, with a process that requires endosomal acidification and dephosphorilation [54]. While CB 2 receptors are abundantly expressed in most peripheral organs (and particularly in immune cells, where they regulate cytokine secretion and modulate cell trafficking) [55], their distribution in the brain appears to be sparse and particularly confined to microglial cells; nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed the presence of CB 2 receptors in several areas of the brain [56-58]. Interestingly, a number of studies suggest that neuronal CB 2 receptors may be mainly located in postsynaptic terminals [58,59]; nevertheless, the functional role of these targets in the brain remains largely elusive and awaits further characterization. The existence of cannabinoid receptors other than CB 1 and CB 2 has been postulated based on ample experimental evidence [60-62]. Interestingly, a number of investigations have pointed to GPR55 as a novel putative cannabinoid receptor [63,64]; nevertheless, evidence on the specificity of this receptor for endocannabinoid is still inconclusive [65]. Endocannabinoids Both anandamide and derivatives of arachidonic acid, an unsaturated C20 fatty acid with 4 double bonds, which also serves as the precursor for synthesis of other eicosanoids, including prostaglandins and leukotriens. Anandamide is found in picomolar concentrations and acts as a high-affinity partial agonist for both CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. It is synthesized on demand by enzymatic hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid N- process catalyzed by Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 25. Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptphospholipases [66-68]. Following release and activation of CB receptors, anandamide is rapidly removed from the synaptic cleft by a carrier-mediated system [69-72] and including oleoylethanolamine (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamine (PEA). Both these compounds do not activate CB1 receptors [76], although they may reduce or slow down anandamide degradation by competing with it for FAAH activity. In comparison with anandamide, 2-AG is much more abundant (occurring in nanomolar concentrations across most tissues) and acts as a full agonist of both CB receptors. It is produced from 1,2diacylglycerol (DAG) by diacylglycerol lipase lipase (MAGL) [78], although other enzymes are known to contribute to this process [79]. The divergent neurochemical profiles of anandamide and 2-AG underscore their different physiological roles. Although our current understanding of the different functions entertained by each endocannabinoid is still rudimentary, the development of FAAH and MAGL inhibitors [80,81] has been instrumental to elucidate the implication of each mediator in synaptic and neurochemical regulation. While 2-AG is known as the retrograde mediator of DSI [82,83] and DSE [84-87], a number of studies suggest that anandamide may serve as an activity-dependent regulator of monoaminergic transmission [88-90]. Recent evidence points to a potential biological antagonism between anandamide and 2-AG [91,92]; on the other hand, emerging evidence points to a similar role of anandamide and 2-AG in the regulation of anxiety (albeit in relation to different receptors) and pain [93]. The development of JZL195, a potent FAAH/MAGL inhibitor, has in turn revealed that the behavioral effects of CB 1 receptor agonists can be only recapitulated by the combination of both endocannabinoid-mediated functions [94]. Other lipids have been [96] (Fig. 3). Additionally, recent evidence has identified that CB receptors may be modulated by peptidic ligands, such as hemopressin and its derivatives [97,98]. EFFECTS OF CANNABIS AND CANNABINOID AGENTS ON ANXIETY Cannabis, THC and CB 1 receptor agonists The employment of cannabis for its medicinal, relaxing and mood-enhancing properties has been documented across most ancient civilizations. Originally introduced in Chinese pharmacopoeia during the third millennium BCE [99,100], cannabis became a popular remedy throughout Asia and Europe in the following centuries [99,101]. The inclusion of cannabis in the medical treatises by Dioscorides and Galen secured the herb a stable reputation in the Roman Empire and the Arabic world [101]. Until the early 20th century, the plant remained a valuable therapy for a large number of diseases [102]; however, growing concerns about the psychoactive and narcotic effects of cannabis led to a progressive restriction and ultimate ban of its usage in the United States and several European countries [100,103]. Despite its illicit status, cannabis remains one of the most popular recreational drugs, particular among adolescents and young adults, in view of its mood-enhancing and euphoriant characteristics [104-106]. Most psychological and behavioral effects of marijuana and other hemp products are induced by THC through activation of CB 1 brain receptors. In fact, although THC and most synthetic cannabinoids are known to activate both CB 1 and CB 2 receptors, their actions onTambaro and Bortolato Page 5 Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 25. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptanxiety-like behaviors and emotional regulation are efficiently countered by selective CB 1 receptor antagonists, such as rimonabant (see next section) [107]. The studies on the psychological effects of cannabis and THC have unfolded a highly complex and often contradictory scenario, fostering a long-standing debate on the potential harms and benefits of its products. An important aspect of this discussion (particularly in consideration of its legal aspects and the potential therapeutic applications of hemp derivatives), revolves around the distinction between use and misuse of cannabis. In particular, whereas the abuse and dependence liability of cannabis is generally well- recognized [108,109], the definition of these phenomena has been heavily criticized as reflective of political agendas rather than scientific bases. For instance, the diagnosis of substance abuse, according to the criteria listed by the DSM-IV TR, is based on the manifestation of at least one of four symptoms: interference with major professional or personal obligations; intoxication in hazardous settings; substance-related legal problems; continued use in the face of persistent social or interpersonal problems [110]. The applicability of some of these standards to marijuana and other cannabis derivatives, however, has been questioned [99], also in view of their lower potential to induce physical harm in comparison with other legal substances, such as alcohol and tobacco [111]. While the controversies surrounding cannabis are far from subdued (and are often permeated and masked by conflicting ideological credos), standardized studies on cannabinoids have highlighted that the psychological and behavioral outcomes of this substance are highly variable and range from relaxation, euthymia and heightened sociability to panic, paranoid ideation and psychosis [112-116]. A corollary of this observation is that the high comorbidity rate between cannabis use disorders and psychiatric conditions [100-105] may indicate that cannabis consumption is either a concurring cause or a \"self-therapeutic\" strategy for anxiety and mood disorders [117-123]. The latter interpretation is supported by the observation that anxiety-spectrum disturbances and traumas in early developmental stages are a strong predictor for later cannabis use disorders [124-127]; furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that the anxiolytic effects of THC may partially account for the high prevalence of cannabis use in patients affected by PTSD [128-131] and OCD [132]. Accordingly, recent clinical studies have shown that THC elicits therapeutic effects in OCD [133] and trichotillomania, an impulse-control disorder characterized by compulsive hair- pulling [134]. Nevertheless, prospective analyses show that cannabis use and dependence increase the risk for development of panic disorder [135], suggesting that the effect of cannabis may vary with respect to the nosological entities within the spectrum of anxiety disorders. Of note, chronic consumption of cannabis has been hypothesized to exacerbate depressive or anxious manifestations, and reduce the therapeutic efficacy of anxiolytic agents [122,136-138]; an interesting theoretical implication of this finding is that long-term exposure to cannabinoid agents may lead to profound alterations of synaptic plasticity and neurochemical homeostasis and alter the pathophysiological trajectory of anxiety and mood disorders. Thus, while cannabis may be initially used as a self-therapy for certain anxiety disorders, the prolonged exposure to this substance in vulnerable individuals may in turn alter or aggravate the clinical course of these conditions and render the patients refractory to standard treatments. The ability of cannabis to either exacerbate or attenuate emotional reactivity is highly influenced by numerous factors, including its chemotype, as well as the influence of genetic, developmental and contextual variables. Unfortunately, little is still known about the susceptibility factors that govern the behavioral outcomes of cannabis in patients affected by anxiety-spectrum disorders. Indeed, several components have been shown to play a role in this link, including genetic background, age, gender, environmental stress and concurrentTambaro and Bortolato Page 6 Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 25. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptuse of other drugs; a detailed analysis of these determinants is outside the scope of the present work, but the interested reader should refer to [139]. Aside from the influence of vulnerability factors, the available evidence indicates that cannabis, THC and other CB 1 receptor agonists exercise a bidirectional influence on anxiety responses as a function of the dosage. The majority of users report that consumption of modest amounts of cannabis and CB 1 receptor agonists results in euphoria, relaxation, heightened perception, sociability and creativity, moderate to high doses have been reported to elicit phobia, agitation, panic, dysphoria, psychotic manifestations and cognitive impairments [112-116,124,140-143]. In line with these premises, early studies showed a robust anxiolytic efficacy of low-dose nabilone in comparison with placebo [144,145]. Additionally, the few available reports on the clinical outcomes of recreational cannabinoids show that a moderate consumption of \"Spice\" blends is generally associated with euphoria and disinhibition [146], but the abuse of these substances is conducive to high levels of anxiety, panic, paranoid ideation and mood disturbances [147-151]. The biphasic effects of cannabinoids on anxiety-related responses have been extensively documented in rodents. In agreement with human evidence, preclinical studies have elucidated that the acute administration of low doses of CB 1 receptor agonists elicits anxiolytic-like in approach/avoidance tasks [152-156]; conversely, high concentrations of the same compounds are generally associated with the opposite outcomes [157-162] (for complete reviews of the topic, see [163,164]) The bidirectional action of CB 1 receptors on anxiety responses may be related to the modulatory role of these targets on GABA and glutamate release across amygdala and other forebrain areas [41,165,166]. As these two major neurotransmitters affect anxiety in an opposite fashion, different doses of cannabinoids and synthetic CB 1 receptor agonists may indeed produce highly divergent effects, in relation to their ability to affect the homeostasis and the balance of GABA and glutamate (for a review on these issues, see [163]). Furthermore, CB 1 receptors have been shown to play critical roles in the regulation of most neurochemical substrates of anxiety, including the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine and acetylcholine, as well as stress hormones, colecystokynin and opioid peptides [50,163]. In line with this concept, the infusion in the periaqueductal grey of arachidonyl-2- chloroethylamide (ACEA), an anandamide synthetic analog with high CB 1 receptor selectivity, elicited anxiolytic-like effects in rats in an elevated plus maze, with a bell-shaped dose-response curve [167], the highest doses being associated to no significant behavioral change. Novel categories of compounds have been patented for potential efficacy as selective CB 1 receptor modulators, including sulfonyl-benzamides [168] and tetrasubstituted imidazole derivatives [169]. To the best of our knowledge, however, no findings on the action of these compounds in anxiety regulation have been reported to date. CB1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists The cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonist rimonabant was introduced into clinical practice by Sanofi-Aventis in 2006 as a treatment for obesity [170] and smoking cessation [171]. The majority of preclinical studies found that these compounds are anxiogenic at high doses [158,159,172,173] and ineffective at low doses [174,175]. The anxiogenic properties of CB 1 antagonists, were unequivocally confirmed by clinical data on the psychiatric side effects of rimonabant. The significant increase in anxiety, depression and suicidality in patients under treatment with rimonabant [176-179], in particular, led to the withdrawal of the drug from the European market in October, 2008. As a consequence, several pharmaceutical companies announced the interruption of their clinical research onTambaro and Bortolato Page 7 Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 25. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptCB1 receptor antagonists, including taranabant (from Merck) and otenabant (from Pfizer), both in Phase 3 of development. Some of the anxiogenic properties of rimonabant and analogs have been speculated to be due to their activity as inverse agonists; as a result, the therapeutic use of newly-developed neutral CB 1 antagonists has been proposed, with the hypothesis that these compounds would not elicit the untoward psychological effects observed with rimonabant and its analogs [180,181]; this idea is supported by recent findings, showing that unlike CB 1 receptor inverse agonists, the neutral antagonists of this targets fail to facilitate the acquisition or consolidation of fear [182]. CB2 receptor ligands Few studies have actually evaluated the role of CB 2 receptor in anxiety and stress response. While this receptor was posited to be mainly expressed mainly in immune cells and peripheral areas, its identification in the brain under pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal cord [183-185], led to a number of studies aimed at the assessment of its potential role in brain function and behavioral regulation. Some of these investigations indicated that the suppression of CB 2 receptor in the brain, through intracerebroventricular injection of antisense nucleotide sequences, elicited anxiolytic [186]. In Garcia-Gutierrez and Manzanares [187] recently described that the overexpression of CB 2 receptors reduced anxiogenic-related behaviors in the light-dark box and elevated plus maze. These premises point to the possibility that CB 2 receptor ligands may also play a role in the modulation of anxiety disorders. This hypothesis, however, awaits further examination with proper pharmacological tools. CBD Several studies suggest that THC and CBD may exert opposite actions on brain function and psychopathology [188], possibly in relation to the action of CBD as a potent CB 1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist [21] (see above). Several lines of preclinical work have shown that CBD reduces the effects of THC on several behavioral functions [189-191]. In line with these data, CBD has been found to reduce the anxiety and improve the sensation of well being induced by an acute, high THC dose in healthy volunteers [192]. In contrast with these data, a number of studies have shown that CBD pretreatment potentiated the behavioral effects induced by THC [193-195]. These actions may signify the ability of CBD to inhibit cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism [196,197], which may increase THC blood and brain concentrations [193,195]. Notably, the behavioral outcomes of CBD do not appear to be only due to potential pharmacodynamic/pharmacokynetic competition with THC; indeed, recent studies have shown that CBD exerts inherent anxiolytic effects, both in rodent models [157,198-201] and, more recently, in patients affected by social phobia [202,203]. The anxiolytic action of CBD may be linked to 5-HT 1A receptor, but not through benzodiazepine receptors [204]. Of note, the anxiolytic action of CBD also appears to be bidirectional, as only low to moderate doses, but not high doses, have been associated with exert anxiolytic effects [200,205]. The anxiolytic action of CBD do not appear to be mediated by benzodiazepine receptors [204], but rather by 5-HT 1A serotonin receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis [206], a critical component of the amygdaloid complex involved in the regulation of stress response. Accordingly, CBD has been shown to reduce amygdalar responses to fearful stimuli [207]; this mechanism may be essential for the anxiolytic effects of this compound in social phobia [203]. Furthermore, CBD has been shown to elicit antipanic effects through the activation ofTambaro and Bortolato Page 8 Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 25. Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript5-HT 1A receptors in the dorsal periaqueductal gray, a critical area for the modulation of emotional reactivity to stress [208,209]. Endocannabinoid transport blockers The systemic administration of the endocannabinoid transport blocker AM404 (Fig. 4) was shown to elicit anxiolytic-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze and defensive withdrawal in adult rats, as well as an attenuation of ultrasonic vocalizations in rat pups [175]. The same compound was shown to attenuate marble burying (a paradigm for compulsivity testing) in mice, suggesting that this compound may have some potential efficacy for OCD [206]. Interestingly, the anxiolytic effects of AM404 were shown to be contributed by both CB 1 and 5-HT 1A receptors [152,210], in a fashion similar to the potent CB 1 receptor agonist CP 55,940 [160]. Additionally, AM404 has been suggested to act as a FAAH inhibitor [211], although evidence in this respect is controversial [72]. Indeed, despite the identification of potential candidate endocannabinoid binding sites [212], no final evidence is currently available on the existence and/or molecular identity of the endocannabinoid transporter. Although the possibility of targeting the endocannabinoid carrier for the development of anxiolytic compounds is appealing and has been targeted by a patent proposing these compounds as a pharmacological support for psychotherapy [213], the elusive molecular identity of the transporter itself has greatly limited the studies. Furthermore, preliminary data indicate that AM404 elicits reward in animals and is self-administered by squirrel monkeys [175,214], raising the possibility that endocannabinoid transport blockers may be addictive. FAAH inhibitors The prototypical FAAH inhibitor URB597 (Fig. 4) has been shown to reduce anxiety-like behaviors in rats, in a rimonabant-sensitive fashion [155,163,215-217]. In addition to its anxiolytic-like properties, URB597 was found to exert also antidepressant-like effects in several animal models with high face and predictive validity, such as the forced swim, tail suspension and chronic mild stress paradigms [89,210,216,218]. The anxiolytic action of FAAH inhibitors has been suggested to depend on the enhancement of anandamide in the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray [219]; interestingly, however, only low doses of URB597 in the prefrontal cortex were found to elicit anxiolytic-like effects, through CB 1 receptor activation. However, higher doses ceased to elicit anxiolysis, in view of their interaction with TPRV1 vanilloid receptors [220]. Furthermore, the anxiolytic and antidepressant actions of FAAH inhibitors were observed only under conditions of high environmental aversiveness, but not under normal conditions [163,218,221]. Importantly, the psychotropic effects of FAAH inhibitors are partially distinct from those associated with cannabinoids, in that they appear to fail to reproduce the hedonic and interoceptive states produced by CB receptor agonists [89] and to induce self-administration in squirrel monkeys [222]. Taken together, these data suggest that FAAH inhibitors may be promising tools in the therapy of anxiety and mood disorders with a safer profile than cannabinoid direct agonists. This idea has been recently endorsed by several authors in recent articles and patents, featuring novel categories of highly selective and potent FAAH inhibitors [223-225] [226]. However, it should be noted that recent data have recently shown that URB597 induce a number of side effects in rats, including social withdrawal, working memory deficits [227] and impairments in auditory discrimination and reversal of olfactory discrimination [228]. MAGL inhibitors The role of 2-AG in emotional regulation has been difficult to ascertain until the recent development of highly selective monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitors [35,223]. Several lines of evidence have suggested that 2-AG plays a pivotal role in theTambaro and Bortolato Page 9 Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 25. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptpathophysiology of anxiety and defensive behaviors. The prototypical MAGL inhibitor, JZL184 (Fig. 4), has been shown to enhance the levels of 2-AG, but not anandamide; this effect is due to its extremely high selectivity for MAGL over FAAH and other brain serine hydrolases. Recent evidence has shown that this compound exerts anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus maze and in marble buyring, at doses that do not affect locomotor activity [93,229,230]. Similarly to the effects described for FAAH inhibitors (see above), the anxiolytic effects of this compound were observed in highly aversive (or anxiogenic) contextual settings [229]. The neurobiological role of 2-AG in anxiety is still poorly understood, although several studies have shown that environmental stressors alter its biosynthesis and degradation in key brain structures controlling emotional regulation, including periaqueductal grey, amygdala and hippocampus [231,232]. Interestingly, recent evidence has shown that the anxiolytic properties of JZL184 appear to be mediated by CB 2, rather than CB 1 receptors [93], pointing to a potential implication of this receptor in the role of 2-AG in anxiety regulation. CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS In light of the limitations of our current pharmacological armamentarium for anxiety disorders, the ability of cannabinoids to modulate emotional responses is extremely attractive for the development of novel anxiolytic agents [217]. At the same time, great concern arises from the protean role of cannabinoids on the regulation of these responses, as well as their misuse liability and other side effects. The identification of operational strategies for the employment of cannabinoids in the therapy of anxiety disorders is therefore a fundamental goal in psychiatry research. As outlined above, clinical evidence strongly suggests that acute administration of low doses of CB 1 receptor agonists results in anxiolytic effects, while excessive activation of these targets elicits opposite outcomes, following a reverse U-shaped dose-response pattern. Hence, a primary strategy to harness the anxiolytic properties of cannabinoids could consist in the employment of partial, low-affinity CB 1 agonists, which may ensure a relatively high therapeutic index and the stabilization of the activation of this target within a range associated with mood enhancement and/or anxiolysis. This idea is indirectly supported by the mirroring observation that anecdotal reports on highly potent, high-affinity synthetic cannabinoids (such as those contained in \"Spice\" blends) trigger greater psychoactive effects than the partial CB agonist THC [26]. This concept indicates a potential evolution in the search for direct CB agonists, in sharp contrast with the previous trend aimed at the identification of high-affinity CB receptor activators. An alternative strategy to achieve a similar therapeutic goal may lie in the combination of CB1 receptor agonists with low dosages of antagonists (preferably neutral, in order to avoid potential side effects linked to CB 1 inverse agonism); this intriguing approach, which has been indicated in a recent patent [233], is based on the likely mechanism of action of Sativex\u00ae, a cannabinoid mouth spray containing THC and CBD (in a ratio of 1.08:1) and marketed for the treatment of neuropathic pain, spasticity and overactive bladder, in consideration of the action of CBD as a CB 1 receptor antagonist. However, recent preliminary clinical studies have shown that this formulation did not significantly reduce anxiety (in fact, it was reported to induce a mild, yet not significant increase of this symptom) [234,235], and that CBD did not appear to elicit a significant opposition to the effect of dronabinol [235], plausibly indicating that a higher concentration of this ingredient (or lower relative amount of THC) may be necessary to elicit anxiolytic effects. A third, highly promising avenue for the development of cannabinoid-based anxiolytic therapies may be afforded by FAAH inhibitors. Unlike endocannabinoid transport blockersTambaro and Bortolato Page 10 Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June 25. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptand direct CB receptor agonists, these compounds exhibit a number of highly desirable properties for anxiolytic agents: first, they appear to maintain their anxiolytic and antidepressant effect not only under conditions of acute administration, but also following long-term treatment [93,210]; second, they appear to elicit their effects only in conditions of highly aversive environmental circumstances (i.e., similar to those that would in fact require an anxiolytic treatment); third, they have no apparent addiction liability [89,222]. The neurobiological bases of this phenomenon are not completely understood, and may be related to the involvement of other FAAH substrates, such as OEA or PEA; however, recent investigations suggest that the lack of 2-AG enhancement ensuing FAAH inactivation may contribute to the lack of reinforcing properties of URB597 [236], potentially suggesting a different role of anandamide and 2-AG in the modulation of reward; this idea is actually consistent with the recent finding that 2-AG is induces self-administration in monkeys [237]. A key problem concerning the potential application of cannabinoid-related agents and cannabinoids is the relatively little information about their long-term effects following chronic administration. Indeed, the subjective effects of cannabis have been shown to be typically different in chronic users as compared to occasional marijuana smokers [238,239]. Prolonged consumption of cannabis has been shown to induce affective sequelae, including alexithymia and avolition [113,240-242]. Interestingly, tolerance has been shown to the effects of THC [243,244], while no information is available on endocannabinoid-related agents. Long-term administration of cannabinoids has been shown to result in a number of neuroplastic adaptive processes, including CB receptor down-regulation [245,246]. Some of these phenomena may indeed be critical in shaping the different emotional responsiveness to cannabis throughout life and reflect a potential pathophysiological loop which may compound the severity of pre-existing anxiety and affective disorders. Finally, another important step for the employment of cannabinoid-based anxiolytic therapies will be the analysis of the vulnerability factors implicated in the differential responses and long-term sequelae induced by cannabis consumption. For example, numerous meta-analyses and longitudinal studies have established that cannabis consumption in adolescence is conducive to an increased risk for psychotic disorders [247-250]. This association is particularly significant in the presence of other genetic factors, such as the Val108Met allelic variant of the gene encoding Catechol-O- methyltransferase (COMT) [251,252], one of the main enzymes for the degradation of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Interestingly, it has been shown that the synergistic effect of COMT haplotype and cannabis in adolescence is more robust in conjunction with predisposing environmental variables, such as the exposure to urbanicity and psychosocial stress [253]. Another gene that may modulate the behavioral responsiveness to cannabinoids is Nrg1 , which encodes for the synaptic protein neuregulin 1. Indeed, the heterozygous deletion of this gene ablates the development of tolerance to the anxiogenic effects of CB receptor agonists [254,255]. These findings suggest that the employment of a pharmacogenetic approach may be a critical screening instrument to identify which patients may be treated with cannabis for medical purposes without risks of neuropsychiatric side effects. Notably, the role of genes in the mental sequelae of cannabis may also be contributed by epigenetic factors, in consideration of the recent finding that THC induces expression of histone deacetylase 3 [256]. While studies on the biological determinants of different responses to cannabis are still at their preliminary stages, advances in this area may be essential to allow a personalized approach for the employment of cannabinoid-based therapies in anxiety and mood disorders.Tambaro and Bortolato Page 11 Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov .

Marmar1 Published online: 4 September 2015 #The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc. 2015 Abstract Cannabidiol (CBD), a Cannabis sativa constituent, is a pharmacologically broad-spectrum drug that in recent years has drawn increasing interest as a treatment for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of the current re- view is to determine CBD 's potential as a treatment for anxiety-related disorders, by assessing evidence from preclin-ical, human experimental, clinical, and epidemiological stud-ies. We found that existing preclinical evidence strongly sup- ports CBD as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder when adminis- tered acutely; however, few studies have investigated chronic CBD dosing. Likewise, evidence from human studies sup-ports an anxiolytic role of CBD, but is currently limited to acute dosing, also with few studies in clinical populations. Overall, current evidence indicates CBD has considerable po-tential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders, with need for further study of chronic and therapeutic effects in relevant clinical populations. Keywords Cannabidiol .Endocannabinoids .Anxiety . Generalized anxiety disorder .Post-traumatic stress disorderIntroduction Fear and anxiety are adaptive responses essential to coping with threats to survival. Yet excessive or persistent fear may be maladaptive, leading to disability. Symptoms arising from excessive fear and anxiety occur in a number of neuropsychi- atric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),panic disorder (PD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety -compulsive dis- order Notably, PTSD and OCD are no longer classi- fied as anxiety disorders in the recent revision of the Diagnos- tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5; however, excessive anxiety is central to the symptomatology of bothdisorders. These anxiety-related disorders are associated with a diminished sense of well-being, elevated rates of unemploy- ment and relationship breakdown, and elevated suicide risk[1-3]. Together, they have a lifetime prevalence in the USA of 29 % [ 4], the highest of any mental disorder, and constitute an immense social and economic burden [ 5,6]. Currently available pharmacological treatments and atypical antipsy- chotics are also to treat PTS D. These medications are asso- ciated with limited response rates and residual symptoms, partic-ularly in PTSD, and adverse effect s may also limit tolerability and adherence [ 7-10]. The substantial burden of anxiety-related disorders and the limitations of current treatments place a highpriority on developing novel pharmaceutical treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid constituent of Cannabis psychoactive CBD has broad erties across a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, stemmingfrom diverse central nervous system actions [ 11,12]. In recent*Esther M. Blessing esther.blessing@nyumc.org 1New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY , USA 2Instituto de Neurociencias de 10.1007/s13311-015-0387-1 has attracted increasing interest as a potential anxiolytic treatment [ 13-15]. The purpose of this review is to assess evidence from current preclinical, clinical, and epi- demiological studies pertaining to the potential risks and ben- efits of CBD as a treatment for anxiety disorders. Methods A search of MEDLINE (PubMed) , PsycINFO, Web of Science Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted for English-language papers published up to 1 January 2015, usingthe Bcannabidiol ^and ^orBsocial phobia ^orBpost-trau- matic stress disorder ^orBpanic disorder ^orBobsessive com- pulsive disorder ^. In total, 49 primary preclinical, clinical, or epidemiological studies were in cluded. Neuroimaging studies that documented results from anxi ety-related tasks, or resting neural activity, were included. Epidemiological or clinical stud-ies that assessed CBD 's effects on anxiety symptoms, or the potential protective effects of CBD on anxiety symptoms in- duced by cannabis use (where the CBD content of cannabis is inferred via a higher CBD:T HC ratio), were included. CBD Pharmacology Relevant to Anxiety General Pharmacology and Therapeutic Profile Cannabis sativa ,as p e c i e so ft h e Cannabis genus of flowering plants, is one of the most frequently used illicit recreational substances in Western culture. The 2 major phyto- cannabinoidconstituents with central nervous system activity are THC, re- sponsible for the euphoric and mind-altering effects, and CBD, which lacks these psychoactive eff ects. Preclinical and clinical studies show CBD possesses a wide range of therapeutic (see [ 11,12,16-19]f o r reviews). A review of potential side effects in humans found that CBD was well tolerated across a wide dose range, up to 1500 mg/day (orally), with no reported psychomotor slowing, negative mood effects, or vital sign abnormalities noted [ 20]. CBD has a broad pharmacological profile, including inter- actions with several receptors known to regulate fear andanxiety-related behaviors, specifically the cannabinoid type1 receptor (CB 1R), the 5-HT 1Areceptor, receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1)receptor [ 11,12,19,21]. In addition, CBD may also regulate, directly or indirectly, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- , the orphan G-protein-coupled transporter, the TRP channels, and glycine receptors [ 11,12,19, 21]. In the current review of primary studies, the following receptor-specific actions were found to have been investigated as potential mediators of CBD 's to actions is detailed below. The Endocannabinoid System Following cloning of the endogenous receptor for THC, endogenous 2-arachidonoylglycerol in [ 22]). The CB 1R is an inhibitory G i/oprotein-coupled receptor that is mainly localized to nerve terminals, and is expressed on both -aminobutryic acid-ergic and glutamatergic neurons. eCBs are fatty acid derivatives that are synthesized on demand inresponse to neuronal depolarization and Ca 2+influx, via cleavage primary mecha- nism by which eCBs regulate synaptic function is retrograde signaling, wherein eCBs produced by depolarization of thepostsynaptic neuron activate presynaptic CB 1Rs, leading to inhibition of neurotransmitter release [ 23]. The BeCB system ^ and related CB 2re- ceptor (the latter expressed mainly in the periphery); as well as several other receptors activated by eCBs, including the TRPV1 receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated which func- tionally interact with CB 1R signaling (reviewed in [ 21,24]). Interactions with the TRPV1 receptor, in particular, appear tobe critical in regulating the extent to which eCB release leadsto inhibition or facilitation of presynaptic neurotransmitter re- The TRPV1 receptor is postsynaptic cation chan- nel that underlies sensation of noxious heat in the periphery, with capsacin (hot chili) as an exogenous ligand. TRPV1 re- ceptors are also expressed in the brain, including the amygdala, periaqueductal grey, hippocampus, and other areas [ 26,27]. The eCB system regulates diverse physiological functions, including caloric energy balance and immune function [ 28]. The eCB system is also integral to regulation of emotionalbehavior, being essential to forms of synaptic plasticity that determine learning and response to emotionally salient, par- ticularly highly aversive events [ 29,30]. Activation of CB 1Rs produces anxiolytic effects in various models of uncondi-tioned fear, relevant to multiple anxiety disorder symptomdomains (reviewed in [ 30-33]). Regarding conditioned fear, the effect of CB 1R activation is complex: CB 1R activation may enhance or reduce fear expression, depending on brainlocus and the eCB ligand [ 34]; however, CB 1R activation potently enhances fear extinction [ 35], and can prevent fear reconsolidation. Genetic manipulations that impede826 Blessing et al.CB1R activation are anxiogenic [ 35], and individuals with eCB system gene polymorphisms that reduce eCB tone \u2014 for example, FAAH gene polymorphisms \u2014exhibit physio- logical, psychological, and neuroimaging features consis- tent with impaired fear regulation [ 36]. Reduction of AEA- CB 1R signaling in the amygdala the anxiogenic effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone[37], and CB 1R activation is essential to negative feedback of the neuroendocrine stress response, and protects against the adverse effects of chronic stress [ 38,39]. Finally, chronic stress impairs eCB signaling in the hippocampusand amygdala, leading to anxiety [ 40,41], and people with PTSD show elevated CB 1R availability and reduced peripheral AEA, suggestive of reduced eCB tone [ 42]. Accordingly, CB 1R activation has been suggested as a tar- get for anxiolytic drug development [ 15,43,44]. Proposed agents for enhancing CB 1R activation include THC, which is a potent and direct agonist; synthetic CB 1R agonists; FAAH inhibitors and other agents that increase eCB as well as nonpsychoactive cannabis phytocannabinoids, includ- ing CBD. While CBD for the CB 1R, it func- tions as an indirect agonist, potentially via augmentation of CB1R constitutional activity, or via increasing AEA through FAAH inhibition (reviewed in [ 21]). Several complexities of the eCB system may impact upon the potential of CBD and other CB 1R-activating agents to serve as anxiolytic drugs. First, CB 1R agonists, including THC and AEA, have a biphasic effect: low doses are anxiolytic, but higher doses are ineffective or anxiogenic, in both preclinicalmodels in and humans (reviewed in [ 33,45]). This biphasic profile may stem from the capacity of CB 1R agonists to also activate TRPV1 receptors when administered at a high,but not low dose, as demonstrated for AEA [ 46]. Activation of TRPV1 receptors is predominantly anxiogenic, and thus acritical balance of eCB levels, determining CB1 versus TRPV1 activation, is proposed to govern emotional behavior [ 27,47]. CBD acts as a TRPV1 agonist at high concentrations, poten-tially by interfering with AEA inactivation [48]. In addition todose-dependent activation of TRPV1 channels, the anxiogenic versus anxiolytic balance of CB 1R agonists also depends on dynamic factors, including environmental 33,49]. 5-HT 1AReceptors The other 5-HT 1AR agonists are approved for the treatment of GAD, with fair response rates [ 50]. In preclinical studies, 5-HT 1AR agonists are anxiolytic in animal models of general anxiety [ 51], prevent the adverse effects of stress [ 52], and enhance fear extinction [ 53]. Both pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT 1ARs are coupled to various members of the Gi/oprotein family. They are expressed on serotonergic neurons in the raphe, where they exert autoinhibitory function, andvarious other brain areas involved in fear and anxiety[54,55]. Mechanisms underlying the anxiolytic effects of 5-HT 1AR activation are complex, varying between both brain region, and pre- versus postsynaptic locus, and are not fully established [ 56]. While in vitro studies suggest CBD acts as a direct 5-HT 1AR agonist [ 57], in vivo or facilitator of 5-HT 1A signaling [ 58]. Preclinical Evaluations Generalized Anxiety Models Relevant studies in animal models are summarized in chro- nological order in Table 1. CBD has been studied in a wide range of animal models of general anxiety, including the elevated plus maze (EPM), the V ogel-conflict test (VCT), and the elevated T maze (ETM). See Table 1for the anxi- olytic effect specific to each paradigm. Initial studies of CBD in these models showed conflicting results: high (100 mg/kg) doses were ineffective, while low (10 mg/kg) doses were anxiolytic [ 59,60]. When tested over a wide range of doses in further studies, the anxiolytic effects of CBD presented a bell-shaped dose -response curve, with an- xiolytic effects observed at moderate but not higher doses [61,90]. All further studies of acute systemic CBD without prior stress showed anxiolytic effects or no effect [ 62,65], the latter study involving intracerebroventricular rather thanthe intraperitoneal anxiogenic effects of acute sys- temic CBD dosing in models of general anxiety have yet been reported. As yet, few studies have examined chronicdosing effects of CBD in models of generalized anxiety. Campos et al. [ 66] showed that in rat, CBD treatment for 21 days attenuated inhibitory avoidance acquisition [ 83]. Long et al. [ 69] showed that, in mouse, CBD produced moderate anxiolytic effects in some paradigms, with no ef- fects in others. Anxiolytic effects of CBD in models of generalized anxiety have been linked to specific receptor mechanisms and brainregions. The midbrain dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) isintegral to anxiety, orchestrating autonomic and behavioral responses to threat [ 91], and DPAG stimulation in humans produces feelings of intense distress and dread [ 92]. Microin- jection of CBD into the in the EPM, VGC, and ETM that were partially mediated byactivation of 5-HT 1ARs but not by CB 1Rs [65,68]. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) serves as a principaloutput structure of the amygdaloid complex to coordinatesustained fear responses, relevant to anxiety [ 93]. Anxiolytic effects of CBD in the EPM and VCT occurred upon microin-jection into the BNST, where they depended on 5-HT 1ARCannabidiol as a Potential Treatment for Anxiety Disorders 827Table 1 Preclinical studies Study Animal Route Dose Model Effect Receptor Involvement Silveira Filho et al.

In the prelimbic cortex, which drives expression of fear responses via connections with the amygdala [ 94], CBD had more complex effects: acute was anxiolytic [ 87]. Finally, the anxi- olytic effects of systemic CBD partially depended onGABA Areceptor activation in the EPM model but not in the VCT model [ 61,62]. As noted, CBD has been found to have a bell-shaped re- sponse curve, with higher doses being ineffective. This mayreflect activation of TRPV1 receptors at higher dose, as block- ade of TRPV1 receptors in the DPAG rendered a previously ineffective high dose of CBD as anxiolytic in the EPM [ 66]. Given TRPV1 receptors have anxiogenic effects, this may indicate that at higher doses, CBD 's interaction with TRPV1 receptors to some extent impedes anxiolytic actions, although was notably not sufficient to produce anxiogenic effects. Stress-induced Anxiety Models Stress is an important contributor to anxiety disorders, and traumatic stress exposure is essential to the development of PTSD. Systemically administered CBD reduced acute in- creases in heart rate and blood pressure induced by restraintstress, as well as the delayed (24 h) anxiogenic effects of stress in the EPM, partially by 5-HT activation [ 67,73]. How- ever intra-BNST microinjection of CBD augmented stress- induced heart rate increase, also partially via 5-HT 1ARa c t i v a - tion [ 85]. In a subchronic study, CBD administered daily 1 h after predator stress (a proposed model of PTSD) reduced thelong-lasting anxiogenic effects of chronic predator stress, par- tially via 5-HT 1AR activation [ 77]. In a chronic study, system- ic CBD prevented increased anxiety produced by chronic un- predictable stress, in addition to increasing hippocampal AEA; these anxiolytic effects depended upon CB 1R activation and hippocampal neurogenesis, as demonstrated by genetic ablation techniques [ 81]. Prior stress also appears to modulate anxiogenic of animals was anxiogenic in theEPM but following restraint stress was found to be anxiolytic [87]. Likewise, systemic CBD was anxiolytic in the EPM following but not prior to stress [ 65]. PD and Compulsive Behavior Models CBD inhibited escape responses in the ETM and increased DPAG escape electrical threshold [ 68], both proposed models of panic attacks [ 95]. These effects partially depended on 5- HT 1AR activation but were not affected by CB 1R blockade. CBD was also panicolytic in the predator -prey model, whichassesses explosive escape and defensive immobility in re- sponse to a boa constrictor snake, also partially via 5-HT 1AR activation; however, more consistent with an anxiogenic ef- fect, CBD was also noted to decrease time spent outside the burrow and increase defensive attention (not shown in Table 1)[75,86] . Finally, CBD, partially via CB 1Rs, de- immobility and explosive escape caused by neuronal activation in the superior colliculus [ 89]. Anticompulsive of CBD were investi- marble-burying conceptualized to model [ 96]. Acute systemic CBD reduced marble-burying be- havior for up to 7 days, with no attenuation in effect up to high (120 mg/kg) doses, and effect shown to depend on CB 1Rs but not 5-HT 1ARs [71,74,88]. Contextual Fear Conditioning, Fear Extinction, and Reconsolidation Blockade Several studies assessed CBD using contextual fear condition- ing. Briefly, this paradigm involves pairing a neutral context, the conditioned stimulus (CS), with an aversive unconditionedstimulus (US), a mild foot shock. After repeated pairings, the subject learns that the CS predicts the US, and subsequent CS presentation elicits freezing and other physiological re-sponses. Systemic administration of CBD prior to CS re-exposure reduced conditioned cardiovascular re- sponses [ 63], an effect reproduced by microinjection of CBD into the BNST, and partially mediated by 5- HT 1AR activation [ 79]. Similarly, CBD in the prelimbic cortex reduced conditioned freezing [ 70], an effect p r e v e n t e db y5 - H T 1ARb l o c k a d e[ 87]. By contrast, CBD microinjection in the infralimbic cortex enhanced c o n d i t i o n e df r e e z i n g[ 70]. Finally, El Batsh et al. [ 80] reported that repeated CBD doses over 21 days, that ischronic as opposed to acute treatment, facilitated condi- tioned freezing. In this study, CBD was administered prior to conditioning rather than prior to re-exposure as in acute studies, thus further directly comparablestudies are required. CBD has also been shown to enhance extinction of contextually conditioned fear responses. Extinction train-ing involves repeated CS exposure in the absence of theUS, leading to the formation of a new memory that inhibits fear responses and a decline in freezing over subsequent training sessions. Systemic CBD administra- tion immediately before training markedly enhanced ex- tinction, and this effect depended on CB 1R activation, without involvement of TRPV1 receptors [65 ]. Further studies showed CB 1Rs in the infralimbic cortex may be involved in this effect [ 82]. CBD also blocked reconsolidation of aversive memo- ries in rat [ 76]. Briefly, fear memories, when reactivated by re-exposure (retrieval) , enter into a labile state in830 Blessing et al.which the memory trace may either be reconsolidated or extinguished [ 97], and this process may be pharmacolog- ically modulated to achieve reconsolidation blockade or extinction. When administered immediately following re- trieval, CBD prevented freezing to the conditioned con- text upon further re-exposure, and no reinstatement orspontaneous recovery was observed over 3 weeks, con- sistent with reconsolidation blockade rather than extinc- tion [ 76]. This effect depended on CB 1R activation but not 5-HT 1ARa c t i v a t i o n[ 76]. Summary and Clinical Relevance Overall, existing preclinical evidence strongly supports the potential of CBD as a treatment for anxiety disor-ders. CBD exhibits a broad range of actions, relevant to multiple symptom domains, including anxiolytic, panicolytic, and anticompulsive actions, as well as adecrease in autonomic arousal, a decrease in conditioned fear expression, enhancement of fear ex- tinction, reconsolidation blockade, and prevention of thelong-term anxiogenic effects of stress. Activation of 5- HT 1ARs appears to mediate anxiolytic and panicolytic effects, in addition to reducing conditioned fear expres- sion, although CB 1R activation may play a limited role. By contrast, CB 1R activation appears to mediate CBD 's anticompulsive effects, enhancement of fear extinction,reconsolidation blockade, and capacity to prevent the long-term anxiogenic consequences of stress, with in- volvement of hippocampal neurogenesis. While CBD predominantly has acute anxiolytic ef- fects, some species discrepancies are apparent. In addi-tion, effects may be contingent on prior stress and varyaccording to brain region. A notable contrast between CBD and other agents that target the eCB system, in- THC, direct CB 1R inhibi- tors, is a lack of anxiogenic effects at a higher dose. Further receptor-specific studies may elucidate the recep- tor specific basis of this distinct dose response profile.Further studies are also required to establish the efficacy of CBD when administered in chronic dosing, as rela- tively few relevant studies exist, with mixed results, in-cluding both anxiolytic and anxiogenic outcomes. Overall, preclinical evidence supports systemic CBD as an acute treatment of GAD, SAD, PD, OCD, and PTSD, and suggests that CBD has the advantage of not producing anxiogenic effects at higher dose, as dis-tinct from other agents that enhance CB 1R activation. In particular, results show potential for the treatment ofmultiple PTSD symptom domains, including reducingarousal and avoidance, preventing the long-term adverse effects of stress, as well as enhancing the extinction and blocking the reconsolidation of persistent fear memories.Human Experimental and Clinical Studies Evidence from Acute Psychological Studies Relevant studies are summarized in Table 2. The anxiolytic effects of CBD in humans were first demonstrated in the con- text of reversing the anxiogenic effects of THC. CBD reduced THC-induced anxiety when administered simultaneously with this agent, but had no effect on baseline anxiety when admin-istered alone [ 99,100]. Further studies using higher doses supported a lack of anxiolytic effects at baseline [ 101,107]. By contrast, CBD potently reduces experimentally inducedanxiety or fear. CBD reduced anxiety associated with a simu- lated public speaking test in healthy subjects, and in subjects with SAD, showing a comparable efficacy to ipsapirone (a 5-HT 1ARa g o n i s t )o rd i a z e p a m[ 98,105]. CBD also reduced the presumed anticipatory undergoing asingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) im-aging procedure, in both healthy and SAD subjects [ 102,104]. Finally, CBD enhanced extinction of fear memories in healthyvolunteers: specifically, inhaled CBD administered prior to orafter extinction training in a contextual fear conditioning par- adigm led to a trend-level enhancement in the reduction of skin conductance response during reinstatement, and a signif- icant reduction in expectancy (of shock) ratings during rein- statement [ 106]. Evidence from Neuroimaging Studies Relevant studies are summarized in Table 3. In a SPECTstudy of resting cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in normal subjects, CBD reduced rCBF in left medial temporal areas, including the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as the hypothalamusand left posterior gyrus, increased rCBF in These rCBF changes were not correlated with anxiolytic effects [ 102]. In a SPECT study, by the same authors, in patients with SAD, CBD reduced rCBF in overlapping, but distinct, limbic and paralimbic areas; again, with no correlations to anxiolytic effects [ 104]. In a series of placebo-contr olled studies involving 15 healthy volunteers, Fusar-Poli et al. the effectsof CBD and THC on blood-oxygen-level imaging activation, spe- cifically the go/no-go and fearful faces tasks [ 109,110]. The go/no-go task measures response inhibition, and prefrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and parietal areas [ 111]. Response activation is diminished in PTSD and other anxiety disorders, and increased activation predicts response to treatment [ 112]. CBD produced no changes in predicted areas (relative to placebo) but reduced activation in the left insula, superior temporal gyrus, and trans- verse temporal gyrus. The fearful faces task activates the amygdala, and other medial temporal areas involved inCannabidiol as a Potential Treatment for Anxiety Disorders 831Table 2 Human psychological studies Study Subjects, designCBD route, doseMeasure Effect Karniol et al.

CBD attenuated blood-oxygen-level dependent activation in amygdala, and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex in response to intensely fearful faces, and also reduced amplitude in skin conductance fluctu-ation, which was highly correlated with amygdala activation [109]. Dynamic causal modeling analysis in this data set fur- ther showed CBD reduced forward functional connectivity between the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex [ 110]. Evidence from Epidemiological and Chronic Studies Epidemiological studies of various neuropsychiatric disorders indicate that a higher CBD content in chronically consumed cannabis may protect against adverse effects of THC, includ- ing psychotic symptoms, drug cravings, memory loss, andhippocampal gray matter loss [ 115-118] (reviewed in [ 119]). As THC acutely induces anxiety, this pattern may also beevident for chronic anxiety symptoms. Two studies were iden-tified, including an uncontrolled retrospective study in civilian patients with PTSD patients [ 120], and a case study in a pa- tient with severe sexual abuse-related PTSD [ 121], which showed that chronic cannabis use significantly reduces PTSDsymptoms; however, these studies did not include data on the THC:CBD ratio. Thus, overall, no outcome data are currentlyavailable regarding the chronic effects of CBD in the treat- ment of anxiety symptoms, nor do any data exist regarding the potential protective effects of CBD on anxiety potentially in-duced by chronic THC use. Summary and Clinical Relevance Evidence from human studies strongly supports the potential for CBD as a treatment for anxiety disorders: at oral dosesranging from 300 to 600 mg, CBD reduces experimentally induced anxiety in healthy controls, without affecting baseline anxiety levels, and reduces anxiety in patients with SAD.Limited results in healthy subjects also support the efficacy of CBD in acutely enhancing fear extinction, suggesting po- tential for the treatment of PTSD, or for enhancing cognitive behavioral therapy. Neuroimaging findings provide evidence of neurobiological targets that may underlie CBD 's anxiolytic effects, including reduced amygdala activation and altered medial prefrontal amygdala connectivity, although current findings are limited by small sample sizes, and a lack of inde-pendent replication. Further studies are also required to estab- lish whether chronic, in addition to acute CBD dosing is an- xiolytic in human. Also, clinical findings are currently limitedto SAD, whereas preclinical evidence suggests CBD 'sp o t e n - tial to treat multiple symptom domains relevant to GAD, PD,and, particularly, PTSD.Conclusions Preclinical evidence conclusively demonstrates CBD 'se f f i c a - cy in reducing anxiety behaviors relevant to multiple disor- ders, including PTSD, GAD, PD, OCD, and SAD, with a notable lack of anxiogenic effects. CBD 's anxiolytic actions appear to depend upon CB 1Rs and 5-HT 1ARs in several brain regions; however, investigation of additional receptor actionsmay reveal further mechanisms. Human experimental find-ings support preclinical findings, and also suggest a lack of anxiogenic effects, minimal sedative effects, and an excellent safety profile. Current preclinical and human findings mostlyinvolve acute CBD dosing in healthy subjects, so further stud- ies are required to establish whether chronic dosing of CBD has similar effects in relevant clinical populations. Overall,this review emphasizes the potential value and need for further study of CBD in the treatment of anxiety disorders.

Koppel1 Published online: 14 August 2015 #The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc. 2015 Abstract Cannabis has been used for many medicinal pur- poses, including management of spasms, dystonia, and dyski- nesias, with variable success. Its use for tetanus was described in the second century BCE, but the literature continues to include more case reports and surveys of its beneficial effects in managing symptoms of hyperkinetic movement disorders than randomized controlled trials, making evidence-based rec-ommendations difficult. This paper reviews clinical research using various formulations of cannabis (botanical products, oral preparations containing 9-tetrahydrocannabinol and/or cannabidiol) and currently available preparations in the USA (nabilone and dronabinol). This has been expanded from a recent systematic review of cannabis use in several neurologicconditions to include case reports and case series and results of anonymous surveys of patients using cannabis outside of medical settings, with the original evidence classificationsmarked for those papers that followed research protocols. De- spite overlap in some patients, dyskinesias will be treated sep- arately from dystonia and chorea; benefit was not establishedbeyond individual patients for these conditions. Tics, usually due to Tourettes, did respond to cannabis preparations. Side effects reported in the trials will be reviewed but those due torecreational use, including the dystonia that can be secondary to synthetic marijuana preparations, are outside the scope dC B 2R) are plentiful in the basal ganglia [ 1], implying they play a role in normal motor function and that pharmaceutical (or recreational) can-nabis formulations, which are agonists at both sites, might alleviate symptoms of movement disorders. CB 1Ra r e expressed in -aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons of the caudate and projec-tions to and from the cortex and the subthalamic In addition to GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways, dopami- inputs are also endocannabinoids. Ingeneral, the cannabinoid signals would be upregulated if a disease was marked by hypokinesis, such as in Parkinson disease (PD), as the cannabinoid ligands act overall to sup-press movement, and would be decreased in hyperkinetic movement disorders such as Huntington disease (HD). How- ever, paradoxical responses can occur during degeneration asthe receptors in various parts of the basal ganglia die (Table 1). The complexity of feedback loops in this region, with in- direct actions of the endocannabinoid system modulating oth- er inhibitory, excitatory or dopaminergic transmission, partial- ly explains this. In addition, in degenerative diseases such asHD and PD, progressive loss of specific structures, along with their endocannabinoid receptors occurs. The receptor loss will dampen any effects of CB 1/2Ra g o n i s t ss u c ha s 9-tetrahy- drocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). transient receptor poten- tial vannilloid-type 1, may be successfully stimulated in early*Barbara S.

In fact, CB 1R antagonists, similarly experimental at this stage, might be beneficial for hypokinetic symptoms such ashypokinesia in PD. Contradictory and confusing efficacy has been reported when cannabis medications (or smoked phytocannabinoids)are used to treat movement disorder symptoms [ 2,3]. Al- though the loss of receptors plays some role, more likely cur-rently available cannabis preparations, which contain differentamounts and combinations of cannabinoids (at least 60 have been described) with variable potency and psychoactive con- tent (present in 9-THC but not CBD) with different, usually low, doses, make standardized comparisons impossible. Scor- ing methods, other than counting individual tics or choreiform movements, add to the researcher 's difficulty in measuringefficacy. The potency, especially 9-THC content, is kept de- liberately low to limit side effects (or patient recognition in those experienced with marijuana), which contributes to treat- ment failure. Studies are small with problematic recruitment for a substance that will require limitation of activities such as driving, use of a stigmatized medication, and of short duration(sometimes single dose) to avoid abuse or addiction [ 4]. Even obtaining study drug status in the USA requires working withthe various government agencies, and is only becoming easierin the face of a serious epidemic of opiate overuse and toxicity. The Drug Enforcement Agency continues to classify medical cannabis as a Schedule I drug (that with no therapeutic use). Investigation into cannabis 'medicinal use began with promising case reports and anonymous surveys, followed bylimited clinical research often conducted outside the USA,Table 1 Cannabis formulations used in various movement disorders Generic name Trade name Use Dosage and component(s) Reference marijuana - Parkinson tremor and dyskinesias 1 cigarette 2.9 % twice daily 2.5 mg twice daily[5*,11] CBD or cannabis extract None Primary dystonias 10 mg/kg/day up to 75 mg/day 100 mg CBD[7,18*,23] y[6,8,9] Motor score no improvement, some in chorea and NPI1-2m g / d a y [ 23* ,24*] CBD or cannabis extract None 10 mg/kg/day, mean 700 mg [ 21*] Tourette syndrome Botanical smoked marijuana 0.5 -2.0 cigarettes/day One Bcone^/night survey (self-prescribed)[25-27] THC capsule Tics vocalizations 2.5 mg 9-THC, maximum 10 mg/day [ 28,29] If no evidence classification is indicated, it means it was class IV .

Although overlap exists in individuals, in this review dyskinesias, dystonia, and chorea will be consid-ered separately. Although tremor was studied in patients suf- fering from multiple sclerosis, there is no information on es- sential tremor. Tics will be considered separately, as the mech-anism differs. Dystonia Dystonia involves overactivity of muscles required for normalmovement, with extra force or activation of nearby but unnec- essary muscles, including those that should be turned off to facilitate movement, and is often painful in addition to inter-fering with function. It can be primary, as in torticollis and blepharospasm/orofacial dyskinesias or dystonias (Meige syn- drome) or as part of another condition such as HD and tardivedyskinesia after dopa-blocking drugs. The as neuromodulators and enhancing GABA re- lease and reducing its reuptake [ 5]. In 1981, Marsden described improvement in a patient with torticollis who smoked cannabis [ 6]. An open-label series followed [ 7], and self-reported improvement with smoking marijuana was described in 2002 in a patient with central painand dystonia and in a patient with Wilson disease [8 ,9]. Cannabidiol showed improvement of 20 -50 % by videotape review in 5 patients [ 9], but higher doses exacerbated tremor and hypokinesis in 2 patients with PD and levodopa-induceddystonia. Nabilone, a synthetic oral form of 9-THC, which is available in the USA for other indications, was not found to beeffective in 1 administration of escalating doses of 0.03 mg/kg using a dystonia rating scale; however, 3/15 patients felt better for several days after its use [ 10]. Another currently available oral form of 9-THC, dronabinol, did not improve symptoms of cervical dystonia, as demonstrated by the Toronto WesternHospital Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale in a 3-week treat-ment trial [ 5]. Finally, response to dronabinol 2.5 mg twice daily in a case report of dystonia (and tics) in a patient withmultiple sclerosis who had previously reported symptom im-provement after smoking marijuana [ 11]. Side effects described in these studies included hypoten- sion and sedation at higher doses of nabilone [ 10], insomnia and tachycardia from dronabinol [ 5], and hypokinesia and tremor of PD [ 10]. Dyskinesias from Levodopa (in Advanced PD) of indicate they must be playing a role in regulatingtone and motor function through the effect of the endogenous cannabinoid ligand, arachidonylethanolamide (anadamide), on modulation of GABA transmission [ 12]. Many studies have been done with primate or rat models to determine if cannabinoid agonists or antagonists could act to suppress dys- kinesias without exacerbating hypokinesis; however, transla-tion to patients has proved difficult. Since the initial observation in 1991 of no improvement of resting tremor in 5 patients who smoked one marijuana ciga-rette [ 13], surveys have been done asking patients with PD to say if they had tried marijuana on their own (presumably thesmoked botanical form) and if so with what effect. Venderovasent surveys to 630 patients attending a movement disorders clinic in Prague, and of the 339 respondents, 25 % had used marijuana. Of these 85 patients, 39 benefitted in rest tremor(31 %), bradykinesia (45 %), and dyskinesias (14 %), and continued its daily use [ 14]. A recent survey of Colorado residents with Parkinson using all types of complementary therapies found 9 using medical marijuana (4 %), reporting improvement of mood and sleep, but only 2 with improve- ment of motor symptoms, not specifically dyskinesias [ 15]. A small but class III randomized double-blind study using nabilone (synthetic 9-THC) showed a significant reduction in Rush score on levodopa-induced dyskinesias in 7 patients, observed and measured with the Rush dyskinesia scale [ 16], and 2 reported improvement in dystonia occurring in the off period for dopa. In a study of 17 patients using the oral prep- aration Cannador (2.5 mg 9-THC/1.25 mg CBD) no noted in dyskinesias as measured in Q32 -34 of the Unified Parkinson 's disease rating scale scale (the pri- mary outcome), or other scales including Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 scale, nor was there a dose response [ 17]. The study by Carrol et al. [ 17] was the only one considered class I for the purposes of evidence-based recommendations.Various doses of cannabidiol were given to 21 patients over6 weeks; no change was found in the total motor score, despite improvement in the quality of life section of the Unified Parkinson 's disease rating scale if the target dose of 300 mg daily was reached, which was possible in only 35 % of the patients [ 18]. Finally, an open- Blabel^study of smoked mari- juana in 22 Israeli patients showed improvement in the num- ber of dyskinesias observed after dopa challenge, 30 min after smoking the cigarette [ 19]. In an interesting twist, a single dose of the CB 1Rantagonist rimonabant (SR141716) was found to have no effect on motor symptoms, or induced dys-kinesias in 8 patients [ 20]. Side effects mentioned in the studies included hypotension, vertigo, hyperacusis, and disorientation and visual hallucina-tions dizziness and bad taste, with hypogly- cemia in 1 patient [ 19], and, rarely, bradykinesia, but in the few studies where it was measured [ 17], there was no effect on cognitive function as measured by Mini Mental State Exami- nation; in fact, an improv ement in Mini Mental State790 KoppelExamination was noted, which was attributed to a practice effect but may have been precognitive (the 4-week trial was too short to call cannabis neuroprotective). In summary in PD, the symptom that responded best to cannabis, levodopa-induced dyskinesias, is a fairly rare com-plication of dopamine replacement in advanced cases. Therole of cannabis in other symptoms of PD is unclear, and these symptoms vary according to the stage of neurodegeneration and also to the state of treatment with dopamine transmitterreplacement. As there is the potential of cannabis worsening some symptoms, especially hypokinesia, very careful research must be done with PD. Dyskinesias in HD Abnormalities of motor function, along with psychiatric andcognitive dysfunction, are a main feature of HD, a dominantlyinherited neurodegenerative disease. Cannabis products have been most often used to ameliorate agitation and other psychi- atric symptoms, but the presence of endocannibinoid recep-tors in the striatum, where they modulate GABA transmission and affect glutamate release, suggests a role for management of the excessive involuntary movements (choreoathetosis ordystonia) of HD. As in other degenerative processes, these receptors can decrease as the disease progresses, leaving less response to cannabinoid agonists as the brain 's substrate changes. Obviously, current or prior use of dopamine- blocking medication (neuroleptics), which can superimpose tardive dyskinesias on the direct movements of HD, will alsochange the therapeutic effects of cannabis. Consroe et al. [ 21] first reported the clinical use of CBD in HD in 1991. This class III study of 15 patients receiving can-nabis extract in capsule form (10 mg/kg), crossing to placebo over a 15-week period, off neuroleptics for at least 2 weeks, found no difference in the chorea severity score of Marsdenand Quinn, or on videotape and live assessment of chorea severity, nor on secondary end points of Shoulson and Fahn disability scores, finger tapping, or manipulation. Side effects,as checked off a symptom inventory, did not vary between placebo and treated patients. After a case report in a patient who had improved mood and movements after smoking mar-ijuana and then taking prescribed nabilone, 1 mg daily [ 22], the authors gave 1 or 2 mg of nabilone to 37 patients in a classII study [ 23]. Despite improvement in the secondary measures of neuropsychiatric index and chorea score, the primary out-come, total motor score of the Unified Huntingdon DiseaseRating Scale, showed only a modest response, with no dose response (i.e., 2 mg was not better than 1 mg). Drowsiness and forgetfulness were the main reported ad- verse events in both groups, with no increase in psychosis oreuphoria in the treated group. In 1 case nabilone actually caused increased chorea [ 24].Tourette Syndrome Tics As in any condition influenced by anxiety, a nonspecific ben-eficial effect of cannabis might be expected, but given the presence of endocannibinoid receptors in the striatum, it is possible that a direct effect of cannabis is reducing the numberof tics. Success in treating symptoms of Tourette sydrome, including involuntary movements (tics) and compulsivebehaviors, was first mentioned in an observation of 3 patients who, in 1988, noted improvement in tics and urges while smoking marijuana cigarettes [ 25], followed by another case of a patient remaining symptom free for a year while smoking marijuana daily [ 26]. In 1998 a survey of a larger population confirmed a reduction in tic or complete remission in 82 % of patients [ 27]. The same authors used 9-THC capsules of varying strengths in a single dose in 12 patients (class II study)and reported improvement in scores of the Tourette Syndrome Symptom List and obsessive -compulsive be- havior scores, with a decreased number of complex mo- tor tics observed by the examiner [ 28]. The following year, in a study of 24 patients using the maximum-strength 9-THC capsule from the pilot study (10 mg) for 6 weeks, a significant response in self-rated Tourettescore and observer-rated scores, including the TouretteSyndrome Clinical Global Impression Scale, the Shapiro Tourette Syndrome Severity Scale, and the Yal Global Tic Severity Scale, as well as the review of video, wasnoted [ 29]. These were then summarized in a Cochrane review [30 ]. Little additional work was summarized in a more recent review [31 ]. Of note, improvements oc- curred without exacerbating performance on neuropsychologic testing [ 32]. Side effects were minimized by a simple technique of pro- viding dronabinol after breakfast in order to slow its absorp-tion and provide a steady level acting in the brain [ 29]. Conclusions Although clinical studies in this area are difficult to do, even in countries where the use of cannabis has been allowed for years, there is a clear role for cannabis prod- ucts in symptom management for these difficult condi- tions. The movement disorders are well-known to be worsened in patients who are anxious, but the carefulobservations reviewed above lead to the conclusion that there is a direct effect of cannabis in various formula- tions in some conditions, especially hyperkinetic symp-toms. Caution in using a potential central nervous system depressant is always required in patients whose neuro- logic function is already c ompromised by disease, butCannabis use in movement disorders 791larger studies will prove there is a promising role for this class of drug in the therapy of dyskinesias, tics, and possibly dystonia.

Fourteen states allow physicians to recommend marijuana or provide a legal defense for patients and physicians if prosecuted in state courts; however, little is known about those individuals using marijuana for medicinal purposes and the symptoms they use it for. This study provides descriptive information from 1,655 patients seeking a physician's recommendation for medical marijuana, the conditions for which they seek treatment, and the diagnoses made by the physicians. It conducts a systematic analysis of physician records and patient questionnaires obtained from consecutive patients being seen during a three month period at nine medical marijuana evaluation clinics belonging to a select medical group operating throughout the State of California. While this study is not representative of all medical marijuana users in California, it provides novel insights about an important population being affected by this policy. I. INTRODUCTION As of December 2010, 15 states and the District of Columbia provide allowances for medical marijuana (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2010).1 There is a small literature about whether these laws influence the overall demand for marijuana (Gorman and Charles, 2007; Pacula et al., 2010), and a tremendous amount of discussion about how medicinal marijuana is distributed, especially in California (see e.g., Hoeffel, 2010a; 2010b). What remains largely missing from the literature and policy discussions is a good understanding of the individuals who seek a medical allowance for marijuana. This paper helps fill this gap by systematically evaluating the characteristics, ailments, and medical histories of a large group of applicants seeking a medicinal marijuana recommendation. Data are collected from medical charts and doctor interviews with 1,655 individuals seen in June, July and August of 2006 from nine medical marijuana specialty practices dispersed throughout California. The results provide some interesting insights as to the characteristics of those seeking medicinal allowances nearly a decade after the policy was introduced in California. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly review the literature on the therapeutic value of cannabinoids, provide details of the specific allowances provided for within California state law, and review previously published surveys of populations of medical marijuana users. In Section 3 we discuss the methods that were used in the current study, including our data collection procedures, and in Section 4 we present 1This excludes Maryland. While Maryland does allow those arrested for marijuana possession to use a medical necessity defense, those found to be using for medical purposes are still convicted and can be fined up to $100.

BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW Research on the therapeutic value of cannabinoids Cannabinoids are compounds related to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) found in the cannabis plant (phytocannabinoids), in animals (endocannabinoids), and synthesized in laboratories (e.g., THC analogues, cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists) (Pertwee, 2006). Cannabinoid receptors are found in all animals; in humans, cannabinoid receptors are concentrated in the brain but are also found in other parts of the body. The use of cannabis as a medicine originated thousands of years ago. After being introduced to the West in the mid-nineteenth century, cannabis-based medicines were popular through the early decades of the twentieth century (Grinspoon, 2005; Zuardi, 2006). The virtual disappearance of cannabis-based medicines by the mid-1900s was due to the introduction of new pharmaceuticals (e.g., aspirin, chloral hydrate, barbiturates) for the same conditions, such as pain, migraines, menstrual cramps, and sedation, as well as the legal restrictions associated with the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act (Fankhauser, 2002; Grinspoon). The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) 1999 report Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base , concluded that \u00aaScientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs, primarily THC, for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation; smoked marijuana, however, is a crude THC delivery system that also delivers harmful substances\u00ba (4). The report further noted that, \u00aaFor the most part, the logical categories for the medical use of marijuana are not based on particular diseases but on symptoms\u00bc[that] can be caused by various diseases or even by treatments for diseases\u00ba (IOM, 1999; pp. 137\u00b1138). Based on these findings, the panel recommended that \u00aaclinical trials of cannabinoid drugs for symptom management should be conducted with the goal of developing rapid-onset, reliable, and safe delivery systems\u00ba (4). In addition to focusing on pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation, the IOM report also called recommended that clinical trials focus on the suitability of cannabinoid drugs to address anxiety reduction and sedation. Reviews published since the IOM report also highlight the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs; however, few of the studies focus on inhaled marijuana. A review of 72 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies from 1975 to 2004 evaluating the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids concludes that \u00aaCannabinoids present an interesting therapeutic potential as antiemetics, appetite stimulants in debilitating diseases (cancer and AIDS), analgesics, and in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy and glaucoma\u00ba (Ben Amar, 2006). A more recent review focusing on clinical studies published from 2005 to 2009 (Hazekamp and Grotenhermen, 2010) concluded that cannabinoids have \u00aatherapeutic potential mainly as analgesics in chronic neuropathic pain, appetite stimulants in debilitating diseases (cancer and AIDS), as well as in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.\u00ba For both reviews, a minority of the trials evaluated inhaled marijuana (six and eight studies, respectively). The others used a synthetic THC isomer or analog for oral administration, or plant extract in oral or sublingual preparations.2 2Hazekamp and Grotenhermen included recent studies of nabilone, a prescription drug that is a THC analog. Skrabek et al. (2008) performed a randomized, controlled trial to assess the benefit of nabilone on pain reduction and quality of life improvement in patients with fibromyalgia. They found significant decreases in pain and anxiety. Similarly, Ware et al. (2010) concluded that nabilone \u00aais effective in improving sleep in patients with fibromyalgia and is well tolerated.\u00ba Finally, in a more recent observational study (Bestard and Toth, 2010), nabilone was found to be as effective as gabapentin, a first line medication for peripheral neuropathy, in measures of pain, sleep, depression and anxiety.Nunberg et al. Page 2 J Drug Policy Anal . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptIn February 2010, the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research (CMCR) at the University of California San Diego submitted a report to the Legislature and Governor of California describing five completed clinical trials with inhaled marijuana (Grant et al., 2010). Four demonstrated pain relief effects in conditions secondary to injury or disease of the nervous system (Abrams et al., 2007; Wallace et al., 2007; Wilsey et al., 2008; Ellis et al., 2009), and one suggested a reduction of spasticity in multiple sclerosis (Corey-Bloom et al., 2008). Medicinal Marijuana in California In California, patients with a physician's recommendation, along with their designated caregivers and recommending physicians, are exempted from state criminal laws against marijuana. Although provision and use remain illegal under federal law, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder made a statement in March 2009 suggesting that the federal government would not target those who complied with state medical marijuana laws. This was made more official in an October 2009 memo to U.S. Attorneys which noted that: \u00aaAs a general matter, pursuit of these priorities should not focus federal resources in your States on individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana.\u00ba The California medical marijuana law, passed through voter referendum (Proposition 215) in 1996, permits the use of marijuana for \u00aacancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief\u00ba [emphasis added]. California Senate Bill 420, signed into law on October 12, 2003, named additional ailments such as severe nausea, cachexia, seizures, and persistent muscle spasms (regardless of whether they are associated with multiple sclerosis). In an effort to provide better guidance to law enforcement agencies, SB 420 allowed patients and primary caregivers to possess up to six mature plants (or 12 immature plants) and eight ounces of marijuana; however, it granted local governments the authority to establish larger maximum quantities. Many of the early studies about medicinal marijuana users in California focused on individuals with HIV or AIDS (e.g., Harris et al., 2000; Sidney, 2001; de Jong et al., 2005; Prentiss et al., 2004). Based on analyses of several unpublished surveys of clients entering cannabis buyer clubs in the San Francisco Bay Area, Gieringer (2002) found that the share of clients that were AIDS and cancer patients declined after the passage of Proposition 215. More recent research in California shows that medicinal marijuana patients are largely men who present with pain and/or emotional/mental health concerns (O'Connell and Bou-Matar, 2007; Reiman, 2007; Reiman, 2009). An informal survey of several California medical marijuana specialty physicians revealed that more than 95% of the pateints of each physician were already \u00aaself-medicating\u00ba prior to the receipt of their recommendation, leading Mikuriya et al. (2007) to conclude that the physicians were really \u00aaapproving\u00ba the medical use of marijuana as opposed to \u00aarecommending\u00ba it. III. DATA AND METHODS The data used in this study come from medical records of 1,745 applicants consecutively presenting to one of nine MediCann clinics located in large and small cities throughout California.3 The sample is based on visits in June, July, and August 2006, roughly ten years after the original law was enacted. Medical charts were reviewed and data entered within a few weeks of the visit. Our final sample excludes 90 individuals who are either missing diagnosis information (N=35) or did not report using marijuana before seeking a 3Since 2006, MediCann has expanded to 21 locations throughout California.Nunberg et al. Page 3 J Drug Policy Anal . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptrecommendation (N=55).4 There are no statistically significant differences in terms of age, race/ethnicity, and gender between those included and excluded in the analysis sample. We drew on consecutive visits from all nine clinics in hopes of approximating a representative sample of applicants seeking recommendations at these medical marijuana specialty practices. The sample is not generalizable to all individuals applying for a medical marijuana recommendation as it only represents those individuals selecting this particular network of physicians. In general, the MediCann policy was to provide a 12-month recommendation to those with an acceptable medical condition who had supporting medical record documentation.5 Those without medical record documentation received a provisional three-month recommendation conditional upon them providing the MediCann physician with a copy of the relevant supporting medical record, or, if not currently under the care of a medical professional, seeking care and providing those records. Applicants were only denied if they did not report having an eligible medical condition or if they refused to be under the care of a medical professional. For our sample the denial rate was less than 2%. MediCann's medical records include two standard forms specifically created for MediCann. One form is filled out by the applicant and includes demographic information, medical history, and marijuana use history. The second form is filled out by the evaluating physician and contains clinical information related to the health problem and symptoms for which the applicant is seeking help. Clinic physicians relied on medical histories, physical exams, and the supporting medical documents when they assigned diagnoses. The supporting medical documents included laboratory and radiological evaluations to validate applicant claims of use of marijuana for relief of symptoms due to a medical condition. Over two-thirds of applicants (67.8%) brought medical record documentation with them at the time of the visits analyzed in our study. In light of the limited information on this population of interest, we examine simple means or sample proportions for several variables of interest, including patient characteristics and stated therapeutic needs, physician diagnoses, and medical history. Results are provided for the entire sample and then broken down by gender. IV. RESULTS Applicant Characteristics Applicant demographic information is shown in Table 1 both for the full sample and by gender, since almost 73% of the applicants seeking a recommendation were male. This is not much different than the share of those in the 2006 National Household Survey on Drug Use and Health who reported purchasing marijuana in the previous month (70%). Female applicants seeking recommendations were, on average, older and more likely than men to be African American, have some college education, have Medicaid (MediCal) health insurance, or to be unemployed and disabled (19.5% of women reported being unemployed due to disability). In general, those seeking recommendations were insured (73.0% currently insured, of whom 24.2% were covered through Medicare or Medicaid), have at least a high school degree (only 8.8% have less than a high school degree), and are generally employed (68.7%). 4While in many ways the applicants who report not using marijuana prior to seeking this recommendation are perhaps the most interesting, there are an insufficient number of these individuals in our sample for robust comparisons.5Qualifying patients would be given a recommendation and would be reassessed periodically to review the course of treatment and any new information about their health, as well as to monitor response to treatment as indicated by a decrease in symptoms, an increase in level of function, or an improvement in quality of life.Nunberg et al. Page 4 J Drug Policy Anal . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptAs for the age distribution, at least half of the population seeking medical recommendations through this physician group was over the age of 35. For comparison, the median age for those 18 and older in the 2006 NSDUH who reported purchasing marijuana in the previous month was in the 26\u00b129 year old category (those over 21 are placed into age categories). Applicants' Self Reports of the Therapeutic Benefits of Marijuana In light of the IOM's argument that the \u00aalogical categories for the medical use of marijuana are not based on particular diseases but on symptoms (IOM; pp. 137\u00b1138), we examined the self-reported therapeutic benefit received from marijuana and the symptoms it helped relieve. Applicants were asked \u00aaWhich of the following best describe the therapeutic benefit you receive from medicinal cannabis? (Check the most important reasons you use cannabis.)\u00ba The results are presented in Table 2. Applicants most frequently reported using medical marijuana for pain relief (82.6%), improved sleep (70.6%), and relaxation (55.6%). The next most frequently reported benefits included relief of muscle spasms (41.3%), headache (40.8%), relief of anxiety (38.1%), improved appetite (38.0%), relief of nausea and vomiting (27.7%), and relief of depression (26.1%). Half the applicants (50.8%) reported using marijuana as a substitute for prescription medication and 13.2% reported using marijuana as a substitute for alcohol. Interestingly, women were statistically more likely than men to report that they used marijuana to relieve most of the indications listed, including headaches, anxiety, nausea, depression, panic, and medication side-effects. The only indication for which men were more likely than women to report use of marijuana was to help with focus. One in four men reported that marijuana improved focus. Physician Diagnosis Table 3 presents the highest frequency diagnoses and the diagnoses specifically listed in the Compassionate Use Act. Recall that treating physicians make their diagnoses based on a review of applicant's history, the medical records from treating physicians (in two-thirds of the cases), and on their own physical examination. Evaluating physicians were then asked to \u00aacircle only diagnoses related to patient's medicinal marijuana use\u00ba from a list of 162diagnoses. In general, chronic pain disorders were the most common diagnoses made by physicians, with nearly 60 percent (58.2%) of applicants being diagnosed with some sort of musculoskeletal or neuropathic chronic pain condition. Low back pain was diagnosed for over one quarter (26.2%) of patients seen during this three month period, with lumbar and cervical degenerative disc disease (together 21.8%) and arthritis (18%) the next most common diagnoses in the chronic pain group. Mental health disorders were the next largest group of diagnoses made (22.9%), followed closely by sleep disorders (21.3%). Diagnoses in the grouping \u00aaneurological disorders,\u00ba including migraine and other headache, were made in 16.6% of applicants. Only 3% of the applicants were diagnosed with either cancer or HIV/AIDS. Previous Treatments and Physician's Recommendations for Additional Treatment Because self-reported information was collected from applicants and most provided medical documentation from their treating physician that could be reviewed by the evaluating physician, it was possible to consider the extent to which previous therapies had been used to cope with or treat the primary symptoms for which they were seeking a medical allowance. In Table 4 we provide a list of therapies or approaches that were previously tried or currently being used. Almost half of the applicants (47.6%) reported taking prescriptionNunberg et al. Page 5 J Drug Policy Anal . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptmedication at the time of their evaluation, and nearly 4 out of 5 (79.5%) reported having taken prescription medication in the past for their problems. As chronic pain was the leading diagnosis for which marijuana was being recommended, we were curious to see what percent of applicants had used opioids or opiate medication to deal with their problem. On the physician evaluation form, evaluating physicians were asked to check yes or no if the applicant was currently using or had used in the past opioids or opiate medication prescribed by another physician for their chronic pain. Evaluating physicians determined that almost half of all applicants (48.0%) experiencing chronic pain either currently or in the past had been prescribed opioids or opiate medication. Non-prescription therapies tried by applicants seeking medicinal marijuana allowances included physical therapy (48.6%), chiropractic services (37.2%), surgery (21.9%), psychological counseling (20.7%), and acupuncture (19.6%). Thus, these data do not suggest that applicants immediately seek marijuana recommendations as the first strategy to deal with their symptoms. In many cases, these individuals tried more traditional forms of medicine. V. DISCUSSION This study provides descriptive information from 1,655 applicants seeking a physician's recommendation for medical marijuana in California, the conditions for which they sought treatment, and the diagnoses made by the physicians. The most common diagnoses reported were for chronic pain, mental health conditions (primarily anxiety and depression), and sleep disorders (insomnia). For physicians who make medical marijuana recommendations, the risk of being deceived is not dissimilar to the risk of deception faced by those who prescribe oxycodone and other painkillers; however, those prescribing the latter can limit the number of pills and refills.6 For medical marijuana, existing laws and policies only allow physicians to distribute recommendations, they cannot control the number of purchases, what is purchased (e.g., % THC or other cannabinoid content), where it is purchased, or the route of administration (e.g., inhale smoke or vapor, ingest an edible, apply topically). The majority of applicants reported that they tried other therapies, including prescription drugs, to manage their symptoms prior to seeking the medicinal allowance. Fifty percent of the sample reported that they used marijuana as a substitute for prescription medicine. This is consistent with other studies (e.g., Reiman, 2007; 2009) and raises important questions about the specific drugs they are replacing. Future research with this population should focus on previous and concurrent prescription medication use to examine claims that marijuana enables people to reduce or eliminate their use of prescription medications. These data could also be useful for understanding whether there could be cost-savings associated with substituting certain prescription medicines with marijuana. This also raises the issue about whether the legalization of marijuana for non-medicinal purposes would influence the consumption of prescription drugs. Not only would legalization increase availability and reduce the price of marijuana (Kilmer et al., 2010), but the reduced stigma may increase the likelihood that some individuals try it for medicinal purposes. It could also be the case that doctors may be more willing to discuss marijuana use with patients if it was not prohibited. Less than 5% of the applicants in our sample were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or glaucoma. While these were not the only diseases/conditions discussed when Proposition 6However, doctors prescribing oxycodone cannot prevent patients from crushing the pill to deactivate the time-release functionality and then snorting or injecting it.Nunberg et al. Page 6 J Drug Policy Anal . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 June Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript215 was on the ballot, they did receive a lot of attention. This is not surprising; we would expect the number of applicants presenting with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or glaucoma to be relatively low compared to the number presenting with pain, anxiety, and insomnia, due to the relative prevalence of these conditions in the general population. However, it is also important to note that many of those receiving recommendations did so for conditions other than those listed by the IOM (pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation). Finally, the age profile observed in the sample of applicants is intriguing, especially when compared with those who report purchasing marijuana in the previous month in the 2006 NSDUH. One should not assume the larger median age for these applicants is statistically meaningful in light of the potential non-representativeness of our sample and the fact that it is drawn exclusively from California. However, if these age differences appear in future studies, it could offer important insights about age-related risk aversion and/or age-specific access to distribution networks\u00d0each with different policy implications. Thus, future work should explore the robustness of these differences and consider their implications for policy. We conclude by reminding readers that we did not examine randomly-selected representative sample of all individuals in California seeking a medical recommendation for the use of marijuana. We were merely able to collect data from a sample of individuals who presented themselves within a three month window to a group of doctors that they most likely expected would be willing to provide them with a recommendation. The applicants receiving recommendations from these doctors may differ from those in the general population in important ways that we are unable to know. As applicants receiving physician recommendations are not required by law to register with county or state health officials, we have no way of knowing the extent to which the population served by this particular physician group might differ from that served by other medical marijuana specialists or by primary care physicians. Knowledge about the number and type of individuals that receive recommendations from other specialists or from primary care physicians would improve our understanding medical marijuana users in California. Since California law allows for medical marijuana use for any \u00aaillness for which marijuana provides relief,\u00ba we have an enormous opportunity to further our understanding of the risks and benefits of marijuana with careful questioning of some of the thousands of patients willing to discuss their use of marijuana. Detailed information about the doses, frequency, methods, and forms of marijuana consumed, as well as information about past and present alcohol, illicit drug, and prescription drug consumption would be of great interest.

Improvement in Refractory Obsessive Compulsive Disorder With Dronabinol TO THE EDITOR : It has been reported that 40%-60% of pa- tients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not re- spond to first-line treatment. Treatment options for these pa- tients include switching to another agent or augmentation(1). We report on two patients with treatment-resistant OCD and comorbid axis I disorders who responded to an augmen- tation with the cannabinoid dronabinol.\"Mrs. L\" was a 38-year-old woman who was admitted with recurrent major depression and OCD (Yale-Brown Ob- sessive Compulsive Scale score: 20) after outpatient treat- ment with paroxetine (60 mg) for 8 months and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) were not efficacious. Switching to clomipramine (300 mg) resulted in partial response af- ter 12 weeks of treatment. Based on the patient's report that smoking marijuana usually relieved her symptoms, an augmentation with dronabinol (2.5%; 10 mg t.i.d.) was started. The prior medication was continued. While un- dergoing treatment with dron abinol (2.5%), the patient's OCD symptoms significantly (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score: 10). \"Mr. K\" was a 36-year-old man with schizophrenia and OCD who was admitted for deterioration of psychotic and obsessive symptoms (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score: 23). During his course of illness, Mr. K had been treated with antipsychotics (including haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole), combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. His OCD symptoms in par- ticular remained predominately treatment resistant. Treatment with clozapine (400 mg), which he had already received for more than 1 year (in combination with parox- etine [60 mg] for 13 weeks) resulted only in partial re- sponse of his psychotic and OCD symptoms. Switching par- oxetine to clomipramine (for another 10 weeks), followedby an additional course of 18 electroconvulsive therapy treatments (right unilateral high dose), did not improve the patient's psychotic or OCD symptoms significantly. Af- ter the addition of dronabin ol to ongoing treatment with clomipramine (150 mg) and clozapine (400 mg), a signifi- cant reduction of OCD symptoms was observed within 2 weeks (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score: 15). In order to prevent psychotic deterioration, dronabinol (2.5%) was carefully increased to 10 mg b.i.d. Apart from anticholinergic symptoms that preceded the addition of dronabinol (patient 1: dry mouth, constipa- tion; patient 2: constipation, hypotension), both patients reported no side effects. In particular, there was no dete- rioration of psychotic or mood disorder symptoms. Based on data from case reports and small clinical trials suggesting that cannabinoids can reduce symptoms of tic dis- order (2) and on findings from genetic studies linking tic dis-order with OCD (3), we hypothesized that cannabinoidsFIGURE 1.

Moreover, there is evi- dence suggesting that besides serotonergic and dopaminer- gic systems, glutamatergic hyperactivity is involved in thepathophysiology of OCD (4, 5). This view is supported by data suggesting the efficacy of glutamate modulating drugs, such as topiramate, memantine, riluzole, or N-acetylcysteine, inthe treatment of OCD has been reported that canna- binoids inhibit glutamate release in the CNS (7, 8). Addition- ally, cannabinoid type 1 (CB 1) receptors are distributed abun- dantly in the striatum (8), a brain region frequently associated with OCD. Hence, it can be speculated that the anti-obsessive effect observed in our patients may have been a consequenceof the glutamate modulation of the cannabinoid dronabinol. Since it is well known that cannabinoids may trigger psy- chotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (8), cautionis warranted when prescribing for patients with a history of the disorder.

Maintenance Treatment With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in a Patient With Late-Onset Schizophrenia TO THE EDITOR : A recent meta-analysis (1) concluded that re- petitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) efficiently reduces resistant auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia (effect size=0.76). Nevertheless, treatment ispresently only provided over short periods of time, and little is known about longer-term impact. Maintenance treatmentprotocols have been developed, and we previously describeda case report involving a maintenance protocol with a weekly, once-a-day stimulation (2); however, we failed to demon- strate long-term benefits. To our knowledge, the case pre-sented below is the first report of a twice-daily transcranial magnetic stimulation as efficacious for auditory hallucina- tions, both in acute and maintenance treatment. 55-year-old right-handed, postmenopausal woman who had DSM-IV late-onset schizophrenia with anillness duration of 2 years, was referred for transcranialmagnetic stimulation treatment. She was noted to havebenzodiazepine addiction involving the use of lorazepam(9 mg/day). She had been suffering from resistant audi-tory hallucinations for 2 years (very frequent and loud,with >5 critical and command voices). She was unrespon- sive to four antipsychotic medication trials lasting >4 haloperidol (15 mg/day), (8 mg/day). A detailed assessment did not revealany other pathology or transcranial magnetic stimulationcontraindications. Auditory hallucinations were assessedusing the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (3), and pos-itive symptoms were assessed using the Scale for the As-sessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS). Lorazepam with- drawal was completed exacerbation of the psychotic symptoms (Auditory Hallucination Rating Scalescore: 34). Four months after her initial presentation, thepatient gave informed consent and was included in atranscranial magnetic stimulation protocol. Twice-a-day,1000 low-frequency repetitive 5-day period. patient's cur-rent dose of risperidone was maintained during treat-ment with transcranial magnetic stimulation. After thefirst course, auditory hallucinations were moderately im-proved, with a 35% reduction in her Auditory Hallucina-tion Rating Scale score, which did not change over thenext several months, as observed in a follow-up assess-ment. However, the patient's general SAPS score im-proved, with a 30% reduction in severity. Six months after the first course of transcranial mag- netic stimulation therapy, the patient presented with arelapse of hallucinations. A new transcranial magneticstimulation course, with the same parameters, was con-ducted. This second course was followed by a once-per-month, twice-daily maintenance protocol (one session inthe morning, the other in the afternoon on the same day).The patient's auditory hallucinations were greatly im-proved, by 80%, and her SAPS score decreased from 38 to16. This maintenance course was associated with a remis- sion of auditory hallucination symptoms, with a stabiliza- tion of SAPS scores at 10 over the next 6 months. Pres-ently, more than 1 year later, Ms. A is not receiving anyantipsychotic medication, and her Auditory HallucinationRating Scale and SAPS scores remain at 0. Our case raises the question as to whether twice-daily transcranial magnetic stimulation may be useful in some pa-tients as a possible maintenance intervention. Certainly, fur-ther research will help us to understand whether the benefits observed in this single case might also be evident in larger studies.RESEARCH ARTICLE The Relationship between Bipolar Disorder and Cannabis Use in Daily Life: An ExperienceSampling Study Carter3, Christine Barrowclough2 1The Spectrum Centre for Mental Health Research, Division of Health Research Lancaster University, Lancaster, Lancashire, United Kingdom, 2School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom, 3Health Methodology Research Group, School of Community Based Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom *e.tyler@lancaster.ac.uk Abstract Objectives Although cannabis use is common in bipolar disorder and may contribute to worse clinical outcomes, little is understood about the relationship between this drug and bipolar disorderover the course of daily life. The aim of study was to examine the effect of cannabis on affectand bipolar symptoms in a group of individuals with bipolar disorder. Methods Twenty-four participants with bipolar disorder type I or type II completed diaries for 6 daysusing Experience Sampling Methodology to investigate the temporal associations betweencannabis, affect and bipolar disorder symptoms. Results The results indicated that higher levels of positive affect increase the odds of using cannabis(OR:1.25 ,CI:1.06 -1.47, P=0.008). However, neither negative affect, manic nor depressive symptoms predicted the use of cannabis. Cannabis use was associated with subsequentincreases in = 0.17,CI:0.04-0.29, P=0.008). Conclusion The findings indicate that cannabis use is associated with a number of subsequent psycho- logical effects. However there was no evidence that individuals with BD were using canna-bis to self-medicate minor fluctuations in negative affect or bipolar disorder symptoms overthe course of daily life. The findings in relation to existing literature and clinical implicationsare discussed.

Estimates of current use range from 8% to 22% and lifetime use from 30% to 64% [ 4]. Cannabis use in BD is associated with poorer outcomes, including increased symptom severity[5] and poorer treatment compliance [ 5,6]. A recent study found that individuals who were di- agnosed with BD and a co-occurring cannabis disorder had a younger age of BD onset and an increased number of manic, hypomanic and depressive episodes per year [ 7]. Specific reasons for the high levels of cannabis use in BD remain equivocal and are not yet fully understood. Whilst there have been a number of reviews reporting on the co-occurrence of substance use and BD [ 8] few studies have focused specifically on the relationship between cannabis use and BD [ 7]. Prospective cohort studies [ 9,10,11] have found evidence to suggest that cannabis use be- gins prior to bipolar onset, which might suggest a causal role in the development of BD. How- ever there is also evidence to suggest that for some, cannabis use commences following theonset of manic symptoms [ 12]. Self-report literature including case histories [ 13,14] and quali- tative interviews [ 15] suggests that individuals with BD use cannabis as a form of self- medication to alleviate manic symptoms [ 13,15] and to relieve depression [ 14]. These findings [13,14,15] are consistent with the proposal of Ashton et al [ 16] that the key consitutents of cannabis, 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), can have both sedative and antidepressant effects. Therefore whilst manic, individuals may use cannabis for the sedativeeffects and when depressed for the anti-depressive effects. As with BD, rates of cannabis use in individuals with psychosis are high [ 17,18] and there is no single model available which fully explains this co morbidity [ 19]. A recent study [ 20] used the experience sampling method (ESM) to provide further insight into the complicated dynam-ics of cannabis use and its effect on individuals with psychosis, in the context of daily life. Hen- quet et al [ 20] found that cannabis use predicted an increase in positive affect in both individuals with psychosis and a non-clinical control group. Cannabis use also predicted a de-crease in negative affect and an increase in the number of hallucinatory experiences in the psy- chosis group alone. They found no evidence to support the self-medication hypothesis as neither psychotic experiences or mood was found to predict cannabis use. The current studywas similarly designed using ESM to allow a close investigation into BD and cannabis use over the course of daily life and to aid further understanding of this seemingly complex relationship. ESM is a structured diary method where individuals are asked to report their thoughts, feel- ings and symptoms over the course of daily life. ESM was pioneered in mental health research byresearchers at the University of Maastricht [ 21,22]. The methodology offers a number of advan- tages in comparison to traditional assessments of mental health experiences [ 23,24], which rely on using retrospective data, and may be open to recall bias. With ESM, the short space betweenan event occurring and reporting of the details reduces the possibility of memory bias [ 25]. ESM examines phenomena in the real world as they occur and therefore has a high level of ecological validity. It provides a rich and descriptive data set, detailing a participant ' s daily experience and has the capacity to assess the temporal relationship between numerous variables [ 24]. ESM has previously been used to investigate the perception of daily 'hassles 'and 'uplifts 'in individuals with BD [ 26]. The study found that individuals who had more previous depressive episodes and current depressive symptoms experienced negative events as more stressful [ 30]. Furthermore, Knowles et al [ 27] used a diary method, where individuals with remitted BD or remitted unipolar depression plus a non-clinical sample reported on self-esteem and positiveand negative affect twice a day, over the course of a week. The study reported instability of self-esteem and affect in the remitted BD individuals compared to both other groups.

The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis,decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.To the authors knowledge there are no published studies that have used ESM to examine the relationship between BD and cannabis use. Therefore the current study aimed to provide an investigation into the associations between cannabis use, positive affect, negative affect andBD symptoms (mania and depression) in individuals with BD in daily life over a six day period,and to test two key predictions suggested in the literature outlined above: 1]. frequency of cannabis use will increase as a function of affect and BD symptom change (i.e. self medication effects) 2]. cannabis use will be associated with subsequent changes in affect and BD symptoms Materials and Methods Ethics statement Full ethical approval for the study was obtained from Liverpool National Research Ethics Ser- vice (NRES) Committee and the University of Manchester research ethics committee. Written,informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study. Participants Twenty-nine participants were recruited for the study from a number of sources. These includ-ed four mental health trusts in the North-West of England, self-help organisations (Bipolar UKand Mood Swings Network) and self-referral from the online University of Manchester re- search volunteering website ( http://www.studentnet.manchester.ac.uk/volunteer/ ). All individuals met criteria for BD-I or BD-II, as determined by the Structured Clinical In- terview for Axis I Disorders (SCID) based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria [ 28]. Current symptomatology was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [ 29] and the Bech Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale [ 30]. Substance use disorders were assessed using the sub- stance use module of the SCID [ 28]. To be included, participants were required to report using cannabis on at least two occasions per week (in at least half the weeks in the 3 months prior to assessment). Exclusion criteria for the study included meeting criteria for a current episode of mania or depression (if currently met criteria they were kept on a waiting list until out of epi-sode, except for those who remained unwell throughout the recruitment period), aged below 18, evidence of an organic brain disease or moderate/severe learning disability. Experience sampling method and procedure At the beginning of this study, participants were given a paper diary and a digital wristwatch. In accordance with previous research [ 31,32], the ESM period lasted for six consecutive days and the watch emitted a signal on ten occasions throughout the day at unpredictable times, be- tween the hours of 8am and 10pm. Each time participants heard the beep they were required to fill out a page of the diary. The diary consisted of questions on thoughts, affect, BD symptomatology, contextual information regarding their current situation and substance use. Participants were required to fill out thediary within 15 minutes of hearing the beep and to record the time of completion. Any entriescompleted outside this time frame were excluded from analyses. Previous research has demonstrated that entries completed after the 15 minutes are less reliable and valid [ 22]. A minimum of 20 valid diary reports were required by each participant, to ensure the data wasrepresentative [ 24]. During the initial visit informed consent was gained from the participant and the SCID [28], Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [ 29] and the Beck Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale Bipolar Disorder and Cannabis Use in Daily Life PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0118916 March 4, 2015 3/1 5[30] were completed. Where all inclusion criteria were met, a second visit was arranged, one day prior to the ESM period. During the second visit, the participant was introduced to the watch and paper diary and briefed about the study. The general procedure described above wasexplained in detail. On the seventh day a final meeting was arranged to collect the watches anddiaries and debrief the participant. Measures The ESM diary \u2014affect items Current affect was assessed using ten items, rated on a 7-point Likert scale (where 1 = 'not at all'and 7 = 'very much so '). In previous ESM studies [ 20,31,33], with individuals with psycho- sis and healthy controls, a positive and negative affect scale was identified using a factor analy-sis on the raw-within participant scores for the affect items (N = 10). A principal componentsanalysis for this study was conducted and like the similar studies [ 20,31,33] revealed two sepa- rate scales. The items 'cheerful 'lonely ','anxious ','irritated the negative affect scale ( /= 0.82). This analysis yielded similar results to other ESM studies. Henquet et al [20] reported a positive affect scale ( /= 0.89) and a negative affect scale ( /= 0.80). The mean scores for each scale were used in the analyses. The ESM diary \u2014BD Symptoms Current BD symptomatology (mania and depression) was assessed using 7 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale. The items were formulated by the authors (SJ, CB, ET), all of whom had significant experience of working with people with BD. They were chosen in accordance withguidelines for selection of ESM items [ 24] and to assess momentary experiences of BD symp- toms that might reasonably occur and fluctuate during the flow of daily life. A service-user group of 4 people with a BD diagnosis took part in a consultation exercise and checked the ap-propriateness of the potential questions. Members reported that the language reflected howthey would describe their own behaviour and experiences. A principal components analysis re- vealed two distinct subscales with high internal consistency. The mania scale ( /= 0.76) con- sisting of the items: I of energy ','high ','full of good ideas 'and the depression scale (/= consisting of items: I feel 'slowed down ','low ','bad about myself ','fearful '. The mean scores for each scale were used in the analyses. The ESM diary \u2014substance use Cannabis use, referred to as a 'cannabis moment 'was reported in the diary after each beep (the period between the current beep and previous beep). Information was derived from the ques- tion (since the last beep I 've used cannabis 'Yes 'or'No '?) Cannabis use previous was defined as cannabis use during the period between previous beep and the beep before that. The type ofcannabis used was also recorded (skunk, resin or grass). Alcohol and drug use other than cannabis were reported in the diary after each beep, termed 'alcohol moment 'and 'other drug moment 'respectively. Statistical analysis strategy STATA 11 [ 34] was used for the analyses. ESM data has a hierarchical structure with the re- peated participant observations (level one), nested within days (level two), nested within partic- ipants (level three). Responses for one individual or for one day are more likely to be similar than those for a different individual or for a different day. Multilevel random regression Bipolar Disorder and Cannabis Use in Daily Life PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0118916 March 4, 2015 4/1 5analysis was used as it takes the whole data set into account and can estimate the amount of variation that is associated with the three different levels. The multilevel regression XTMELO- GIT routine was used for the dichotomous variables and the XTMIXED routine for the contin-uous variables. Therefore the odds ratios (dichotomous variables) and the betas (continuousvariables) are the associations between the independent and dependent variables in the multilevel model. Preliminary analyses Multi-level regression analyses were conducted to identify whether age, gender, alcohol use at the same beep, other drug use at the same beep, type of cannabis used and total cannabis usefor the ESM period were associated with changes in affect, BD symptoms and cannabis use. The results were used to identify which variables would be adjusted for in the main analyses. Self medication effects To investigate whether affect or BD symptoms predicted cannabis use; multilevel analyses were conducted using the XTMELOGIT routine. Positive affect previous , negative affect previous , mania previous and depression previous were entered as the independent variables and canna- bis use as the dependent variable. Overall cannabis use during the ESM week was adjusted for in these analyses. Cannabis effects on affect and BD symptoms The main effects of cannabis use on affect / symptoms were investigated with cannabis use asthe independent variable and positive affect, negative affect, mania and depression as the de- pendent variables. Alcohol use at the same beep and overall cannabis use during the ESM week were adjusted for in these analyses. Temporal analyses of cannabis use Post hoc analyses were conducted to further investigate the duration of cannabis effects on af-fect and symptoms. To investigate these, cannabis use at the current beep and cannabis use previous were entered simultaneously into the model, predicting positive affect, negative affect, mania and depression. Results Participants Twenty-nine participants initially participated in the study. However three participants were subsequently excluded as they had fewer than 20 valid reports and a further two dropped out due to personal circumstances. The final study sample consisted of 24 participants. See table 1 for socio-demographics of the participant sample. Participant exclusion /drop outs Five participants were excluded / dropped out of the study. There were no significant differ- ences between individuals who completed the study and those who did not in relation to gen- der, ethnicity, bipolar diagnosis, marital status, occupational status or living arrangements.However significant differences were revealed between the two groups in terms of age. Individ- uals who were excluded/ dropped out had a higher mean age and scores on the HAM and the MAS were elevated for the group that was excluded/ dropped out (see table 2 for actual values). Bipolar Disorder and Cannabis Use in Daily Life PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0118916 March 4, 2015 5/1 5Substance use Three participants met current criteria for cannabis abuse disorder and 12 met criteria for cur- rent cannabis dependence disorder. Over the course of the six-day ESM period, the mean num- ber of cannabis moments for the sample was 15.0 (SD: 8.6, range: 2 -30). During this period all participants reported only using one type of cannabis, with the majority using 'skunk '(54%). The mean number of alcohol moments for the sample was 3.1 (SD: 5.5, range 0 -21) and for 'other 'drug use 0.8 (S.D: 2.5, 0 -12). See table 3 for other drug and alcohol use. Preliminary analyses Age, gender, other drug use (at the same beep) and type of cannabis used were not associated with any of the outcome variables, therefore were not adjusted for in the main analyses. Total cannabis use for the ESM period (number of cannabis moments) was positively associated withcannabis use at the current beep ( = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.10 -0.15, P = 0.000), therefore this was ad- justed for in all the main analyses. Alcohol use (at the same beep) was positively associated with subsequent increases in positive affect ( = 0.48, 95% of the participant sample.

Self \u2014medication effects There was a significant positive relationship between positive affect previous and cannabis use at the current beep (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.06 -1.47, P = 0.008). The odds of cannabis use at the current beep were increased for those with higher scores of positive affect at the previous beep.Negative affect previous did not significantly predict cannabis use at the following beep (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.74 -1.05, P = 0.147). Similarly association was found between manic symp- toms previous (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.93 table 4 . Cannabis effects on affect and BD symptoms Cannabis use was associated with subsequent increases in positive affect ( = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.20 -0.51, P = 0.000). Cannabis use was also associated with subsequent increases in manic symptoms ( = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05 -0.34, P = 0.009) depressive symptoms = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04 -0.29, P = 0.008). Overall, cannabis use had no effect negative affect = -0.01, 95% CI: -0.13 -0.10, P table 5 ). Temporal dynamics of cannabis effects Follow up post -hoc analyses were conducted to investigate the duration of cannabis effects on affect and BD symptoms. This was achieved by entering cannabis use and cannabis use previ- oussimultaneously into the model. The results suggested that increases in positive affect were observed in the short term ( = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10 -0.48, P = 0.003 for cannabis use) but not the longer term (over one beep but not two) ( = 0.01, 95% cannabis useprevious ). Similarly increases in depressive symptoms were observed in the short term (= 0.18, 95% CI: 0.03 -0.33, P = 0.019 for cannabis term CI: ). For mania, when both cannabis use and cannabis use previous were entered simultaneously in the same model, increases in manic symptoms were not observed in the short term ( = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.10 -0.24, CI: -0.25 -0.09, P = Effect of mood/ BD symptomatology on cannabis use of cannabis use on mood/ BD symptoms.

The data from the current study indicates that individuals with BD are not using cannabis to self-medicate minor fluctuations in negative affect and bipolar symptoms (previousbeep to current beep). It remains to be seen how this data relates to the broader self-medication hypothesis in BD. In line with the second prediction, the findings from the study indicate that the use of cannabis in daily life was associated with subsequent increases in positive affect,manic symptoms and depressive symptoms. In addition, the data suggests that increases inpositive affect and depressive symptoms were only experienced in the short-term, as cannabis use at the previous beep did not predict a significant increase in affect or symptoms at subse- quent time points. Cannabis effects The findings that cannabis use was associated with an increase in positive affect, manic and de-pressive symptoms is consistent with current literature that suggests cannabis can produce arange of psychological effects [ 35,36,37]. It has been suggested that the psychological and physiological effects of cannabis are primarily due to its main chemical compounds, THC and CBD. The effects of cannabis have previously been found to be bidirectional [ 35,38], causing effects such as euphoria and dysphoria; this may partially explain why cannabis use was associ- ated with both manic and depressive symptoms in the current study. The bidirectional effects of cannabis have been found to depend on a range of factors such as dose, route of administra-tion and personality differences [ 35,38]. The effect of cannabis use on individuals with psychosis has received rather more investiga- tion than the effects of the drug on those with BD. Research suggests that compared to 'healthy ' control participants, individuals with at high risk for psychosis may be more sensitive toTHC [ 39,40]. Barkus and Lewis [ 41] found that individuals scoring higher on Schizotypal traits were more likely to experience both psychosis-like experiences and more pleasurable ex- periences after smoking cannabis. Individual differences in sensitivity to the effects of THCmay explain the range of experiences, as noted by Henquet et al [ 20]. In a similar way, individ- uals with BD may also differ in their sensitivity to the effects of THC, which may explain why there was a range of effects in the current study.Table 6. Temporal dynamics of cannabis effects. Positive affect Cannabis use = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10 -0.48, -0.18 CI: CI: 0.138 Cannabis Use in Daily Life PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0118916 March 4, 2015 9/1 5Effects of affect / BD symptoms on cannabis use (Self-medication effects) The results indicated that higher levels of positive affect increase the odds of using cannabis, and it appears that individuals were using cannabis when they were feeling good. Alternatively, higher positive affect prior to cannabis use may have been experienced due to the expected en-joyment of the effects of substance use. Data from the current study does not support the idea that cannabis is used by individuals with BD for the self-medication of minor fluctuations in negative affect and BD symptoms inthe context of daily life. An increase in negative affect and BD symptoms did not predict canna-bis use at the following beep. This finding is consistent with Henquet et al [ 20] who similarly did not find evidence to support the self-medication hypothesis for psychosis over the course of daily life, as changes in hallucinations, delusions and negative affect did not predictcannabis use. The interpretation of the findings of this study is limited to the associations between the current beep and the previous beep. It is possibly the case that self-medication effects appearfurther down the chain of events, following a longer period of negative affect / symptom changes. Alternatively, failure to find self-medicating effects from cannabis may have been due to the nature of the participant sample. BD is characterised by shifts in affect regulationand therefore over time individuals may have become accustomed to subtle changes in mood. Therefore, within the context of daily life, cannabis may not be used as a way to cope with these slight fluctuations. Participants in the study were currently well and out of episodeand therefore it may be that cannabis is used to self-medicate more pronounced symptoms orthe onset of manic / depressive episodes. This would be consistent with the self- report litera- ture where individuals have found cannabis useful in the management of their BD [ 13,14,15]. Limitations Several limitations need to be taken into account in interpreting the results of the study. First, details of cannabis use were based on self-report. Cannabis use remains illegal in the UnitedKingdom, and this may have led to underestimations in reported use. Hair sample analysismay have offered a way to confirm usage [ 42], however this was beyond the resources of the current study. Additionally, whilst type of cannabis was reported and adjusted for in analyses, the individual potency of the drugs consumed was not controlled for. There are in excess of100 different strengths of cannabis and research has revealed that on average, cannabis resin and herbal (grass) contains around 2 -4% THC, however Sinsemillia (Skunk) contains around 12-18% at each bleep was dichotomized into 'yes 'or'no'; future studies might attempt to collect and report information regarding the amount of canna- bis ingested and route of consumption at each beep. The items used on the scales for mania and depression were formulated specifically for use in the ESM diary in this study. They were chosen in accordance with guidelines for the selec- tion of ESM questions [ 24] which highlights the need for items to be 'momentary experiences which occur in the flow of daily life '. Whilst we have limited evidence for their validity, items were reviewed by a service user panel with BD who felt they accurately described their experi-ence when manic and depressed. A correlation matrix was computed to investigate the rela- tionship between the positive affect, negative affect, mania and depressive scales. There was a strong correlation between the negative affect and depressive scales (r = 0.82). This indicatesthat there may have been a high degree of overlap between the scales. The correlation between the positive affect scale and mania scale was (r = 0.58). However during the main analyses the scales produced different results (e.g. cannabis use was significantly associated with depressive Bipolar Disorder and Cannabis Use in Daily Life PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0118916 March 4, 2015 10 / 15symptoms but not with negative affect and higher levels of positive affect increase the odds of using cannabis, however higher levels of manic symptoms did not). This provided some predic- tive validity to support the use of separate scales: and it suggests that they were measuring dif-ferent emotional states. Items from the positive and negative affect scales were considered toreflect everyday mood fluctuations as expected within the 'normal 'range. The items formulat- ed for the mania and depression scales were deemed to reflect symptoms specific to BD that would fluctuate over the course of daily life. Cannabis is known to have an impact on cognition [ 45,46] and as suggested by Henquet et al [ 20] this may therefore have impacted on the ability to report information accurately in the diaries. However one of the main advantages of using ESM is the short space of time be-tween an event occurring and the recall, which reduces memory bias [ 25]. Additionally, a re- cent study [ 47] found cannabis use was associated with better neuro-cognitive functioning in participants with BD, particularly executive functioning. Cannabis is rapidly metabolized in the body and the pharmacological effects can often begin within minutes after smoking [ 48]. Blood plasma levels of THC peak approximately 20 minutes after ingestion [ 49]. However traces of THC can exist in the body for several days following use. There may have been a background level of cannabis in the system for some ofthe regular users taking part in the study and this must be taken into account when interpreting the results. However, the consequences produced from 're-dosing 'during the cannabis mo- ments are still valid due to the almost immediate effects of cannabis use. ESM can be a demanding methodology and requires sustained attention and motivation to fill out diary entries. This may deter some individuals, and thereby result in a selection bias. In addition, like other ESM studies [ 50,51] the participant sample size was relatively small and therefore may not generalize to all individuals with co-occurring cannabis use and BD. Howev- er a large number of data points were generated as ESM data has a hierarchical structure with the repeated participant observations (level one), nested within days (level two), nested withinparticipants (level three). Additionally, the majority of the sample was from a white British background and had a di- agnosis of BD-I. It is therefore questionable how much the findings of this study may generalise to people from different ethnic minorities or other BD groups. Finally, Henquet et al [ 20] used a study sample with individuals with a clinical diagnosis of a psychotic disorder and healthy controls. Both groups were frequent cannabis users (current use of at least 3 times per week). The results from the study were different for both groups,with cannabis use associated with a decrease in negative affect and an increase in hallucinatory experiences in the clinical group alone. The inclusion of a control group (individuals without a mental health diagnosis who regularly used cannabis) in this study may have provided insightinto whether the findings of the study relate exclusively to those with a diagnosis of BD, com- pared to a non-clinical sample. Clinical Implications Overall results from the present study indicate that cannabis use can cause a range of psycho- logical effects for individuals with BD, including an exacerbation of both manic and depressivesymptoms. Co-occurring BD and substance abuse is highly prevalent [ 6,52] and it is associated with worsened outcomes [ 5,6,7]. However intervention research for BD and substance abuse is in its infancy [ 53,54,55,56] and demonstrates a limited evidence base [ 53]. The results from this study may help to inform future interventions. Clients often find it difficult to reduce their substance intake and the literature suggests that some individuals perceive cannabis as a useful coping strategy in the management of their BD Bipolar Disorder and Cannabis Use in Daily Life PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0118916 March 4, 2015 11 / 15symptoms. However results from this study may help to counter these positive expectations of their substance use. The findings suggest that cannabis is not being used to self medicate changes in symptoms, within the context of daily life, and in fact it may be further complicatingaffective states. Services and clinicians need to be aware of the potential impact of using canna-bis and able to inform clients of the risks. Alongside this it may be helpful for clinicians to offer alternative strategies to help clients cope with changes in BD symptoms, which may in turn in- crease an individual 's confidence to reduce their substance intake. Similar to Henquet et al 's findings [ 20], the majority of participants in this study reported that they found the ESM diary a useful and reflective tool to monitor their mood and cannabis use. Anecdotally, a number of participants reported that tracking patterns of mood and canna-bis use led them to question their substance use and in some cases reduce intake. ESM could provide an invaluable therapeutic tool, particularly with clients who are ambivalent about changing their drug use habits, providing insight into unhelpful patterns of behaviour, whichmay contribute towards the maintenance of their difficulties. Conclusion The findings from the study indicate that cannabis use is associated with a subsequent change in positive affect, depressive symptoms and manic symptoms over the course of daily life. No evidence for the use of cannabis to self-medicate minor fluctuations in negative affect or BDsymptoms was revealed. Participants in the study were currently well and out of episode. Fu- ture research should explore whether the self-medication hypothesis is more relevant to indi- viduals that are in the acute stages of depression or mania. This would be consistent with thebroader self-medication hypothesis in BD where individuals have reported finding cannabisuseful in the management of their symptoms [ 13,14,15].

Bakalar** Abstract- The authors present case histories indicating that a number of patients find cannabis (marihuana) useful in the treatment of their bipolar disorder. Some used it to treat mania, depression, or both. They stated that it was more effective than conventional drugs, or helped relieve the side effects ofthose drugs. One woman found that cannabis curbed her manic rages; she and her husband have worked to make it legally available as a medicine. Others described the use of cannabis as a supplement to lithium (allowing reduced consumption) or for relief of lithium's side effects. Another case illustrates the fact that medical cannabis users are in danger of arrest, especially when children are encouraged to inform on parents by some drug prevention programs . An analogy is drawn between the status of cannabis today and that of lithium in the early 1950s, when its effect on mania had been discovered but there were no controlled studies. In the case of cannabis, the law has made such studies almost impossible, and the only available evidence is anecdotal. The potential for cannabis as a treatment for bipolar disorder unfortunately can not be fully explored in the present social circumstances.

Manic symp\u00ad toms include sleeplessness, tirelessness (until exhaustion leads to a breakdown), and recklessly gregarious and expan\u00ad sive behavior, which sometimes turns to irritability, rage and paranoid delusions. Bipolar disorder is treated mainly with lithium salts and anticonvulsant drugs, which can have serious side effects. Thir ty percent to 40% of patients with bipolar disorder are not consistently helped by or cannot tolerate standard medicati ons. In the course of the authors' studies of the medical uses of cannabis (Grinspoon & Bakalar 1997), a number of sufferers were discovered who believed marihuana to be more effective than conventional anti-manic drugs, or who used it to relieve the side effects of lithium. Our first account was written by a 47-year-old woman: I was born on Friday, October 13, 1950, a few months before my father had his first serious bout with manic depression. My mother said he was taking valuable art objects they owned and throwing them down the trash chute in their New York apartment building. I enjoyed my youth with a great deal of abandon. How much of this would be mood disorder I could not tell you. As a single person I dido 't notice; I just rode the waves of emo\u00ad tional highs and lows and didn't think much about it. I was an old pro at this by the time I was 19 and met my husband. It was only through my association with him that I came to terms with my mood problems, although right before I met him I had checked myself in at a mental health clinic com\u00ad plaining that I sometimes felt unable to concentrate on one thing at a time. I think I was 22 years old when my troubles cropped up again. At one point my husband and I went to see a psycholo\u00ad gist. We talked about my mood swings and spells of nervous\u00ad ness, anger, and depression. The tiniest negative thing happening would cause long-lasting rage, very hard to quell. We told the psychologist of my father's history, even longer and grislier by then. He must have been in every state mental institution along the east coast. My grandmother, his mother, was wasting away by this time, losing her lifelong battle with chronic depression. I don't know much about her case except that she was chronically sad and starved herself to death after her husband passed away. This man said my husband and I needed to lose weight; that was the extent of his advice. We did not see him much longer. By this time I was experiencing most of the symp\u00ad toms I have today, although they havestrengthened year by year. Sometimes I feel elated, exhilarated, with a great deal of energy. It sounds great, but you can get to be feeling so good that you scare the people around you, believe me! This is accompanied by light sleeping and nocturnal habits. I tend to become angry or aggressive when it is not appropriate, or just talk too loud. I often have a low self-image or feel sad. I sometimes have a hard time getting up to work, a heaviness that keeps me from moving. I get racing thoughts that make concentration hard. I have strong emotions that change rap\u00ad idly. I tend to be physically clumsy. I develop unexplained skin rashes, and sometimes feel like I'm generating electric\u00ad ity and shooting it out my fingers and toes. My judgment is often poor. It was in my early twenties that I first used cannabis for my condition. I had been exposed to it several times, the first Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 172 Cannabis as a Mood Stabilizer in Bipolar Disorder when I was quite young. My mother had taken me to a mental health center after my initial signs of trouble as a child. After a group therapy session there, some of the other kids took me riding and gave me a joint. Nothing at all hap\u00ad pened, and I concluded it must be a mild drug. When I was exposed to it later, I would actually choose it over alcohol because it dido 't have such strong and negative effects on me. This is how I discovered that it was effective against most of my symptoms. Suppose I am in a fit of manic rage-the most destructive behavior of all. A few puffs of this herb and I can be calm. My husband and I have both noticed this; it is quite dramatic. One minute out of control in a mad rage over a meaningless detail, seem\u00ad ingly in need of a strait jacket. and somewher e, deep in my mind, asking myself why this is happening and why I can't get a handle on my own emotions. Then, within a few min\u00ad utes, the time it takes to smoke a few pinches-why, I could even, after a round of apologies, laugh at myself' But this herb is illegal and I have a strong desire to abide by the law. My father was having great success with a new drug, lithium carbonate. I saw my father's physician and he recommended that I try it. I took lithium for six months and experienced several adverse side effects: shak\u00ad ing, skin rashes, and loss of control over my speech. But I would still be taking it if it had worked for me as it did for my father. It literally restored his life. I had gotten worse, if anything. The combination of lithium side effects and increased manic depressive symptoms drove me back to the use of cannabis. Some years later I tried to go without it again, this time because of increased social pressure against illegal drug use. It was a very difficult time for my family. When\u00ad ever I started to become manic, my husband and son would get scared and cower, triggering rage and making matters worse. When depression struck it was a black funk on our household. And I can tell you from the experience with my father that this can really destroy a family. After a while the knowledge that a little bit of marihuana would help me so much became irresistible. At first I tried eating cannabis, but soon returned to smoking because I could control the dose better. I don't at all consider myself a drug abuser. I am doing what any rational person in my position would do. Cannabis does not cure my condition and over the years it has prob\u00ad ably continued to worsen. But with judicious use of this medicine my life is fine. I can control things with this drug that seems so harmless compared to the others I've tried, including tranquilizers as well as lithium. I am constantly concerned that I will be cut off from my supply of mari\u00ad huana or caught with it in my possession. I feel my sanity may depend on it. Cannabis lessens what is troubling me and returns me to a more normal state. Often I do not expe\u00ad rience a \"high\" at all, just a return to normal. This patient's husband bears witness to the usefulness of cannabis: I've been mates with my full-blown manic-dep ressive (M-D) wife for 26 years. Her father was the classic, well\u00ad studied and well-written-about manic-depressive, and she's the one who inherited it. She's lovely, and as I've always truthfully told her, she has the perfect personality, blem\u00ad ished only by M-D. I've always been smooth-sai ling. Smoking marihuana only makes me sleepy. I never use it. She requires it, or, I Volume 30 (2), April-June 1998 Downloaded by [UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE LIBRARIES] at 07:34 26 September 2017 Grinspoon swear she'd be institutionalized just like her father. There wouldn't be any other way. We've tried Marino! [dronabi nol]. It works for her too, but to get the same effect as marihuana she must take I 0 mg about six times a day, which costs about $65 a day. What's worse is that it takes forty-five minutes to engage and tapers off within two hours maximum. Timing of capsule ingestion must be exact or the symptoms can print through. Marihuana [smoked] lasts a little longer and is smoother, and, most im\u00ad portantly takes effect quickly. What does marihuana do for my wife? It \"recenters\" her personality and her interaction with the immediate fam\u00ad ily moves back into a normal range-no highs, no lows, at least not the highs and lows that are abnormally extreme and that you can tell are from a crazy person with active M-D. Narcoleptic drugs really \"zone\" her out, like a temporary lo\u00ad botomy in a medicine bottle. Marihuana never does that I It normalizes, that's all. If there's an overdose, which is rare, it's not dangerous and is very short. Yesterday we went downtown (one and a half hour's drive one way). However , going several hours without the medicine can be quite calamitous. The worst kind of getting along badly ensued. That's the exact nature of M-D. You tear at your mate with unfounded suspicions, accusations, insane bittemess--{:nough to make you hate each other. It makes no sense. That's why it's crazy behavior . If you're lucky, like my wife, your mate understands and gets you home right away to have a smoke. It used to be that you could take trips, but the police have cracked down so hard that you don't dare smoke a joint in the car. I can bear witness to the probability of a near normal life situation for a manic-depressive if they've got good marihuana, a lifestyle that allows one to be home nearly always, and an understanding partner. Here is the account of another woman with bipolar disorder who finds cannabis more useful than conventional medications: I am a 35-year-old woman with severe manic depres\u00ad sion. When I was growing up I was hypersensitive, cried all the time, and fought with my brothers and sister. My parents always said they had to handle me with kid gloves. I had more energy than most and used it to the hilt. I was an agile gymnast and one of the fastest swimmers in my school. I was also at the top of my class in algebra and good at art and creative writing. I used to stay awake at night and dream up stories. Around age 14 my mood swings\u00b7 began to get more intense. I was agitated, restless, and constantly fighting at home. I lay awake at night and lost a lot of weight. Eventu\u00ad ally I snapped and was sent to a mental hospital, where I was diagnosed as having manic-depressive disorder. They put me on lithium and told me I would have to take it the rest of my life. But lithium made me lethargic. I had trouble communi\u00ad cating and lost all my animation and creativity. Eventually I quit taking it. Recently I have also tried Tegretol [carbamazepine] and Depakote [valproic acid). neither of which helped. Tegretol started a manic episode, and Depakote had some very bad side effects. I'd like to find something else, but I don't have health insurance or the money to spend trying out new medications. Since the age of 14 I have had manic episodes regu\u00ad larly about once every six months. It would always start with Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 173 Cannabis as a Mood Stabilizer in Bipolar Disorder not being able to sleep or eat. After two weeks I would just break down and seem to trip out into another world. Usually I ended up in a mental hospital. I smoked marihuana for the first time in high school and couldn't believe how good it made me feel. My nor\u00ad mally chaotic emotions subsided and I had a sudden sense of calm, peace, and well-being. My perceptions of others and life changed dramatically. The world no longer seemed hos\u00ad tile but more within my control. I could sleep easily and ac\u00ad tually had cravings for food. There were practically no side effects. When I had enough marihuana I would just naturally stop, because once you've gotten a certain effect you really don't want any more. Only another manic-d epressive using marihuana could possibly know how much this has changed the quality of my life. Although they don't know it, my family actually likes me better when I'm stoned than when I'm taking lithium or not taking anything. When I'm stoned they can predict my moods and actually get close to me. But I can't tell my fam\u00ad ily or the doctors because it's illegal. I have to live a double life to get along. I've often tried to quit marihuana, but I have a manic episode every time. Last year I decided I could control my emotional ups and downs without marihuana, but it led to one of the worst episodes I've ever experienced. I had been having trouble sleeping as usual. I began to get super clear vision that a disastrous earthquake was going to hit Los Angeles. I was feeling so good I was sure I was right. Soon I had my roommate convinced that we didn't have much time and would have to buy as many supplies as possible and then leave. We thought that after the quake the New World Order would be implemented and everyone would have to take the number that Revelations talks about in the Bible. We planned to go to El Salvador. where her family lives, and hide out for the next three and a half years. Crazy I But I really believed it. I maxed out all my credit cards, quit my job, and packed up all my things, including disguises I thought we were going to need. Eventually I had to return home with no job and major bills. I knew then and there that I would have to go back on marihuana. It's been seven months now since I resumed smoking marihuana, and I don't know what else to do. I have to choose between obeying the law and staying sick or breaking the law and being well. J.P. is a 45-year-old health professional and the mother of a 20-year-old son: In late 1994 and early 1995 my son Michael, age 18, began to go out of control. He was unable to sleep, attend school, or function in a normal fashion. He was running around non\u00ad stop, acting on impulse without any sense of normal judg\u00ad ment. He was in serious danger of accidentally harming himself or others. There was no way to reason with him, be\u00ad cause he was unable to think or listen long enough to under\u00ad stand what you were trying to say. He had become a human time-bomb. Then, on February 14, 1995, he had a full-blown psy\u00ad chotic manic episode and refused treatment. I had to petition a court to commit him to a psychiatric hospital in Portland, Maine, where he was given a diagnosis of manic-depressive disorder. Both Michael's father and my grandmother suf\u00ad fered from the same disorder, which is now called bipolar disorder. Volume 30 (2), April-June 1998 Downloaded by [UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE LIBRARIES] at 07:34 26 September 2017 Grinspoon During his nine days in the hospital (the time allotted by my insurance company) Michael was given lithium and Trilafon [perphenazi ne]. We were told that he would need lithium for the rest of his life. They explained that it worked very well in 60% of people with this disorder. We returned home, and for the first month or two, the mania seemed to have ended. At the end of the second month the Trilafon was discontinued, but Michael was still taking a high dose of lithium. At that point he developed a rash on his neck and chest; he also had dark circles under his eyes, and he was incoherent most of the time. The lithium level in his blood was exactly where the doctor wanted it, but now he was acting like an Alzheimer's patient. He couldn't read or comprehend a paragraph, let alone finish school. He was detached from his surroundings and himself. There was no emotional content left in him. He was becoming unrecogniz\u00ad able. He had always been very much like [comedian] Robin Williams in personality and extremely athletic-a skier, foot\u00ad ball player, and weight lifter. It was heartbreaki ng to watch him lose himself in a medicated stupor. I became convinced that lithium did not eliminate the disease but instead was drowning his brain so the symptoms could not be activated. I could still see tiny mood swings and moments of complete restlessness, but in a body that was unable to become hypomanic. Michael decided to cut his lithium in half. I knew this would be dangerous but I agreed that something had to be done. Soon he was more himself. laughing and talking and almost back among the living. Then he started to become more hypomanic, and I knew we were headed for trouble. He was back to the energy level of someone on high doses of speed, and this lasted for months. He was running through life like a high-bred stallion, while I was gathering every\u00ad thing ever written on manic-depressive disorder. Then one day he came home and was perfectly normal in every respect. I thought that maybe he was in remission because the disease is known to do that, and I was thrilled at the possibility. Later that night he was back to full speed ahead, and all hope sank within me. This continued as the weeks passed. There would be times when he was perfectly normal, but only for short intervals. I could not figure it out. I started to chart his sleep pattern, his food intake, the kinds of foods, what chemicals he was subjecting himself to, and so on. Finally one day I discovered that he was smoking pot. Of course I freaked out. We talked about it at length and he told me point blank, \"I only feel normal when I smoke a joint.\" By this time I was ready to blame the disease on his pot smoking. I was totally irrational about this. Michael and I fought constantly for a month about it. Finally he asked me to research cannabis and let him know what I found. I figured I would be able to find enough damaging information to put the subject to rest. The next week was my week of discovery. Not only could I not find what I was looking for, but I became convinced that there was no permanent damage, and that cannabis was actually helpful for people with mood disorders. I went on-line on the computer to talk to other people suffering from bipolar disorder, and I was overwhelmed by first-person stories of the benefits that others had found. The hardest part of this entire thing was rearranging my value system. I was raised to be a law-abiding citizen. Al\u00ad though I grew up in the sixties and had tried pot and inhaled, I was never a regular user because it was illegal. I raised Mike right. He was taught to respect elders, do what you are supposed to do, and above all follow the law. Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 174 Cannabis as a Mood Stabilizer in Bipolar Disorder It is hard enough to live with an 18 year old during a naturally rebellious time, but to be forced to participate in an illegal activity is the absolute worst scenario. But that is exactly what I'm doing. Mike has been smoking pot for two months now. He does not smoke daily, but when the mania begins he smokes and within five minutes he is fine. He never appears to be \"high,\" just happy and relaxed. We don't have to deal with mood swings anymore. He can work on his home-schooling program, and I don't doubt that he will finish by the end of summer. He has been repairing lob\u00ad ster traps with a friend and will be lobstering six days a week by the end of April. At this point I expect to be arrested some day, because if Mike gets arrested , they will have to take me right along with him. I plan to grow a plant this summer for his use. I know I could end up in jail, but I also know that without some kind of medication that works, my son could end up in jail. institutionalized, or dead. What choice do I have? Another account of cannabis use by a person with bipolar disorder emphasizes the reduction of lithium side effects: I am 29 years old, born and raised in North Carolina. My academic background is in English literature. computer sci\u00ad ence, and law; I now work as a technology consultant and writer, although I am contemplating returning to graduate school. I am divorced. I am reasonably active in my community, though work takes much of my time these days. I was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder about five years ago, when I was in law school (a psychiatrist also ten\u00ad tatively ventured this diagnosis during my und ergraduate years), but I suspect that I have had a mood disorder for most of my life. I was certainly clinically depressed as early as age nine, and my first hypomanic episode occurred at I 7. There is also a family history of mood disorders, especially on my mother's side. All three of her brothers had \"mercu\u00ad rial\" personalities, and they all experienced tremendous successes and notable failures in business. Their extrava\u00ad gance and outgoing personalities resemble my behavior while manic or hypomanic. Although none of them was for\u00ad mally diagnosed with a mood disorder, both my parents have been treated for clinical depr ession. Before I was diagnosed and found the right treatment, I had the typical symptoms of bipolar disorder. During depressive phases I became withdrawn, uncommunica tive, and preoccupied with suicide. I found it nearly impossible to function in school or at work. During hypomanic or manic phases I spent freely, traveled all over the country (and world), made poor personal and business decisions. engaged in risky sexual behavior, and so forth. The illness has caused me a great deal of personal pain as well as finan\u00ad cial woes. I separated from my wife (who eventually di\u00ad vorced me) the summer before I was diagnosed. I've lost jobs, ruined friendships, and alienated members of my fam\u00ad ily. Fortunately, much of this damage has been repaired with time and understanding. I thank God that my ruined credit rating is the only apparent lasting harm. Thanks to lithium and sensible therapy, including the judicious use of cannabis, I have been relatively stable and sane for the past three years, although my sleep is often dis\u00ad turbed and I still have (very much milder) hypomania and depression in much the same cyclic pattern as before. Volume 30 (2), April -June 1998 Downloaded by [UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE LIBRARIES] at 07:34 26 September 2017 Grinspoon I first used cannabis in my freshman year of college (1984). I preferred it to alcohol as an intoxicant, and used it a few times a week, almost always by smoking (I still prefer to take it that way). In retrospect, it seems clear to me that I was medicating myself for bipolar disorder even then. When depressed and anxious, I found that cannabis was soothing and enhanced my ability to enjoy life. When I was in a manic phase, it relaxed me and helped me get to sleep. I often felt as though I had so much energy inside me that I would jump out of my skin; the cannabis helped tremendously with that. But there was a downside. Manics have a big problem with impulse control, and cannabis seemed to exacerbate it. (\"Drive to Canada? Great idea. Let's go!\") It also ratcheted up my already overactive libido a notch or two, which wasn't the healthiest thing in the world. When I was diagnosed and began treatment with lithium, I got almost immediate relief, but I also suf fered from nausea, pounding headaches, hand tremors, and excess production of saliva. A friend suggested that I try getting high, reasoning that if cannabis helped chemotherapy patients deal with their nausea and discomfort, it might help me too. My doctor thought the idea was absurd but admitted that it would be safe to take cannabis together with lithium. So I tried it, and the results were remarkable. The hand trem\u00ad ors subsided, the headaches vanished, and the saliva factory resumed normal production levels. All I needed was one or two puffs on a marihuana cigarette. When lithium side ef\u00ad fects get bad, the availability of cannabis has been an abso\u00ad lute godsend. It is also nice to be able to use cannabis as an intoxicant, knowing that, unlike the combination of lithium and alcohol, it cannot damage my kidneys. Every one of the many thousands of Americans who use marihuana as a medicine runs a risk of being arrested. They have to worry about financial ruin, the loss of their careers, and forfeiture of their automobiles and homes. Some have an additional burden because mandatory school drug programs and Parents for a Drug-Free America adver\u00ad tisements have given their children an exaggerated idea of the dangers of using marihuana. Many of these children become concerned about the health and well-being of their marihuana-using parents. A few of those parents have been arrested because their worried children informed on them to the police officers who serve as instructors in the popu\u00ad lar school drug program known as Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE). The following accounts are by a 40-year-old software engineer and his 37-year-old wife, who suffers from bipo\u00ad lar disorder. He speaks first: My wife and I and our two boys live in Tyngsboro, Massa\u00ad chusetts. My wife was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in 1982 and has been taking lithium since 1992. She also uses marihuana for her symptoms. She has had six psychia\u00ad trists in the past 14 years and has been interviewed by many more. I have always told them that she uses marihuana regu\u00ad larly, and not one of them has told her to stop. They do not even seem to care or pay attention. I posted a question about this to the alt.sup\u00ad port.depression.manic newsgroup on the Internet. I asked whether doctors knew something about marihuana but could Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 175 Cannabis as a Mood Stabilizer in Bipolar Disorder not recommend it because of its illegality. The re\u00ad sponses were varied, but most people who were manic\u00ad depressive said marihuana helped them, and one said that some doctors considered it effective in controlling mood disorders. My wife functions much better when she uses mari\u00ad huana. When she is hypomanic, it relaxes her, helps her sleep, and slows her speech down. When she is depressed and would otherwise lie in bed all day, the marihuana makes her more active_ When she runs out of marihuana and can't get more, she becomes more irritable and hard to live with. Lithium is also effective, but it doesn't always keep her in control. Our dilemma is that our 13 year old has been through the DARE program and has learned about the evils of drugs and alcohol. He opposes all substance use, legal or illegal\u00ad and I want it that way. But he knows that my wife uses mari\u00ad huana and it \"eats\" at him, although he also knows about her illness and how marihuana helps. Understandably, all this confuses him. I believe that marihuana could help some people if it were made available as a prescription medicine. Certainly there are other health and social issues involved, and I can't decide what would be right for the country as a whole. All I know is that in this family it has relieved us all of much suffering. Now his wife: I am 37, and I have been using marihuana for 20 years. I was diagnosed bipolar in 1982. I take lithium and Wellbutrin [bupropion], although I dislike these drugs. I've gained about 40 pounds since I started taking lithium, but otherwise there are no side effects. My 13-year-old son knows about my illness. He has also known about my marihuana smoking for about five years. He realized what I was doing after he participated in the DARE program in school. It bothers me when he comes home and says they talked about drugs and he was thinking that his mother is \"one of them.\" He doesn't want anyone to know his mother is a \"druggie,\" and until now we've kept it as our secret. I don't think he would tell anyone, but I'm still afraid something might get out. Sometimes these programs use tricks to get kids to inform on their friends and relatives. They say, \"If you really care about this person, the only way you can help them is to report them.\" My husband has talked to him about it. He has explained that lithium and the other medications I'm taking are drugs. He also explained that many legal drugs are far more dangerous than marihuana and that no one has ever died from using marihuana. But my son insists that if it is illegal, then it is wrong_ This bothers me so much that I have considered stopping. The trouble is that at times when I feel tired and run\u00ad down, just a couple puffs of marihuana bring me back to life. Sometimes I think it brings me to a level of normalcy that everyone else achieves naturally. At other times, when everything seems to be going like a whirlwind around me and I can't keep track of what I'm thinking about or saying or feeling, the marihuana just seems to slow the world down a bit. When I have trouble sleeping, it helps zonk me out. but if I have trouble waking up it brings me to life. I don't like being thought of as a \"drug-abusing mother,\" but I actually think I'm a better mom when I'm feeling in control because of marihuana. Volume 30 (2), April - June 1998 Downloaded by [UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE LIBRARIES] at 07:34 26 September 2017 Grinspoon In some ways cannabis today is in a position analo\u00ad gous to that of lithium in 1949, when J. F. J. Cade, after observing its sedative effect on guinea pigs, administ ered it to patients suffering from \"chronic and recurrent mania.\" His seminal paper, \"Lithium Salts in the Treatment of Psy\u00ad chotic Excitement,\" presented ten one-paragraph case histories, and this compelling anecdotal evidence attracted the attention of psychiatrists around the world because there was no adequate treatment for bipolar disorder. In his paper Cade ( 1949) mentioned the need for \"controlled observation[s] of a sufficient number of treated and un\u00ad treated patients.\" In 1951, Noack and Trautner followed up by reporting on the treatment of another 30 patients with \"mania alone.\" But they pointed out that not all patients improved, that many discontinued the treatment, and that \"it does not appear to be justified to accept the lithium treat\u00ad ment of mania as invariably safe.\" (Noack & Trautner 1951 ). In 1954, Schou and colleagues published a controlled study in which they alternated lithium and a placebo at two\u00ad week intervals. Lithium was clearly beneficial for 12 patients; 15 showed improvement that was \"not as clear\u00ad cut,\" and three did not improve at all. Schou and his colleagues found it \"rather astonishing that [lithium's suc\u00ad cess] has failed to arouse greater general interest among psychiatr ists.\" One explanation they offered was its low therapeutic ratio. Another explanation was \"the difficulties encountered in attempts to convey to others in a quantita\u00ad tive manner ... the effect of a new psychiatric therapy,\" i.e. to move beyond anecdotal data to controlled studies (Schou eta!. 1954). But there was an even more compelling reason for the delay in lithium's acceptance in the United States. In this country, drugs are introduced by pharmaceutical com\u00ad panies which invest in the studies necessary for official acceptance. They do this because they receive a patent (in the 1950s, for 17 years) on the new drug which allows them to recoup their investment. Lithium salts, of course, could not be patented. Similar obstacles face the medical use of cannabis today. Lithium had a reputation for toxicity that grew out of its use as a salt substitute for cardiac patients in the 1940s. There were a number of deaths before its dangers were fully appreciated, and today blood levels are carefully monitored. Because of its nonmedical use, cannabis also has a reputa\u00ad tion for toxicity, in this case undeserved. Lithium was unpatentable, and so is cannabis. Finally, lik e the evidence for lithium in 1949, the evidence for the therapeutic value of cannabis in bipolar disorder today is anecdotal. Although it has been repeatedly considered as a treatment for affec\u00ad tive disorders in the Western medical literature since 1845, when Jacques-Joseph Moreau de Tours (1857) recom\u00ad mended it for melancholia, there is little in the medical literature on the use of cannabis as a mood stabilizer (see Parker & Wrigley 1950; Pond 1948; Stockings 1947). Today drugs must undergo rigorous, expensive, and time-consuming tests to win approval by the Food and Drug Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 176 Cannabis as a Mood Stabilizer in Bipolar Disorder Administration (FDA) for marketing as medicines. The purpose of the testing is to protect the consumer by estab\u00ad lishing both safety and efficacy. First the drug's safety (or rather limited toxicity) is established through animal and then human experiments. Next, double-blind controlled studies are conducted to determine whether the drug has more than a placebo effect and is at least as useful as an available drug. As the difference between drug and placebo may be small, large numbers of patients are often needed in these studies for a statistically significant effect. Because no drug is completely safe (nontoxic) or always efficacious, a drug approved by the FDA has presumably satisfied a risk-benefit analysis. When physicians prescribe for individual patients they conduct an informal analysis of a similar kind, taking into account not just the drug's overall safety and efficacy but its risks and benefits for a given patient and a given condition. The formal drug approval procedures help to provide physicians with the information they need to make this analysis. But devotion to formal procedures may have caused us to undervalue anecdotal evidence. Regulators today are willing to accept the experience of physicians and patients as evidence of adverse effects but not as evidence of thera\u00ad peutic effects (Lasagna 1985). Yet case histories and clinical experience are the source of much of our knowledge of synthetic medicines as well as plant derivatives. Controlled experiments were not needed to recognize the therapeutic potential of chloral hydrate, barbiturates, aspirin, curare, insulin, or penicillin. More recently, the uses of propra\u00ad nolol for angina and hypertension, diazepam for status epilepticus, and imipramine for childhood enuresis were discovered in the same way, although these drugs were originally approved by regulators for other purposes. A related source of evidence is the experimental method known as the \"N of I\" clinical trial or single\u00ad patient randomized trial. This is the kind of experiment used by Schou and his colleagues (1954 ), in which active and placebo treatments are administered in alternation or succession to a patient. The method is often used when large-scale controlled studies are impossible or inappro\u00ad priate because the disorder is rare, the patient is atypical, or the response to treatment is idiosyncratic. Several patients the authors have encountered carried out some\u00ad what similar experiments on themselves. They alternated periods of cannabis use with periods of no use and discov\u00ad ered that cannabis was effective. The familiar deficiency of anecdotal evidence is the risk of counting successes and ignoring failures. If many people suffering from clinical depression take, say, St. John's Wort after unsuccessful treatment with conventional antidepressants and a few recover, those few stand out and come to attention. Bipolar disorder is a cyclical condition, so it is essential to avoid confusing natural remission with drug-induced improvement. At present we do not know how many patients with bipolar disorder would benefit Volume 30 (2). April-June 1998 Downloaded by [UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE LIBRARIES] at 07:34 26 September 2017 Grinspoon from cannabis. The promising anecdotal evidence points to the need for more systematic clinical investigation, just as it did 50 years ago in the case of lithium. Thousands of years of widespread use as well as re\u00ad cent research designed to discover toxic effects have made it clear that cannabis is an unusually safe drug. In fact, its long-tenn safety is better established than that of St. John's Wort. Yet unlike St. John's Wort, cannabis would be sub\u00ad ject to government regulations that demand further time-consuming and unnecessa ry safety tests. The classi-Cannabis as a Mood Stabilizer in Bipolar Disorder fication of cannabis as a Schedule I drug creates further obstacles to clinical research. But given the disinterest of phannaceutical companies, there is no immediate prospect of such studies being funded even if the political obstacles are removed. We are left with the tantalizing possibility that cannabis (or one or more of its constituent cannab\u00ad inoids) is useful in the treatment of bipolar disorder and the sad knowledge that in the present circumstances little can be done to explore that potenti al.

However, there is conflicting evidence as to whether marijuana may alleviate or exacerbatemood symptomatology. As bipolar disorder and marijuana use are individually associatedwith cognitive impairment, it also remains unclear whether there is an additive effect on cog-nition when bipolar patients use marijuana. The current study aimed to determine the impactof marijuana on mood in bipolar patients and to examine whether marijuana confers anadditional negative impact on cognitive function. Twelve patients with bipolar disorder whosmoke marijuana (MJBP), 18 bipolar patients who do not smoke (BP), 23 marijuana smok- ers without other Axis 1 pathology (MJ), and 21 healthy controls (HC) completed a neuro- psychological battery. Further, using ecological momentary assessment, participants ratedtheir mood three times daily as well as after each instance of marijuana use over a four-week period. Results revealed that although the MJ, BP, and MJBP groups each exhibitedsome degree of cognitive impairment relative to HCs, no significant differences between theBP and MJBP groups were apparent, providing no evidence of an additive negative impactof BPD and MJ use on cognition. Additionally, ecological momentary assessment analysesindicated alleviation of mood symptoms in the MJBP group after marijuana use; MJBP par-ticipants experienced a substantial decrease in a composite measure of mood symptoms.Findings suggest that for some bipolar patients, marijuana may result in partial alleviation ofclinical symptoms. Moreover, this improvement is not at the expense of additional cognitiveimpairment.

In those affected, BPD is often a significant source of distress and burden on relatives and caregivers[1]. Further, among Axis I pathologies, BPD carries the highest risk of substance use comorbid- ity, which can complicate the course of illness and impact treatment outcomes. In fact, patients with co-occurring BPD and substance use often experience poor treatment response, relapse ofmood symptoms, psychosocial difficulties, and reduced treatment compliance [ 2-4]. Despite evidence that suggests substance use is linked to poorer outcomes, some studies have also shown that BPD patients engage in substance use to improve clinical symptoms. Bolton andcolleagues [ 5] found that almost a quarter of those with mood disorders used alcohol or drugs to relieve symptoms, with the highest rates of self-medication seen in bipolar I disorder. In another study, the authors found that specifically amongst BPD patients who use substances, 79% engaged in drug use specifically to improve mood symptoms [ 6]. Marijuana (MJ) is the most commonly used illicit substance in the US; this statistic also holds true among those diagnosed with BPD [ 7]. Moreover, rates of MJ use disorders in BPD patients have been found to equal or exceed those of alcohol abuse or dependence, particularlyin younger patients [ 8]. Research has also shown that 20 -50% of patients report some form of MJ-related problems [ 9]. In those who endorse MJ-related problems, 63.7% reported disability, as compared to only 44.5% of those not meeting criteria for MJ use disorders, supporting previ-ous findings that patients with BPD who engage in MJ use exhibit reduced compliance, higherlevels of illness severity, and increased likelihood to attempt suicide [ 4,7-8,10-12]. While these studies appear to suggest that MJ use results in negative outcomes, a specific cause-and-effect relationship has yet to be determined. Although many studies have reportedthat MJ use precedes the onset of BPD [ 13-16], it remains unclear whether MJ use contributes to the pathogenesis of the disorder, or if it is used to address symptomatology, perhaps as a form of premorbid self-medication [ 17-19], especially if traditional pharmacotherapeutic regi- mens are ineffective at symptom alleviation. Others have also reported that individuals with higher levels of illness severity may be at risk for MJ use after the onset of the disorder [ 20]. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between MJ use and the manifestation ofBPD symptoms. Despite claims of negative outcomes associated with MJ use, whether patients ' view MJ use as successful in symptom improvement is rarely assessed. In a single study of BPD patients, Weiss et al. [ 21] reported that nearly all patients initiated substance use as the result of one bipolar symptom, and the majority of patients reported improvement that was attributableto substance use for at least one symptom. Further, in a review of anecdotal reports of MJ use among BPD patients, the authors concluded that MJ was not utilized for the \"high\"sought out by recreational users, which may suggest that the effects of MJ are unique in sub-euphoricdoses [ 22]. Regardless of the motive for use, the fact remains that MJ use is common in patients with BPD. As noted above, patients with BPD who use MJ have been shown to have higher ill- ness severity and poorer outcome, yet report subjective improvement in symptoms after usingMJ, suggestive of a complex relationship between MJ and mood [ 23]. Taken together, these data provide evidence that some patients with BPD may derive a clinical benefit from using MJ and highlight the importance of understanding the effects of MJ on mood symptomatology inthose diagnosed with affective disorders. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), utilized in the current study, allows for the investigation of real-time assessment of mood and related symptoms as well as repeated collec-tion of real-time data in participants' natural environment [ 24-25]. While most symptom assessments and diagnostic tools in both research and clinical settings rely on retrospective Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 2/2 3Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.recall of emotions and symptomatology using interviews and self-report questionnaires, EMA data is collected in naturalistic, real-world contexts and therefore offers improved ecological validity over traditional, retrospective methods. In fact, retrospective reports of mood havebeen shown to have a bias towards negative mood states such as anxiety, depression, and help-lessness [ 26]. Collecting data in real-time with EMA reduces error bias from retrospective assessment and limits the effects of recall bias and generalization of symptoms over a period of time (Shiffman et al., 2008). Additionally, in a review article assessing the contribution of EMAon psychopathology research, Myin-Germeys and colleagues [ 27] suggest that symptoms in psychiatric disorders are dynamic and can meaningfully fluctuate through the course of the day. Thus, the increased ecological validity of EMA tools can provide better insight into thephenomenology and etiology of psychopathology than retrospective techniques. Better under- standing of the development, maintenance, and progression of symptoms may lead to improved models of these disorders and help inform future treatment strategies [ 27]. Given a growing body of research indicating cognitive deficits associated with MJ use, it is also important to explore the impact of MJ across various cognitive domains. Interestingly, MJ users (without Axis I pathology) and BPD patients (who do not necessarily smoke MJ) havebeen shown to exhibit similar cognitive deficits. MJ use has been linked to impairments acrossa wide range of areas, including attention [ 28], memory [ 29-31], IQ [ 32-34], and executive function [ 35-37]. Similarly, BPD patients often evidence cognitive deficits across multiple overlapping domains; in two meta-analyses of euthymic BPD patients [ 38-39], the authors note marked impairment relative to healthy controls on measures of executive function, verbal memory, and attention. Despite the fact that MJ use and a diagnosis of BPD are both individu- ally related to cognitive deficits, two studies examining neurocognitive function in MJ-smokingpatients with BPD report surprising outcomes. Both Ringen et al. 40] and Braga, Burdick, DeRosse, and neuropsychological func- tioning and MJ use in BPD patients, perhaps suggestive of a unique relationship between BPDand MJ use. Specifically, Ringen and colleagues [ 40] examined a variety of cognitive domains, including psychomotor speed, attention, working memory, executive functioning, and verbal learning. Overall, BPD patients who used MJ demonstrated better performance than patients who did notuse MJ, although statistically significant results were only observed on tests of executive function. Similarly, Braga et al. [ 41] reported neurocognitive advantages in MJ-smok- ing BPD patients, relative to a non-smoking BPD group, spanning several domains, including executive function (Trails B) as well as attention and working memory. These results suggestthat despite a more severe clinical course, BPD patients who use MJ may demonstrate a cogni- tive advantage relative to patients without a history of MJ use, underscoring the need for addi- tional investigation. Through EMA and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, the current study aimed to clarify the relationship between acute MJ use and mood symptoms as well as cognitive function in patients with BPD. In order to accurately assess the impact of MJ use, BPD diagnosis, andthe additive effects of both MJ use and BPD, we utilized a four-group study design enrollinghealthy control subjects without MJ use or Axis I disorders (HC), MJ smokers without other Axis I disorders (MJ), individuals diagnosed with BPD without a history of MJ use (BP), and those diagnosed with BPD who currently used MJ (MJBP). We expected, in line with previousresearch, that the BP and MJBP groups would have more severely affected mood overall rela- tive to the HC group. However, we further hypothesized that the MJBP group would experi- ence significant mood improvement secondary to MJ use. In addition, although previousstudies have shown that MJ use is related to cognitive deficits, there is a relative paucity of liter- ature focused on the association between MJ use and cognitive function in patients with BPD. Therefore, the current study also aimed to determine whether MJ use has a differential effect Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 3/2 3on cognitive performance in pure MJ smokers, BPD patients who smoke MJ (MJBP), and BPD patients who do not use MJ (BP). Materials and Methods Prior to participation, study procedures were thoroughly explained. All participants were alsorequired to read and sign an informed consent form, a document that describes the procedures, risks, benefits, and voluntary nature of the study. This study and all study procedures wereapproved by the McLean Hospital Institutional Review Board. Participants As part of a larger study conducted between 2008 and 2014, 21 healthy control subjects (HC),23 MJ smokers without other Axis 1 pathology (MJ), 18 individuals with bipolar I disorder who do not smoke MJ (BP), and 12 individuals diagnosed with bipolar I disorder who smoke MJ (MJBP), were enrolled and completed neuropsychological assessments. A subset of theseparticipants also completed daily EMA assessments over the course of four weeks to assessmood. Participants were not enrolled in the current study if they met criteria for any Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) Axis I pathology (with the exception of bipolar I disorder in the BPD groups, and MJ abuse/dependence in the MJ-smoking groups), as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Patient Edition (SCID-P) [ 42]. Individuals were also excluded if they reported a neurological disorder or significant medicalproblems, significant head injury with loss of consciousness, or were non-native English speak- ers (as necessitated by the cognitive assessment battery). Further, no participant was enrolled if they reported more than 15 lifetime uses of any illicit drugs (except MJ for the smoking groups)or recreational use of prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications, or had receivedelectroconvulsive therapy. Subjects enrolled in the MJ and MJBP groups were all well-characterized as chronic MJ smokers who reported smoking a minimum of 2,500 times in their lives, used MJ at least fourout of the last seven days and tested positive for urinary cannabinoids. In order to ensure that cognitive test results were not affected by acute intoxication, all participants were also required to abstain from MJ use for at least twelve hours prior to study visits. Upon arrival, all individu-als were required to provide a urine sample and, to ensure adherence to the twelve-hour absti- nence requirement, were led to believe that this sample could be used to detect use within this time frame. This method has previously been used by our laboratory with success [ 36,43-44]. Subjects were assessed for most recent use and any who violated the abstinence schedule or who appeared even vaguely intoxicated were rescheduled for a later date. An aliquot of the urine sample was sent to an outside laboratory for quantification of urinary cannabinoid con-centration via gas chromatography -mass spectrometry during the initial and final study visit. Urinary THC levels were averaged across the two study visits. Study Design and Measures After completing diagnostic assessments, subjects who met inclusion criteria were enrolled inthe four-week study, which contained a baseline visit and four weekly check-in visits. This study employed a combination Time-Based EMA design and Event-Based Monitoring [ 24- 25]. The Time-Based EMA employed an alarm schedule, which alerted participants to com- plete three rating sessions per day. Each subject pre-selected three times throughout the day (at least five hours apart), which were tailored to his/her typical daily schedules, to rate their mood. In Event-Based Monitoring, EMA measures are triggered by the occurrence of a specific Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 4/2 3event. For this study, participants were instructed to complete rating scales as soon as possible after MJ use in order to assess the acute impact of MJ on mood. At the end of their initial screening study visit, all enrolled participants were issued a Palm Pilot (Palm Tungsten T5 PalmOne PDA) and instructed to use the device to rate their moodthree times daily over the course of the four-week study. All individuals rated their mood using a custom-designed application, which contained electronic versions of several clinical rating scales: the Profile of Mood States (POMS) [ 45], which yields subscores for vigor, anger, confu- sion, tension, fatigue, depression, and a composite score for total mood disturbance (TMD); the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) [ 46]; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [ 47]; and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) [ 48]. Participants who smoked MJ were also asked to use the device to record episodes of MJ use to allow for the cal- culation of pre- and post-MJ use mood changes. More specifically, for each episode of MJ use, participants recorded the amount (in grams), frequency, and mode of MJ use (bong, bowl,joint, etc.). Date and time were automatically recorded at the completion of each scale in order to assist with accurate pre- and post-smoking determinations. However, participants were also given the option to adjust the time of last MJ use when completing post-use ratings. Only rat-ings identified as being completed within four hours of MJ use were categorized as post-MJ useand used for analysis. To ensure that participants were not arbitrarily answering clinical rating questions, \"quality control \"questions were interspersed throughout the scales, with such ques- tions such as \"who is the current US president? \"and\"how thoughtfully are you answering these questions? \" In order to establish an estimate of overall intellectual functioning, participants completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) [ 49]. In addition, all individuals enrolled also completed a neuropsychological battery designed to assay a variety of cognitive domains. Neuropsychological assessments were typically completed by the end of the first check-in visit, and consisted of a number of measures including the Wisconsin Card SortingTest (WCST), Trail Making Test, Stroop Color Word Test, the Controlled Oral Word Associa-tion Test (COWAT), and Digit Span, which served as direct measures of executive function. The WCST assesses the ability to form abstract concepts, shift and maintain set, and utilize feedback, and is considered a gold-standard measure of executive function [ 50-51]. The Trail Making Test is comprised of two parts; while Trails A measures visual scanning and psycho- motor speed, Trails B serves as a measure of cognitive set-shifting and attention [ 51]. The Stroop measures the ability to establish competing response tendencies, inhibit inappropriateresponses, and resist interference [ 52]. The COWAT consists of two parts and serves as a mea- sure of phonemic verbal fluency and executive function (participants must generate words starting with the specific letters F, A, and S) as well as verbal memory function (participants arerequired to generate words from a specific semantic category, in this case \"Animals \")[53-54]. The Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \u2014Revised (WAIS-R), requires subjects to recall increasingly longer strings of numbers in forward and then backwardorder, and reflects attention, working memory and executive functioning [ 55-56]. Study participants also completed additional cognitive measures, including the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF), and Hooper Visual Organization Test (HVOT). The CVLT-II requires subjects to learn an orally presentedlist of words across five trials to assess verbal learning [ 57]. Errors and clustering strategies (i.e., grouping list items by category) are also documented to assess efficiency of learning. Further, the CVLT incorporates a delay trial, in which individuals are required to remember the list ofwords after a 20-minute delay in order to assess verbal memory. The ROCF assesses visual-spa- tial organization as well as visual memory and requires individuals to copy a complex figure and then draw it from memory both immediately and after a twenty-minute delay [ 51]. Finally, Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 5/2 3the HVOT, a measure of visuoperception, requires participants to name objects in drawings that have been \"cut\"into pieces [ 58]. In addition, study participants completed the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) [ 59] in order to assess current level of nicotine use and level of dependence. The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) [ 60] was administered to calculate days of alcohol use within the past month. In order to assess average frequency and magnitude of MJ use, a modified timeline follow-back procedure [ 61] was utilized at weekly study visits, with a specific focus on the past week of use. Participants were asked to report the number of times they smoked MJ, the amount of MJ used (in grams) and the mode of use each time (i.e., joint, blunt, bong, etc.). Lifetime use was also assessed using the SCID-P and guided substance use interviews. Statistical Analyses In order to ensure that groups were well-matched, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs)with Scheff\u00e9 all pairwise post hoc comparisons (two-tailed) were used to compare the four groups on all continuous demographic variables: age, IQ, ASI alcohol use (days/month), and FTND. As analyses identified age as a potential confounding variable, analyses of covariance(ANCOVAs) controlling for age were performed for all comparisons in which age was signifi- cantly different between the groups. In addition, chi-squared analyses were used to compare the sex frequencies between the four groups and to compare medication in the BP and MJBPgroups. One-way ANOVAs (two-tailed) were conducted to compare age of BP onset in the BP and MJ BP groups, as well as MJ use variables in the MJ and MJBP groups, including age of MJ onset (defined as first regular use: a measurable, consistent pattern of use that occurred at least monthly); frequency of MJ use (average number of smoking episodes per week); magnitude ofMJ use (average amount, in grams, used each week); duration of use (number of years since onset of regular MJ use); and urinary THC concentration (ng/mL). EMA analyses Average mood scores over the entire four-week EMA data collection period were calculated for all clinical rating scales for each individual. Additionally, for MJ-smoking participants (MJ &MJBP groups), clinical rating scales were coded to indicate whether each rating was collected before (pre) or after (post) MJ use and, with this information, \"average pre-MJ use \"and\"aver- age post-MJ use \"ratings scales were calculated for each individual. As previously mentioned, a four-hour threshold was utilized, such that all scales completed within four hours of MJ use were coded as post-MJ use ratings. Ratings completed before MJ use each day, as well as those completed in excess of four hours after MJ use were labeled as pre-MJ use ratings. In an effortto obtain at least one daily baseline rating per day, participants were asked to complete their first set of clinical rating scales prior to smoking MJ. Obtaining overall mood rating averages for each individual, as well as pre- and post-MJ use ratings in the MJ and MJBP participants,provided the opportunity to conduct several levels of analyses in order to assess the unique effects of MJ and BPD on mood, as described below. One-way ANCOVAs controlling for age were used to analyze differences between the four groups. In order to reduce the number of unnecessary pairwise comparisons, one-tailed Dun-netttpost hoc comparisons were employed to compare each group to the HC control group. More specifically, to assess the effects of MJ use on both mood and cognition, the HC and MJ groups were directly compared. Similarly, the effect of BPD was examined by comparing theHC group to the \"pure\"BP group. The additive effect of MJ use and BPD was assessed by com- paring the HC group to the MJBP group, and additional one-way ANCOVAs (one-tailed) were also conducted in order to compare the BP group to the MJBP group. These analyses were Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 6/2 3performed on the overall average mood ratings from the EMA data and, to determine whether significant between-groups differences in overall mood were affected by MJ use, ANCOVAs were repeated using the pre-MJ use average mood ratings, and again using the post-MJ useaverage mood ratings from the MJ-using groups (MJ and MJBP). In addition, in order to inves-tigate the acute effects of MJ on mood within both the MJ and MJBP groups, pre-MJ use aver- age mood scores were compared to post-MJ use average mood scores using paired ttests (one- tailed) in each of these two groups separately. EMA compliance analyses and controlling for missing data. Compliance checks were completed during weekly visits and involved saving the EMA data from the PDA to ensure that subjects were completing the majority of their scales. Subjects were informed of their level ofcompliance at each check-in visit and were encouraged to complete as many scales as possible during the following week. Overall compliance percentages were calculated for each subject. One-way ANOVAs with two-tailed Scheff\u00e9 all pairwise post hoc comparisons were used toassess compliance percentage differences between the four groups. Additionally, two-tailed Pearson correlations between compliance percentage and EMA average rating scales were used to ensure that missing data did not significantly impact or skew the study findings. Neuropsychological assessment statistical analyses. To examine the effect of BPD on cognition, regardless of MJ use status, one-way two-group ANCOVAs (2-tailed) controlling for age were performed to compare HC participants to participants with BPD (BP and MJBP groups all-pairwise post com-parisons (2-tailed) also conducted to compare the HC, BP, and MJBP participants. These three-group analyses assessed the impact of BPD on cognition exclusive of MJ use (HC vs BP), and addressed any potential additive effects of MJ use in BP patients (HC vs MJBP and BP vsMJBP). Results Demographics Demographics are reported in Table 1 . ANOVAs of demographic variables between the four groups revealed that the groups were well matched for IQ and alcohol use (days/month).Between-group differences were noted for age ( F(3,70) = 5.819, p= .001); Scheff\u00e9 post hoc comparisons indicated that the BP subjects were significantly older than both HC ( p= .029), and MJ ( p= .002) participants. Accordingly, age differences were controlled for by utilizing ANCOVAs in all analyses of mood and cognitive performance. Chi-squared analyses indicated that the groups were not well matched for sex ( X 2(3,N= 74) = 11.628, p= .009) with the MJBP group having a significantly lower percentage of females than the HC ( X2(1,N= 33) = 8.972, p = .003) and BP groups ( X2(1,N= 30) = 6.914, p= .009). Average scores on the FTND reflected very low nicotine use across the groups. However, between-group differences were noted ( F (3,70) = 6.335, p= .001); the MJBP group the HC ( p= .019) and BP ( p= .004) groups. All of the other groups reported sim- ilar FTND scores to one another, and given such low use indicated by the total scores, even for the MJBP group ( M= 1.92, SD= 3.00), it is nicotine use was a confound for subse- quent analyses. Analyses of medication use revealed that the BP and MJBP groups reported similar medica- tion regimens ( Table 2 ). No significant differences were noted for the frequency of use of different classes of medications: mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodi-azepines. There were also no significant differences between the BP and MJBP groups for the number of medicated vs unmedicated patients within each group. In addition, the BP and MJBP groups were well-matched for age of BPD onset. With regard to MJ use characteristics, Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 7/2 3the MJ and MJBP groups were also well-matched for age of MJ onset ( Table 1 ), as well as cur- rent levels of MJ use. In fact, no significant differences emerged between groups for frequency (smokes/week) and magnitude of MJ use (grams/week), duration of MJ use (years since onset of regular use), or urinary THC levels (ng/mL). EMA Results EMA compliance results and controlling for missing data. Across all groups, high levels of compliance were noted for rating scale completion, with the average overall number of com- pleted rating scales at 88% of all possible rating opportunities. Within the HC group, EMA rat-ing compliance indicated that they completed 94% of scales, while the BP completed 90%, and the MJ and MJBP groups each completed 84% of scales. Notably, the MJ and MJBP groups both were required to complete more rating scales than the non-smoking groups, as they ratedtheir mood three times daily in addition to completing ratings after MJ use. Therefore, it is notTable 1.

Two- tailed Scheff\u00e9 all pairwise post hoc comparisons revealed that these differences were driven bya trend in which the MJ group exhibited lower percentages for completion of EMA ratings(M= 83.71, SD= 19.29) were not significantly different from the other groups. However, due to the significant between-groupdifferences, EMA analyses were re-run with compliance percentage as a covariate, and results remained unchanged. Further, in order to determine the nature of missing EMA data, correla- tion analyses were also conducted to assess the association between compliance percentage andEMA clinical ratings. Compliance percentage did not significantly correlate with any clinical rating scale ( r(59)/C20.203, p/C21.12), suggesting that ratings were missing at random, and therefore missing EMA data did not unduly influence clinical mood ratings results. Between-group analyses. Overall average mood ratings from across the 4-week data col- lection period are presented in Table 3 . As expected, compared to the HC group, BP and MJBP participants reported higher levels of anger, confusion, tension, fatigue, depression, and totalmood disturbance (TMD) as measured by the POMS, as well as increased anxiety (HAM-A),depression (MADRS), and mania (YMRS). Among patients, those in the BP group reported similar overall mood to MJBP participants, with no significant differences observed on any rat- ing scale, with the exception of higher MADRS scores in the MJBP group. Despite this differ-ence, depression ratings on the POMS were similar between groups, and actually were slightly (albeit not significantly) lower in the MJBP group relative to the BP group. With regard to the MJ group, no significant differences were noted between MJ smokers and HCs for averagemood ratings. Analyses of average pre-MJ use mood data in the MJ and MJBP group compared to overall average mood in the HC and BP group are presented in Table 4 (top portion of table); analyses of average post-MJ mood data in the MJ and MJBP group compared to overall average mood in the HC and BP group are presented in Table 4 (bottom half of table). Prior to smoking MJ, the MJBP participants reported higher levels of anger, confusion, tension, depression, and TMD on the POMS, as well as greater anxiety, depression, and mania as measured by the HAM-A,MADRS, and YMRS, relative to the average mood ratings of the HC participants. After smok- ing MJ, while some significant differences remained between the MJBP and HC groups, the MJBP group no longer endorsed significantly higher anger, tension, or TMD on the POMS rel-ative to the HCs. Notably, the MJ participants did not report significantly different mood rat- ings compared to the HC participants either pre- or post-MJ use. Two-group ANCOVAs directly comparing the BPD patient groups (BP vs MJBP; Table 4 ) revealed that prior to MJ use, MJBP participants exhibited higher depression (MADRS) scores and a trend for higher mania (YMRS) ratings relative to the BP group. Interestingly, after smoking MJ , the MJBP group reported decreased levels of depression and mania; MADRS scores fell to a level no longer significantly different from ratings in the BP group, and thetrend for higher mania ratings on the YMRS was no longer observed in MJBP participants rela- tive to BP participants. In addition, the MJBP group reported a trend for lower levels of tension on the POMS after MJ use compared to BP patients. Together, these decreases in clinical symp-toms led to far lower TMD scores in the MJBP group after MJ use, relative to the BP group 's average TMD score (MJBP: 11.15 vs BP: 22.53); however, this difference was not statistically significant. Within-group analyses. Paired ttests investigating within-group mood changes pre- and post MJ use suggest that after smoking MJ, the MJ smokers experienced slightly worse mood overall. As a group, they reported significantly increased confusion and fatigue, and decreased Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 9/2 3vigor on the POMS, resulting in higher TMD scores relative to pre-smoking levels. It is of note, however, that their average TMD scores still fell below zero, reflecting very low levels of mood-related symptomatology overall. MJ smokers also reported higher levels of anxiety (HAM-A) after MJ use ( Fig 1A ). In contrast, the MJBP participants reported positive changes in mood after MJ use. Paired ttests comparing pre- and post-MJ use mood ratings within the MJBP group indicated significantly decreased ratings of anger, tension, depression, and TMD scoreson the POMS as well as lower levels of depression on the MADRS. In addition, MJBP partici- pants reported increased vigor on POMS use ( Fig 1B of BPD on cognition (regardless of MJ use status). When all BPD patients (BP and MJBP combined) were compared to the HC group, they generally demon-strated poorer performance on tasks of executive function. Specifically, as noted in Table 5 , 2-way ANCOVAS revealed that patients with BPD achieved fewer categories, made more per- severation errors and had more losses of set on the WCST. Patients with BPD had significantly longer completion times and made more errors on the Stroop during the Color Naming andWord Reading condition. They also demonstrated slightly slower completion times on the Stroop Interference condition relative to the HCs, although this did not reach statistical signifi- cance. Similarly, BPD patients also performed Trails B significantly more slowly and exhibitedTable 3.

BPD patients achieved lower total scores across the three trials of the COWAT in which they had to generate words starting with a given letter (F, A, S); during the semantic category trial (animals) a trend was also observed for fewer words generated among BPD patients. In addition, BPD patients recalled fewer digits on DigitSpan overall, including recollection of digits in forward order (Forward) and in reverse order(Backward), which led to lower Total Digit Span scores. On the remaining measures, BPD patients also tended to demonstrate reduced perfor- mance. Despite similar scores on the copy condition of the ROCF, they exhibited slightly lowerscores on the immediate recall condition, and achieved significantly lower scores on delayed recall relative to the HCs. On the CVLT, BPD patients recalled fewer words during the initial learning trial (Trial 1), as well as across all five trials (Trial 1 -5 Total Correct), and after the Long Delay. They also used less semantic clustering on the CVLT across the five trials (Trial 1-5 Total Semantic Clusters). No significant differences in performance were apparent on the HVOT. HC vs BP: Effects of BPD on cognition (exclusive of MJ use). Post hoc analyses from a three-way ANCOVA comparing HC, BP and MJBP patients revealed that, relative to HCs, the non-MJ smoking BP participants (BP group only) demonstrated similar deficits when exam- ined separate from the MJBP group as when grouped with MJBP participants (see Table 5 ). The BP group exhibited poorer performance across the majority of assessment measures. Non- MJ smoking BP patients achieved significantly fewer categories on the WCST; they also made more perseverative errors, and had more losses of set, although this did not reach the thresholdfor significance. Participants in the BP group also made more errors on the Stroop Color Nam- ing and Word Reading subtests. They took significantly longer to complete Trails B, and exhib- ited a trend for more Trails B errors. Further, they recalled slightly fewer digits across on DigitSpan Backwards, which contributed to significantly lower scores on the Total Digit Span scores among BPD patients relative to HCs.

Similar to our previous report of MJ smokers [ 43], two-way ANCOVAs directly comparing MJ smokers to HCs demonstrated that pure MJ smokers exhibited impairment on a number of tasks relative to HCs, including the WCST, Trail Making Test, COWAT, and CVLT (See Table 6 ). Specifi- cally, as noted in the BPD patients, MJ smokers demonstrated poorer executive functioning rel-ative to controls. They achieved fewer categories and made more perseverative errors on the WCST, and took longer to complete Trails B of the Trail Making Test. MJ smokers generated fewer words than HCs on the COWAT when asked to provide words in a given semantic cate-gory. On the CVLT, although MJ smokers recalled a similar number of correct words, they had more Intrusions (incorrect responses) and utilized less semantic clustering across trials (Total Semantic Clusters). HC and MJ participants did not differ significantly with regard to their per-formance of the Stroop Color Word Test, Digit Span, ROCF, or HVOT. HC vs MJBP and BP vs MJBP: Potential additive effects of BPD and MJ use. Post hoc analyses from three-way ANCOVAs (HC vs BP vs MJBP) designed to detect potential additiveeffects of BPD and MJ use revealed that MJBP patients demonstrated some areas of poorer cog-nitive performance relative to HCs (see Table 5 , HC vs MJBP). They achieved fewer categories on the WCST and their performance suggests a trend for making more perseverative errors on this task. On the Stroop, significantly slower times were noted relative to HCs on the ColorNaming subtest, while on the CVLT, MJBP participants recalled significantly fewer wordsTable 5.

In fact, Scheff\u00e9 all pairwise post hoc comparisons revealed no significant between-group differences for BP vs MJBP participantsfor ROCF, Digit Span, or HVOT. Discussion The current investigation, to our knowledge, marks the first study to examine the effects of MJ on both mood and neuropsychological performance in BPD patients. As the nation explores indications for medical MJ (MMJ), it is imperative to determine how MJ use might affect clini- cal symptoms in those diagnosed with mood disorders, such as BPD. In addition, given the factthat cognitive decrements are well-documented in both MJ smokers [ 43,62-64] and those with BPD [ 39,65], it is critical to examine whether these impairments may be exacerbated or possibly ameliorated by the combination of a BPD diagnosis and regular MJ use. Through theutilization of proper control groups (achieved by including four discrete groups: healthy con- trols, MJ smokers with no Axis I pathology, non-MJ smoking BP patients, and MJ-smoking BP patients), the current study was able to begin to clarify both the individual effects and potentialfor additive effects of MJ use and BPD on mood and cognition. As hypothesized, our findings suggest that after smoking MJ, BPD patients experienced improvement in several aspects of clinical state secondary to MJ use. In fact, direct analyses of the MJ-smoking BPD patients (MJBP) before andafter MJ use revealed notable symptom alle- viation within four hours of smoking. After smoking MJ, the MJBP group reported signifi- cantly lower scores of anger, tension, depression (POMS and MADRS), as well as higher levels of vigor, which led to a marked decrease in TMD scores (22.39 to 11.15), a composite measureof overall mood on the POMS. Further, prior to smoking MJ, the MJBP participants reported slightly worse levels of symptomatology relative to the pure BP group, with higher levels of depressive and manic symptoms. In contrast, after MJ use, the MJBP group demonstrated con-siderably lower levels of tension and lower TMD scores relative to the BP group. In addition, although depression (MADRS) and mania scores were still slightly higher in the MJBP group after MJ use relative to the BP group, scores dropped to levels that were no longer significant or approaching significance between the two groups, highlighting positive changes in mood-related symptoms. In addition, average mood ratings across the course of the study showed that overall mood was comparable between MJBP and BP subjects. Although MADRS scores were generally elevated in MJBP patients, POMS scores for depression were similar betweengroups (and were actually marginally lower within MJBP participants). As the MADRS reflects specific depressive symptoms, as compared to the POMS which measures self-perceived mood, results may indicate that while certain depressive symptoms were more evident in MJBP partic-ipants relative to BP participants, a self-perceived mood of depression (i.e., feeling sad, lonely, blue) was not more prevalent in MJBP participants. To some extent, these findings support recent work, which found that MJ use was correlated with increased positive affect in BPD patients [ 66]. However, the authors also observed a rela- tionship between MJ use and increased manic and depressive symptoms. Although the authors of this study report both positive and negative fluctuations in clinical symptoms, they posit that bidirectional effects of MJ use, outlined by Ashton and colleagues [ 22], are likely impacted by a range of factors, including dose, mode of use, and personality differences. In addition, as we learn more about the differential effects of individual constituents of MJ, (i.e., THC vs can- nabidiol [CBD]), it is possible that strains higher in certain constituents are at least partially Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 16 / 23responsible for the moderation of specific dimensions of clinical symptoms. Some research suggests that CBD may be beneficial in alleviating, anxiety, psychosis, and other psychological symptoms [ 67-70] and may have a pharmacological profile similar to that of antipsychotic medications [ 69], which are often prescribed to patients with bipolar I disorder. Further, CBD has been shown to be an effective anticonvulsant treatment for those with pediatric seizure dis- orders [ 70], another class of drugs frequently prescribed for mood stabilization in patients with BPD. Interestingly, among pure MJ smokers (those not diagnosed with BPD), beneficial effects on mood were notobserved in the current study. MJ smokers reported decreases in vigor, as well as higher levels of confusion, fatigue and TMD after smoking, consistent with effects com-monly reported in the general population after MJ use. It is of note, however, that MJ smokers continued to exhibit very low levels of mood-related symptoms even after MJ use, suggesting that while their mood did appear to worsen slightly after using MJ, these changes remained farbelow clinical thresholds. Overall, results may indicate that MJ use may have unique effects in BPD patients, effects which are not necessarily observed in those without Axis I pathology. With regard to cognitive performance, MJ smokers and BPD patients performed more poorly than HCs overall. However, within the BPD patients, impairment was observed regard- lessof MJ use status; deficits were apparent when the non-smoking BP patients were analyzed as a whole group (BP and MJBP) as well as separately (BP vs MJBP). Overall, patients in both BPD groups demonstrated poorer performance on tasks of executive function. They also exhib-ited less efficient learning and recall strategies during a serial list-learning task, reduced verbal fluency, inferior attention and working memory, and poorer visuospatial organization. Inter- estingly, when the non-smoking BP group was compared to the MJBP group, no significant dif-ferences across any measure were noted. Taken together, study findings suggest that MJ use may result in at least short-term mood term stabilization for a subset of BPD patients, and fur- ther, that MJ use does not have an additive, negative impact on cognitive performance in BPDpatients. These findings provide a valuable contribution to the field, which has only begun to clarify the effects of MJ on mood and cognition in psychiatric populations. While many would posit that the individual relationships between cognitive impairment and both MJ use and BPDwould collectively result in a more severe impact on cognitive function, some studies have actu- ally reported a cognitive advantage in BPD patients who use MJ regularly [ 40-41]. In addition, a recent study of MJ-smoking patients diagnosed with schizophrenia found no evidence for anadditive effect of MJ use and schizophrenia diagnosis on cognitive dysfunction [ 71]. In combi- nation, these studies provide evidence that cognitive deficits associated with certain Axis I pathologies may not be worsened by MJ use. In fact, improved cognitive performance may berelated to the potential anxiolytic effects of MJ. Anxiety, common in BPD patients [ 72], often interferes with attention and the ability to encode information, suggesting that if MJ acts as an anxiolytic in at least a subset of patients, this may result in better concentration and enhancedcognitive performance. Despite these positive changes, one previous study also observed that patients tended to experience improved cognitive performance at the expense of a more severe clinical course [41]. While the current study did not examine long-term treatment outcomes, our preliminary findings provide evidence that BPD patients who smoke MJ may derive at least a short-term clinical benefit. MJBP participants reported improvements in mood within four hours of smok- ing MJ, did not have elevated average mood ratings (with the exception of the MADRS) relativeto the BPD group across the four-week study, and did not experience additional cognitive defi- cits when compared to the non-smoking BP group. Future studies will need to be conducted in order to investigate the effect of MJ use on clinical course over longer durations of time. Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 17 / 23Limitations Data from the current study provide critical information about MJ use in psychiatric popula- tions, as guidelines regarding indications for medical MJ are considered; however, these find- ings must be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, although this study served as apilot investigation, it is important to acknowledge that the overall sample is moderate in size, with a modest number of patients completing EMA ratings, which may limit the generalizabil- ity of findings. For example, only participants who were well characterized as chronic, heavyMJ smokers were enrolled in the current study; participants with less frequent use (i.e., casual MJ smokers) may not experience the same effects of MJ on mood and cognition as observed in this sample of participants. Further, rather stringent enrollment criteria were employed, whichexcluded participants who reported comorbid diagnoses (via phone interview or through theclinical interview). In addition, participants were required to be predominantly euthymic throughout the course of the study. Although these criteria limited the effects of extraneous variables, the impact of MJ on mood and cognition may differ in those who have been diag-nosed with comorbid disorders (i.e., ADHD, PTSD, polysubstance use, etc.) or who may be experiencing more acute clinical symptomatology. Finally, likely related to the geographic region from which patients were recruited (the Greater Boston area is home to many universi-ties, hospitals, and research institutions), participants generally demonstrated higher than aver- age IQs. This may limit generalizability to populations with average to below average cognitive abilities. It will be important for future studies to recruit larger numbers of research partici-pants to further investigate the impact of MJ on mood and cognition in BPD, as well as toexamine additional factors that were not explored in the current pilot investigation. Additionally, although the four groups were not statistically matched for sex (more males were enrolled than females in the MJ and MJBP groups), it is likely that the sex distribution ofthis sample is actually representative of the larger population. In fact, national surveys of sub- stance-using populations have revealed that males engage in the use of illicit substances, including MJ, more frequently than females [ 73-74]. Regarding the EMA study design, overall compliance was very high among all study groups with an overall completion rate of 88% of all possible scheduled ratings. Several measures were also put in place to encourage completion of ratings after MJ use, including comparingreported frequency of MJ use during interim visits to the frequency of EMA ratings. However, given the nature of EMA data, it is not possible to guarantee that all participants completed mood ratings immediately after MJ use. In an attempt to address this issue, all participantswere asked to adjust the time of last use if necessary, and any ratings reported more than fourhours after MJ use were not coded as post-use data. While this four-hour window was selected to capture the acute effects of MJ use on mood, the duration of MJ effects are likely related to a range of factors including, but not limited to the specific product used (i.e. high THC/lowTHC), amount and frequency of use, mode of use, and metabolism. It may therefore be an important consideration for future studies to explore whether the duration of MJ intoxication is related to the duration of reported symptom improvement by BPD participants. Further, although this investigation examined the acute effects of MJ use in BPD patients, additional investigations should explore the potential long-term impact of MJ use on clinical state. It is of note that over the duration of the study, the overall average mood ratings for theMJBP and BP were not significantly different across any measure (except for the MADRS), which provides preliminary evidence that MJ use may not directly result in poorer clinical course. Higher levels of clinical severity previously reported in MJ-smoking BPD patients [ 4,8, 11] may be a result of several factors, including a failure to inform clinicians of MJ use. As MJ may partially address mood-related symptoms, the pharmacotherapeutic regimen prescribed Marijuana, Bipolar Disorder, Mood, and Cognition PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0157060 June 8, 2016 18 / 23by physicians may, as a result, be different from what would normally be prescribed. Addition- ally, any short-term improvement following MJ use may result in non-adherence with patients ' prescribed medications, which could ultimately result in poorer long-term outcomes. Due to the preliminary nature of the current study, the relationship between specific pat- terns or levels of MJ use and symptom improvement were not thoroughly investigated. In addi- tion, all MJ using participants in the current study were chronic MJ users and results may therefore not be generalizable to more casual MJ users. Future investigations should considerthe impact of frequency and amount of MJ smoked, as well as mode of use, and strain of MJ used on both cognition and symptomotology. In fact, several studies have shown promise for the alleviation of anxiety using MJ products that contain high levels of CBD [ 67-68]. Given that CBD is a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid that has shown promise as an anxiolytic and anticonvulsant (often used to stabilize mood in patients with BPD), high CBD-containing products may afford more viable options than other cannabinoid-based treatments. Therefore,future studies should also aim to explore whether high-CBD relative to low-CBD strains have differential effects in BPD patients as well as other clinical populations. Finally, it should be noted the current study design does not imply cause and effect, but rather shows a relationship between MJ use and mood improvement. Clinical trials will be needed in order to further investigate the potential for MJ and cannabinoid-containing prod- ucts as a potential treatment for patients with BPD. Conclusions New legislation across the nation has increased the overall accessibility of MJ to the general public for both recreational and medical use. To date, 24 states and the District of Columbia have fully legalized medical marijuana and another 18 states have allowed the use of CBD- based products for medical use. Each state individually regulates the use of MMJ, and perhapsnot surprisingly, a wide range of acceptable conditions are often listed as eligible for MMJ certi- fication. While some states include a \"catchall \"category, allowing physicians to certify condi- tions at their discretion, other states employ a restrictive list of indications suitable for MMJ.Additional studies are needed to help shape public policy regarding conditions that may beamenable to MMJ treatment, especially with regard to psychiatric illnesses. The current study highlights preliminary evidence that patients with BPD who regularly smoked MJ reported at least short-term clinical symptom alleviation following MJ use, indicating potential mood-stabilizing properties of MJ in at least a subset of patients with BPD. Furthermore, despite pre- vious research showing that MJ use and BPD individually can have a negative impact on cogni- tion, MJ use in BPD patients may notresult in additional impairment. Further research is warranted to explore the impact of MJ on mood in clinical and non-clinical populations. Supporting Information S1 File. Manuscript Database.

El-Mallakh, M.D.* Carl Brown, J.D.** Abstract- The effect of marijuana on bipolar disorder has nev\u00ad er been systemati cally evaluated. Subjective reports by patients suggest an overall positive effect, but these may be unreliable. We herein report a case in which mood data was prospectively collected over two years of total substance abstinence and two years of extreme marijuana use. Marijuana use did not alter the total number of days of abnormal mood, however, marijuana was associated with an increase in the number of hypomanic days and a decrease in the number of depressed days. While not conclusive, the data suggest that marijuana may indeed have an effect on mood in bipolar patients that needs to be systematical ly examined. Keywords-bipolar disorder, manic-depres sion, marijuana, prospective mood ratings Marijuana use is quite common in patients with bipolar iII ness (Goldberg et al. 1999) but its effect on the course of bipolar illness is not clear (Tondo et al. 1999; Grinspoon & Bakalar 1998). There have not been any systematic evalua\u00ad tions of objective or subjective consequences of marijuana in bipolar disorder. Recently, the authors had the opportunity to examine the effect of chronic marijuana use in a Type I hi polar individual keeping meticulous daily mood charts.

Mr. 8 utilized marijuana on a daily basis (maintaining a constant state of intoxication with I 0 joints or equivalent daily). In 2000, Mr. 8 was imprisoned for a crime committed during a manic period. His sentence mandated 12 months in federal prison and a one-year probationary period during which he did not use any marijuana. However, immediately after the end of the probation, Mr. B reinstituted his daily marijuana use. Mood charts for the four years (two years off marijuana and two years on marijuana) were prospectively recorded using the National Institute of Mental Health self-rating chart (a -4 to +4 scale). During most of these four years, pharmacologic management was kept constant, consisting of carbamazepine (1400 mg daily), lamotrigine (550 mg daily), and clonazepam (I mg daily). During the two years on marijuana use, Mr. B expe\u00ad rienced 299 depressed days hypomanic days (23.4%, modal score+ I). Depression was significantly less while using marijuana than the two years off marijuana (391 depressed days, 53.5%, modal score -4, z = 5.0, P < 0.0 I). Similarly, the hypomania oc\u00ad cupied significantly greater time while using marijuana than off (Ill hypomanic days, 15.2%, modal score +I, z = 3.9, P < 0.01). If the year in jail is excluded, and the year on probation is compared to the subsequent year, the results are not significantly different. Total number of depressed days while using marijuana was nonsignificantly less than the total number off marijuana (139 [38.1 %] vs. 160 days [43.8%1. respectively, z = 1.58, ns), while the total number of hypomanic days was significantly greater while using marijuana (I 04 [28.5% 1 vs. 67 [ 18.4% I days, z = 3.26, P < 0.01). The total number of ill days was not different (243 days while using marijuana vs. 227 days off marijuana, z = 1.19, ns). There were no full manic episodes in the entire four-year period. DISCUSSION This anecdotal prospective eval uation of the compara\u00ad tive effect of marijuana on the long-term course of bipolar illness suggests that heavy use is associated with a statisti\u00ad cally significant reduction in depressed time and a significant increase in hypomanic days compared to abstinence. It is of interest that when marijuana is associated with psychosis, it frequently presents with manic or hypomanic features (Chaudry et al. 1991; Rottanburg et al. 1982). Anecdotally, patients report that marijuana use provides sub jective mood Volume 39 (2), June 2007 Downloaded by [York University Libraries] at 17:24 17 November 2014 El-Mallakh & Brown stabilization (Grinspoon & Bakalar 1998) or antidepressant effect (Gruber, Pope & Brown 1996). In this case marijuana was not mood stabilizing sinc e the total number of ill days did not change. However, the relative decline in depressed days and increase in hypomanic days was felt subjectively as an antidepressant effect by the patient. The apparent hypomanic promoting effect is con\u00ad sistent with previous clinical reports (Chaudry et al. 1991; Rottanbur g et al. 1982). There are clearly problems with this case. The two years in which the subject abstained from marijuana were marked by imprisonment and probation-both of which Marijuana Use and Bipolar Disorder could have an adverse effect on mood. However, the pattern of depression and hypomania revealed the same cycling that had gone on before imprisonment and after the end of probation, suggesting that this did not play an overt role. Despite these considerations, this report suggests that preconceived notions that marijuana is depressogenic may need to be reexamined regarding its effect in bipolar patients. Similarly, the patient-promoted view that marijuana is mood stabilizing also needs to be reexamined. Clearly, larger stud\u00ad ies would be important and potentially enlightening.

These concerns are at least partly due to the strong increase in recreational and medical cannabis use and the rise in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels. Cannabis is widely used to self-medicate by older people and people with brain disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Objective: This review p r o v i d e s a n o v e r v i e w o f t h e p e r c e i v e d b e n e f i t s a n d a d v e r s e m e n t a l h e a l t h effects of cannabis use in people with ALS, MS, AD, PD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Results: The reviewed studies indicate that cannabis use diminishes some symptoms associated with these disorders. Cannabis use decreases pain and spasticity in people with MS, decreases tremor, rigidity, and pain in people with PD, and improves the quality of life of ALS patients by improving appetite, and decreasing pain and spasticity. Cannabis use is more common among people with schizophrenia than healthy controls. Cannabis use is a risk factor for schizophrenia which increases positive symptoms in schizophrenia patients and diminishes negative symptoms. Cannabis use worsens bipolar disorder and there is no evidence that bipolar patients derive any benefit from cannabis. In late stage Alzheimer's patients, cannabis products may improve food intake, sleep quality, and diminish agitation. Conclusion: Cannabis use diminishes some of the adverse effects of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, chronic cannabis use may lead to cognitive impairments and dependence. Keywords: Cannabis, dependence, cognition, neurological disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder. 1. INTRODUCTION Cannabis is one of the most widely used illicit drugs in the world. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that worldwide 3-5% of adults use cannabis [1]. The prevalence of cannabis use is very high in countries such as Ghana (21.5%), Zambia (17.7%), Canada (17.0%), the United States of America (US, 12.3%), and New Zealand (13.3%)[1]. It has been estimated that there are 20 million cannabis users in the US, including 1.2 million medical cannabis users [2, 3]. About 6 percent of Americans above the age of 18 will meet the DSM-5 criteria for cannabis use disorder at some point in their life [4]. In the US, federal law does not allow recreational or medical cannabis use. However, recreational and medical *Address correspondence to this author at the University of Florida, College of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, 1149 Newell Dr. Gainesville, FL, USA 32611; Tel: 352-294-4931; cannabis in an increasing number of states. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized the medical use of cannabis and 4 states have legalized its recreational use. It is expected that cannabis use will continue to increase as there is growing tolerance towards the use of cannabis and an increase in the number of patients who use cannabis for medical purposes [5]. Most cannabis studies have investigated the effects of cannabis in healthy adolescents and young adults. However, cannabis is also used recreationally by older adults and by patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders to alleviate symptoms associated with their disorder. A large study with participants from 31 countries showed that 24.1% of cannabis users are between the ages of 51 and 60, 5.8% between 61 and 70, and 0.6% are older than 70 [6]. Cannabis use has more than quadrupled among the 55-59 year olds (1.6 to 7.4%) and doubled among 60-64 year olds (2.4 to 4.4%) between 2002 and 2012 [7]. In addition to the increase in cannabis use in the elderly, there has also been an increase in the use of cannabis for the A R T I C L E H I S T O R Y Received: June 11, 2016 Revised: August 26, 2016 Accepted: October 28, 2016 DOI: 10.2174/1570159X14666161101095325 Pros and Cons of Medical Cannabis use by People with Chronic Brain Disorders Current Neuropharmacology, 2017, Vol. 15, No. 6 801 treatment of neurological disorders [8, 9]. This is in combination with the dramatic increase in THC levels in cannabis which could lead to an increase in the number of people who experience adverse mental health effects [10]. In addition to cannabis, cannabis-based treatments such as nabiximols (trade name Sativex, cannabis extract, 1:1 ratio dronabinol synthetic THC), and nabilone (trade name Cesamet, synthetic cannabinoid with chemical structure s i m i l a r t o T H C ) h a v e also been used by people with brain disorders. Both nabilone and dronabinol have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy for cancer and to stimulate appetite in AIDS patients with wasting syndrome. Nabiximols is already being used in 15 countries for the treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in the US, Sativex is being reviewed by the FDA for the treatment of cancer pain. The goal of this review is to provide insight into the potential beneficial and harmful effects of cannabis use and cannabis-based treatments in people with common neurological or psychiatric disorders and older individuals. 2. CANNABINOIDS Cannabis has been used in religious ceremonies and for medical purposes for thousands of years [11]. Cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychoactive component of cannabis, was isolated in the 1940s and its structure was established in the 1960s [12, 13]. It wasn't until 1964 that tetrahydro- cannabinol (THC) was isolated [14]. Cannabidiol does not induce and diminishes the psychotropic effects of THC [15, 16]. The cannabinoids can phytocannabinoids, endocannabinoids, and synthetic cannabinoids [17]. More than one hundred phytocannabinoids have been isolated but in most commercial cannabis strains, only THC is produced in high levels [18]. Another phyto- cannabinoid that is sometimes expressed at high levels is CBD. Furthermore, two endocannabinoids have been discovered, namely 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide [19-21]. Some synthetic cannabinoids have a much higher potency than THC and have been associated with severe adverse mental health effects [22]. Cannabinoids mediate their effects via the activation of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2) receptor. The endogenous ligands for these receptors are 2-AG and anandamide. The CB1 r e c e p t o r i s o n e o f t h e m o s t c o m m o n r e c e p t o r s i n t h e central nervous system. High levels of CB1 r e c e p t o r s h a v e been detected in the hippocampus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex and cerebellum the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex underscores the critical role of the cannabinoid system in the regulation of motor function and cognition [24]. The CB2 receptors are mostly found in the periphery (thymus and spleen), but they have also been detected on cerebellar and brain stem neurons [25]. Cannabinoid type 2 receptor levels are extremely low in the healthy brain but their levels increase after injury and inflammation [26, 27]. The CB2 receptors are mainly expressed on activated microglia, which play a critical role in the removal of dying cells but also induce the release of cytotoxic molecules that can lead to cell death [28, 29]. Activation of the CB2 receptor decreases the release of cytokines and chemokines and diminishes inflammation and cell death [30, 31]. 3. ANIMAL STUDIES Studies with animals have provided evidence for the fact that chronic exposure to cannabis smoke, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), or CB1 receptor agonists leads to the development of dependence. Cannabis withdrawal leads to somatic withdrawal signs (e.g., abdominal constriction, wet-dog shakes, head shakes, forepaw fluttering), anxiety-like behavior, and an increased release of the stress peptide corticotropin-releasing factor in the amygdala [32-35]. The negative affective state associated with drug withdrawal provides powerful motivation for the continuation of drug use [36, 37]. There is also extensive evidence that cannabis and THC impair memory and cognition in rodents. The eight-arm radial maze is a well validated test for investigating the neuronal mechanisms that underlie memory [38]. Nakamura et al. demonstrated that THC disrupts working memory in the radial maze test [39]. THC inhibits the release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus and this is likely one mechanism by which it impairs memory. This is supported by the observation that drugs that prevent the THC-induced decrease in acetylcholine release in the hippocampus also prevent memory impairments [40]. It has also been suggested that repeated THC administration leads to increased glutamate levels, which induces a downregulation of glutamate receptors and a reduction in the density of dendritic spines on hippocampal neurons. This may reduce synaptic plasticity and thereby cause memory impairments [41]. Memory impairments due to THC exposure may gradually diminish over time. In the above mentioned study by Nakamura et al., memory function returned to baseline levels after 4 weeks of abstinence [39]. Another study reported that memory function in mice was still impaired three weeks after the administration of one low dose of THC [42]. Therefore, this suggests that the memory function might recover after cannabis use, but only after an extended amount of time. 4. ACUTE EFFECTS OF CANNABIS USE Cannabis has a wide range of subjective effects. The effects may vary between light and heavy users and can include feelings of intoxication, euphoria, altered sensory perception, cognitive and perceptual distortions, anxiety, dizziness, and increased appetite [43]. The most reliable markers of acute cannabis exposure are intoxication and tachycardia [44]. In terms of cognitive processes, there is extensive evidence that acute cannabis exposure impairs attentional tasks, consolidation and retrieval of memory, working memory, verbal memory, learning, and executive functions [44]. Impaired performance has been consistently found in multiple aspects of attention, including sustained attention, divided attention, selective, and focused attention [45]. Additionally, studies have found executive dysfunction related to cannabis exposure, including disinhibition and impaired decision making [46]. Acute cannabis intoxication in healthy young people causes slower reaction times, impaired accuracy, and impaired response inhibition [47, 48]. Other frontal dysfunction that has been observed 802 Current Neuropharmacology, 2017, Vol. 15, No. 6 Suryadevara et al. includes decreased information processing s p e e d , p o o r planning, lack of self-monitoring, and inability to alter behaviors to suit changing tasks [49-51]. There can also be alterations in mathematical abilities and time perception, along with changes in the gross and fine motor skills [52, 53]. Taken together, these studies indicate that acute cannabis use affects emotional states and dramatically impairs cognitive processes and motor functions. 5. CHRONIC EFFECTS OF CANNABIS USE One of the main adverse effects of cannabis use is the development of dependence. In the US, almost 10% of adults use cannabis and one third users meet the criteria for cannabis use disorder [54]. Cannabis use disorder is characterized by a strong desire to use cannabis, using larger amounts than intended, and continued usage despite negative social and physical consequences, craving, tolerance and withdrawal [55]. It has been estimated that 30% of regular cannabis users and 50-95% of heavy users experience a cannabis withdrawal syndrome [56]. Cannabis withdrawal is characterized by anxiety, depression, irritability, decreased sleep quality along with the quantity and stomach pain [57, 58]. This negative affective state plays a critical role in the maintenance of drug addiction [37]. Studies that have evaluated the long term effects of cannabis use on cognition are sparse. In one study in which participants were followed from birth to age 38, persistent cannabis users had a 6 point reduction in IQ compared to non-users [59]. Some longitudinal studies have shown persistent adverse effects of cannabis use on neurocognitive performance. These effects depend on the length of abstinence, age at the onset, or cumulative lifetime exposure [60]. Significant psychomotor dysfunction has also been reported in chronic cannabis users [61]. Some recovery of cognitive function might occur after cessation of cannabis use. Adolescent cannabis users with 3 weeks of sobriety demonstrated resolution of learning and verbal memory deficits, but continued to have difficulty with attentional tasks [62]. In one longitudinal study in young adults, episodic memory improved over an eight year abstinence period [63]. Taken together, this indicates that chronic cannabis use can lead to loss of control over cannabis use and cognitive impairments, which may diminish gradually after a prolonged abstinence period. Chronic cannabis use can also lead to what is called an amotivational syndrome [64, 65]. This amotivational syndrome is characterized by apathy, lack of motivation, and poor educational performance. Animal studies suggest that the amotivational syndrome is due to a THC-induced dysregulation of dopaminergic systems [66]. This is supported by a study with human cannabis users that showed that cannabis users with the highest level of apathy had the lowest dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum [67]. 6. STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN CANNABIS USE There is extensive evidence for structural and functional abnormalities in young cannabis users. Chronic cannabis use leads to changes in gray (cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses) and white matter (myelinated neuronal tracts) architecture [68, 69]. There is some evidence that cannabis use may increase the volume of subregions of the cerebellum and amygdala in adolescents [70, 71]. The changes in the volume of these brain sites were associated with poor executive functioning (cerebellum) and internalizing problems (amygdala) [70, 71]. An increase in the volume of a brain site might be due to disrupted pruning of gray matter during a critical period in adolescence or possibly abnormal connectivity patterns that develop to compensate for cognitive deficits [72]. Although some studies reported that cannabis use can increase the size of brain regions, the great majority of the studies found that cannabis use decreases the volume of brain regions. Cannabis use-induced decreases in brain volume have been reported orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and amygdala [69, 73-76]. One of the most consistent findings has been that cannabis use decreases the volume of the hippocampus and this correlates with the amount of cannabis used and the level of dependence [77]. It should be noted that a recent study reported that daily cannabis use does not affect the volume of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, or cerebellum [78]. It was suggested that there was no effect of cannabis use on brain volumes because the study closely controlled for other factors that may affect the volume of specific brain sites, such as alcohol use. Taken together, conflicting findings about the effect of cannabis use on the volume of brain sites have been reported. Some of these differences might be due to difference in study design, comorbid drug use, and data analysis. Well controlled animal studies with young and old animals are urgently needed to evaluate the effects of cannabis smoke exposure on the volume of specific brain regions. Cannabis use is most common among adolescents and young adults and this period is also critical for brain myelination. Cannabinoid receptors are found on myelinating glial cells and are thought to play a role in white matter integrity and connectivity [79]. A number of studies that investigated neuronal tracts in the brain using diffusor tensor imaging have found reductions in white matter integrity throughout the frontal and temporal lobes in adolescent cannabis users [68, 80-82]. These abnormalities are associated with psychological symptoms and cognitive impairments. Chronic cannabis use also leads to impairments in cerebro- vascular functioning, which has been associated with an increased risk for stroke [83, 84]. There is a lack of data regarding the effects of cannabis use on the brain of the elderly. The vast majority of cannabis studies have been conducted with young adults. Given the rapid increase in the aging population, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the acute and long-term effects of cannabis use in this group. 7. CANNABIS AND AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease t h a t r a p i d l y p r o g r e s s e s a n d primarily affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. One of the first symptoms is muscle weakness in one part of the body, which then spreads to other parts. Furthermore, thirty to fifty percent of ALS patients have signs of cognitive impairments [85, 86]. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is very rare in people before the age of 40, and the median age at diagnosis is 65 for males and 67 for females Pros and Cons of Medical Cannabis use by People with Chronic Brain Disorders Current Neuropharmacology, 2017, Vol. 15, No. 6 803 [87]. The precise cause of ALS is unknown. However, several possible causes for ALS have been identified: 1) oxidative damage, 2) blockade of axonal transport by neurofilaments, 3) toxicity from intracellular aggregates, and 4) glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity [88]. Although it is not known what causes ALS, there is strong evidence that inflammation plays a role in its progression [89]. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been associated with changes in the endogenous cannabinoid system and cannabinoid receptor agonists may slow down the progression of ALS by decreasing inflammation. Animal studies have shown that endogenous cannabinoid levels are elevated in spinal cord of symptomatic ALS mice [90]. Interestingly, CB2 r e c e p t o r s , b u t n o t C B1 r e c e p t o r s , a r e upregulated in a mouse model for ALS (G93A-SOD1 mutant mice) [91]. This observation is in line with a recent study in which CB1 and CB2 recept or levels were assessed i n TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) mice [92]. These mice are considered an animal model for ALS [93]. TDP-43 aggregates have been detected in the brains of ALS patients and it has been suggested that these aggregates induce toxicity and cell death [94, 95]. Interestingly, in both male and female TDP-43 mice there is an upregulation of CB2, but not CB1, receptors in the spinal cord [92]. Treatment with THC, the synthetic CB1 a n d C B2 r e c e p t o r a g o n i s t W I N 5 5 , 2 1 2-2, and the selective CB2 agonist AM-1241 delays ALS progression in animal models [91, 96]. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of THC are diminished by CB1 r e c e p t o r b l o c k a d e [97]. Taken together, this suggests that both CB1 a n d C B2 agonists may slow down the progression of ALS. Cannabinoids target multiple neuronal pathways and exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. A post-mortem study showed that ALS patients have elevated CB2 receptor levels on microglia in the spinal cord [98]. Unfortunately, CB1 recept or l evel s were not assessed i n t he aforementioned study, but studies with animal models for ALS suggest that ALS is not associated with an upregulation of CB1 r e c e p t o r s [ 9 1 , 9 2 ] . M i c r oglia do not express CB2 receptors under baseline conditions but neuronal damage leads to microglia activation and the expression of CB2 receptors [99]. Clinical studies suggest that cannabis may improve ALS symptoms. There is evidence that cannabis helps with pain, spasticity, drooling, appetite loss, and sleep [100, 101]. In patients with respiratory failure due to ALS, cannabis may help by inducing bronchodilation [102, 103]. Overall, these studies suggest that cannabis diminishes ALS symptoms and thereby improve the quality of life of patients. Clinical studies indicate that ALS is associated with high levels of anxiety and depression [104-106]. Small amounts of cannabis may help people to relax, induces euphoria, and decreases anxiety and thereby could also increase the quality of life of ALS patients [107-109]. Overall, the reviewed studies suggest that cannabis use may diminish some of the symptoms associated with ALS and delay disease progression (See Table 1 for an overview). 8. CANNABIS AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central and peripheral nervous system [110, 111]. The symptoms (e.g., vision problems, muscle weakness, pain, balance problems, and paralysis) are due to uncontrolled or inappropriate n e u r a l t r a n s m i s s i o n t h a t g r a d u a l l y w o r s e n s when the disease progresses. During the early stage of the disease, patients may experience long periods during which they are relatively symptom free and these periods are interrupted by flare ups that lasts days to weeks. It has been suggested that cannabis, THC, nabiximols, and oral cannabis extract (OCE) may diminish spasticity associated with MS [112]. Thus far, one cannabis based drug (nabiximols) h a s been developed for the treatment of MS. Nabiximols is a mucosal spray that contains THC and CBD in a 1:1 ratio. The US FDA has approved nabiximols for clinical trials and it has been approved in several European countries, Canada, and New Zealand for the treatment of spasticity associated with MS. Animal studies show that cannabinoid receptor agonists diminish tremors and spasticity in mouse models for MS [113]. Preclinical studies suggest that spasticity associated with MS is diminished by CB1, but not CB2, receptor agonists [114]. Cannabinoids have neuroprotective due action on microglial cells [115, 116]. Medical cannabis has been shown to decrease spasticity and pain in MS patients but it has negative effects on posture and balance [117, 118]. Furthermore, both nabiximols and THC decrease spasticity in MS patients [119, 120]. Oral cannabis extract has proven to be very effective for the treatment of central pain [119]. In addition to this, people with MS often suffer from severe bladder dysfunction due to the disruption of neuronal transmission between the brain and bladder. Some evidence suggests that nabiximols, but not dronabinol or oral cannabis extract, improves bladder function in people with MS [119, 121]. The cannabis based treatments did not reduce tremors in patients with MS [119, 122]. Multiple sclerosis has been associated with cognitive impairments, depression, and anxiety [123, 124]. It has been estimated that about 50% of MS patients have cognitive deficits and suffer from depression [125-127]. Multiple Sclerosis patients who smoke cannabis have more severe cognitive impairments than nonusers [128, 129]. Patients with MS who smoke cannabis perform poorly on tests for information processing speed, working memory, executive functioning, and visuospatial perception compared to ALS patients who do not smoke cannabis [129]. Multiple sclerosis patients who used cannabis were also twice as likely to be considered cognitively impaired [129]. Furthermore, in MS patients who use cannabis there is a correlation between cognitive impairments and reductions in gray and white matter volume in medial and lateral temporal regions, thalamus, basal ganglia, and prefrontal regions [130]. So far there is no evidence that cannabis use affects anxiety and depression in MS patients. Overall, the reviewed studies indicate that cannabis use may diminish spasticity and pain associated with MS, but chronic cannabis use has a detrimental effect on cognition in MS patients. 9. CANNABIS AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that decreases quality of life as it leads to bradykinesia (slow movements), rigidity, and tremors. Parkinson's has also been associated with non-motor symptoms that may 804 Current Neuropharmacology, 2017, Vol. 15, No. 6 Suryadevara et al. include psychosis, cognitive impairments, anxiety, and depression [131]. Parkinson's symptoms are at least partly due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which leads to a dysregulation of the extrapyramidal system. There is evidence that the endocannabinoid system is dysregulated in PD patients. It should be noted, however, that at this point it is not known if a dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system contributed to the development of PD or that PD leads to changes in the endocannabinoid system. Patients with PD have elevated levels of anandamide in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and decreased CB1 receptor levels in the basal ganglia [132, 133]. Animal studies suggest that drugs that target the cannabinoid system might diminish PD's motor symptoms and slow disease progression. In a Marmoset PD model, THC improved both CBD diminish the neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA, and these effects might be mediated by their antioxidant or anti-inflammatory properties [136]. In the same animal model, a drug treatment (AM404) that enhanced anandamide levels also decreased PD symptoms [137]. Therefore, there is strong preclinical evidence that increasing cannabinoid tone diminishes PD symptoms. Table 1. Cannabis based treatments and expression of disease symptoms.

A small study with 22 patients showed that smoking cannabis improves motor symptoms such as resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and posture. In the same study, cannabis also decreased pain and improved sleep quality [139]. It has also been reported that CBD diminishes REM sleep behavior disorder in people with PD [140]. Furthermore, the or CB1 r e ce p t o r b l oc k a d e wi t h r i m o n a b a nt d o e s n o t improve motor symptoms associated with PD [142, 143]. Overall, clinical studies suggest that cannabis, CBD, and synthetic cannabinoid agonists may diminish motor symptoms and pain associated with PD. At this point, only a few relatively small studies have been conducted and additional studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn about the effect of cannabis on PD. Furthermore, before medical cannabis can be recommended to PD patients, clinical studies are needed to investigate the effects of cannabis on non-motor systems (hallucinations, cognitive impairments) associated with PD. 10. CANNABIS AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Neurocognitive disorders are increasingly prevalent in the aging population. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Alzheimer's is truly a brain disease of the elderly; 4.3% of the 75-80 year olds and 28.5% of the 90 year olds has been diagnosed with AD [144]. The majority of AD patients are between the ages of 80 and 85. One of the first clinical symptoms is memory impairment and this is followed by language and behavioral problems. Alzheimer's is characterized by the loss of synapses and lesions that include plaques composed of an amyloid (A) core and neurofibrillary tangles that mainly consist of hyperphosphorylated tau [145]. Alzheimer's has significant effects on the expression of CB2 receptors in the human brain. One study reported a high level of CB2 receptor expression in microglia associated with -amyloid-enriched neuritic plaques while CB2 r e c e p t o r s w e r e n o t detected beyond the borders of the plaques or in the brains of healthy controls [146]. In contrast, AD does not lead to changes in CB1 r ec e pt o r l e v el s [ 1 4 6 , 1 4 7 ] . T h e t he r a p e ut i c effects of the cannabinoids are hypothesized to be due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects, which may diminish the effects of beta-amyloid toxicity [148, 149]. Animal studies indicate that compounds that elevate endocannabinoid levels decrease the toxic effects of beta-amyloid peptide [150]. Furthermore, studies with an AD mouse model (amyloid-protein precursor/presenilin 1) show that a THC-CBD mixture decreases amyloid beta levels and reverses learning impairments [151]. In the same animal model, a CB2 r e c e p t o r a g o n i s t i m p r o v e s c o g n i t i o n , decreases tau hyper-phosphorylation, and decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [152]. Therefore, cannabinoid based treatments could potentially slow the progression of AD. Cannabis might also be effective for the treatment of late stage AD symptoms [153]. Several studies have investigated the effects of dronabinol, which is a synthetic version of THC, in late stage AD patients. These studies showed that dronabinol improves food intake, sleep duration, circadian rhythm, and decreases agitation in late stage AD patients [154-157]. The patients received dronabinol for only a short period of time and it was not investigated if dronabinol affects memory and cognition. Therefore, additional studies are needed to investigate the long-term cognitive effects of THC or THC-like compounds in AD. Overall, these studies suggest that cannabis may slow down the progression of AD and decreases some its symptoms. However, additional insight into the effects of cannabis on cognition in AD patients is needed. 11. CANNABIS AND BIPOLAR DISORDER Bipolar disorder is characterized by major depressive and manic episodes or episodes with mixed depressive and manic symptoms [55]. Cannabis is the most often used illicit drug in patients with bipolar disorder and people with bipolar are seven times more likely to use cannabis than controls [158, 159]. It was initially believed that cannabis might have some therapeutic effects in bipolar patients, but this is not supported by recent findings [160]. Cannabis use is associated with an early age of onset of bipolar disorder, increased severity, and increased disability [161-163]. Cannabis use in patients with bipolar also further increases the risk for suicide [159]. A prospective study showed that cannabis use is associated with a decrease in long-term remission for bipolar disorder [164]. A large epidemiological study indicated that cannabis use increases t h e r i s k f o r m a n i c s y m p t o m s [165]. Cannabis also worsens global functioning in patients with bipolar disorder [166]. There is no indication for CB1 receptor level changes in people with bipolar disorder [167]. However, a single nucleotide polymorphisms in t h e C B2 receptor gene (SNP, rs41311993, 524C>A; Leu133Ile) is more common in people with bipolar disorder than in healthy controls [168]. This gene has been associated with CB2 r e c e p t o r s t a b i l i t y a n d t h e r e f o r e c h a n g e s i n t h e C B2 receptor could possibly contribute to the development of bipolar disorder. Finally, cannabis may alter the metabolism of medications prescribed for bipolar disorder. Overall, there are no clear indications that bipolar patients derive a benefit from cannabis use. 12. CANNABIS AND SCHIZOPHRENIA Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that typically presents in late adolescence or early adulthood and is among the top ten leading causes of disability in the world [169]. Schizophrenia is characterized by three core symptom groups: positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, paranoia, and suspiciousness), negative symptoms (blunted affect, social avoidance, poor rapport, lack of motivation, lack of spontaneity, and emotional withdrawal), and cognitive dysfunction [170]. Cannabis use is more common among people with schizophrenia than in the general population [171]. In Western countries, 10%20% of the general population use cannabis while 30%50% of people with schizophrenia use cannabis [172, 173]. There are several possible explanations for this. Cannabis might be more rewarding in people with schizophrenia, it might compensate for brain deficits, or people with schizophrenia have less control over drug use. 806 Current Neuropharmacology, 2017, Vol. 15, No. 6 Suryadevara et al. There is extensive evidence that the endogenous cannabinoid system is dysregulated in people with schizophrenia. Anandamide levels are elevated in the CSF of schizophrenia patients [174]. Furthermore, post mortem studies have shown an increase in CB1 r e c e p t o r l e v e l s i n s c h i z o p h r e n i a patients, especially in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, pons, cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens [175-180]. There is extensive evidence that cannabis use increases the risk for schizophrenia [181]. A large study with 50,087 Swedish men showed that cannabis users are 7 times more likely to develop schizophrenia than people who do not use cannabis [182]. This is in line with another large study that reported an increase in cannabis use in people in the year before they were first diagnosed with schizophrenia [183]. It should be noted that the harmful effects of cannabis depend on the THC:CBD ratio [181]. THC increases the risk for psychosis but CBD diminishes the effects of THC and even has antipsychotic effects in people with schizophrenia [184, 185]. During the last decades there has been an increase in THC levels in cannabis and CBD levels have remained the same. From 1980 to 2008, the THC concentration in cannabis products increased from 3 to 9 % while CBD levels remained stable at 0.4 % [186]. This suggests that cannabis use is more likely to lead to psychiatric illness and in particular in people who are genetically predisposed to develop schizophrenia [187, 188]. It is interesting to note that electroencephalography (EEG) studies have revealed that chronic cannabis use disrupts the brains ability to generate synchronized neuronal oscillations (beta and gamma band activity) [189, 190]. Neuronal oscillations play a critical role in coordinating the activity between brain sites and a disruption in synchronized neuronal activity can affect a wide range of brain functions. Chronic cannabis use induces similar disruptions in neuronal synchronization as those observed in people with schizophrenia [191]. Therefore it has been suggested that cannabis' effect on neuronal oscillations may contribute t o the development of schizophrenia (for an extensive review on this topic see [191, 192]). Cannabis use has a detrimental effect on some schizophrenia symptoms. Cannabis use worsens positive symptoms (mainly hallucinations), leads to poor treatment outcomes, and increases the risk for relapse after a period of remission [193-196]. It has been suggested that cannabis use disrupts the endogenous cannabinoid system in the prefrontal cortex and thereby induces changes in glutamate and GABA release, which contributes to the development of schizophrenia [197]. The effects of cannabis use on dopaminergic systems might also play a role in the development of schizophrenia. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene plays an important role in the breakdown of dopamine, and a valine to methionine mutation (Val158Met) in this gene leads to a decrease in dopamine metabolism [198]. It has been suggested that this mutation by itself does not increase the risk for schizophrenia but increases the risk for schizophrenia in people who use cannabis [199]. There is some evidence that cannabis use may diminish the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Several small studies suggest that a majority of people with schizophrenia use cannabis to diminish negative symptoms [200, 201]. The adverse effects of cannabis use might be more severe for people with schizophrenia than for healthy controls [202]. Cannabis use leads to a larger decrease in gray matter volume in people with schizophrenia than in healthy controls [202]. Interestingly, the decrease in gray matter volume was greatest in brain areas with high levels of CB1 receptors such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex [203]. Despite the negative effect of cannabis use on gray matter volume in people with schizophrenia, several studies suggest that people with schizophrenia who use cannabis have better cognitive function than people with schizophrenia who do not use cannabis [204-208]. However, it has also been reported that people with schizophrenia who use cannabis have worse cognitive function than patients who do not use cannabis [209]. It should be noted that it might be possible that cannabis use does not improve cognition but that patients who use cannabis have less severe cognitive impairments than non-cannabis users. It has been hypothesized that cannabis use in vulnerable young people can lead to a type of schizophrenia that is characterized by psychosis and only mild cognitive impairments [208, 210]. In contrast, people who do not use cannabis and develop schizophrenia have psychotic symptoms and also severe cognitive impairments. The endogenous cannabinoid system has been identified as a target for the treatment of schizophrenia [169]. Since the 1970's it has been suggested that the cannabinoid CBD has antipsychotic properties [211]. In the prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigm in healthy humans, a weak pre-pulse inhibits the strong startle response caused by an intense stimulus (e.g., loud noise) [212]. However, this inhibitory response is disrupted in people with schizophrenia (i.e., impaired PPI) [213]. Drugs that induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in humans such as the NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and ketamine also disrupt PPI in rats [212]. A wide range of antipsychotic drugs diminish the PPI impairment induced by NMDA receptor antagonists [214]. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that CBD also attenuates the PPI impairment induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 or amphetamine [215-217]. This suggests that cannabis might mediate some effects that resemble those of antipsychotic drugs. Taken together, cannabis has a complex effect on schizophrenia and the effect might depend on the THC and CBD levels in cannabis. Regular use of cannabis with high levels of THC has detrimental effects on gray matter and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. On the other hand, cannabis does not seem to worsen the cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia and might diminish some of the negative symptoms. Cannabis with high levels of CBD and l o w l e v el s o f T H C c o ul d p o s s i b l y p r e v e n t s o me o f t h e deficits in sensory motor gating in patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUDING REMARKS The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the benefits and negative mental health effects of cannabis use by people with a neurological disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. The reviewed studies indicate that cannabis use has complex effects and its effects depend on the specific brain disorder for which it is being used. Clinical studies Pros and Cons of Medical Cannabis use by People with Chronic Brain Disorders Current Neuropharmacology, 2017, Vol. 15, No. 6 807 provide evidence that cannabis might diminish some of the symptoms associated with PD, ALS, and MS. Cannabis use may decrease spasticity and pain in people with MS, decrease tremor, rigidity, and pain in people with PD and improve the quality of life of ALS patients by improving speech and swallowing, and decreasing spasticity. There is also evidence that people with schizophrenia use cannabis to diminish some of the symptoms of their disorders. Cannabis use might temporarily improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. There is currently no evidence that people with bipolar disorder derive any benefit from cannabis. The acute and chronic effects of cannabis use in the elderly are poorly understood. Aging is associated with physiological and neurological changes that m a y a f f e c t t h e r e s p o n s e t o cannabis. Changes in lean and fat mass may affect the volume of distribution of THC, and impairments in THC clearance may lead to elevated drug levels and increased drug interactions [218, 219]. Cannabis has large effects on neurotransmitter release in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and these brain sites also undergo changes during aging [220, 221]. Because cannabis use in the elderly is on the rise, clinical and preclinical studies are urgently needed to investigate the physiological and neurological effects of cannabis use in the elderly. Taken together, many people with PD, ALS, MS, and schizophrenia smoke cannabis to diminish the symptoms associated with their disorder. It should be noted that while short term use of cannabis could diminish some of the symptoms of these disorders, chronic cannabis use can have adverse long-term effects. It has been firmly established that chronic cannabis use can lead to the development of dependence, cognitive impairments, which increases the risk for depression and anxiety. Cannabis also has adverse physiological effects such as increasing the risk for lung diseases and has negative effects on male and female reproductive systems. Overall, acute cannabis use might provide temporary relief from a wide range of symptoms associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, but prolonged heavy cannabis use might have adverse effects on mental and physiological health.

RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Continued cannabis use at one year follow up is associated with elevated mood and lower global functioning in bipolar I disorder Levi Andreas Ringen3 Abstract Background: There is limited knowledge about how environmental factors affect the course of bipolar disorder (BD). Cannabis has been proposed as a potential risk factor for poorer course of illness, but the role of cannabis use has not been studied in a first treatment BD I sample. Methods: The present study examines the associations between course of illness in first treatment BD I and continued cannabis use, from baseline to one year follow up. Patients (N = 62) with first treatment DSM-IV BD I were included as part of the Thematically Organized Psychosis study (TOP), and completed interviews and self-report questionnaires at both baseline and follow up. Cannabis use within the last six months at baseline and use between baseline and follow up ( \"continued use \") was recorded. Results: After controlling for confounders, continued cannabis use was significantly associated with elevated mood (YMRS) and inferior global functioning (GAF-F) at follow up. Elevated mood mediated the effect of cannabis use on global functioning. Conclusions: These results suggest that cannabis use has clinical implications for the early course of BD by increasing mood level. More focus on reducing cannabis use in clinical settings seems to be useful for improving outcome in early phase of the disorder. Keywords: Cannabis, Bipolar Background The prevalence of substance use in bipolar disorder (BD) is high [1-3] with cannabis being the most com- monly used drug [3]. This is of interest since cannabis has been indicated as a risk factor for developing BD [4-6]. Cannabis use has also been associated with sever- ity indicators in chronic BD, including earlier age of on- set for the first affective episode [7-13], increased risk of manic episodes [4,14], prolonged duration of episodes [4-6], switch to mania in depressed individuals [15] and increased suicidal ideation and suicide risk [16,17], in addition to a more severe general course of the illness[18-20]. Cannabis abuse has furthermore been shown to predict poorer medication adherence in BD patients [21]. Most of these studies have included patients mainly in the chronic phase of illness after multiple mood epi- sodes, and we cannot rule out the possibility that these findings are biased by a selection of patients with a more severe course, possibly being more prone to self- medication with cannabis. Longitudinal studies of BD samples recruited at first treatment are very few. Two follow-up studies of first time hospitalized patients with BD I indicate that patients with cannabis use spend more time in affective episodes and exhibit more rapid cycling over the first year of treat- ment [22], and that periods with cannabis use coincide with periods with manic and hypomanic episodes over a mean follow-up period of 4.5 years [6]. Both studies sug- gest that continued cannabis with recently* Correspondence: l.r.kvitland@medisin.uio.no 1NORMENT, KG Jebsen Center for Psychosis Research, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital and Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway TOP Study, Building 49, Oslo University Hospital, Ullev\u00e5l, Kirkeveien 166, PO Box 4956 Nydalen, 0424, Oslo, Norway Full list of author information is available at the end of the article \u00a9 2015 Kvitland et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

BMC Psychiatry (2015) 15:11 DOI 10.1186/s12888-015-0389-xdiagnosed BD has a negative impact on the course of ill- ness. Since these two studies are based on hospitalized pa- tients in two university hospitals with well-acknowledged BD research groups, their patient samples might be biased towards patients with a higher severity of illness. The current study is based on patients recruited dur- ing their first adequate treatment for a manic episode from both inpatient and outpatient services in a catch- ment area based treatment system, and subsequently followed up after one year. We here aim to ascertain the rate of continued cannabis use over the first year of treatment in patients with recent onset BD and identify clinical outcomes associated with continued use, by ex- ploring the relationship between cannabis use patterns over the follow-up period and clinical status at one year follow-up. Methods One hundred and one patients with recent onset DSM- IV [23] BD-I were recruited consecutively from 2003 until 2013 from in- and outpatient units at all major hospitals in the Oslo area as a part of The Thematically Organized Psychosis (TOP) Study at the University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital. The patients had both psychotic and non-psychotic forms of bipolar dis- order. Out of these, 62 patients (63%) participated in a personal follow-up examination after one year. Of the 39 patients that did not attend the follow-up, 20 had de- cided to withdraw from the study, 18 had moved and were impossible to reach and one patient had died. There were no significant differences in baseline demo- graphic and clinical characteristics between follow-up participants and study drop-outs. The full inclusion criteria were as follows: meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BD I, being within the first year of receiving adequate treatment for a manic episode, age between 17 -65 years. Patients were ex- cluded from the study if they had pronounced cognitive deficits (IQ lower than 70), a neurological disorder, mod- erate/severe head injury, or were not able to speak a Scandinavian language or to give written informed con- sent. The patients were given both oral and written de- scriptions of the study before consenting to participate. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and the Norwegian Data Inspectorate. Assessments Patients referred to the study were interviewed by trained research fellows (psychologists and medical doc- tors). Diagnosis and episodes of illness were determined at baseline using the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID module I, chapters A-E) [24], with the aid of medical charts. For more details, see[1]. Patients were interviewed in detail, based on a com- mon semi-structural interview form, about substance use in the six months prior to inclusion and in the follow-up period. Forty-seven patients did not use can- nabis at any point during this period, 7 patients used cannabis at baseline but not at follow-up, 2 patients started to use cannabis in the follow-up period while 6 patients used cannabis at both time points. Based on these data, the sample was divided into those with con- tinued cannabis use (defined as any cannabis use at both time points, n = 6) and those without continued use (the rest of the patient group, i.e. both non-users and those using at one but not both time-points, n = 56). The con- tinued use patients reported an average use of cannabis at both baseline and follow up of 2 -3 times a week. Global functioning was measured using the function- ing part of the Global Assessment Functioning scale split version (GAF-F) [25,26]. Cut-off for functional recovery was set at a GAF score of 61 [27]. Current depressive symptoms were assessed with the Inventory of Depres- sive Symptoms -Clinician rated (IDS-C) [28], current manic symptoms were rated with the Young Mania Rating Scale [29], and current psychotic symptoms were assessed with the positive symptoms subscale of the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [30] at both time points. Medication and socio-demographic data were obtained by clinical interviews supported by medical chart infor- mation. Premorbid functioning was measured with the Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS), divided into aca- demic and social functioning [31]. Childhood premorbid functioning was chosen due to the young age of the sample. Symptomatic recovery was defined as a lack of affective and psychotic symptoms the previous 6 months (PANSS-P less than 4 and no mood episodes as verified by the SCID). All clinical personnel completed a training program in diagnostics (SCID) and symptom rating (PANSS), based on the training program at the University of California, Los Angeles. They also attended bi-weekly diagnostic consensus meetings led by experienced clinicians in the field of severe mental illness diagnostics. The inter-rater reliability was good with an overall kappa-score of 0.77 (95% LI [0.60, [32] for PANSS positive symptoms and 0.86 for the GAF [1]. Statistical analyses The statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Group comparisons for continuous variables were evaluated with independent sample T-tests, and group comparisons for dichotomous data were evaluated with Chi-squared tests or Fischer 's exact tests as appropriate. Level of significance was set to p < 0.05,Kvitland et al. BMC Psychiatry (2015) 15:11 Page 2 of 7two-sided. The overall effects of continued cannabis use on key baseline measures and on outcome mea- sures at one-year follow-up w ere first evaluated with a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with con- tinued cannabis use as the fixed factor. Outcome di- mensions indicated to be different between continued cannabis users and the rest of the patients through the MANOVA, were followed up with a series of hierarch- ical block-wise multiple linear regressions analyses controlling for possible confounders of this associ- ation. In addition to sex and age, variables with strong correlations with both co ntinued use of cannabis and the outcome measure were selected as possible con- founders, based on a bivariate analysis. Premorbid aca- demic functioning (PAS) was added to the models in order to investigate the role of premorbid traits in the associations. Hence the baseline measures of YMRS and GAF-F were entered in the first step, age and gen- der in the second, premorbid functioning in the third step and continued cannabis use in the fourth step of the model. There were no associations between the outcome measures and drug treatment adherence on continued cocaine, ampheta mine or alcohol use. These factors were thus not added to the model. Information about patient hospitalisations were not collected, and thus not corrected for. Since global functioning (GAF-F) is highly correlated with mood symptoms, a separate ana- lysis was performed with YMRS at one-year follow up in the second-to-last step. To evaluate the possibility of out- liers mediating the main effect, a scatterplot of GAF-F by YMRS scores was performed and examined. Finally, in order to investigate if current cannabis use influenced the results, follow-up analyses were done removing patients with cannabis use at one time-point, but not the other,from the no continued cannabis use group, thus contrast- ing the continuous cannabis users from the non-users. Results The mean age of the sample was 30.9 years (SD: 9.9 years), and 37 patients (60%) were female. Lifetime cannabis use was reported in 52% of the sample. There were more males in the continued use group (p < .05) than in the group without continued use. There were no significant differences in key clinical characteristics at baseline, in- cluding YMRS and GAF-F levels. There was a negative as- sociation between YMRS and GAF-F, indicating that patients with high levels of elevated mood had poorer functioning. The groups did not differ in any other fea- tures (Table 1), including the number in symptomatic re- mission at follow-up (3 (50%) in the continued cannabis use group vs 38 (68%) in the no continued cannabis use group, p = .601). Four (67%) of the patients in the contin- ued cannabis use group had not reached a level of func- tional recovery compared to 19 (29%) patients in the group without continued use; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = .390). The MANOVA indicated that the continued use group experienced significantly elevated mood, as measured by the YMRS, and significantly lower global functioning as measured by the GAF-F compared to the group without continued use. The effect size for the difference in GAF- F was high. There were however no significant differ- ences in the levels of depression or psychotic symptoms between the groups (Table 2). Repeating the analyses, this time only contrasting continued cannabis users with non-users, gave the same findings. The bivariate analysis showed a correlation between continued cannabis use and sex ( .287 p < .05), and a Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with- and without continued cannabis use at one year follow-up No continued cannabis use Continued cannabis use N = 56 N = 6 N Mean SD N Mean SD p Age (years) 56 32.3 10.0 6 30.5 9.7 .691 IDS total score 53* 11.2 10.0 6 18.5 11.9 .198 YMRS total score 56 2.3 4.0 6 7.3 5.5 .076 PANSS positive total score 56 8.8 2.6 6 9.7 2.6 .439 GAF-F 56 65.3 16.0 6 49.0 16.1 .056 N% N % P Females 36 64.3 1 16.7 . 035 Current use of antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medication42 79.2 4 66.7 .605 *Missing data.

In the regression analysis of elevated mood (Table 3), the ini- tial level of elevated mood contributed significantly and with an even stronger association between elevated mood at follow-up and continued cannabis use than in- dicated by the bivariate analysis. After controlling for possible confounders of the r elationship between global functioning at follow-up and continued cannabis use (Table 4), we found that baseline global functioning and continued cannabis use both contributed significantly in the final model (4A). When correcting for level of elevated mood (YMRS scores) at the second to last step, the impact of continued cannabis use was reduced to a trend level of significance (4B). Gender, age and pre- morbid functioning (as represented by the childhood level of academic functioning in the presented final model) did not contribute significantly to any of the models. The scatterplot did not indicate any outliers (Figure 1).Discussion The main result of the current study is that continued cannabis use had a statistically significant association with elevated mood but not with depressive or psychotic symptoms, over a one year follow-up period in a sample of first treatment BD-I patients. This relationship was not explained by differences in age, gender, premorbid functioning or symptoms at baseline. Continued canna- bis use also had a significant association with poorer glo- bal functioning, but this association seemed to be mediated by the elevated mood levels. The finding of an association between continued canna- bis use and elevated mood confirms findings from the two existing first-hospitalization samples in addition to several multi-episode samples [2,6,14,19,20,22,33,34] and sup- ports the hypothesis that cannabis use in these groups is particularly associated with a higher risk for elevated mood [3-6]. The association was not fully explained by baseline levels of mood symptoms. Furthermore, premor- bid functioning did not contribute to the explanation, contrary to findings in schizophrenia [35,36].Table 2 Levels of symptoms and functioning in patients with and without continued cannabis use at one year follow-up (MANOVA between-subject effects) No continued cannabis use N = 56 Continued cannabis use N = 6 Measure Mean SD Mean SD Mean square F P d GAF-F 66.02 15.31 49.00 16.11 1561.12 6.599 .013 1.4 PANSS-P 2.55 9.67 0.9 9.89 18.50 11.89 289.60 2.802 .100 0.1 .005 0.3 Wilks '3.299 p = .017 GAF-F = Global assessment of functioning; PANSS-P = Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Psychotic; IDS = Inventory of depression Scale; YMRS = Youn g Mania Rating Scale.

BMC Psychiatry (2015) 15:11 Page 4 of 7The finding of worse global functioning in the contin- ued cannabis group is in line with previous studies of multi-episode inpatients with BD [20,33] and negative effects of continued cannabis use in general in BD [37,38]. Our findings indicate that the reduction in glo- bal function is partly mediated by elevated mood. The lack of an association between continued cannabis use and depression is in line with a recent systematic reviewand meta-analysis of mainly multi-episode samples [39]. The lack of an association with psychotic features is slightly surprising given the extensive amount of studies on the relationship between cannabis and psychosis risk [40-43], but we cannot rule out a type II error due the low number of continued cannabis users, and this find- ing warrants further research. The YMRS contains items of psychotic manic symptoms [29]. The lack of an asso- ciation between continued cannabis use and psychotic features could strengthen the notion of a primary associ- ation to mood symptoms since this indicates that the higher YMRS scores are not mainly based on psychosis- related items [29], a view supported by the findings of an association between poorer global functioning and el- evated mood also at baseline. The effect of continued cannabis use on outcome measures after 12 months did not seem to be explained by premorbid traits, further strengthening a hypothesis of a direct association be- tween cannabis use and outcome. Strengths and limitations The main strength of the study is the well characterized and relatively large prospective sample of patients followed during one year after the first treatment for mania in BD-I. The catchment area based consecutive sampling procedure including both in-and outpatient treatments services gives the sample a high degree of representativity.Table 4 Multiple regression analysis with GAF-F at one year follow-up as dependent variable Block model summary for each step Contribution of separate variables for last step Block no. variable R2 change F change Beta t P Value 95% CI of B Lower Upper Constant ...... 4.432 Sex .217 13.794 3.202 functioning -.178 1.377 .174 5.997 1.110 4 of cannabis -.363 3.009 .004 33.745 6.770 -.565 -.5190 .000 23.582 .003.

BMC Psychiatry (2015) 15:11 Page 5 of 7The low number of continued use patients is our main limitation, but is unlikely to induce type I errors since results did not appear to be driven by outliers. However, type II errors cannot be ruled out. This is a longitudinal study with two cross-sectional points of assessment; we thus lack reliable data of temporal sequencing of canna- bis use and mood symptoms in the follow up period. It is thus not possible to conclude with certainty which phenomenon that drives the other. Information about cannabis use was based on self-reports. Self-reports of substance use have however been shown to have consid- erable validity in earlier studies [44-46]. Conclusion In conclusion, the current study showed that patients with continued cannabis use throughout the first year of treatment of BD I were at higher risk for elevated mood and worse global functioning compared to the patients without continued cannabis use. The poorer functioning seemed to be, at least in part, mediated by the elevated mood. These findings indicate that continued cannabis use, also below the threshold for a DSM-IV diagnosis of abuse or dependency, may have important clinical impli- cations for patients suffering from BD-I. Future research should aim at replicate these findings in a larger sample to minimize the risk of type II errors. Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

GUY2 Pain Centre,1McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Canada; GW Pharmaceuticals plc,2Salisbury, UK SUMMARY The use of cannabis for medical purposes is a controversial but an important topic of public and scientific interest. We report on the results of a self-administ ered questionnaire study con- ducted in the United Kingdom between 1998 and 2002. The questionnaire consisted of 34 items and included demographic data, disease and medication use patterns and cannabis use profiles. Subjects were self-selected; 3663 questionnaires were distributed and 2969 were re turned [1805 (60.9%) women, mean age 52.7 years (SD 12.7)]. Medicinal cannabis use wasreported by patients with chroni c pain (25%), multiple sclerosis and depression (22% each), arthritis (21%) and neuropathy (19%). Medicinal cannabis use was associated with younger age, male gender and previous recreational use (p <0.001). While caution must be exercised in interpreting these data, they point to the need for clinical studies of cannabis and cannabi- noids with therapeutics Publishing Ltd INTRODUCTION The potential use of cannabis and related derivatives (canna- binoids) for medical purposes is currently under intense scientific investigation. Research efforts are predominantly focused on exploring the cellular and neurophysiological effects of agonists and antagonists on endogenous cannabin- oid receptors in animal models, and a novel endogenous cannabinoid pathway is being described with roles in move- ment, pain, appetite and cardiovascular control. This scienti- fic knowledge is emerging at the same time as increasing numbers of patients' reports of the effective use of herbal cannabis. It is therefore plausible that patients using cannabis as a medicine may be exploiting this novel neurophysiological signalling system. Further information on the alleged effects of cannabis may guide the development of cannabis-based medicines for symptoms of chronic diseases. Few data are available on the patterns and prevalence of the medicinal use of cannabis. A large number of case reports of effective medicinal cannabis use have been published in peer- reviewed journals, including central thalamic pain myotonic myopathy (2), familial Medi- terranean fever (3) and multiple sclerosis (MS) (4). In a telephone survey of adults in 2508 households in Ontario, Canada, 49 people (1.9%) reported using cannabis for a medical reason in the past year, mainly for pain or nausea (5). Wide-ranging effects of cannabis are noted in large case series: 50 self-selected medicinal cannabis users reported use for a variety of conditions including HIV AIDS-related problems, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, menstrual cramps, migraine and narcotic addiction, as well as everyday aches, pains, stresses and sleeping difficulties (6). In a survey of 53 UK and 59 US patients with MS, cannabis was reported to affect spasticity, chronic pain of extremities, acute parox- ysmal phenomena, tremor, emotional dysfunction, anorexia/ weight loss, fatigue states, double vision, sexual dysfunction, bowel and bladder dysfunctions, vision dimness, dysfunctions of walking and balance and memory loss (7). In a survey of 15 chronic pain patients who admitted to using cannabis medi- cinally pain, sleep and mood were most frequently improved, while doses used were modest (8). Several prospective studies among specific patient popula- tions have now been published. In a survey of ambulatory patients with HIV/AIDS in three HIV clinics in eastern Canada, 35% reported current use of cannabis (9). This is higher than an estimated prevalence of 30% in British Columbia (10) and 15-23% in California (11,12). In a survey of 220 patients with chronic non-cancer pain, 10% reported continuing medicinal use (13). The prevalence of medical cannabis use among patients with MS has been estimated at 14% (14). Large population-based surveys are needed to further describe the characteristics of medicinal cannabis users and their reasons for use.Correspondence to: Dr Mark Ware, E19.145, Montreal General Hospital, Canada H3G 1A4 Tel.:11-514-934-8222 Fax:11-514-934-8096 Email: mark.ware@muhc.mcgill.ca The authors state that this work is their own and has not been submitted for publication elsewhere.

Patients were identified by word of mouth and through patients' support groups. A questionnaire instrument was developed for postal distribution and self-administration. A stamped addressed envelope was provided to improve response rates. The questionnaire consisted of 34 items including binary (yes/no) responses, Likert scales and open-ended questions. Information collected included demographics (age and gender), disease and symptom status and patterns of cannabis use both medicinally and non-medicinally. Patients were asked to select their diseases and/or symptoms from a list, and space was provided for additional information. Disease and symptom information was accepted as reported by the patient in the questionnaire responses, and no attempt to validate these diagnoses was made. Data were single-entered into a relational database ( MICRO- SOFT ACCESS 2000). Missing data and outliers were excluded from the analysis; these accounted for less than 5% of the total responses for the variables of interest. Data were imported and analysed using a standard statistical package (STATA version 8, Houston, TX, USA). Categorical data were compared using Pearson's w2-tests. Ordered categorical data were analysed using Mantel-Haenzel tests. Signifi- cance was set at the 95% level, and all tests were two sided. The database was registered with the Data Protection Act 1998. RESULTS Over the period 1998-2002, 3663 questionnaires were dis- tributed, and 2969 were returned (81% response rate). Demographic Information The mean age of the 2969 subjects was 52.7 years (SD 12.7), of whom 1805 (60.7%) were female. MS was the most common disease, reported by 1753 subjects (59%), while 1280 reported neuropathy (43%), 1125 reported chronic pain (33%) and 777 reported arthritis (26%). There was considerable overlap among these conditions. Cannabis Use Patterns Ever Use of Cannabis for Medicinal Purposes. A total of 947 (31.9%) subjects reported ever having used cannabis for med- ical purposes. The remainder were assumed to be never users. The median duration of medicinal use among 616 subjects for whom the duration of use data were available was 4 years [interquartile range: (2-7)]. The demographic profile of med- ical cannabis users is summarised in Table 1, compared to the never users. Medical cannabis use was associated with malegender, younger age and non-medical use (p <0.001 for all tests). Continuing Use of Cannabis for Medicinal Purposes. Of those who had ever used cannabis medicinally, 543 (18.3% of total sample) persons reported continuing to use cannabis for medical purposes, while 403 (13.6%) said they no longer used it. The 30 diseases or symptoms for which continuing medical cannabis use was most common are summarised in Table 2, along with the median duration of use for each condition. As noted above, some subjects reported cannabis use for more than one purpose. Reasons given for no longer using cannabis for medical purposes are also summarised in Table 3. Patterns of Cannabis Use Frequency of Use. Patients were asked how many days per week they usually used cannabis for medicinal purposes. Of 946 responses, 333 (35%) used 6-7 days per week, 219 (23%) used 3-5 days per week, 139 (15%) used 1-2 days per week, 73 (8%) used less than 1 day per week and 182 (19%) reported 'other'. Reasons for Trying Cannabis. When asked why they decided to try cannabis for medical purposes, 585 said it was because a friend, family member or acquaintance had suggested it, 519 said they read a book or article about cannabis, 177 said they had been prior users and found out 'by accident', 152 said their doctor had suggested it and 128 gave other reasons. Modes of Administration. Smoking was the most common means of administration, reported by 777 (82%) of medical cannabis users. The modes of administration were: eating was reported by 406 (43%) subjects, tea by 267 (28%), sublingual spray by 20 (2%) and 118 (12%) used other means. Amount of Cannabis Used. Nine hundred and sixteen sub- jects reported amounts of cannabis used for medical purposes. Of these, 18 used 10 or more grams per day, 60 used 5-9 gTable 1 Characteristics of ever-medicinal cannabis users Medicinal cannabis use Variable Ever % Never % Total p-Value Age (years) <0.001 <45 395 55 325 45 720 45-50 171 39 265 61 436 50-59 274 30 643 70 917 >60 104 14 620 86 724 Gender <0.001 Male 439 40 649 60 1088 Female 508 30 1209 70 1717 Non-medical cannabis use <0.001 Yes 357 66 182 34 539 No 575 28 1454 72 2029292 UK MEDICINAL CANNABIS SURVEY \u00aa2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Int J Clin Pract , March 2005, 59, 3, 291-295per day, 107 used 3-4 g per day, 249 used 1-2 g per day, 153 used several grams per week, 107 used several grams per month and 222 used only occasionally when needed. Change in Amount Used. Seven hundred and seventy-seven subjects reported on whether the amounts of cannabis needed to control symptoms had changed over time since they had started; 54 said they needed much more, 171 needed a little more, 514 said it was about the same, 31 said they needed less and seven said they needed much less.Perceived Effects of Cannabis Overall Effectiveness. Of 948 reported users, 648 (68%) reported that cannabis made their symptoms overall much better, 256 (27%) said a little better, 36 (4%) said no differ- ence and eight subjects said a little worse (four subjects) or much worse (four subjects). Effectiveness Compared to Other Medications. When asked how cannabis compared to other medications overall, 412 of 916 subjects (45%) said it worked much better than pre- scribed medications, 261 (28%) said it was somewhat better and 45 (5%) said it was about the same; only 27 subjects said that prescription medicines worked better than cannabis (18 somewhat better and nine much better). One hundred and seventy-one (19%) subjects said it was impos- sible to tell. Side Effects Compared to other Medications. When asked to compare the undesirable effects of cannabis to those of pre- scribed medicines, 872 subjects responded, of whom six found that cannabis produced much worse side effects, 23 found somewhat worse side effects and 54 said the side effects were about the same. Two hundred and sixty-four (30%) subjects stated that side effects of prescribed medicines were somewhat worse and 294 (34%) said they were much worse. Two hundred and thirty-one (26%) stated that it was impos- sible to tell. Effects on Other Medication Use. Of the 909 subjects responding to this question, 374 stated that their use of cannabis had changed their use of other medications, while 521 said it had not. Fourteen were not coded. Return of Symptoms on Stopping. Of the 876 subjects responding, 673 said their symptoms returned or got worse when they stopped using cannabis, and 203 denied any worsening on stopping cannabis. Non-medicinal Cannabis Use. Five hundred and thirty-nine (18%) subjects reported ever having used cannabis for reasons not related to disease (assumed to mean non-medical use), while 2029 subjects stated that they had never used cannabis for non-medical purposes. Medicinal cannabis use was sig- nificantly associated with recreational use (p <0.001) (Table 1). DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the most extensive survey of medical cannabis use among chr onically ill patients con- ducted to date. Before any conclusions may be drawn, however, the potential limitations of the study must be addressed. The sample of patients recruited for this study was not selected through any systematic procedure or by random recruitment. The questionnaire was distributed primarily by word of mouth to patients and patients' support groups, andTable 3 Reasons for stopping medicinal cannabis Reason Number of responses % of number stopping Unable to find supply 207 7 Could not afford 169 5.7 Did not like side effects 40 1.3 Did not work 25 1 Did not like 'high' 20 0.7 Other 173 5.8Table 2 Thirty diseases and symptoms for which continuing cannabis use is most commonly reported Disease/symptom Number %Median years of use (interquartile range) Multiple 11.61 3 (2-6) Neuropathy 239 11.14 4 (2-8) Chronic pain 235 10.96 4 (2-9) Depression 172 8.02 6 (3-10) Arthritis 4 (2-8) Gastrointestinal 84 3.92 5 (2-10) Migraine 74 3.45 6 (3.5-15) Allergy 62 2.89 3 (2-7) Spinal pain 62 2.89 4 (2-9) Asthma 53 2.47 4 (2-7) Weight loss (unintended) 40 1.86 6 (2-13) Spinal cord injury 39 1.82 7 (4-16) Genitourinary 36 1.68 2 (2-5) Chronic fatigue syndrome 27 1.26 4 (3-9) Dystonia 27 1.26 2.5 (2-6) Limited mobility 25 1.17 3 (2-6) Epilepsy 24 1.12 4.5 (2.5-10) Psychological 24 1.12 6.5 (3-17) Fibromyalgia 23 1.07 5 (2-14) Spinal disorder 22 1.03 5 (3-11) Spinal surgery 22 1.03 6 (2-12) Cardiovascular condition 21 0.98 4 (2-6) Bone disorder 18 0.84 3 (2-6) Spinal disc disorder 16 0.75 3 (2-10) Spinal paralysis 16 0.75 9.5 (4.5-15) Surgery 15 0.7 3.5 (2-16) Visual impairment 15 0.7 5 (1-16) Insomnia 14 0.65 4 (1-8) Skin condition 14 0.65 3 (2-5) Carcinoma 13 0.61 5 (4-6) Other 309 MEDICINAL Publishing Ltd Int J Clin Pract , March 2005, 59, 3, 291-295the high rate of response (81%) suggests that this was a highly motivated population. Therefore, there is potential for a strong selection bias to inflate the estimated of reported effectiveness of cannabis (assuming the responses reflect mainly 'successful' cannabis users) and to minimise the adverse effects. The subjects were chronically ill patients with a range of comorbid conditions, and the need for add- itional symptom relief may explain the self-reported on-going medical cannabis use prevalence of 18%. However, this is not out of the range of other prevalence surveys in MS (14%) (14) and chronic pain (10%) (13). However, because of the poten- tial for bias, we caution against drawing any conclusions with respect to the efficacy of cannabis from this study. It is important, however, to recognise these results as contributing to our understanding of what the perceived effects of cannabis are among these subjects. Most of the awareness of this study was achieved by word of mouth between patients, spread by patients putting notes about the project into their various newsletters/magazines, etc. MS patients have a large active patient support network in the UK and may have raised the awareness of this questionnaire study. This would have the effect of weighting the sample towards this population. There is a noticeable paucity of data from subjects with HIV/AIDS and cancer, populations which are also associated with therapeutic cannabis use. We believe that at the time of analysis, awareness of this questionnaire was not very high among the HIV/AIDS and cancer 'network groups'. The presence of a significant selection bias may also have the effect of excluding cannabis non-responders, persons who have tried cannabis and for whom it has not been of any use. This is a difficult group to target, and only randomly selected large-scale surveys would be able to identify the extent of this. Such studies usually rely on postal distribution and often have low response rates. Detailed estimates of response to any medication are best captured in formal clinical trials. In spite of these limitations, we believe that this survey is the best available assessment of current medical cannabis use in the UK. Some key messages emerge from the findings. Our study found that 68% of users had found cannabis to make symptoms overall much better and 27% a little better, sug- gesting that over 95% of the patients using cannabis had obtained some benefit from cannabis. In spite of this, about half of these subjects had not continued to use cannabis. The reasons for this are illuminating: the lack of supply or cost were more commonly reported as reasons for stopping com- pared to ineffectiveness or intolerable side effects. This lends support to ongoing efforts to make cannabis-based medicines available for research purposes and lends credence to changes in public policy on compassionate grounds. The study has found that ever use of medicinal cannabis is significantly associated with young age, male gender and non- medical use. This relationship has been found in other surveys(13) and may represent a general bias towards medical can- nabis use in this population. Alternatively, the association may be explained by factors which make clinical response to cannabis more favourable in this population. It is known that males and females respond differently to cannabis (15), and younger age groups may be better able to find and use cannabis as more socially 'acceptable'. This may particularly be true of the recreational users who would more likely have discovered medical use by 'accident' (19% of ever-medical users). Finally, recent randomised controlled clinical trials have pointed to potential therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids for patients with MS (16) and chronic neuropathic pain (17). This suggests that patients' reports of the effectiveness of cannabis should not be discounted as purely anecdotal, but rather could serve as a valid indicator of target diseases and symptoms for cannabinoid drug development. In conclusion, we believe that this survey presents a broad picture of the current state of cannabis use for medical pur- poses in the UK. The extent of use and the reported effects lend support to the further development of safe and effective medicines based on cannabis.

Pursuant to Section 18 of C hapter 351 of the Acts of 2016, a Report of Findings was submitted to the legislature on June 29, 2018. This document serves a s the Final Report . Summary of Findings (1) Patterns of Use and Perceptions of Marijuana A survey of adults in Massachusetts suggests that approximately 21% of adults have used marijuana in the past 30 days. The proportion of marijuana use was highes t among those 18 -25 years old. Smoking is the most common method of marijuana consumption, although more than 40% of marijuana users report using multiple methods of use. More than half of adults perceive marijuana to have slight or no risks, and use marijuana for non -medical purposes. A survey of patients who use marijuana products for therapeutic use suggests these individuals use marijuana treatments for approximately 24 days a month, with the majority of respondents using a marijuana product for at leas t 21 out of the past 30 days . On average, respondents spend at least $246.00 on marijuana each month, and use at least 3 different modes of use . The most common method of marijuana administration is smoking (combusting) dried flower (65%), followed by vaporizing marijuana concentrate (62%) and eating marijuana products (51%). (2) Incidents of Impaired Driving and Hospitalization Tools to reliably ascertain levels of marijuana exposure and impairment in the field do not currently exist. Marijuana has cognitive and behavior effects in t he areas of automative behavior (i.e., well -learned skills), and executive function impacts (i.e., how the user interacts with traffic). These effects have not been reliably linked to a level of marijuana or THC in the body. In a survey of Massachusett s residents, among respondents that use marijuana, the prevalence of self -reported driving under the influence is 34.3%. Overall, 7.2% of the adult population drove under the influence of marijuana in the past 30 days, and 11.3% of adults rode with a mari juana -using driver in the past 30 days. This is similar to estimates from a survey of medical marijuana patients that found approximately 10% of respondents drove under the influence in the past 30 days. 5 Retrospective evaluations of fatal crash data suggest that drivers who died in a fatal crash are much more likely to have had their blood tested for marijuana, than drivers who survived a crash in which there was at least one fatality. Marijuana -related treatment is a small portion of the overall volume of substance use disorder treatment episodes. In a statewide -survey of Massachusetts, no respondents reported marijuana -related use of emergency room or urgent care facilities. The number of marijuana -related calls to the Regional Poison Control Center in Massachusetts h as been increasing over time. The calls include incidents of unintentional exposures among children, with the majority of calls related to 10 -19 year old individuals, and/or expos ure to dried marijuana flower. The proportion of calls increased after medical marijuana was available in the Commonwealth. (3) Economic and Fiscal Impacts for State and Local Governments Economic projections suggest that marijuana will increase Massachuse tts state revenue by about $215.8 million in the fi rst two years of retail sales. The increase will largely come from sales and excise taxes collected on retail purchases. Based on experiences from states with existing legalized adult use, sales tax reven ue will be higher in the second year ($154.2 million), as compared to the first year ($61.6 million). Economic projections of the impacts to local government, suggest that local tax revenue over the first two years of retail sale are projected to be high est in the most densely populated regions (ranging from $233,498 to $2,875,048), with considerable fluctuation in two -year revenue projections among high -density suburban cities and towns (ranging from $68,139 to $991,873, over the two year period). 6 Acknowledgements The MBHS was directed by DPH in consultation with an advisory p anel consisting of representatives from the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, Executive Office for Administration and Finance, and the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security.

Nascarella, PhD , IRB# 1081301 . 8 Introduction A legislative mandate required the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to conduct a baseline study to investigate three topics: (1) Patterns of use, methods of consumption, and general perceptions of marijuana; (2) Incidents of impaired driving and hospitalization related to marijuana use; and (3) Economic and fiscal impacts for state and local governments (Chapter 351 of the acts of 2016). This study, referred to as the Marijuana Baseline Health Study (MBHS), was conducted by DPH, under the leadership of the DPH Commissioner, in consultation with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, the Executive Office for Administration and Finance, and the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. Pursuant to the legislative mandate, DPH entered into an agreement with the following research entities to assist with the execution the study: University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute , Mathematica Policy Research Inc., and JSI Research and Training, Inc. Pursuant to Section 18 of Chapter 351 of the Acts of 2016, a Report of Findings was submitted to the legislature on June 29, 2018. This document serves as the Final Report Topic 1: Patterns of Use and Perceptions of Marijuana a. Retrospective Evaluation A retrospective analysis of previous surveys of \"marijuana use\" was conducted by comparing national and state -specific information from three states which have legalized marijuana, compared to three states which have not. This evaluation was conducted to identify indicators which ma y be sensitive to factors associated with legalization of marijuana, thus providing a valuable reference to monitor trends in use and perceptions of marijuana as the legaliz ation of marijuana progresses. This retrospective analysis suggests that thirteen d ifferent indicators from national surveys with information available at the state level appear to be responsive to factors associated with the legalization of marijuana and sensitive to changes over time. These indicators include evaluating if minors have \"ever used marijuana,\" and if they \"believe occasional use poses no risk of harm.\" The evaluation also suggests that monitoring similar indicators in adults is valuable, as well as monitoring indicators of \"perceptions of great risk from smoking marijuana once a month\" and \"any use in the past year.\" b. Statewide Survey A cross -sectional population -based survey of adults was conducted to assess past 30 - day use of marijuana, alcohol, and other substances. For each of these three substance types, the survey collected information on frequency of use, spending on the substance, driving under the influence, riding as a passenger with a driver under the influence, and use of emergency room or urgent care services. The mail and web -based survey was designed to be representative of adults in Massach usetts, age 18 years or older. Participants were chosen randomly using address -based sampling from a list of Massachusetts residential households obtained through a sampling vendor. The sample was stratified by 6 regions (Boston, Central, Metrowest, Northwest, Southeast, and 9 Western). A simple random sample of 15,000 addresses were selected to participate with an equal number of households (n = 2,5 00) selected from each region. Once duplicates were removed from the study results, there were 3,022 individuals that responded to the survey (21.8% response rate). The respondent data was weighted to allow estimates to be representative of the en tire Massachusetts population. These weighted results suggest that 21% of adults in Massachusetts have used marijuana in the past 30 days; 26% of men and 17.0% of women. The proportion of marijuana use was highest among those 18 -20 years of age and 21 -25 years (54.4% and 49.1%, respectively), as compared to older age groups. Eighteen per cent of adults aged 26 or older had used marijuana in the past 30 days. By region, residents in the Western area of the state report the highest prevalence of past 30 -day marijuana use (~30%). Among marijuana users living in Massachusetts, most are White, 70.8%, and many fewer are Hispanic, 12.0%, Black, 7.1%, other, 6.9%, or Asian, 3.2%. In statistical analysis of the data (which accounted for the effect of other factors), race/ethnicity was not associated with marijuana use, suggesting that the likeliho od of using marijuana is similar for each group (compared to Whites). Fifty -three percent of adults perceive marijuana to have slight or no risks. The patterns of marijuana consumption indicate that smoking is most common, although 43% of marijuana users report using more than just one method. More than half of all adult marijuana users (56.0%) report using marijuana only for adult non-medical purposes. Data suggest that men are more likely than women to report past 30 -day use, and adults 18 -20 years old are more likely to have used marijuana, compared to adults older than 26 years old. Marijuana use is positively associated with past 30 -day alcohol use. Population groups such as men, White, non -Hispanic individuals and individuals age 18 -20 years had th e highest prevalence of marijuana use, when compared to other group s. c. Survey of Medical Use of Marijuana Patients An online survey of the patterns of use and perceptions of marijuana was sent to patients actively using medical marijuana. The survey remained open for approximately 5 weeks, with a stated goal of characterizing how regulated legal retail marijuana is consumed in Massachusetts. The survey included 81 questions focused on collecting information on demographics, product use, methods of use, perceptions of medical use, driving behavior, alcohol consumption, non -medical use of prescription drugs and other substances, and combined substance use. A total of 6,934 participants completed the entire survey, for a response rate of 16%. There were no notable differences between respondent gender, age, or county of residence as compared to the eligible population (i.e., all patients). On average, respondents indicated marijuana use for 23.5 out of the past 30 days, with over 60% reporting marijuana use at least 21 out of the past 30 days. However, 8% of respondents reported no use of marijuana or marijuana produ cts in the past 30 days. Over 65% of respondents reported using marijuana or marijuana products for medical purposes for at least 1 year, with approximately 1 in 5 of respondents using marijuana or marijuana products for medical purposes for at least 3 yea rs. On average, 10 respondents reported spending $246 on marijuana products in the past 30 days, with a significantly larger amount spent among respondents under 50 years old and among respondents with an educational attainment less than a Bachelor's degree. On average, participants reported using approximately 3 different mod es of use in the past 30 days. Approximately 16% of respondents who indicated marijuana use in the past 30 days reported using only 1 method of administration, while over 30% reported us ing 4 or more methods. The most common method of marijuana administration was smoking dried flower (65%), followed by vaporized marijuana concentrate (62%) and edible marijuana products (51%). The amount of product used varied by gender, age group, and e ducational attainment. A significantly larger proportion of males compared to females reported using vaporized dried flower or a concentrated preparation of THC referred to as \"dabbing\", while a larger proportion of females compared to males reported using sublingual or orally administered uptake products and applying topical cannabis products to the skin. A significantly larger proportion of respondents 50 years old or younger reported smoking (combusting) dried flower cigarettes (or \"joints\"), vaporizing dried flower, vaporizing marijuana concentrate, dabbing, or consuming edible marijuana products. A significantly larger proportion of respondents with an educational attainment less than a Bachelor's degree reported smoking dried flower and dabbing compa red to respondents with a Bachelor's degree or higher. All respondents were asked questions related to their perceptions of the medical use of marijuana. Over 65% of respondents reported that they believed marijuana products have been \"very effective\" in treating their medical condition(s), while an additional 26% believed use o f marijuana to be \"effective.\" Almost 90% of respondents reported that they had \"somewhat high\" or \"very high\" confidence that they were receiving safe, uncontaminated products w hen purchasing marijuana or marijuana products at a registered medical marijuana dispensary. All respondents were asked questions related to positive and negative outcomes/conseq uences of their marijuana use. Overall, respondents reported high rates of pos itive outcomes/consequences of marijuana use, and little obvious harm. Among all respondents, 78% reported positive changes in their mood or mental health, and 67% reported improved physical health. In addition, 83% of respondents reported no negative ou tcomes/consequences related to their marijuana use. Approximately 10% of respondents reported driving or operating a car or other motor vehicle while under the influence of marijuana in the past 30 days. Topic 2: Incidents of Impaired Driving and Hospit alization a. Measuring Marijuana and Driving Impairment Marijuana intoxication can impair psychomotor and cognitive functions related to driving and increase the risk of involvement in a motor veh icle crash. A literature review was conducted to examine the state of the science on quantifying marijuana and impairment leading to the inabili ty to operate a motor vehicle. Various point -of-collection (POC) devices/kits were compared to standard analytical chemistry methods (e.g., gas chromatography mass spectrome try, or liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry) to determine concentrations of 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the 11 primary psychoactive compound in marijuana. While some of the POC devices showed a screening -level accuracy that meets or exceeds re commended standards, they are limited in their ability to serve as a diagnostic tool t o indicate driving impairment. The review of studies assessing cognitive and behavioral impacts of marijuana that are relevant to driving indicate that marijuana has cogn itive and behavior effects in the areas of automative behavior (i.e. well -learned skills), especially for occasional users, and there also are likely executive function impacts (i.e. how the user interacts with traffic) for some users. Additional research is needed to establish baseline levels of cannabinoids in blood, urine, and saliva, and the relationship between t hese levels and marijuana use. Additional data are also needed to characterize the variability in cannabinoid levels across product t ypes and modes of consumption. b. Baseline Assessment of Medical Use of Marijuana Patients As a follow -up to the survey of Medical Use of Marijuana patients described above, DPH conducted a biomonitori ng study to evaluate baseline levels tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 1 -nor-9-carboxy -9-tetrahydrocannnabinol (THC - COOH) in the blood and urine of patients that were regular marijuana consumers. This study, referred to as the Baseline Assessment of Medical Marijuana Patients (BAMMP) Study, was conducted in two di stinct phases. The first \"recruitment\" phase, involved leveraging the patient survey component of the MBHS sent to 42,519 active medical marijuana patients, and included opinion, attitude, and perception questions as well as questions specifically address ing the magnitude, frequency, type and method of marijuana use. The survey also collected data on the social and demographic characteristics of respondents, including: age, gender, race/ethnicity, employment status, income level as well as county and zip code of residence. Recruitment of BAMMP study participants from the 6,934 patient survey respondents was achieved by creating a pool of respondents that indicated an interest in participating in a fo llow-up research study (e.g., question No. 81 on the pat ient survey ; see Appendix B ). From this pool of 2,113 interested individuals, 333 participants were selected for follow -up for study participation based on a sampling methodology to generate a sample representative of the geography, race/ethnicity, age, an d gender of the statewide population. The second \"field -based\" phase of the BAMMP study involved the recruitment, scheduling, and collection of detailed marijuana use information and biological specimens (e.g., blood and urine) from 134 of the 333 individ uals. These field-based appointments were conducted across the state of Massachusetts, where each of the 134 participants executed a consent form, returned a completed 7 -day marijuana use diary, responded to questions on a same -day questionnaire, and unde rwent a physical and cognitive evaluation to confirm that they were not impaired. Participants then provided clinical specimens of either urine (n = 16), or urine and blood (n = 118) for quantitative analysis of THC an d THC -COOH . A full report of the BAM MP study findings are expected later this year . 12 c. Marijuana -Involved Motor Vehicle Crashes in Massachusetts Baseline prevalence of self -reported DUI -marijuana and riding with a driver under the influence of marijuana (RUI -marijuana) was characterized to identify demographic risk factors as sociated with these behaviors. Retrospective trends and patterns of marijuana -involved motor vehicle crashes in Massachusetts were investigated between 2006 and 2016, using (1) DUI and RUI data collected as part of a statewide baseline survey of Massachusetts adults age 18 years and older; (2) Prevalence of marijuana, alcohol and drug -involved fatal crashes in Massachusetts from 2006 -2016; and (3) Marijuana -involved non -fatal crashes in Massachusetts. The baseline dat a in Massachusetts suggests that approximately 7% of adults drove under the influence of marijuana in the past 30 days and about 12% of adults rode with a driver who was under the influence of marijuana. Nearly 35% of adults who reported marijuana use also reported DUI -marijuana, and a similar proportion reported RUI -marijuana. Retrospective evaluation of fatal crash data suggest that over the 11 -year study period of 2006 -2016, there were an average of 351 crashes per year in which someone died and an aver age of 373 traffic fatalities per year. Approximately 73% of the drivers who died in a crash were administ ered a post -mortem blood test. Of the deceased, blood - tested drivers, there was an increasing trend for the proportion or drivers testing positive for any cannabinoid post -mortem. In contrast, alcohol -involved crashes in Massachusetts have steadily decreased in frequency since 2006. In an examination of non-fatal crash data, an increasing number and proportion of crash reports describe marijuana. The se reports preclude the accurate characterization of marijuana -involved, non-fatal crashes as the crash reports do not systematically incl ude reporting of drug testing. d. Marijuana -Related Health System Contacts in Massachusetts The use of health care sy stems by frequent and occasional marijuana users was evaluated to determine the number and prevalence of (1) substance use treatment admissions for a primary diagnosis of cannabis use disorder; (2) emergency room and urgent care services due to marijuana, and (3) marijuana -related calls received by the regional poison control center (PCC). This phase of the study sought to provide a summary of valuable health system -related indicators from before retail sales of adult use marijuana. For this phase, three d ata sources were utilized for analyses. First, Massachusetts -specific data were extracted from a national substance use database to compile the number of marijuana -related trea tments over 2004 -2014. Second, baseline data from the statewide survey on emerg ency or urgent care related to marijuana use, alcohol use, and other substance use were evaluated. Finally, data from the Massachusetts and Rhode Island Regional Poison Control Center (PCC) were evaluated to characterize marijuana -related calls (for all e xposure reasons) by age and year, trends in specific marijuana product type as the source of exposure (e.g. dried plant, edible preparation, etc.). These evaluations suggest that marijuana -related treatment is a small portion of the overall volume of sub stance use disorder treatment episodes, with an estimated 13 prevalence of 45 admissions per 100,000 individuals. Of the 436 individuals who reported using marijuana in the past 30 days on the statewide -survey, no respondents reported marijuana -related use o f emergency room or urgent care services in the prior year. Data from the PCC suggest that the number and proportion of marijuana -related calls has been increasing over time for all age groups. For example, during the 10 -year study period (2007 -2016) the re were 641 calls to the PCC that involved marijuana exposure, equal to a prevalence of 9.4 c alls per a 100,000 population. The evaluated calls include incidents of unintentional exposures among children age 0 -9 years old (n = 27, 4.21%). The greatest num ber of calls were related to 10 -19 year old individuals (n = 257, or 40.09%). The proportion of calls due to marijuana exposure in individual ages 0-5, 6-9, and 10 -20 years old showed a statistically significant increase after medical marijuana was enacte d in the Commonwealth. In all age groups, it was exposure to dried cannabis plant that resulted in the greatest number of calls to poison control, followed by edible preparat ions. Topic 3: Economic and Fiscal Impacts for State and Local Governments To evaluate the potential economic impacts on state and local government, a model was constructed to estimate the fiscal impacts during the first two years of retail sales. The model included three parts: (1) a main model, which included measures that were assumed to be major drivers of state economic impacts for which there is strong evidence to inform estimates (e.g., sales tax revenue, regulatory oversight costs and revenue, and reductions in marijuana -related law enforcement activities); (2) a supplement al model, which evaluated secondary impacts on public health, public safety, and income tax revenue for which the strength of the evidence is less definitive; and (3) a local model, which estimates local tax revenue for each city or town in Massachusetts (assuming the maximum local tax rate of 3%). This approach suggests that marijuana will increase Massachusetts state revenue by about $215.8 million in the first two years of retail sales. The increase will largely come from sales and excise taxes collected on retail purchases. Based on experience from states with existing legalized adult use, sales tax revenue will be higher in the second year ($154.2 million), as compared to the first year ($61.6 million). When measures calculated with less certa inty are included in the model (because of either a lack of data or uncertain timing), the state revenue may increase by an additional $65.3 million. Because the model includes multiple measures, the overall estimate compounds uncertainty from each of the measures. To address this, low and high ranges have been calculated. For example, the total fiscal contribution could range from $95.7 to $405.9 million, with two major assumptions heavily influencing the estimates. The first assumption involves the numb er of expected marijuana users in Massachusetts. While the model uses previous population surveys that show a prevalence of use ranging from 8.6% to 12.1%, data collected in Massachusetts suggest th at it may be as high as 20.1%. When this Massachusetts -base d estimate is used, revenue projections increased by 38% (from $215.8 million to $298.8 million). Another source of uncertainty is the changes that arise in a state when moving a regulated medical marijuana marketplace 14 to a combined medical and adult -use marketplace, versus changes in a state going from no sal es to adult -use retail sales. The model -based approach of estimating fiscal impacts to local government, projects that local tax revenue over the first two years of retail sale are projected to be highest in the most densely populated regions (ranging from $233,498 to $2,875,048), with considerable fluctuation in the two -year revenue projections in high -density suburban cities and towns (ranging from $68,139 to $991,873, over the two year period). These local analyses assume that approximately 65% of marijuana users would shift from purchasing their marijuana in the illicit marketplace to purchasing from a dispensary. In general, the estimated median local tax revenue over the first two years of re tail sale ranges from $72,835 in suburban communities with a low population density, to $582,899 in urban communities with a high population density. Because these model estimates rely on the location and availability of dispensaries, each community -level estimate is dependent upon the availability of marijuana in that community and the demand for marijuana in nearby communities. For some of the 83 cities and towns included in the primary analysis, local tax revenue estimates fluctuated dramatically based on these community -level effects (for example, fro m about $992,000 to $108,000). In general, the modeling efforts described here estimate that adult -use marijuana sales are driven primarily by the availability of dispensaries and the potential for medic al marijuana dispensaries to expand and/or convert operations to include adult -use marijuana sales. The increase in revenue will largely be a result of retail purchases made by adults with heavy use (defined as consuming marijuana an average o f 21 days or more each month). It is difficult to speculate what regulatory costs/benefits may have already been realized when Massachusetts implemented a medical marijuana program. For example, if revenue changes have already been realized, the assumption could be inflating some of the revenue projections by 7 -28%. While it is important to consider all aspects of the fiscal impact of legalization, the estimated increase from sales and business tax revenue appear to be most significant. 15 Task 1: Prevalence and Perceptions of Marijuana Use Chapter 1: Retrospective Analysis of Indicators of Use and Perceptions of Marijuana 16 Introduction In this chapter an exploratory, secondary data analysis of marijuana indicators using national and state -specific data from Massachusetts as well as three states which have fully legalized marijuana (Oregon, Washington, and Colorado) and three states which have made no changes to marijuana laws (Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma) is presented. The goal of the stu dy was to identify indicators of use and perception of risk of marijuana that may be used by policymakers and program leaders to monitor the impact of the legalization of marijuana over time. Background During the past two decades , there have been many s tate policy changes with regard to marijuana use. Currently, 29 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana and 8 states have legalized recreational marijuana. National data indicates that marijuana is the most commonly used illici t drug in the U.S. and the shifts in policy align with changes in public opinion regarding the acceptance and legality of marijuana. In addition, an increase in marijuana use prevalence and a decrease in the perceived harmfulness of marijuana use have also been noted (Hall & Kozlowski, 2015; Monte, Zane, & Heard, 2015). Recent polls show growing support for the legalization of marijuana, with some reports indicating that over 50% of Americans now view the use of marijuana as a non -moral issue (Swift, 2013; Pew Research Center, 2013). Between 2002 and 2014, marijuana use increased from 10.2% to 13.4% among adults, and the perception of harmfulness associated with marijuana use decreased from 40% to 27.8% (Swift, 2013). Although trends in marijuana use for bo th adolescents and adults have been examined using national data as well as data specific to states that have legalized marijuana, few studies, if any, have conducted a comparative analyses of legalized states versus non - legalized states with regard to mar ijuana use (Swift, 2013; Pew Research Center, 2013; Allen & Holder, 2014; Keyes, et al. 2016). And while several studies have examined trends in marijuana use following its legalization in specific states, these trends have not been examined in relation to key policy milestones. The purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative, secondary data analysis of marijuana indicators using national and state -specific data from three legal states (Oregon, Washington, Washington) and three non -legal states (Texas , Kansas, Oklahoma). Recreational marijuana was legalized in Massachusetts in 2016, and a focal point of this study is to compare Massachusetts indicators to other states in order to identify indicators which are responsive to changes in legalization. Give n changes in marijuana policies regarding recreational use, the primary purpose of this study is to identify indicators that may be sensitive to those changes and factors associated with marijuana. The data reported reflect marijuana indicators that were r eported for both legal and non -legalized comparison states. 17 Methods In order to identify the indicators which may be sensitive to factors associated with legalization of marijuana, a list of the most relevant potential indicators from four national data sets was detailed. This list was then honed to only those which met specific criteria for inclusion. The remaining indicators were then analyzed for responsiveness to factors associated with marijuana and change over time. In sum, the process included four steps: 1. Conduct an indicator inventory 2. Choose comparison states 3. Confirm data sources 4. Conduct statistical analyses Along with identifying indicators that appear to be responsive to changes over time, this approach also provided a baseline for chose n indicators from which to assess future trends. Indicator Inventory The purpose of the inventory was to identify a comprehensive list of potential indicators and detail salient information to inform the selection of indicators for further analysis. Four data sets were selected from which to pull the comprehensive list of indicators: Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) Massachusetts Youth Health Survey (YHS) Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH ) Sixty -eight initial indicators were identified for consideration. From this list, indicators were chosen that met the following criteria: Represents population of youth and/or adults Availability in potential comparison states Sampling and weighting representative of the entire state Administration at regular intervals over the course of the last 10 years The result of the prioritization was the identification of 22 indicators for further analysis. Selection of Compari son States The next step was to select comparison states. Two types of comparison states were selected: those that have legalized recreational marijuana and those that have not legalized nor decriminalized marijuana use. Many states have made some changes to marijuana laws either by decriminalizing, legalizing medical marijuana use, or ultimately legalizing recreational marijuana use. These changes appear to occur in a progression 18 and therefore our focus was to identify states on either end of the continuu m. The map below (Figure 1) demonstrates the range of legalization across the United States. Figure 1: Current marijuana legalization status by state For the purposes of this analysis, legalized comparison states considered included Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado and Maine. However, only three states had legalized recreational use for sufficient time to make a trend analysis plausible: Washington, Oregon and Colorado. A search found that there are seven states which have not de criminalized marijuana use or possession and have no recreational or medical marijuana laws, nor any legal cannabidiol oil use. These include: Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas. It was assumed that states that meet this p rofile would be politically dissimilar (e.g. approach to criminal justice reform, social programs, etc.) from Massachusetts and therefore selecting on the basis on similarity of social factors would not be fruitful. Therefore, the selection criteria focuse d upon population density and unemployment rate. The table below details how each state met those criteria. Of the seven potential comparison states, the three selected had the most similar unemployment rate and population density to Massachusetts. Based o n this information, the chosen non -legalization comparison states were Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. 19 Table 1: Comparison State Census Information Confirmation of Data Sources Once the indicators and comparison states were chosen for analysis, the data sets were obtained. For adults, the final data sources include the NSDUH and the BRFSS. While raw NSDUH data were not available due to upgrades to SAMHSA's online data portal and restricted data access system, a limited number of NSDUH indicators (with point estimates and confidence intervals) were available from SAMHSA's public data access system for Massachusetts, the U.S., and all comparison states. BRFSS data regarding marijuan a were only available for Washington state; other states did not include marijuana questions or included them too recently for a trend analysis to be conducted. For youth, the final data sources included the NSDUH, the YRBS, the YHS, the Healthy Youth Surv ey from Washington state. While the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey and the Oregon Healthy Teen Data Set were explored for use. Ultimately, they were not used due to their failing to meet the criteria set forth for the indicator inventory or their indicators did not align with Massachusetts indicators. The NSDUH data were available as described above through the public data access system for a limited number of indicators for youth aged 12 -17. For high school youth, YRBS data were available for the U.S., Massa chusetts, Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Colorado deployed the YRBS through 2011, then switched to include the YRBS instrument in the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey, which is available for 2013 and 2015. In Washington State, the Healthy Youth Survey sampled st udents in grades 10 and 12; these data are not directly comparable to YRBS data but are presented on their own for trend analysis. The raw Healthy Youth Survey data were not available, but point estimates and confidence intervals available from published r eports were used. For middle school youth, Massachusetts data are available from the YHS, and Washington state data are available from the Healthy Youth Survey for grades 6 and 8. State Population People per sq. mile Unemployment rate Massachusetts 6,547,629 839.4 4.3% 25,145,561 96.3 4.6% 20 Statistical Analysis Where raw data were available (for the YRBS, BRFSS, YHS), tests for linear and non - linear trends using logistic regression were conducted. Data were compiled and analyzed in two ways. Variables representing gender, race, and grade (in the case of youth data) were entered as control variables to adjus t for demographic shifts in the underlying populations. Where raw data were not available, a significant trend was determined by non -overlapping confidence intervals; this analysis did not adjust for demographic variables. Because the sampling for each of the surveys involved complex sampling, SPSS Complex Samples version 21.0 was used to account for the sampling design and to ensure there was not an underestimation of the standard errors (Cambron , Guttmannova & Fleming, 2017). Finally, a literature review of peer -reviewed journal articles related to marijuana legalization and block grant review was conducted to inform the selection of key milestones related to marijuana legislation in each state. Trends for each of the marijuana indicators were plotted alo ngside the key milestones to illustrate which indicators may be sensitive to state -level changes. Results The retrospective analysis resulted in identifying 13 indicators which appear to be responsive to factors associated to marijuana legalization and s ensitive to change over time. Table 2 below presents a summary of the results of the analysis. 21 Table 2: Retrospective Analysis Results Youth Adult Indicator Data Source Type of Analysis Indicator Data Source Type of Analysis Ever Used Marijuana - Middle School Students YHS F-test, p=0.002 Ever Used Marijuana - Adults Ages 18 and Older BRFFS F-test, p=0.000 Used Marijuana Before Age 13 - High School Students YRBS F-test, p=0.005 Use in the Past Year - Adults Ages 18-25 NSDUH State comparison, non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals Current Marijuana Use - Middle School Students YHS F-test, p=0.000 Use in the Past Year - Adults Ages 26+ NSDUH State comparison, non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals Believe Occasional Marijuana Use Poses No Risk of Harm - High School Students YHS F-test, p=0.000 Current Marijuana Use - Adults Ages 18-25 NSDUH State comparison, non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals Believe it Would Be Easy to Obtain Marijuana - High School Students YHS F-test, p=0.001 Current Marijuana - Adults Ages 26+ NSDUH State comparison, non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals Perceptions of Great Risk of Smoking Marijuana Once a Month, Youth Ages 12 -17 NSDUH (data not available for 2014 - 15) State comparison, non- overlapping 95% confidence intervals Perceptions of Great Risk of Smoking Marijuana Once a Month, Adults Ages 18 -25 NSDUH (data not available for 2014 - 15) State comparison, non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals Perceptions of Great Risk of Smoking Marijuana Once a Month, Adults Ages 26+ NSDUH (data not available for 2014 - 15) State comparison, non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals Indicators of Youth Marijuana Use Marijuana use among youth has generally been stable over time, both in states that have legalized recreational marijuana use and those that have not. However, data from Massachusetts suggest that marijuana use may be declining among Massachusetts middle school aged youth. Please see Figure 2 below. 22 Figure 2: Massachusetts Ever Used Marijuana, Middle School Students The specific indicators that show possible sensitivity to changes include: Ever Used Marijuana - Middle School Students Current Marijuana Use - Middle School Students Used Marijuana B efore Age 13 - High School Students Indicators of Youth Marijuana Perceptions Perceptions that there is great risk in occasional marijuana use have been declining over time among youth. This trend is present in Massachusetts, nationally, and in legalized and non -legalized comparison states. More youth in non-legalized comparison states perceive that there is great risk for occasional marijuana use than youth in legalized states. Please see Figure 3 below. Massachusetts youth perceive the risk of occasional marijuana use to be lowest of all states included in analysis. In Massachuset ts, this shift in perception of risk may be more pronounced in high school aged youth than in younger youth. 0%10%20% 2007 2009 2011 2013 20155.8%8.3%MA decriminalization (2008) % (confidence intervals) % (confidence intervals) % (confidence intervals) % (confidence intervals) % (confidence intervals) MA 8.3 (6.9 -10) 9.4 (7.9 -11.2) 8.1 (6.6 -9.9) 7.6 (6.3 -9.1) 5.8 (4.6 -7.3)MA medical marijuana passes (2012)MA medical dispensaries open (2015) 23 Figure 3: Massachusetts and Comparison States Perceptions of Great Risk of Smoking Marijuana Once a Month, Youth Ages 12 -17 Given the parallel trends in several states, trends in these indicators may reflect larger national shifts rather than responses to state -level policy: Perceptions of Great Risk of Smoking Marijuana Once a Month, Youth Ages 12 - 17 Indicators of Adult Marijuana Use Marijuana use seems to be increasing among some adult populations. Marijuana use among adults ages 26 and older has been increasing in Massachusetts and in states that have legalized recreational marijuana. This trend is also present nationally, though not in all non -legalized comparison states. Additionally, states that have legalized marijuana have higher rates of current use than states that do not.

Please see Figure 4 . Figure 4: Massachusetts and Comparison States Current Use Ages 26 and Older Among adults ages 18 -25, who have higher rates of marijuana use than their older counterparts, use has increased in some legalized states but not in Massachusetts. Overall rates of use for all adults ages 18 and older have increased in Washington State, where recreational marijuana is legal. The specific indicators that show possible sensitivity to policy changes include: Current Marijuana Use - Adults Ages 18 -25 and Adults Ages 26+ Use in the Past Year - Adults Ages 18 -25 and Adults Ages 26+ Current Marijuana Use - Adults Ages 18 and Older Ever Used Marijuana - Adults Ages 18 passes (2012) % (confidence intervals) % (confidence intervals) % (confidence intervals) % (confidence intervals) % (confidence intervals) MA 5.2 ( 4.0-6.7) 5.8 (4.5 -7.6) 6.6 (5.1 -8.5) (7.6 -11.1) 4.0 (3.8 4.4 (4.2 (5.2 -5.7) 6.6 (6.3 -6.8) 3.7 ( 3.0-4.4) (3.7 7.1 8.7 ( 6.9-11.0) 10.4 (8.3 -12.9) ( 9.2-13.0) 5.8 (4.5 -7.5) 7.3 (5.6 -9.5) 8.2 (6.4 -10.4) 10.1 (8.1 -12.6) 14.6 (12.4 -17.2) WA 5.6 (4.4 -7.2) 5.5 (4.2 -7.3) 7.3 (5.8 medical dispensaries open (2015) 25 Indicators of Adult Marijuana Perceptions As with youth, perceptions about the risks of marijuana use among adults seem to be shifting; fewer adults believe there is great risk in occasional use. This trend is occurring in Massachusetts, nationally, and in legalized and non -legalized states. Those adults in non-legalized states perceive the risk of occasional use to be higher than those in legalized states. Massachusetts adults' perceptions were closer to those in legalized comparison states than non -legalized. Please see Figures 5 and 6 below. Figure 5.

And likewise legal states' trends (Kansas, Texas and Oklahoma), when comparisons were available, were differe nt from trends in non -legal states. This suggests that some indicators may be responsive to factors associated with legalization of marijuana. The 6 indicators, 2 youth and 4 adult indicators, that differentiated between legal and non -legalized comparison states include: Used Marijuana Before Age 13, High School Students Perceptions of Great Risk of Smoking Marijuana Once a Month, Youth Ages 12 - 17 Current Marijuana Use, Adults Ages 26+ Use in the Past Year, Adults Ages 26+ Perceptions of Great Risk of Smoking Marijuana Once a Month, Adults Ages 18 - 25 Perceptions of Great Risk of Smoking Marijuana Once a Month, Adults Ages 26+ In some cases, the exact items from which the indicators are drawn, were not available for other states. For these indicators, a nalysis of the trends in response to policy changes was conducted. The study identified 7 indicators, 4 youth indicators and 3 adult indicators, which appear to be responsive to changes over time. These indicators include: Ever Used Marijuana - Middle Sch ool Students Current Marijuana Use - Middle School Students Believe Occasional Marijuana Use Poses No Risk of Harm - High School Students Believe it Would Be Easy to Obtain Marijuana - High School Students Current Marijuana Use - Adults Ages 18 -25 Use in the Past Year - Adults Ages 18 -25 Ever Used Marijuana - Adults Ages 18 and Older One indicator, Current Marijuana Use - Adults Ages 18 and Older, was only available for Washington State and therefore it is difficult to assert that similar trends would b e evident in Massachusetts. The data sets utilized were helpful when considering trends in use, consumption, and perceptions of marijuana for health and policy -related purposes. While these data are rich information, consistency with regard to the availabi lity of the data and wording of the questions make drawing state comparisons challenging. 28 References Allen, J., & Holder, M.

Findings are based on data provided by Massachusetts adults who co mpleted a survey in the fall of 2017. Despite the existence of several ongoing surveys of Massachusetts adults, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), there are significant gap s in the information that they provide. For example, existing Massachusetts databases did not provide information about various modes of consumption (from smoking, to eating, to vaping and dabbing). The purpose of this survey was to address these gaps an d provide a \"snapshot\" of marijuana use and related behaviors in Massachusetts in the time before retail sales of adult use marijuana begin. This study provides a \"baseline\" or benchmark against which future studies can make comparisons. The information fr om this survey will enable ongoing study of impacts that can inform the Commonwealth's policy and regulatory response over the course of the next several years. Methods We conducted a cross -sectional, population -based survey of adults in Massachusetts. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. A copy of the survey instrument can be found in the Appendix A. Data Collection and Participants The University of Massachusetts Amherst partnered with the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute to conducted a mail and web -based survey designed to be representative of adults in Massachusetts, age 18 years or older. Participants were chosen randomly using address -based sampling from a list of M assachusetts residential households obtained through a sampling vendor. The sample was stratified by 6 regions (Boston, Central, Metrowest, Northweast, Southeast, and Western). Addresses that were known to be vacant, seasonal, educational, or drop points w ere excluded from the sample. A simple random sample of 15,000 addresses were selected to participate with an equal number of households (n=2500) selected from each region. The survey was then administered in four waves over a four -week period. Wave 1: Pr e-notification postcard A pre -notification postcard was sent to selected addresses informing participants about the survey eligibility to participate. On the postcard and all subsequent mailings an online survey link with a unique access code was provided for those who chose to complete the web -based version. Online survey participants could only complete the survey once, and quality checks were implemented to identify duplicate completions (by 33 mail and online) using the same code. The postcard and all sub sequent materials included a means to opt out of participation by calling the researchers. Wave 2: Mail Survey The postcard was followed by a survey packet containing an informed consent letter, the full survey, a postage -paid business reply envelope, an d an up -front cash incentive of $2. The survey instructed the adult in the household with the most recent birthday to complete the survey. Responses were tracked with a unique identification number to allow for follow -up mailings. Wave 3: Reminder Postcar d After the initial wave of survey mailing, a reminder postcard with the online link was sent to all non -responders. Wave 4: Final Mail Survey The final opportunity to respond was via paper -based survey with the informed consent cover letter and online link. This was sent to those who still had not responded or had not notified the researchers of their desire not to participate. Data were collected between November 7, 2017 (first online response opportunity) and December 30, 2017. Completed mail surve ys were scanned using a computerized system. The scanned dataset was combined with the online responses and an initial quality review removed all duplicate surveys from the dataset. The resultant dataset included 3,023 respondents with a 21.7% response rat e. Measures The survey contained 37 items that assessed a limited number of demographic characteristics, past 30 -day substance use (marijuana, alcohol, and other substances), and behaviors related to substance use such as driving under the influence an d riding with a driver who was under the influence. When possible the wording of items was aligned with national population health surveys (e.g. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, National Survey on Drug Use and Health) to facilitate comparisons of estimates. Demographic characteristics Basic demographics were ascertained. Participant age was ascertained by asking the survey respondent to report their year of birth. Participants reported gender as female, male, or other. Race/ethnicity was asked with two questions. One asked \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?\" and required a yes/no response. The second question asked \"Which one or more of the following would you say is your race?\" with response options that included (1) white or Caucasian, (2) Black or African American, (3) Asian, (4) Native 34 Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, (5) Native American or Alaska Native, (6) Some other race. Participants could choose as may categories as were applicable. The survey ascertained the participants' highest degree or level of school completed, which was reported on the survey with 10 categories ranging from \"never attended school or only attended kindergarten\" to \"doctorate degree\". For analysis, this was coded to a 3 -level variable that included: (1) high school or less, (2) any college, (3) graduate degree. The survey asked about annual household income using the following categories (1) less than $15,000 (2) $15 -29,000 (3) $30,000 -49,000 (4) 50,000 -99,000 (5) 100,000 - 150,000, or (6) 150,000 or more. Participants also reported zip code as well as home owner ship (own, rent, something else). Participants reported their type of healthcare coverage as one or more of the following (1) private commercial or group plan (2) Medicare, (3) Medicaid, (4) Commonwealth Care Program (Health Connector), (5) Indian Health S ervice (6) Veterans Affairs (7) No health insurance, or (8) other plan. Substance Use The survey ascertained past 30 -day use of marijuana, alcohol, and other substances. Marijuana use was assessed with the yes/no question \"In the past 30 days, did you use marijuana or hashish at least once?\" For those who responded \"yes,\" the survey asked about the number of days on which the participated used marijuana in the past 30 days. The purpose of marijuana use was ascertained with a multiple response item indic ating use for one or more of the following: adult use (non -medical), medical use (prescribed by a qualified physician), or medical use (not prescribed by a qualified physician). The mode of use (smoking, eating, drinking, vaporizing, etc.) was assessed wit h a multiple response item. Past 30 -day alcohol use was reported with the yes/no question \" During the past 30 days, did you have at least one drink of any alcoholic beverage such as beer, wine, a malt beverage, or liquor?\" For those who responded \"yes,\" the survey asked them to provide the number of days per week that participants consumed an alcoholic beverage. Use of other substances was coded as \"Yes\" if participants reported use of crack/cocaine, heroin, non -medical use of antianxiety drugs (sedatives , tranquilizers, anxiolytics, or sleeping drugs such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates), non -medical use of prescription opioids, or other drugs (e.g. hallucinogens, non -medical use of stimulants). The instructions to participants in the section of the su rvey on other substances noted that \"non -medical\" prescription drug use means using it to get high or experience pleasurable effects, see what the effects are like, or use with friends. Items and results pertaining to driving under the influence of mariju ana, alcohol, and other drugs are reported in Task 2 of this report, along with items pertaining to use of hospital emergency rooms and urgent care related to substance use. Data Quality Assessment The data was subject to a quality check process. Duplic ates were identified and removed, leaving 3268 respondents. We verified that skip logic was properly applied. Other instances with out -of-range responses (e.g. reported having 33 children in the home) were also coded as missing. Any instances in which retu rned responses were 35 unreasonable were coded as a missing response on the illogical variable. In cases in which a respondent reported driving under the influence of a substance, but did not first report using that substance, we set the response to the quest ion about use to yes. This affected a very small number of cases. Statistical Procedures and Analysis Weighting Weights were assigned to each completed survey so that the survey responses closely represent the Massachusetts population relative to age, g ender, race, and education. The weighting scheme included six steps that are summarized below. First, a weight was assigned to directly account for the sampling fraction of addresses. Second, using information on the sample addresses, adjustments were mad e for unknown eligibility of the addresses. Eligibility was classified into one of four categories: (1) eligible respondent, (2) eligible non -respondent, (3) known ineligible addresses, and (4) unknown status. Eligible respondents resided at the sample add ress, were 18 years or older, and lived in Massachusetts for 6 or more months per year. Addresses with unknown status included addresses where surveys were not returned (n=11,163), surveys bounced back to the post office (presumably based on refusal of rec ipient) (n=504), and surveys returned blank (n=65). The eligibility weighting accounted for the fact that our knowledge of eligibility status may be related to other address characteristics such as the type of postal route (rural, street, firm, high -rise, etc.). The third step in the weighting was to adjust for non -response. We defined a complete survey as one in which the respondent provided basic demographics (age, gender, race, and education) and answered the item on past 30 -day marijuana use. We observ ed a difference in the survey completion rate for eligible addresses by region (p=0.03) and a weight was developed to account for this. Household size was accounted for next. Raking was then used to align the weights to the distribution of four demograph ic variables (age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education) to the Massachusetts target population based on the 2016 American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data. The last step trimmed weights to improve estimation accuracy. Statistica l Analysis In most cases, variables were defined as shown on the survey. For example, past 30 - day marijuana use was defined as \"Yes\" based on an answer of yes to the question, \"In the past 30 days, did you use marijuana or hashish at least once?\" For analysis purpose s, we coded race as a 5 -level categorical variable with the following categories (1) White, non -Hispanic, (2) Black non -Hispanic, (3) Any Hispanic/Latino (4) Asian, non - Hispanic, (5) Other. First, we examined the bivariate differences in characteristics between adults who had used marijuana in the past 30 days and those who had not. Next, we used modified 36 Poisson regression with robust standard errors (Zou, 2004) to assess associations between use of marijuana (yes/no), gender, age, race/ethnicity, and other covariates (education, home ownership, children in household, region, alcohol and other substance use). This approach allowed estimation of relative risk, adjusting for potential confounders. We used a two -tailed significance level at p <0.05 for all statistical tests. All analyses were weighted to acc ount for the complex survey design, yielding results that have been adjusted to be representative of the adult population in Massachusetts. The analysis for this report was generated using SAS/STAT software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows (Copyr ight \u00a9 2016 SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA.) with the exception of the Poisson regression models which were generated using Stata 15 statistical software (StataCorp, LLC, College Station, TX). Results A total of 3,528 surveys were returned, of which 2 60 were duplicates. And additional 245 were determined ineligible or incomplete. After removing the duplicate, ineligible and complete surveys, 3,023 remained. The logic -checking process resulted in identification of one case in which multiple questions ha d unreasonable responses. This case was dropped, resulting in a final analytic sample of 3,022. Prevalence of Marijuana Use Of the 3,022 adults in the sample, 439 self -reported marijuana use in the past 30 days, and 2,583 did not. After data were weighted, results indicate that 21.1% of adults in Massachusetts have used marijuana in the past 30 days (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 18.6, 23.6), and 78.9% have not (95% CI 76.4, 81.4) (Table 1). Hereafter, we report only the population -level point estim ates; confidence interval data are presented in each table. We examined prevalence rates of past 30 -day marijuana use among key socio - demographic groups. These analyses indicated that 25.9% of adult men in Massachusetts and 17.0% of women have used mariju ana in the past 30 days. By age category, past 30 -day marijuana use was reported by 54.4% of adults aged 18 to 20, 49.1% of those aged 21 to 25, 34.5% of those aged 26 to 29, 22.7% of those aged 30 to 39, 19.3% of those aged 40 to 49, 18.7% of those aged 50 to 59, 14.1% of those aged 60 to 69, and 3.4% of those aged 70 or older. To enable comparisons of age-specific marijuana prevalence with other estimates (presented in Chapter 1), we changed the categorization of age to create a category that captured ag ed 26 or older. Past 30 -day marijuana use was reported by 18.0% (95% CI 15.7, 20.3) of adults aged 26 or older. By race/ethnicity, past 30 -day marijuana use was reported by 20.1% of Whites, 27.1% of Hispanics, 10.4% of Asians, 25.8% of Blacks, and 37.5% of other race/ethnic groups. By educational attainment, past 30 -day marijuana use was reported by 24.7% of adults with a High School education or less, 22.9% of those with a college degree, and 10.7% of adults with a post -secondary graduate degree. By income , past 30-day marijuana use was reported by 32.5% of adults earning less than $15,000. Fewer people in each of the higher income categories reported past 30 -day use, with 37 prevalence rates ranging between about 17.3% and 25%. By region, past 30 -day marijuan a use was reported by 29.8% of Western residents, 20.9% of Southeast residents, 20.5% of Boston residents, 20.1% of Northeast residents, 19.6% of Central residents, and 18.2% of Metrowest residents. Socio -Demographic Characteristics Table 2 presents socio-demographic characteristics of adults who had used marijuana in the past 30 days compared with adults who had not. A greater proportion of marijuana users than non -users are men, 57.7% versus 44.5% (p<0.001). With respect to age, marijuana users tend to be younger than non -users, with a greater proportion of them in the youngest age categories (p<0.001). Specifically, 9.6% of marijuana users are aged 18 to 20, versus 2.2% of non -users, 14.7% of marijuana users are 21 to 25, versus 4.2% of non -users, and 1 4.3% of marijuana users are 26 to 29, versus 7.4% of non -users. For the 30 to 59 age categories, differences between marijuana users and non -users are small (<5%). A smaller proportion of marijuana users than non -users are aged 60 to 69, 10.1% versus 16.7% , and a smaller proportion are 70 or older, 2.3% versus 17.2%. A smaller proportion of marijuana users than non -users are White or Asian, and a greater proportion are Hispanic, African American, or other race/ethnicity (p<0.05). Specifically, 70.8% of mar ijuana users are White, versus 75.5% of non -users, and 3.2% of marijuana users are Asian, versus 7.3% of non -users. Among marijuana users, 12.0% are Hispanic, 7.1% are African American, and 6.9% are another race/ethnicity. Among non -users, in comparison, 8 .7% are Hispanic, 5.5% are African American, and 3.1% are another race/ethnicity. 38 Table 1.

A smaller proportion of marijuana users than non -users own a home, and a greater proportion rent or have another type of living arrangements (p<0.001). 39 There are no differences between mariju ana users and non -users in the remaining socio -demographic characteristics, including income, having children in the home, health insurance type, and region of residence. For both groups, most report an income of $50,000 to $99,999 or more, few have childr en in the home, private health insurance is the most common type of health insurance, follow ed by Medicare and Mass Health.

Among all adults, 69.4% had consumed alcohol in the prior 30 days, and 4.1% had consumed another substance. Other substance use was defined as past 30 -day use of any of the following substance types: non -prescribed opioids, cocaine/crack, heroin, non -medical anti -anxiety drugs, and other illicit substances. Prevalence rates were relatively small for each of the other substance categories, i.e., 0.9% for cocaine/crack, 0.1% for heroin, 1.3% for non -medical use of anti -anxiety substances, 1.4% for non -medical use of opioids, and 0.4% for other illegal substances. We stratified data to examine alcohol and other substance use by adults who had used marijuana in the past 30 days compared with adults who had not. A g reater proportion of marijuana users than non -users had used alcohol. Specifically, 82.1% of marijuana users had used alcohol, versus 66.0% of non -users (p<0.001). Also, a greater proportion of marijuana users than non -users had used other substances. Spec ifically, 9.8% of marijuana users had used other substances, versus 2.6% of non -users (p<0.01). Analysis of each substance type revealed that 3.8% of marijuana users had used non -prescribed opioids, versus of non -users (p<0.05), and that similar propo rtions of adults in each group had past 30 -day use of cocaine/crack, heroin, non - medical anti -anxiety drugs, and other illicit substances. Given the low rates of past 30 - day use of each of these substances, interpretation of these resul ts should be made with caution. 42 Table 4.

Marijuana Consumption Patterns, Methods, and Expenditures Table 5 presents marijuana consumption patterns, methods, and expenditures reported by Massachusetts adults who had used marijuana in the past 30 days. About half (50.6%) of marijuana users consumed it only by smoking, while 42.9% used more than one method of consumption. Fewer marijuana users vaporized or ate marijuana, 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively. Less than 1% only drank or dabbed marijuana, or only used it topically or sublingually. More than half of Massachusetts adult marijuana users, 56.0%, report using marijuana only for adult non -medical purpose s. Adults also use marijuana for medical reasons; 4% only used prescribed marijuana, 11.5% only used non -prescribed marijuana. In other words, 15.5% used either prescribed or not prescribed marijuana for medical reasons. More than one -quarter, 28.5%, repor ted both adult and medical marijuana use. Of Massachusetts adult marijuana users, 35.5% spent no money on marijuana in the past month, 31.5% spent between $1 and $80, and 33.0% spent $81 or more. 43 Table 5.

It is important to reme mber that because the survey used a cross -sectional design, the results shown here reflect factors that are associated with marijuana use and cannot be interpreted as being causally related to marijuana use. We report relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Men were more likely than women to use marijuana (RR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.1-1.6). Age is also associated with marijuana use. Compared to adults aged 18 to 20, adults aged 26 to 34 were less likely to use marijuana (RR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.4 -0.9), as a re 35 to 64 (RR=0.3; 95% CI: 0.2 -0.5), and adults aged 65 and older (RR=0.1; 95% CI: 0.1 -0.2). Having a graduate degree, compared with having attained a High School education or less, was negatively associated with marijuana use (RR=0.5; 95% CI: 0.4-0.8). Renting a home, compared with owning a home, was positively associated with marijuana use (RR=1.5; 95% CI: 1.1 -1.9). Having children in the home was negatively associated with marijuana use (RR=0.8; 95% CI: 0.6 -1.0). Compared with living in Bos ton, living in the Northeast (RR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.2 (RR=2.0; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.0) regions of the state are each positively associated with marijuana use. Marijuana use is positively associated with 44 past 30 -day use of alcohol (RR=1.9; 95% CI: 1.4 -2.6) and other substances (RR=1.7; 95% CI: 1.3 -2.4). See Table 6. Table 6.

Results are based on weighted, multivariable regression analysis. 45 Discussion We found that 21.1% of adults in Massachusetts had used marijuana in the past 30 days. Estimates are substantially higher than those provided by other surveys. For example, as presented in Chapter 1, 5.2% of Massachusetts adults aged 26 or older reported recent use of marijuana in 2006, and 9.2% reported recent use in 2014. In the present st udy, 18.0% of adults aged 26 or older had used marijuana in the past 30 days . Increases in marijuana prevalence among Massachusetts adults may be attributable to shifts in public opinion regarding marijuana, and in marijuana -related law and public policy. Men in Massachusetts are more likely than women to use marijuana, as are individuals aged 18 to 20. Marijuana prevalence rates are 25.9% for men and 17.0% for women, 54.4% for those aged 18 to 20 and 49.1% for those aged 21 to 25. Findings regarding the greater likelihood of marijuana use by men and younger adults remained significant in regression analysis which accounts for the effect of other factors on marijuana use. Relationships are more complex between marijuana use and other factors, in particula r, race/ethnicity and education. By race/ethnicity, prevalence of marijuana use is highest among Hispanics, at 27.1%, followed by 25.8% of Blacks, 20.1% of Whites, 10.4% of Asians, and 37.5% of other race/ethnic groups. Among marijuana users living in MA, most are White, 70.8%, and many fewer are Hispanic, 12.0%, Black, 7.1%, other, 6.9%, or Asian, 3.2%. In the regression analysis, which accounted for the effect of other factors, race/ethnicity was not associated with marijuana use, suggesting that the lik elihood of using marijuana is similar for each group (compared to Whites), when other factors are accounted for. As for educational attainment, prevalence data and bivariate analysis indicate that a greater proportion of adults with a High School degree o r college education use marijuana than adults with a graduate degree. In regression analysis, which accounts for the effect of other factors on marijuana use, adults with a college education are as likely to use marijuana as those with a high school educat ion or less. In contrast, adults with a graduate degree are less likely to use marijuana that those with a High School education or less. Relationships between marijuana use, educational attainment, and other indicators of economic status are known to be c omplex and poorly understood. For example, college students face added risks for marijuana use that have been attributed to a diverse set of factors that include: overestimation among college students regarding how often the average student uses drugs (McC abe, 2008); perceptions among college students that drug use during their college years is normative (Cook, Bauermeister, Gordon -Messer & Zimmerman, 2013; Pischke et al., 2012); the expectation among college students that drugs will reduce social anxiety a nd facilitate the formation of new peer friendships (Buckner, 2013); and greater exposure to drug - using opportunities that exist on college campuses (Arria et al., 2008). Patterns of m arijuana use among college graduates have been attributed to age-graded changes in social roles and associated normative behavior that generally accompany the life transitions that this event signifies (Kandel & Chen, 2000). The present study 46 was not designed to explore these types of relationships, and therefore fi ndings should be interpreted with caution. By region, residents in the Western area of the state report the highest prevalence rate of past 30 -day marijuana use, at 29.8%, with rates in other areas of the Commonwealth ranging from 20.9% to 18.2%. In Poiss on regression analysis, compared with living in Boston, living in the Northeast, Southeast, and Western regions of the state are each positively associated with marijuana use. Findings suggest that the public health impacts of marijuana use may not be even ly distributed across the state. Other factors associated with a lower likelihood of marijuana use are home ownership and having children in home. Given the cross -sectional design of the study, we cannot determine the nature of these relationships and ther efore these findings should not be interpreted as being causally related. About 7 out of 10 Massachusetts adults consume alcohol, and 4 out of 100 consume another substance (e.g., non -prescribed opioids, cocaine/crack, heroin, non -medical anti-anxiety dru gs, and other illicit substances). Notably, a greater proportion of Massachusetts marijuana users than non -users consume alcohol and other substances, particularly non-prescribed opioids, and use of alcohol and other substances is associated with a greater likelihood of using marijuana . The co -occurring use of marijuana with alcohol and other substances, particularly during adolescence and young adulthood, is well -established (Swift et al., 2012; Tzilos, Reddy, Caviness, Anderson & Stein, 2014). Just over half of Massachusetts adults favored the legalization of marijuana, with double the proportion of marijuana users than non -users supporting legalization. As there have been dramatic shifts in public opinion regarding marijuana and in marijuana -related law and Wagenaar, Chaloupka, & Caulkins, 2014; Pew Research Center, 2014), the incidence and prevalence of both marijuana use and also marijuana use disorders are expected to increase (Budney & Moore, 2002; Hasin et al., 2017; Martins et al., 2016; Volkow, Baler, Compton, & Weiss, 2014). Of those who ever use marijuana, about 21% develop a marijuana use disorder (Caulkins, 2018). However, the proportion of marijuana users who meet disorder criteria is differe nt by age. For example, national prevalence data indicate that in 2016, approximately 7.2 million young adults aged 18 to 25 were current users of marijuana, or 20.8% of young adults, and of these, 1.7 million had a marijuana use disorder in the past year, or 5.0% (SAMHSA, 2017). Expressed another way, these data indicate that about 24% of young adults aged 18 to 25 who use marijuana meet disorder criteria. Longitudinal studies have documented that while marijuana use can extend over many years of the life course, for most individual's problematic marijuana use is generally limited to young adulthood (Chen & Jacobsen, 2012; DeWit, Offord & Wong, 1997; Schulenberg et al., 2005), and only about 9% of marijuana users remain dependent on the substance over the l ong-term (Hall & Degenhardt, 2009). However, once a marijuana use disorder does develop, it is associated with increased risk of several diseases and poor health outcomes, including impaired respiratory function, cardiovascular disease, adverse effects on adolescent psychosocial development and 47 mental health, and residual cognitive impairment (Hall & Degenhardt, 2013). In the present study, we only examined marijuana use, and we did not include measurement of marijuana use disorders. More than half of adul t marijuana users in Massachusetts report using marijuana only for adult non -medical purposes, but a significant proportion also report using it for medical reasons. At the same time, a greater proportion of marijuana users than non - users perceive marijuan a to have no health risks, or only slight risks, and marijuana users are less likely to perceive that marijuana poses moderate or great risks. Marijuana is primarily used for adult use because it induces euphoria, drowsiness, and feelings of relaxation (In aba & Cohen, 2011). Individuals who use marijuana therapeutically report that it relieves conditions and symptoms such as glaucoma, nausea, AIDS -associated anorexia and wasting syndrome, chronic pain, inflammation, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy (Volkow, Baler, Compton, & Weiss, 2014). When taken in combination with prescribed medications, however, marijuana may increase the risk of bleeding, change the impact of medications to address blood sugar levels and low blood pressure, interfere with the body's a bility to process certain medications, and have other negative impacts. Studies are underway now to better understand the health risks and benefits of marijuana use. Finally, Accountable Care Organizations and ongoing health care reforms are expected to bring more marijuana users into primary care and other health care settings (Tai et al., 2014; Gordon, Conley & Gordon, 2013). The National Institute on Drug Abuse and other organizations have published evidence -based guidelines on the screening, brief intervention, and treatment of marijuana and other substance use. Also, the proliferation of electronic health records (EHRs) provides the opportunity to track marijuana use, assess its potential interaction with other therapies, and treat it when needed (Fih n et al., 2014; Halamka, 2014; Longhurst, Harrington & Shah, 2014; Weil, 2014). However, given the special regulations that govern addiction healthcare records (e.g., 42 CFR) and reluctance among patients and physicians to report the illicit and stigmatize d behaviors that marijuana use once entailed, clinicians may not document marijuana use or refrain from discussing its potential health impacts with patients. Limitations and Strengths Findings must be considered within the context of several limitation s. The survey response rate was 21.7%. While typical of general population surveys like this one, if there was a response bias on a measure not accounted for by the weighting, generalizability may be limited. For example, findings may be impacted by respon se bias if adults who used marijuana were more likely to return the survey than adults who do not use marijuana. This could lead to overestimation of the prevalence of marijuana use. T he cross -sectional survey design precludes determining the temporal sequencing of experiences and prevents drawing of causal inferences. For this reason, it is appropriate to interpret findings as highlighting those factors that are associated with, but not necessarily causally related to, the outcomes of interest. 48 Marij uana and other substance use were both self -reported, and not corroborated by testing of biological samples. Social desirability bias can lead to underestimates in survey research, however a unique contribution of this study is that it is the first to be conducted in Massachusetts after legalization of marijuana for adult use. Data was collected in late 2017, nearly one year after marijuana became legal for adult use by, and several years after legalization of medical marijuana in Massachusetts. Reporting o f illegal behaviors (e.g. use of illicit drugs; driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs) may be underreported. Small cell sizes for categories of some variables likely mean that models including them are underpowered. The survey omitted individual s aged 17 or younger and adults living in non -residential settings (e.g., incarcerated settings, group home residents, etc.). Therefore, findings may underrepresent certain groups that may be more likely to use marijuana. We did not explore associations co mparing mental health conditions, adulthood trauma, or other known risk factors for marijuana use, whether associations are different among subgroups of adults (moderation), or the processes through which factors are associated with the outcomes of interes t (mediation), constituting several areas for future research. 49 References Allen, J., & Holder, M.

The aim of this survey is to better understand the patterns of marijuana use, perceptions, and behaviors among medical use of marijuana patients in Massachusetts. Massachusetts Department of Public Health contracted with JSI Research & Training Institute in April 2018 to administer a survey among participants of the Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program. 42,796 partic ipants of the Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program were invited through email to take the survey using a computer, smartphone, or tablet. Methods Data collection efforts were conducted in April 2018 by JSI Research & Training Institute in conjunction with Massachusetts Department of Public Health. All registered participants of the Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program were invited to complete the survey via an emailed link to Survey Gizmo. The survey incorporated 81 items covering topics such as demographics, marijuana and marijuana product use, methods of marijuana administration, perceptions of medical use of marijuana, driving and other issues related to marijuana use, alcohol consumption, non -medical use of prescription drugs a nd other substances, and combination substance use. Respondents were sent 2 reminder emails and given the option at the end of the survey to enter a lottery drawing of $500, $250, or $100. The analyses look both at individual item response summaries as we ll as investigating differences between gender (male vs. female), age (50 years old vs. >50 years old), and education level (<Bachelor's (4 -year college) degree vs. Bachelor's degree) through cross -tabulation comparisons. Chi -square tests for equality of proportions were run to detect significant differences in item response distribution across groups. Exact significance tests were used to test equality of proportions in cases where response categories were too small for reliable chi -square testing. In ca ses where mean statistics are presented, independent t -tests were run to detect significant differences between comparison groups. Highly statistically significant results are highlighted in the summary text throughout this report, and all tables present i tem response frequency, percentages, and results of statistical testing. Appendix B contains all survey questions administered as well as guiding logic used to prompt or restrict respondents to relevant next questions based on their answers to previous it ems. 54 Results Response Rate Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of the overall survey sample compared to all eligible survey participants. All adult registered medical use of marijuana patients in the Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Pro gram were eligible for participation in the 2018 Medical Use of Marijuana Patient Survey (N=42,796). 6934 of these patients responded to the 2018 Medical Use of Marijuana Patient Survey, for a response rate of nearly 16%. There were no noticeable differenc es between 2018 survey respondent distributions and the full eligible population across gender, age, and county, suggesting that respondent population demographics are comparable to the overall eligible population of medical use of marijuana patients in Ma ssachusetts. Table 1. DPH Patient Survey Response Rate and Comparison of Sample Population Full Eligible Population (N=42,796) 2018 Survey Respondents (N=6934) Response Rate 15.93% (42.96) (44.82) Other not to answer 60 ( 0.14) 39 ( 0.57) Age (in years) N=42796 % % 18 to 25 3471 ( 26 Not provided 56 ( 0.13) 223 ( 0.02) 55 Respondent Demographics Approximately equal proportions of all respondents were male compared to female (55% vs. 45%) or under 51 years old (53% vs. 47%). A majority of respondents were Non-Hispanic White (87%), followed by Hispanic (5%), and Non -Hispanic Black or African America n (3%). Less than 3% of respondents identified as more than one race, or other (Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Alaska Native, or other). 98% of all respondents reported their highest level of education as at least high school gr aduation or GED, while over 50% reported receiving a Bachelor's degree or higher. Less than 10% reported an annual household income below $15,000, with the majority reporting over $40,000. Less than 1% of women were currently pregnant or breastfeeding. Table 2A shows results of significance tests comparing demographic characteristics by gender. A significantly larger proportion of female than male respondents reported their highest education as a professional degree beyond a Bachelor's degree (27% vs. 22 %). Female respondents reported annual household incomes between $15,000 and $75,000 compared to males (46% vs. 38%), while a larger proportion of male respondents than female reported annual household incomes above $75,000 (53% vs. 44%). Table 2B shows results of significance tests comparing demographic characteristics by age group. The racial distribution of respondents under the age of 51 was significantly more diverse than respondents over the age of 50, as exhibited by the proportion of non-Hispanic White respondents (83% vs. 93%). Most notably, a larger proportion of Hispanic respondents were under age 51 than over 50. A larger proportion of respondents over the age of 50 than under had professional degrees beyond a Bachelor's degree (29% vs. 20%). O lder respondents reported annual household income earnings above $100,000 at a higher rate than younger respondents (38% vs. 34%). Table 2C shows results of significance tests comparing demographic characteristics by educational attainment. A l arger proportion of respondents with at least a Bachelor's degree than respondents without a degree were aged 65 years or older (20% vs. 12%) or between 26 to 35 years old (20% vs. 17%), while a larger proportion of respondents without a Bachelor's degree were aged between 18 and 25 (10% vs. 4%) and 51 to 64 (33% vs. 29%). A larger proportion of respondents with at least a Bachelor's degree identified as non -Hispanic White compared to respondents with an educational attainment below a Bachelor's degree (90% vs. 84%). Respondents with at least a Bachelor's degree also reported annual household incomes above $75,000 at higher rates than participants without a Bachelor's degree (63% vs. 33%). 56 Table 2A: DPH Patient Survey Characteri stics of Respondents by Gender Total N % Gender Male (N=3732) Female (N=3056) p-value Gender 6818 no test Male 3723 54.61 Female 3056 44.82 Other / choose not to answer 39 0.57 Age (in years) 6772 ** 18 to 25 477 7.04 244 6.66 214 7.13 26 to 35 1256 18.55 87.70 188 2.82 102 2.84 83 2.77 Asian, non -Hispanic 52 0.78 29 0.81 22 0.74 Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, non - Hispanic 14 0.21 8 0.22 6 0.20 More than one race, non -Hispanic 171 2.56 79 2.20 89 2.98 Hispanic 323 4.84 183 5.10 133 4.45 Other 90 52 1.45 35 1.17 *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; ****p<0.0001; ns=not significant 57 (Continued) Table 2A.

All survey respondents were asked to report on the number of days in the past 30 days that they used marijuana or marijuana products. On average, respondents reported marijuana use for 23.5 days out of 30. Over 60% of respondents reported marijuana use for over 20 out of 30 days, while approximately 8% reported no use. A slightly higher rate of respondents under the age of 51 reported at least 11 days of use compared to respondents over age 50 (82% vs. 76%). A larger proportion of respondents without a Bachelor's degree than respondents with a Bachelor's degree reported use for over 20 out of 30 days (65% vs. 56%). 62 Respondents who indicated having used marijuana or marijuana products at least once in the past 30 days were asked to report their total monthly expenditures on marijuana and marijuana products. Almost 40% of these respondents report ed spending at least $201 on marijuana or marijuana products in the past 30 days, while only 10% reported spending nothing. On average, male respondents reported spending approximately $20 more than females, with a larger proportion of males than females s pending at least $151 (56% vs. 51%). Respondents under age 51 reported spending an average of $82 more than older respondents, with a larger proportion of younger respondents than older spending at least $151 (60% vs. 47%). Respondents without a Bachelor's degree spent approximately $71 more than respondents with a Bachelor's degree, with a larger proportion of respondents without a Bachelor's spending at least $151 (61% vs. 48%).

Over 90% of respondents indicated some certified medical use of marijuana, 6% some uncertified medical use, and 17% indicated some recreational use. These categories are not mutually exclusive, suggesting that while most respondents are using marijuana to treat medical conditions, but some are also using recreationally. Results from this survey suggest that respo ndents appear to be treating a wide range of medical conditions, and often more than one at a time. The top 5 medical conditions being treated were anxiety (60% or all respondents), chronic pain (46%), insomnia (43%), depression (42%), and stress (41%), an d the average number of conditions being treated by medical marijuana is 4.7. 149 Patients registered with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Medical Use of Marijuana Program were certified by a qualified physician or clinician because of a debili tating medical situation, which often has multiple associated medical conditions for which marijuana use can assuage. Results from this study confirm this, suggesting that patients believe marijuana use is alleviating multiple. While a qualified physicia n or clinician may certify a patient with a debilitating medical condition for medical use of marijuana, they are not required to write a prescription specifying the product type the patient must use (although they may make recommendations as the patients is under their care). As such, patients have access to a wide range of marijuana administration methods. Results from this study indicate that respondents use multiple methods of administration, over the course of 30 days, with an average of 2.9 methods. I n fact, less than one fifth of all respondents reported only one method of marijuana administration, while over 30% reported using 4 or more. The most common method of marijuana administration was smoking dried flower (65%), followed by vaporized marijuana concentrate (62%) and edible marijuana products (51%). All respondents were asked questions related to perceptions of the Medical Use of Marijuana Program. In general, respondents reported favorably towards medical use of marijuana. Almost all responde nts considered the use to be effective in treating their conditions with over 65% of respondents reported that they believed use of marijuana or marijuana products has been \"very effective\" and an additional 26% believed use of marijuana to be \"effective\". Also almost 90% of respondents reported that they had \"somewhat high\" or \"very high\" confidence that they were receiving safe, uncontaminated products when purchasing marijuana or marijuana products at a licensed dispensary. 94% reported feeling \"somewha t safe\" or \"very safe\" when purchasing medical marijuana at a dispensary, and 66% reported \"somewhat high\" or \"very high\" knowledge of their recommended marijuana or marijuana product based on the information provided by their certified practition er. Findings from this study also suggest that respondents perceive marijuana use to have very high rates of positive outcomes and little obvious harm. 78% of respondents reported positive changes in their mood or mental health, 67% reported improved physi cal health, and 83% reported no negative outcomes or consequences related to their marijuana use. Thus, respondents are highly satisfied with their access to marijuana products and information and believe they have largely benefitted from medical use of ma rijuana with very little, if any negative effects. Finally, almost 60% or respondents who reported use of prescription drugs, over -the- counter, medications, or other substances (for medical use only) also reported cutting down or stopping use of other pre scription drugs, over the counter medications, or other substances since beginning to use marijuana. 150 Conclusion/Public Health Implications The Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Program is considered to be a very important and valuable asset to the ment al and physical health of participants. Respondents of the 2018 Medical Use of Marijuana Patient Survey indicate general satisfaction with the program, few negative outcomes, and in particular have reported a reduction in the use of other drugs and medica tions as a result of marijuana use. 151 Task 2: Incidents of Impairment and Hospitalization Chapter 1: Measuring Marijuana Exposure and its Effects Related to Driving Impairment: A State of the Science Review 152 Introduction In states that have chosen to legalize marijuana, one concern among public health and public safety professionals and citizens is the potential impact of marijuana legalization on motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). Studies suggest that recent can nabis use is associated with an increased crash risk between 22% -100% (Asbridge, Hayden, & Cartwright, 2017; Rogeberg & Elvik, 2016) . However, there are challenges to the detection and deterrence of marijuana -impaired driving. Although a substantial body of literature related to methods for identifying acute marijuana exposure and impairment exists, best practice for doing so has yet t o be established. As such, states that are implementing legalization of marijuana are doing so without established guidelines for detecting marijuana -impaired driving in a manner that is relatively non -invasive and sufficiently accurate to prove impairmen t. Washington State has selected 5ng/mL as a per se limit; Colorado uses this level as \"presumptive evidence\" of impairment. This report reviews the relevant scientific literature on the topic of measuring marijuana as it relates to driving impairment. Scientific Foundation The content of this report is predicated on several accepted premises that are derived from current scientific knowledge. First, with regard to marijuana pharmacokinetics, it is established that combustion (burning) of the dried flowe r of the cannabis plant converts tetrahydrocannabinolic acid to 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Huestis, 2007) . THC is then metabolized in to psychoactive 11 -OH-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (OH -THC; Huestis, 2007) . The 9-THC is the main source of the pharmacological effects caused by cannabis consumption. Cannabinoids exert many effects through activation of G -protein -coupled cannabinoid receptors in the brain and peripheral tissues (Grotenhermen, 2003) . There is also evidence for non -receptor -dependent mechanisms (Grotenhermen, 2003) . Cannabis is usually inhaled or taken orally. The pharmacokinetics of THC vary by route of peak within a few minutes (Grotenhermen, 2003) . Psychotropic effects begin within seconds to a few minutes, reach a maximum after 15 - 30 minutes, and taper off within 2 -3 hours (Grotenhermen, 2003) . Following oral ingestion, psychotropic effects onset after 30 -90 min utes, reach a maximum after 2 -3 hours, and last for about 4 -12 hours, depending on dose and specific effect (Grotenhermen, 2003; Hollister et al., 1981; Wall, Sadler, Brine, Taylor, & Perez -Reyes, 1983) . With regard to biological measurement of marijuana exposure, we take blood to be the \"gold standard\" in terms of the matrix that has been best studied. Urine and oral fluid have also been studied to a great extent. The relationship between route of administration and measurement of cannabis in oral fluid is an area of ongoing research and will be described below. 153 Prevalence of Cannabis -Positive Drivers in Motor Vehicle Cra shes In the U.S. estimates of the prevalence of marijuana involvement in MVCs vary. As part of the background information for this state of the science review (SSR) we systematically collected all studies reporting prevalence of cannabis involvement in MVCs in the U.S. At the national level, one study found that the prevalence of cannabis - involved motor vehicle crashes in 1982 was 10% and that by 2001, the prevalence had increased to 19.6% (Macdonald et al., 2003) . Conversely, another nationwide study found that the overall prevalence of cannabis in motor vehicle crashes between the years 1993 -2014 remained constant at 10.4% which suggests that prevalence had not increased significantly since 1982 (G. Li et al., 2017) . Studies have also been conducted at the state level in locations that have made substantial changes to their marijuana policy by allowing the legal sale of marijuana for medical and/or recreational purposes. States that have undergone such policy changes provide insight that may be especially relevant for Massachusetts. In Colorado, one study conducted between the years 1994 -2011 found that the re was an increase in prevalence of cannabis related motor vehicle crashes from 4.5% in 1994 to 10% in 2011, after medical marijuana was commercialized in mid (Salomonsen -Sautel, Min, Sakai, Thurstone, & Hopfer, 2014) . Findings from another study in Colorado show that in 2006 the prevalence of cannabis related motor vehicle crashes in Colorado was 6.9% and increased to 19% by 2014; Colorado's citizens voted in 2012 to legalize marijuana for non -medical use (Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, 2015) . Results from studies in Washington State indicate that about 10% of drivers in fatal crashes between 2010 -2014 had delta -9-THC in their blood. The prevalence such crashes was stable prior to legalization of recreational marijuana use, but approximately 9 months after legalization took effect it began increasing by nearly 10 percentage points per year (Tefft, Arnold, & Grabowski, 2016) . Another study from 2013 -2014 showed the prevalence of cannabis related motor vehicle crashes in Washington State to be between 7 -8% (Banta -Green, Rowhani -Rahbar, Ebel, Andris, & Qiu, 2016) . Overall, there is conflicting evidence, but studies reviewed here indicate that the prevalence of cannabis -positive drivers in motor vehicle crashes has increased in states where marijuana pol icy has become more permissive. It is important to note that in these prevalence studies, whether drivers were actually impaired by cannabis at the time of the crash was not determined. Collecting a blood test from surviving drivers presents a challenge du e to the invasive nature of blood collection; time delays between a crash and blood testing are common and problematic since delta -9-THC levels rapidly decrease after smoking (Wood, Brooks -Russell, & Drum, 2016) . Study Purpose The establishment of fair and appropriate methods to detect marijuana -related driving impairment could help ensure public safety in environments with legal marijuana and 154 provide important information about prevalence. This review of the literature is under taken for the purpose of summarizing the available scientific evidence. Specifically, we sought to: 1) Describe the analytical methods used to quantify marijuana exposure in laboratory and field settings; 2) Describe measurements of marijuana -related impai rment that are relevant to operating a motor vehicle; and 3) Provide an integration and discussion of evidence for approaches that link marijuana - related measurements of exposure with measurements of impairment that are relevant to operating a motor vehicl e. Research Questions RQ1: What is the most current science on quantifying marijuana exposure in an analytical chemistry laboratory or clinical laboratory setting in different matrices (blood, oral fluid, urine) through quantitative measurement of mari juana and its metabolites? RQ2: What methods (e.g., devices, tests, kits, etc.) are currently available for quantifying marijuana exposure in the field and what is the precision and accuracy of these methods for detecting marijuana exposure (compared to laboratory -based methods)? RQ3a : What are the cognitive and behavioral indicators of marijuana exposure that are relevant to operating a motor vehicle? How have these been characterized at baseline (non-impaired) levels? RQ3b: How are the cognitive and behavioral effects of marijuana impairment measured in laboratory settings and in field settings? What validation has been conducted? What is the level of accuracy for determining impairment/non -impairment? Methods We approach ed the research questions above through a systematic literature search process. In instances when a high -quality review article was already published on the topic of interest, we used the review as a starting point and extracted information from the studie s gathered by the review authors. We then conducted a search that covered the time period between the publication of the latest paper included in the review and December 2017. We conducted the searches in the following order: RQ2, RQ3a, RQ3b, RQ1. More in formation is provided below, and details of the search terms are provided in Table 1. Search Strings . Research Question 1: Quantifying Marijuana Exposure in a Laboratory Setting Our systematic search conducted for R2 identified studies that were relevant to research question 1. Specificall y, all identified R2 studies utilized similar confirmatory laboratory testing methods to identify marijuana exposure in blood, urine, and or saliva. 155 Given the consistency in the studies identified in R2, we were confident in our assessment that said method s were the state of the science. As such, the goal of our research specific to R1 was to identify one or more studies that confirmed our assessment. We did not deem a systematic review of the literature necessary to accomplish this goal. Instead, we develo ped several search strings to identify studies that provided an overview of current methods as well as potential future directions for laboratory marijuana exposure quantification, particularly in regards to new quantification and interpretation methods fo r THC metabolites. We tested both complex and simple search strings to accomplish this goal. All search strings were tested on PubMed. We found that one particular simple search string performed best. The string identified 22 total references. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance and a recent article written by a leading expert in the field was identified. Given that the content of this article matched closely to what we were attempting to procure, we chose to utilize it as the center piece of our response to this question. Other identified references, either from the broad R1 search or the systematic, targeted R2 search were utilized as appropriate. Research Question 2: Methods for Quantifying Marijuana Exposure in a Field Setting We conduct ed a systematic search of the current literature related to on -site testing devices, sometimes called point -of-collection tests (POCT), for measuring marijuana. We did not restrict the search to specific biological matrices (i.e. only blood, only oral fluid). We conducted our search in both PubMed and Web of Science, and searched the relevant gray literature (e.g. AAA Foundation, National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, etc.) for relevant studies. The search was limited to studies published in or after 1995. Search strings were developed in consultation with a University of Massachusetts Amherst librarian with expertise in health science search string development. Searches were conducted on each separate database and abstracts were screened f or appropriateness. To be considered for full text review, abstracts had to convey that the study met the following criteria: (1) was published in English, (2) was conducted in humans, (3) examined field devices or kits, and (4) examined marijuana exposure . Studies identified as candidates for inclusion after the abstract screening process subsequently had their full text reviewed for appropriateness. After full text review, studies were excluded if: (1) Device assessed was only for collection and storage of sample; (2) Study did not assess devices capability as a rapid on -site test; (3) Study assessed devices used to measure synthetic cannabinoids; (4) Device assessed was a laboratory device (5) Study did not assess any on -site device; (6) Study did not p rovide sensitivity or specificity measurements of THC for tested device, or (7) Text of study was not in English. 156 Of 154 combined peer reviewed results identified through our initial searches, 84 were selected for full text review. A majority (61%) of th ese studies were obtained through PubMed. We identified one study from the gray literature for full text review. During full text review, we identified a systematic review and meta -analysis conducted on our topic of interest in 2017 (latest year of included studies was 2015). We used this study as the centerpiece of our review and subsequently reviewed identified stu dies from 2015 -2017 to update and supplement this already completed review. We identified 6 studies that were published beyond the 2015 review. Thus, these 7 studies form the basis of our review for this question. We reviewed the reference list of the 6 mo re recent, original studies and cross -checked this with the review article to ensure that all important papers relevant to the topic were included either in the existing review article or in the original research studies we identified and included. We ex tracted information about sensitivity and specificity of the POCT devices as compared to laboratory methods, and we report accuracy when possible. Sensitivity refers to the percentage of cannabis -using individuals that were correctly identified as positive for cannabis. Specificity refers to the percentage of individuals who did not use cannabis that were correctly identified as non -users by a negative test result. Given the complexity of the studies in this area, we summarized the results in several tables. In synthesizing and interpreting the studies, as a whole, we weighted studies with a larger sample size, controlled laboratory conditions, and comparisons between multiple devices as more salient than others. Research Question 3A: Cognitive and Behav ioral Effects Relevant to Driving A systematic search of the current literature related to cognitive and behavioral indicators of marijuana exposure was conducted. Following advice from a health sciences librarian, we conducted our searches in both PubMed and Web of Science. We also sought input from the librarian for developing and refining our search string. Searches were conducted on each separate database and abstracts were screened for appropriateness. We did not limit the date range on this search. Early in the review process, we identified a recent systematic review (Bondallaz et al., 2016) whose content matched closely with what we were attempting to procure. We judged this review to be of high quality, and therefore used it as the basis for our response to RQ3a. We extracted all individual studies from the review and reviewed them independ ently. We subsequently conducted an update search, using a search string developed in consultation with a health sciences librarian to identify any studies on the subject of interest published after 2013 (the newest study reviewed in the review article). In total, 24 studies were extracted from the Bondallaz review. Our update search (2013 - 2017) initially yielded 367 results from PubMed and 316 from Web of Science. After abstract screening and removal of duplicates, we identified 15 studies for full text r eview from PubMed and 2 studies for full text review from Web of Science. After full text 157 review, we identified an additional 5 studies that had been published on the topic since the Bondallaz review for a total of 29 studies included in our review. Detailed information such as THC dosage, user population, sample size, study setting, indicator tested, measurement approach, and results were extracted from studies included in final review. In order to standardize the information extraction, we defined the relevance of cognitive / behavioral indicators measured according to the recommended behavioral measurements outlined in Guidelines for Research on Drugged Driving (J Michael Walsh, Verstraete, Huestis, & M\u00f8rland, 2008) . These include automotive behavior, control behavior, and executive planning. The only additional category defined outsi de of the three listed above was, \"driving safety/performance metric.\" This was only defined for driving simulator and on road studies which measured direct driving metrics such as mean speed and SD lateral position. This approach was adapted from the Bond allaz review which identified said behavioral measurements and grouped typical neurocognitive tests (Tower of London Task, Critical Tracking Task etc.) according to their corresponding behavioral measurement (Bondallaz et al. 2016 - Table 1) (Bondallaz et al., 2016) . We expanded on this by incorporating these behavioral measurement categories into our analytic table. After information from all s tudies was extracted to the large summary table, we further refined the analysis in order to enhance the digestibility of the results. We created four separate analytic tables grouped by study setting (lab, simulator, on road, and observational). Each tabl e presents a refined analysis, where detailed results are omitted in favor of a simple summary of the results with regard to the impact of marijuana on task performance. We documented whether marijuana exposure hurt performance, improved performance, or ha d no effect on performance on specified tests. These tables are designed to allow the reader to digest the results at a higher level and examine trends otherwise invisible at increased levels of granularity. Research Question 3B: Field Measurement of Mari juana's Effects and Accuracy for Determining Impairment The first component of research question 3b, which addresses how cognitive and behavioral effects of marijuana exposure are measured in a laboratory setting, was answered using the search results fro m research question 3a. Please refer to RQ3a methods for details on the search methods. Search efforts for this research question focused only on the latter part of the question, which attempts to determine how the cognitive behavioral impacts of marijuan a exposure are measured in field settings and the validation and accuracy of those tools. To accomplish this, four separate search strings / strategies were developed to answer this question (Table 1. Search Strings). PubMed was searched. The first string scanned the peer reviewed literature for studies of screening tools that measure cognitive/behavioral indicators of marijuana exposure. After abstract screening, this search did not return any results. 158 The second string searched the peer reviewed literatur e for studies of screening tools that measured indicators of cognitive / behavioral deficits. This was done to gain a broader understanding of currently available validated tools. The overall goal was to identify tools that may have utility when applied to measuring marijuana exposure. After abstract screening, this search returned 2 results. The third string searched the peer reviewed literature for studies that assessed the validity of standardized field sobriety tests (SFSTs) for measuring marijuana. T his search was conducted due to the fact that SFSTs are currently used by law enforcement to determine impairment. After abstract screening, this search returned 3 results. The fourth component of this approach was to scan of the grey literature / internet for tools and or screening devices that might have utility in measuring cognitive or behavioral impacts of marijuana exposure. These included mobile applications. This search returned 5 results, but we excluded 2 apps that were designed generally for cognitive impairment but did not touch directly on tasks used to measure marijuana - related effects in laboratory settings. Results from the four searches were extracted into two separate analytic tables, one for peer reviewed results, and the other for non-peer reviewed results. Table 1.

However, recent desire to identify increasingly informative markers of marijuana exposure has led to more frequent utilization of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC - MS/MS) and high -resolution mass spectrometry (HR -MS) measurement methods. Among other advantages, the LC -MS/MS method allows simultaneous quantification of free and conjugated analy tes in a single assay (Huestis & Smith, 2018) . These methods also offer high sensitivity and specificity for detecting markers of cannabis use (Huestis & Smith, 2018) . LC-MS/MS and HR -MS methods are intriguing because they offer the ability to identify the Phase II THC metabolite (THC . As research on marijuana metabolism continues to advance, particularly as it relates to quantifying exposure, identification of these metabolites becomes increasingly va luable. For instance, quantification of these metabolites can offer information that helps ascertain recent cannabis intake and or the transfer of cannabinoids to alternative matrices such as hair (Huestis & Smith, 2018) .

In 100% of the studies we identified in our systematic search of the literature for R2, at least one variati on of these methods was used as the gold standard laboratory comparator for performance assessment of point of care detection devices. One recent systematic review related to POCT device assessment restricted their search to include only studies where some type of chromatographic assay was used as the confirmatory method (Scherer et al., 2017) . Moreover, among the four most recently published independent studies assessing POCT devices against laboratory methods, 50% utilized the LC -MS/MS method (Edwards, Smith, & al., 2017) . Coupled with the recent analysis from leading experts in quantitative cannabinoid measurement (Huestis & Smith, 2018) these results confirm that measurement of cannabinoi ds in human biological matrices (blood, oral fluid, and urine) using immunoassays, chromatography, and or mass spectrometry, particularly LC -MS/MS, is the current state of the science. Research Question 2: Methods for Quantifying Marijuana Exposure in a Field Setting Point -of-collection testing (POCT) devices make it possible to rapidly screen for cannabis exposure without the use of standard laboratory equipment. These devices typically test oral fluid or urine as these matrices are easier to obtain in a field setting than blood. Compared with urine analysis, oral fluid (OF) collection presents fewer concerns about privacy and adulterations. Drug testing in OF samples usually detects parent drugs, whereas testing of urine samples usually detects metabolites. This make s OF more reflective of recent drug use (Allen, 2011; Bosker & Huestis, 2009; Drummer, 2010; Scherer et al., 2017) . Our systematic search revealed one systematic review plus meta -analysis of 31 stu dies that was published in mid -2017 (Scherer et al, 2017). The papers that met inclusion criteria for this study were papers evaluating one or more POCT devices and using a validated chromatographic assay as the confirmatory method. Devices had to assess oral fluid as the biological matrix. Studies had to include analysis of cannabinoids as well as cocaine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines (BZD), and opioids. We extracted the results for cannabinoids alone from that publication for inclusion in this report. Af ter exclusions, we also reviewed 6 original studies that were not already covered in the review article. In the studies we included in this review, we found evidence for 16 POCT devices (i.e. tests, kits, etc.) that evaluate cannabis exposure in a field setting, with varying levels of evidence and validity testing. In their 2017 review, Scherer et al. noted that the most commonly evaluated devices were the Alere DDS2 (DDS2), the Dr\u00e4ger DrugTest 5000 (DT5000), manufactured by Securetec. (Scherer et al., 2017) Across the studies we reviewed, the Alere DDS2 and the Dr\u00e4ger DrugTest 5000 have the most research evidence available of the POCT devices described in the literature in terms of the number of studies, the number of participants in those studies, and the relevant variables included (i.e. frequent vs. chronic cannabis users, 161 route of cannabis exposure). These devices also performed well according to the Scherer review and thus are the focus of our description. Our systematic sea rch also returned one study comparing two urine tests (the EZCup and the Multi4Card) which we briefly describe below, though there was less evidence for these approaches to point -of-collection OF testing. We concur with the authors of prior studies who not e that the ease of use of OF tests makes them a better candidate for field applications (M. A. Huestis et al., 2013) . Oral Fluid POCT Devices In the Scherer review, the authors included studies that evaluated the DDS. The Drugwipe (Securetec, Germany) was the most commonly evaluated device among the studies (n = 17), followed by the DrugTest 5000 (Dr\u00e4ger Safety AG & Co., Germany; n = 12), the Rapiscan (Cozart Biosciences Ltd., UK; n = 8) and the Rapid Stat (Mavand Solutions, Germany; n = 7) (Scherer et al., 2017) . All other devices were evaluated in five or fewer studies. Most other articles we reviewed focused predominantly on the DT5000 or the Alere DDS2 (DDS2). The Alere D DS2 is a battery operated handheld device that provides a rapid qualitative assessment (positive/negative) of the presence or absence of delta -9-THC in oral fluid above a concentration of 25ng/mL. Samples are collected using a swab cartridge. After collect ion, the cartridge is inserted into the device for analysis. Results are available in five minutes and the device does not require oversight while the analysis is taking place. The device features a simple user interface, is lightweight, and has the abilit y to store up to 10,000 unique samples in its memory at once (\"Alere DDS\u00ae2 Mobile Test System: Rapid Screening for Drugs of Abuse in Oral Fluid,\" 2018) . The Dr\u00e4ger DrugTest 5000 (DT5000) is a portable device that provides a rapid qualitative assessment (positive/negative) of the presence or absence of delta -9-THC above a concentration of 5ng/mL. Samples are collected using a test cassette. After collection, the cassette is inserted into the device for analysis. Results are available i n less than 9 minutes in most cases and the device does not require oversight while the analysis is taking place. The device features a simple graphical display that communicates results in plain text and has the ability to store up to 500 results at one time. Stored results are tagged with date and time. Results can also be printed using the Dr\u00e4ger Mobile Printer (\"Dr\u00e4ger DrugTest\u00ae 5000: Analysis system for detecting drugs,\" 2018) . Study Designs for Evaluating POCT Devices A variety of study designs were included in the articles we reviewed. The review article by Scherer et al. included studies of oral fluid POCT drug tests among varied populations (e.g. drivers, drug users, laboratory participants, etc.). Generally speaking , 162 the methodology of the reviewed studies was a slight variation of the following: Participants ingested cannabis either by smoking, vaporizing, or consumption of foods such as brownies in a controlled environment. Upon cannabis consumption, oral fluid specimens were qualitatively analyzed (i.e. pass or fail) using the specified on -site device. Quantitative analytic specimens were concurrently collected to be used as comparators. Analytic samples were either blood or oral fluid (If oral fluid, usually collected with a Quantisal device) (\"Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Device,\" 2018) and were analyzed at a later date using standard, validated laboratory techniques. Results were obtained by comparing the performance of the on -site OF device to the validated laboratory method to determine sensitivity and specificity of the POC device. Most studi es defined cut -off values for a \"true positive\" using only delta -9-THC, although one did conduct additional analyses that included combinations of delta -9-THC and other cannabinoids (we did not report on these results in our analysis). Of note, two studies did not administer cannabis in a controlled setting but rather screened for it in field settings (Edwards et al., 2017; S. Gentili et al., 2016) . Otherwise, the general outline of their analyses were the same. The choice of a confirmation cut -point matters for the correct identification of cannabis exposure via a POCT device. The European Union's Driving Under the Influ ence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (DRUID) program has suggested an 80% target for analytical sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency when evaluating devices (Blencowe, Pehrsson, & Lillsunde, 2010) . The DRUID project utilized a confirmatory cutoff of 1ng/mL of delta -9-THC (Verstraete et al., 2011) . The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has recommended a cutoff of 2ng/mL as a definition for a positive cannabis test in a wor kplace setting (Department of Health and Human Services, 2015) . Thus, the papers we reviewed most commonly report sensitivity and specificity at a variety o f cutoffs: 25 ng/mL (the devices own cutoff for the DDS2), 5 ng/mL (the device cutoff for the DT5000), 2 ng/mL (SAMHSA), 1 ng/mL (DRUID), and 0.2 or 0.5 ng/mL (the limit of quantitation). Walsh's guidelines for research on drugged driving suggest that for drugs with therapeutic use, the confirmatory testing cut -off concentrations should be at least as low as the low end of the therapeutic range. For recreational drugs without any therapeutic use, the guidelines suggest use of a low analytical cut -off (J. M. Walsh, 2008; J Michael Walsh et al., 2008) . For cannabis, which is used both medically and recreationally in Massachusetts, and has wide interpersonal variation in ph armacokinetics, establishing a cutoff presents a challenge. We, therefore, present sensitivity and specificity estimates at multiple cut -offs when possible. Testing revealed, not unexpectedly, that sensitivity and specificity were highest when the cut -off level was highest (25ng/mL in the studies of OF POCT devices). The tests perform better at correctly identifying the presence of THC when higher levels of THC are present in the matrix. The 25ng/mL cutoff was assessed only for the DDS2 device, since this is the level above which it is designed to report a positive test. Another important factor in examining the performance of POCTs is the cannabis use history of the study participants. Prior studies have documented that POCT device 163 sensitivity is higher in chronic frequent as compared to occasional cannabis smokers due to longer detection windows and higher true positive rates. (M. A. Huestis et al., 2013) Because THC is fat soluble, it is stored in adipose tissue and can leak back into circulation over time, even long after the psychoactive eff ects of acute cannabis use have ceased (Gunasekaran et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2014 ; Wong et al., 2013) . However, at least one study has concluded that the cannabinoid concentration changes that resu lt from THC reentering circulation are not likely to negatively impact the ability to correctly interpret a drug test (Westin, Mj\u00f8nes, Burchardt, Fuskev\u00e5g, & Sl\u00f8rdal, 2014) . In addition, since cannabis is consumed via different routes of exposure (e.g. smoked, vaporized, edible), POCT devices may not assess al l possible routes of exposure. Overall POC Test Performance Table 2 shows the results from studies of OF POCT devices included in this review, number of participants), route of administration, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the device for detecting marijuana exposure as compared to laboratory - based confirmation methods. In this table, we include the overall results from studies that included both chronic and frequent users, as well as results from the meta -analysis and studies conducted in naturalistic settings (e.g. pubs, bars; individuals arrest ed for driving impairment). Scherer and colleagues pooled data from the studies in their meta -analysis to examine performance of individual POCT devices for cannabinoid detection. They found that the DDS2 had a sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 92.1 %. The DT5000 had a sensitivity of 86.5% and specificity of 95.2%. Two other devices, the DrugWipe5+ and RapidStat also performed well for cannabis detection. The RapidStat was not reviewed in any other studies since Scherer's publication. The DrugWipe5A was examined in one naturalistic setting (social venues) and had low sensitivity (29%) and acceptable specificity Busard\u00f2, 2016) . We do not discuss it further in this review. Among all cannabis users, including frequent and occasional users, and across exposure routes, using a confirmation cut -off of 5ng/mL, the DDS2 had a sensitivity of 84.4% and specificity of 94.5% (Swortwood et al., 2017) . The DT5000 had a sensitivity of 80.0% and s pecificity of 91.9% at the same cut -off (Swortwood et al., 2017) . The DDS2 was also tested among individuals arrested for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI) and compared to blood test values. Using a cutoff of 25 ng/mL that mirrors the devices own cu toff level, Edwards and colleagues report a sensitivity of 88.4 and specificity of 86.9 (Edwards et al., 2017) . Huestis and colleagues (2013) te sted the DT5000 among 24 cannabis users (10 occasional, 14 frequent) and provided information about sensitivity 6 -8 hours post - inhalation of smoked cannabis because this time frame is relevant for detecting drivers who may be under the influence of recentl y used marijuana (Huestis et al., 2013) They found the device sensitivity within 6 and 8 hour time frames was 85.6 and 84.7%, respectively, at the confirmation cutoff of 2ng/mL (SAMHSA). Sensitivity within 6 and 8 hour time fra mes was 84.0 and 82.5%, respectively, at the cutoff of 1ng/mL (DRUID) (Huestis et al., 2013) . This can be interpreted to mean that the DT5000 provides a 164 positive test result that accurately identifies approximately 85% of canna bis users who are 6 -8 hour post smoking, with 15% false negatives (i.e. the test provides a negative results but the individual has THC levels above the confirmation cutoff). The DRUID project recommended a threshold of 80% sensitivity, 80% spec ificity, and 80% accuracy has been established as minimum acceptable level of testing performance for a roadside drug screening test. Across all studies, the DT5000 had a sensitivity range from 80.0% -85.5% and specificity range from 82.5% -95.2%. The DDS2 had a sensitivity range from 84.4% -92.5% and specificity range from 86.9 -94.5%. Table 2.

This table reflects the two key studies found by our search that differentiat ed results based on the participants' cannabis use history. These are the same studies as reported above, but broken out for the subpopulations included rather than overall results. Swortwood's study for the DDS did not show substantially different perfo rmance (e.g. more than few percentage points) between chronic vs. frequent users at a 25ng/ML or 5ng/mL confirmation cutoff. In both groups, sensitivity approached 100% for the 25ng/mL cutoff, and sensitivity was 82% -86%. The same study suggested that at t he 5ng/ML cutoff, the DT5000 had a sensitivity of 79.1 for frequent users vs. 82.9 for occasional users; specificity of 89.5 for frequent users vs. 94.0 for occasional users. In their study of smoked cannabis, Huestis et al. report that the sensitivity of the DT5000 was was 6 -11% higher in frequent as compared to occasional cannabis users and suggest that this was due to having a longer detection windows and higher true positive rates (Huestis et al., 2013; Huestis et al., 2013) . The DDS performed slightly better that the DT5000 among frequent users at the 5ng/mL cutoff in the two original studies we reviewed that directly compared the devices. Taking all evidence into account, both devices perform reasonably well for both frequent and occasional users. Edible Route of Exposure As shown in Table 3, the DT5000, in a study that foc used only on edible cannabis, had a sensitivity of 64.9% and specificity of 97.2%, for an overall accuracy of 77.5% (Hartman et al., 2015) . A smaller study found a sensitivity of 89.3 and specificity of 94.7. This is in contrast to the DD S2 which, in the smaller study, had a sensitivity of 96.8 and specificity of 86.5. The DT5000 may perform slightly better than the DDS2 when edible cannabis has been consumed, as its specificity was higher (96.9% vs. 77.1%) in the study by Newmeyer and col leagues that focused on the edible route of exposure (Newmeyer et al., 2017a) . Vaporized Route of Exposure Hartman and colleagues (2015) reported that the DT5000 showed sensitivity of 64.9, specificity of 97.2, and efficiency of 77.5% after vaporized cannabis, using the 5ng/mL confirmatory cutoff (Hartman et al., 2015) . These authors noted that cannabis vapor may interact with oral mucosa differently to smoke, altering the performance of the POCT (Hartman et al., 2015) . While the sensitivity in this study was reduced due to false negatives compared to o ther studies that tested the device after smoked or edible routes of administration, the high specificity indicates that false positives were rare. 168 POC Urine Testing One study returned by our searches evaluated POTC urine tests, the EZ Cup and the Multi4Card (Kim et al., 2017) . The study utilized commercially available samples (Detectabuse) and information about the individuals who originally provided the samples was not available. The cut -off value for these tests was 50 ng/mL of THC -COOH. The results were assessed on a grading scale (G2 -G4) where lower grade meant a higher drug concentration for confirmation testing. The EZ Cu p had a sensitivity ranging from 98.5 (G2) to 100 (G4) and a specificity ranging from 93.0 (G2) to 53.0 (G4). The Multi4Card had a sensitivity range from 6.0 (G2) to 92.0 (G4) and a specificity range from 99.2 (G2) to 87.7 (G4). The EZ cup had with consis tently low false negative tests, but, as concentration decreased, there were more false positives. The EZ Cup therefore exhibited better performance, but it is important to note that the inactive metabolite THC-COOH can be detected for days to weeks after cannabis administration (Goodwin et al., 2008) and a positive screening result alone (absent other information) does not permit inference regarding time of cannabis use. Other Considerations Across all studies, authors note that frequent smokers had sig nificantly later median t last (time of last cannabis detection) compared to occasional smokers. This means that frequent marijuana users may show positive results on POCT results for longer after cannabis administration compared to occasional users who use d the same amount. The studies described here utilize THC as the confirmation marker of cannabis exposure. Hartman (2015) and colleagues note that THC -COOH has been proposed as a potential additional confirmatory criterion, to be used with THC because it helps rule out passive environmental exposure, detects oral cannabis use, and can extend detection windows in chronic frequent cannabis smokers (Lee et al., 2011; Moore et al., 2011) . However, in Hartman's study of vaporized cannabis, THCCOOH was not always detected; including THCCOOH as a requirement for confirmation decreased sensitivity. At this point, the use of additional metabolites as a confirmatory method with POCT devices is not firmly established in the literature. Research Question 3a: Cognitive and Behavioral Effects Relevant to Driving We reviewed 29 studies that contained information about the cognitive and behavioral indicators of marijuana exposure that are relevant to operating a motor vehicle. The study designs utilized can be grouped into fou r categories: laboratory studies, studies conducted in a driving simulator, on -road studies, and observational studies. The cognitive and behavioral effects of marijuana that relate to driving fall into three domains which include automotive behavior, cont rol behavior, and executive function/planning. These domains were described in Walsh's 2008 Guidelines for Research on Drugged Driving ( Walsh et al., 2008) . Based on the literature we obtained through our search, for the purpose of this review, we address an additional behavioral domain which is driving performance/safety. Table 4 describes the domains and provides examples of tasks/tests that measure them. 169 Multiple effects may be measured in one study, and different study designs are well - suited to evaluate different types of effects. For example, only the simulator and on -road studies can address driving performa nce and safe driving. We also considered the elements of the standardized field sobriety test (SFST) which is reflective of control behavior. The SFST includes activities such as a one leg stand, walk and turn, and the modified Romberg balance test. Table 4. Domains of Driving -Related Cognitive and Behavioral Effects of Marijuana Automative Behavior In lab -based studies, we found evidence for 15 different measurements of automotive behavior across 6 studies. For frequent users, 5 out of 6 saw no effect, and 1 found hurt performance, although it must be noted that two o f these studies included low doses of cannabis. For occasional users, 5/5 tests indicated that marijuana hurt performance. In 4 studies in which the population cannabis use history was not specified, both low and medium dose administration resulted in gene rally worse task performance (3/4). Two simulator studies that included measurement of automative behavior both found decreased performance after marijuana administration. Domain Definition Example Tasks Used for Measurement Automative Behavior* Well-learned skills Tracking, steering (road tracking, critical tracking, compensatory tasks). Vigilance or sustained attention (e.g. Mackworth Clock Test). Control Behavior* Maintaining distance, passing, etc. Motor performance, maneuvers (reaction time, car following tasks). Divided attention (dual attention tasks). Perception (time to collision -type tasks). Executive Function/Executive Planning * Interactive functions with ongoing traffic. Risk taking, impulsivity (e.g. stop signal, Iowa gambling tasks). Information processing, attention (choice, reaction time, selective or focused a ttention tasks). Cognition, judgement Driving performance/safety Appropriate and safe operation of a vehicle Maintaining proper headway Lane positioning Speed and braking Note: *Definitions from Walsh et al. 2008 \"Guidelines for Research on Drugged Driving\" 170 Table 5.

Sim.= Driving simulator study. Control Behavior In 18 lab -based measurements of control behavior, 11 focused on frequent or not specified user population, and 4 observed poorer performances after marijuana administration, 1 with improved performance, and 6 with no effect. Of note, the largest study had 136 participants and demonstrated poorer performance. Among tests in occasional users, 6/7 demonstrated poorer performance with one demonstrating no effect. Simulator -based studies showed an even split between hurt performance and no 171 effect. In three on -road studies, control behavior, and specifically reaction time, was not impacted. In lab studies, 9/9 tests that used elements of the SFST to assess control behavior among frequent users demonstrated no effect. In occasional users, this was 3/9. And in two observational studies that together accounted for results on seven tests of control behavior as measured with a SFST, decreased performance was noted in all tests, though it must be noted that the study design did not allow assessment of most potential l imitations. Executive Function and Planning In 16 tests of executive function among frequent cannabis users, six hurt performance and 10 showed no effect. Among occasional users, six hurt performance, and six showed no effect. For non -specified users, 9 /10 studies showed hurt performance. These results indicate more evidence for decreased executive function regardless of use history, with about half or more of the studies finding decreased performance. Driving Performance and Safety In simulator studies, mean speed decreased in 6/14 studies conducted among occasional users. We did not characterize decreased speed as either an improvement or detriment to driving performance, since in a real -world environment this behavior could be associated eithe r with safer driving or with an increased crash risk, depending on the circumstance. There were three studies with decreased performance, including on a measure of collisions, and all other results showed no effect. In two studies that did not specify the cannabis use history of participants, there was decreased performance on 5/7 measures. These included mean headway and lateral position, and speed measures. In 10 driving performance tasks conducted in on -road studies of occasional users, the authors obser ved impaired performance for five tasks and no effect for five tasks. 172 Table 6.

While there are many tools used to measure the domains of impairment in laboratory settings, as evidenced in Tables 5-7, field measures lag behind. In the pe er reviewed literature, we identified three studies testing SFST for detecting marijuana impairment. Accuracy was, at best approximately 50% for the one leg stand portion of the test. We also conducted a web search that identified several mobile applicatio ns that offer versions of some of the tests for automative behavior, executive function, and control behavior that were measured above, as being impacted by marijuana. Although only one tool: DRUID (Milburn, 2017) , was developed explicitly for measuring marijuana -related effects, these tools in general may have promise. DRUID is being tested in an NIH -funded study at Brown University Medical School. 175 Table 8.

Among the most popular techniques currently in use are chromatographic methods such as gas chromatography mass sp ectrometry (GC and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS). In relation to quantifying exposure, the absence of ability to discern potentially key pieces of information from measuring THC alone however has spurred interest in the utility of THC metabolite quantification. The phase offer and movement of metabolites to alternati ve matrices (Huestis & Smith, 2018) . As research related to marijuana metabolism continues to advance, such inferences may prove useful in efforts to establish legal driving limits and standards . Despite this promise however, the inability to quantify THC metabolites in a field setting remains a chief limitation. This review identified two point -of-collection devices with substantial evidence that they perform with sensitivity and specificity abo ve 80% at a confirmation cut -point of 5ng/mL. The DT5000 has a slightly lower sensitivity and higher specificity; the DDS2 has a slightly higher sensitivity and lower specificity. Most screening tests require tradeoffs between these two aspects of correct identification. A higher sensitivity reduces false negatives (i.e. a cannabis user with delta -9-THC above the cut -off who screens negative); a higher specificity reduces false positives (e.g. an individual with a delta -9- THC level below the cut -off who scr eens positive). Choice between the two devices should depend upon the specific use case and consequences of misclassification. The findings from this study indicate that OF devices may be effective for use in field settings with reasonable accuracy. For context, recent studies showed that after smoking or vaporizing cannabis in a controlled environment, chronic frequent users maintained blood THC levels of 25 ng/mL for an average of ~ 30 -45 minutes. By ~6 -10 hours, levels have fallen to 5 ng/mL and at 7 2 hours post smoking, blood THC levels remained between 5 ng/mL and the LOQ (1 ng/mL) (Newmeyer et al., 2016) . Frequent users that orally ingested cannabis in a controlled environment showed similar long term pharmacokinetic profiles, with blood THC levels between 5 ng/mL and the LOQ (1 ng/mL) 72 hours post ingestion. However, average peak concentrations were lower (~25ng/mL) and average time to peak concentration (~ 3 -4 hours) was greater with average blood levels remaining under 10 ng/mL leading up to the peak (Newmeyer et al., 2017a; Newmeyer et al., 2016) . In occasional users, THC blood levels in controlled environments after smoking and vaporization peaked on average in ~10 minutes and stayed above 25 ng/mL for ~30 minutes. At approximately one hour, THC levels remained close to 5 ng/mL but by ~ 3 hours on average, THC blood levels had fallen below the LOQ and by ~ 12 -15 hours, THC was undetectable (Newmeyer et al., 2016) . Blood THC levels of occasional users ingesting THC in a controlled environment followed a similar peaking pattern to that of frequent users. On average, concentrations did not peak until ~ 3 hours post ingestion. 178 However, by ~ 5 hours blood THC levels had fallen below 5ng/mL and by ~ 11 hours, THC was not detectable in the blood (Newmeyer et al., 2016) . Blood cannabinoid concentration cannot be estimated from OF data (Newmeyer et al., 2017b) . The studies reviewed indicated that for smoke d and vaporized cannabis, OF and blood THC concentrations were significantly correlated for up to 8 hours cannabis administration (Hartman et al., 2016) , with THC concentrations in both matrices peaking during or shortly after use followed by rapid decreases. Edible cannabis, however, displays a different profile with OF THC C max (maximum concentration) occurring by 0.3 hours, while blood THC C max occurs 1 -5 hours later. These different pharmacokinetic time courses explain the lack of correlation between OF and blood concentrations during the first 5 h after edible cannabis (Newmeyer et al., 2017b) . Thus, the route of cannabis administration has a large impact on how well oral fluid correlates with blood THC. At present, most marijuana users smoke or vaporize marijuana, making oral fluid testing a reasonable option, though other routes of administration may become mo re frequent as retail sales of adult use marijuana begin in Massachusetts. The evidence suggests that marijuana has cognitive and behavioral effects in the areas of automative behavior, especially for occasional users, and there also are likely some exec utive function impacts for some users. In simulated road environments, marijuana exposure was associated with decreased speed; which may be either positive or negative for driving performance and crash risk, depending on the circumstance. Marijuana exposur e also unquestionably hurt driving performance in some ways. The overall picture was one of mixed results that on balance fall between no effect and decreased performance. It is worth noting that when reported, magnitude of impaired performance was general ly small. In controlled environments, the marijuana use was not associated with performance decreases on elements of the standardized field sobriety test, though observational studies reached a different conclusion. 179 References Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute.

Am J Epidemiol, 159 (7), 702 -706. 183 Chapter 2: Driving Under the Influence of Marijuana and Marijuana - Involved Motor Vehicle Crashes in Massachusetts 184 Introduction Experimental research suggests that marijuana (cannabis) use impairs functions related to safe driving (Huestis, 2002) . Epidemiological evidence for the increase in the magnitude of motor vehicle crash risk from marijuana use ranges f rom 22% to 100% (a doubling) (Asbridge et al., 2012; G. Li et al., 2017; Rogeberg & Elvik, 2016) . In studies of Colorado adults (Dav is et al., 2016) as well as college students (Whitehill, Rivara, & Moreno, 2014) , and high school students (K. Li, Simons -Morton, Gee, & Hingson, 2016) , driving under the influence of marijuana (DUI -marijuana) is common among marijuana users. These individuals, as well as passengers who ride with a driver under the influence of marijuana (RUI -marijuan a), would experience any increased risk for involvement in a motor vehicle crash that exists when the driver has used marijuana. As Massachusetts implements legal retail marijuana sales for all adults, it is important to understand the prevalence of drivi ng under the influence of marijuana and riding with a marijuana -using driver prior to the start of retail marijuana sales for non -medical use among adults age 21 and over. These topics are not well - measured in other Massachusetts datasets that have been previously collected for other purposes. Such information will be necessary to measure the extent to which there are changes in the prevalence of these events after retail adult -use marijuana sales are implemented. Another useful \"baseline\" measure relat ed to marijuana and motor vehicle crashes is how frequently crash -involved drivers test positive for marijuana. Although such testing does not indicate that the driver was intoxicated by or impaired by marijuana at the time of the crash, such data nonethel ess provides some information on information relevant to maintaining safe roadways, such as the extent to which drivers are tested for cannabinoids and cannabinoid disposition among drivers. This chapter describes two studies related to driving and marijuana use. First, we present an analysis of data from the statewide population survey conducted as part of the MBHS that addresses DUI -marijuana and RUI -marijuana. Second, we present an analysis of Massachusetts data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System which includes information on fatal crashes (i.e. crashes in which one occupant died within 30 days of the crash) and the state's Crash Data System which includes information on all crashes on Massachusetts roadways. Methods Population survey of Massachusetts adults We conducted a population -based, mail and Internet survey of Massachusetts residents age 18 years and older. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. A copy of the survey instrument can be found in Appendix A. Details on the methods of survey design, data collection, measures, and statistical procedures, including survey weighting, can be found in Task 1, Chapter 2 of this Marijuana Baseline Health Study report. In addition to the measures 185 described therein, several questions were added to the survey for the purpose of addressing DUI -marijuana and RUI -marijuana. Measures DUI-marijuana was assessed w ith the item \"During the past 30 days, how many times have you driven a car or other motor vehicle while you were under the influence of marijuana?\" Response options included 0 times, 1 time, 2 -3 times, 4 -5 times, or 6 or more times. RUI -marijuana was asc ertained with the question \"During the past 30 days, how many times did you ride as a passenger in a car or other motor vehicle when the driver was under the influence of marijuana\" with the same response options as listed above. Parallel questions were a sked for alcohol and other substances. We also asked about driving after the concurrent use of multiple substances with response options that included: marijuana and alcohol, marijuana and other drugs, alcohol and other drugs, or marijuana, alcohol, and ot her drugs. Statistical analysis Please see the methods section in Chapter 2, Task 1 for details on weighting and statistical procedures for this survey. As noted therein, a total of 3,268 non -duplicate survey questionnaires were returned with 212 determ ined ineligible. After screening for completion and eligibility, there were a total of 3,023 eligible surveys. The logic - checking process resulted in identification of 1 case in which multiple questions had unreasonable responses. This case was dropped, r esulting in a final analytic sample of 3,022. Several variables relevant to this chapter were re -coded from the original data. DUI - marijuana was dichotomized as a yes/no variable indicating any driving under the influence of marijuana in the past 30 days. RUI-marijuana was similarly dichotomized. Frequency of marijuana use in the past 30 days was categorized as a 3 -level variable (0 days, 1 -20 days, 21 or more days). Frequency of alcohol use, originally measured in days per week, was categorized as a 3 -level variable (0 days, 1 -4 days, 5 -7 days). First, we examined bivariate differences in driving under the influence of substances and riding with a substance -using driver between adults who had used marijuana in the past 30 days and those who had not. Next, we examined bivariate differences in socio - demographics and substance use behavior by DUI -marijuana and RUI -marijuana status. Differences were tested with chi -squared tests for categorical variables. Finally, to assess which factors were associated with DU I-marijuana and RUI -marijuana, we estimated relative risk (RR) using Poisson regression with robust standard errors (Zou, 2004) . We examined associations between driving under the influence of marijuana (yes/no) and age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, frequent marijuana use, alcohol use, and riding under the influence of marijuana. Wh en variables were not significant in initial models they were not retained in the final model, with the exception of age, gender, and race, and alcohol use. We used a similar multivariable regression approach with RUI -marijuana as the dependent variable. We used a two -tailed significance level 186 at p <0.05 for all statistical tests. All analyses were weighted and were conducted using commands that accounted for the complex survey design, yielding results that are adjusted to be representative of the adult pop ulation in Massachusetts. The analysis for this report was generated using SAS/STAT software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows (Copyright \u00a9 2016 SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA.) with the exception of the regression models which were generated us ing Stata 15 statistical software (StataCorp, LLC, College Station, TX). Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) To estimate the prevalence of marijuana, alcohol and other drug use by drivers in fatal crashes, 11 years of data (2006 -2016) from the Fat ality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) were studied. FARS is a national database maintained by the states and administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It contains detailed information on every person and vehicle involved in a fatal crash in 26 linkable datasets. The various datasets are compiled at the state level; a state FARS analyst coordinates with the various agencies to gather the necessary data. For example, the police will provide information on the crash (manner o f collision, time, location, etc.) and the medical examiner will provide toxicology information (blood alcohol content, presence of drugs, etc.). For this analysis, two FARS datasets were utilized, the \"Person\" and \"Accident\" files. The \"Person\" file contains an entry for each individual involved in a fatal crash whether they are the driver, a passenger, or a non -motorist. This dataset contains info rmation such as demographics, seating position, drug and alcohol test results. The \"Accident\" file contains crash level information such as time and location of the crash, manner of collision and overall number of fatalities. A full list of fields and data sets can be found in the FARS Analytical User's Manual (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2016) . Measures From the FARS \"Accident\" dataset only the field reflecting the number of fatalities resulting from the crash (FATALS) was used. All other variab les came from the FARS \"Person\" dataset, which included an indicator of \"person type\" which denotes whether the person was a driver, passenger or non -motorist (PER_TYP). We used an indicator of injury severity to identify individuals who died in a crash. Demographic measures The FARS fields for the person's age, sex, and race/ethnicity were included in this analysis. Within FARS, race is only coded for deceased persons. There are 18 options for race and an additional six options that indicate whether the person was of Hispanic /Latino descent. The available categories were condensed into five categories: White, non -Hispanic; Black, non -Hispanic; Asian, non -Hispanic; Other, non -Hispanic; and any Hispanic/Latino. 187 Cannabis and other drug measures FARS includes information on the type of drug testing conducted stored in three variables (DRUGTST1/ DRUGTST2/ DRUGTST3). Persons involved in a fatal crash can have up to three types of drug tests (e.g. blood, urine, etc.) recorded in FARS in these fields. Also included are up to three re sults from the reported drug tests (DRUGRES1/ DRUGRES2/ DRUGRES3). The DRUGRES fields report a code to indicate the specific drugs detected, although the level of drug concentrations are not available within the dataset. There are over 600 different drug t ypes and an exhaustive list can be found in the 2016 FARS/CRSS Coding and Validation Manual (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2016) . This analysis focused upon cannabinoids which are indicated in FARS with the following codes: 600 - Delta 9 601 - Hashish Oils 602 - Hashish 603 - Marijuana/Marihuana 604 - Marinol 605 - Tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) 695 - Cannabinoid, Type Unknown A summary variable was created to indicate whether a drug test result was positive for any of the seven cannabinoid codes listed above. Delta -9-THC is a primary psychoactive compound from the cannabis plant that contributes to the 'high' that users experie nce. As described in Chapter 1, it is metabolized in the body into other cannabinols that can be detected in laboratory testing but are not necessarily psychoactive. Generally, delta -9-THC is measurable in blood for a shorter duration after marijuana use than other metabolites, but this is complicated by individual characteristics such as frequency of cannabis use. Prior studies of marijuana involvement in crashes using FARS data in other states tend to focus on delta -9-THC because it is associated with t he effects of cannabis (Tefft et al., 2016) . However, it is impor tant to note that driver impairment in the crash cannot be discerned from values of delta -9-THC or other compounds. Delta -9-THC, when present, is generally indicative of recent marijuana use. Two years of FARS data (2011 and 2012) appeared anomalous in t hat there were near - zero levels of code 600 indicating a positive test for Delta -9-THC among drivers given a blood test for drugs. This was inconsistent with other years of Massachusetts FARS data in this analysis and inconsistent with published reports of FARS data from other states (Grondel, Hoff, & Doane, 2018) . This absence of code 600 for delta -9-THC in two years of FARS data is likely to be a result of data collection or data entry practices and not indicative of true rates. Additionally, in the 11 years of Massachusetts data, there were only two recorded cases of a person testing positive for codes 601, 602, 603, or 604. In light of these potential irregularities in the cannabis codes observed in FARS, we 188 report on the presence of \"any cannabinoid\" which, though less specific than the code for delta -9-THC, appeared more reliable. Alcohol measures The presence of alcohol in a person is recorded in two fields within the FARS database. ATST_TYP reports the type of alcohol test given (blood, breath, etc.) and ALC_RES indicates the results of alcohol testing such as the blood alcohol content obtained from the given alcohol test. Due to problems that arise from missing data, blood alcohol content (BAC), estimates of alcohol -impaired driving are typically reported after NHTSA uses a multiple imputation process for cases in which testing was not conducted or reported (Subramanian, 2002) . Imputation was not used in the present study for alcohol because the focus was on marijuana -involved crashes. NHTSA does not presently have a standardized imputation procedure for cannabis -related test results, although such procedures are being develo ped and tested with promising results (Chen, Williams, Liu, Chihuri, & Li, 2018). To facilitate comparison across substances within this report, only known BAC values were used in this analysis. The estimates in this report for fatalities with alcohol invo lvement, therefore, may not match the publicly available estimates which incorporate imputed BAC values. Analysis The total number of fatal crashes, number of fatally -injured persons, number of fatal crash -involved drivers, and number of deceased driver s were tabulated. Numbers and percentages of drivers who received a blood test for alcohol or drugs were calculated and graphed, as appropriate. Numbers and proportions of drivers testing positive for any cannabinoid, by driver sex, race/ethnicity, and age , and the extent to which cannabinoids were found in conjunction with alcohol, and with other drugs were calculated. Crash Data System (CDS) In addition to FARS, the Massachusetts Crash Data System (CDS) was utilized to examine trends in frequency of ma rijuana -related crashes. Unlike FARS, CDS contains every reported motor vehicle crash, and not just crashes with a fatality. However, CDS is based on the Massachusetts crash report form which is completed by the police officer who responded to the crash. T his crash report form does not contain the same level of detail as FARS; it does not contain any fields related to known or suspected drug use. As an alternative to a specific drug use field, the crash narrative was utilized. The crash narrative is a fre e form field where the responding officer can include any information they felt to be important that couldn't be captured within the existing crash report fields. A query was written which identified crash reports which had a crash narrative containing the keywords \"marijuana\", \"weed\", and \"cannabis\". The keywords \"high\" and 189 \"pot\" were originally queried as well but these resulted in a high rate of false positives so they were excluded from the final query. While it is not possible to determine how many n on-fatal crashes occurred which involved marijuana, the aforementioned method provides insight into the number of crashes in which the responding officer suspected marijuana involvement. Results Population survey of Massachusetts adults Sample Characteristics The demographic patterns of survey respondents by reported marijuana use in the past 30 days are provided in Table 1. In reporting survey results, all estimates are weighted and all percentages represent population estimates. 190 Table 1. Select sample demographics. Reproduced from Task 1, Chapter 2, Table 1 Prevalence of driving under the influence and riding with a substance -using driver Among the estimated 21.1% of the adult population that used marijuana, the prevalence of driving under the influence of marijuana in the past 30 days was 34.3% (Table 2). Overall, 7.2% of the adult population drove under the influen ce of marijuana in the past 30 days. For assessment of RUI -marijuana, both non -users and users of marijuana were considered to have engaged in the behavior if they reported riding as a passenger Used marijuana in past 30 days Did not use marijuana in past 30 days Total n=439 (21.1%) n=2583 (76.4%) Weighted % 95% CI Weighted % % 95% CI 50.0 47.3 44.6 50.0 Age 18-20 9.6* 4.2 15.0 2.2 0.8 3.6 3.8* 2.1 5.4 21-25 14.7 9.5 20.0 4.2 2.5 5.8 6.4 4.7 8.1 26-29 14.3 9.1 19.6 7.4 5.5 9.2 8.9 7.0 10.7 30-39 18.1 13.1 23.2 16.8 14.4 19.1 17.0 14.9 19.2 40-49 15.5 10.0 20.9 17.6 15.2 19.9 17.1 15.0 19.3 50=59 15.3 11.8 18.9 18.0 16.1 19.9 17.5 15.8 19.1 60-69 10.1 7.2 13.1 16.7 15.0 18.4 15.3 13.8 16.8 >=70 2.3 0.6* 3.9 17.2 15.5 18.9 14.0 12.6 15.4 Education High school or less 38.4 31.1 45.7 31.9 28.8 34.9 33.2 30.4 36.1 48.8 45.9 51.6 49.7 47.0 52.4 Graduate school 8.5 6.1 10.9 19.4 17.6 21.1 17.1 15.5 18.6 Ethnicity Hispanic 12.0 7.0 16.9 8.7 6.4 10.9 9.4 7.3 11.4 White, non - 7.1* 2.7 11.6 5.5 4.0 7.0 5.8 4.3 7.4 Asian, non - Hispanic 3.2* 0.7 5.7 7.3 5.6 9.0 6.4 5.0 7.8 Other, non - Hispanic 6.9 3.1 10.7 3.1 2.1 4.1 3.9 2.8 5.0 Region Boston 13.8 9.0 18.6 14.3 12.1 16.4 14.2 12.2 16.2 Central 13.3 9.1 17.5 14.6 12.7 16.4 14.3 12.6 16.0 Metrowest 18.3 12.6 24.0 22.1 19.8 24.5 21.3 19.1 23.6 Northeast 17.4 12.3 22.4 18.4 16.2 20.7 18.2 16.1 20.3 Southeast 18.8 12.9 24.6 18.9 16.7 21.1 18.9 16.8 21.0 Western 18.5 13.7 23.3 11.6 10.0 13.3 13.1 11.4 14.7 Note: * denotes fewer than 25 respondents; table reproduced from Task 1, Chapter 2. 191 with a driver that is under the influence of marijuana. Resul ts show that 11.3% of Massachusetts adults rode with a marijuana -using driver in the past 30 days. The proportion who RUI -marijuana was statistically significantly higher among marijuana users (36.7%) compared to non -users (4.2%) [p<0.001]. We found that 6.9% of the population drove under the influence of alcohol (DUI -alcohol) and 7.9% of all adults rode as a passenger with a driver under the influence of alcohol (Table 2). Marijuana users were more likely to report DUI -alcohol (15.2%) compared to non-users (4.7%) (p <0.001) and to -alcohol (14.6%) compared to non -users (6.1%) (p<0.001). Subpopulation prevalence By age, we found that 25.6% of young adults age 18 -20 years reported driving under the influence of marijuana, and 24.1% of those age 21-25 years. The proportion of adults in each age group who drove after marijuana use subsequently drops off among older age groups. (Table 3). Among females, 5.5% reported DUI -marijuana, which was statistically significantly less than the percentage of m ales reporting DUI -marijuana (9.1%) (p=0.04). We observed that as the number of days per month of marijuana use increases, the proportion of individuals who drive under the influence of marijuana also increases. Among individuals who use marijuana 21 day s per month or more, just over 50% reported DUI -marijuana. By age, we also found that nearly 36% of 18 -20 year old adults reported riding with a marijuana -using driver in the past 30 days. Prevalence was 38% among those age 21 - 25 years, then lower for ol der age groups (Table 3). We did not observe a difference by gender or race/ethnicity. Prevalence of RUI -marijuana was lowest among those with a post-graduate degree (5.7%). A higher proportion of those who drove under the influence of marijuana reported riding as a passenger with marijuana -using driver (67.5%) compared to marijuana users who did not drive under its influence (21.2%) (p<0.001) (Table 4). We found that 42.8% of individuals who drove under the influence of marijuana reported driving under the influence of alcohol and marijuana, used simultaneously 192 Table 2.

In comparison, users of both marijuana and alcohol who did not drive under the influen ce of marijuana had a much lower prevalence of driving under the influence of alcohol, at only 3.7%. Characteristics of individuals who ride with driver under the influence of marijuana (RUI - marijuana) Table 5 shows a comparison of demographic and subst ance use characteristics between individuals who rode with a driver under the influence of marijuana and those who did not. The distribution of RUI -marijuana by age showed that higher proportions of younger individuals tended to engage in this behavior ve rsus older individuals. . Most individuals (70.6%) who RUI -marijuana had used marijuana in the past 30 days; this is in contrast to 15.5% of individuals who did not RUI -marijuana who reported past -30 day marijuana use. Factors associated with driving under the influence of marijuana (DUI -marijuana) and riding with a driver under the influence of marijuana (RUI -marijuana) Our multivariable Poisson regression model (Table 6) with DUI -marijuana as the outcome included age, gender, race/ethnicity, frequen t marijuana use and alcohol use (Table 6). In preliminary models, we found no association between education level and DUIM and dropped it from subsequent models. We found that Black, non -Hispanic individuals had an 81% lower risk of DUI -marijuana to (RR=0.19; 95% CI:0.05 -0.75) . Frequent marijuana use (defined as using on 21 or more days in the past month) was associated with a 63% increased risk of DUI-marijuana compared to using on 20 days or fewer (RR=1.63; 95% CI:1.15 -2.32). Of the model covariates, riding with a marijuana -using driver demonstrated the strongest association with DUI -marijuana. Individuals who rode with a driver under the influence of marijuana had more than triple the risk of DUI -marijuana compared to mariju ana users who did not ride with a marijuana -using driver (RR=3.42; 95% CI: 2.28 -5.15). 196 Table 5.

We found that being age 25 years or older was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in the risk of RUI -marijuana, controlling for other factors. Using marijuana between 1 -20 days per month was associated with having more than 5 times the risk of RUI-marijuana (RR=5.79; 95% CI: 3.70 -9.07) compared to not using at all; using 21 or more days per month increased the risk more than 8 times (RR=8.57; 95% CI: 5.42 - 13.55).

Overall, there were an average of 484 drivers involved in a fatal crash each year from 2006 to 2016 and an average of 231 drivers were deceased from motor vehicle crashes. Figure 2. Number of drivers involved in fatal crashes and number of deceased drivers in MA by year (2006 -2016) Toxicological Testing When drivers in a fatal crash are given a blood test, it is indicated in FARS under the ATST_TYP (alcohol test type) and DRUGTST (drug test type) fields. There were three 200 instances in the 11 -year sample where a driver was given a blood test for drugs but not for alcohol, and 54 instances of the reverse, when a driver's blood was tested for alcohol but not drugs. Nearly 1900 drivers had their blood tested for both drugs and alcohol after a fatal crash in the 11 -year sample, out of 5330 total crash -involved drivers, which is approximately 36% (Table 9.). Table 9. Blood test types for drivers involved in fatal crashes in MA (2006 -2016 ) Year Alcohol Test Only Drug Test Only Alcohol and Drug Test Total Drivers Percent tested for alcohol and drugs 2006 3 1 215 568 37.9 2007 9 0 207 570 36.3 2008 16 0 156 442 35.3 2009 9 0 155 447 34.7 2010 2 0 186 448 41.5 2011 3 1 149 499 29.9 2012 1 0 172 497 34.6 2013 1 0 164 445 36.9 2014 4 0 142 456 31.1 2015 6 0 159 457 34.8 2016 0 1 192 501 38.3 Total 54 3 1897 5330 35.6 Within the FARS database there are three options that can be selected to indicate that a person was tested for the presence of drugs: (1) blood test, (2) urine test, and (3) both blood and urine tests. Among these three options, for both surviving and deceased drivers, blood tests were used, almost exclusively, to determine the presence of drugs. In the 11 -year sam ple, 1897 drivers were given only a blood test, three were given a urine test only and only one person was given both a blood and urine test to determine if drugs were present in their system after being involved in a fatal crash. Overall, approximately 7 3% of the drivers who were deceased in a crash were given a post-mortem blood test for alcohol or drugs. By contrast, less than 1% of drivers who survived a crash in which there was at least one fatality were given a blood test for alcohol or drugs accordi ng to the FARS data (Figure 3). During the 11 -year study period (2006 -2016), the highest proportion of deceased drivers given a blood test for alcohol or drugs was 83% in 2010 and the lowest was 63% in 2011. The highest proportion of surviving drivers give n a blood test for alcohol or drugs was 2% in 2005 and the lowest was 0% in 2009 and 2015. In 2016, the proportion of deceased drivers given a blood test for alcohol or drugs was 82%, which was a slightly higher testing rate for deceased drivers than in t he preceding five years, and less than 1% of surviving drivers were tested . 201 Figure 3. Percentage of deceased and surviving dr ivers in fatal crashes given a Blood test for drugs To detect potential demographic differences in blood -testing trends, tes ting rates were examined by race/ethnicity. Figure 4 displays the percent of all deceased drivers who were given a blood test by race/ethnicity. The \"Other, non -Hispanic\" category was lower than others, due to this category containing the \"Unknown\" race op tion which was strongly correlated with having an \"unknown drug test type . Figure 4. Percent of deceased drivers given a blood test for drugs, by race/ethnicity. Marijuana Use The prevalence of marijuana use among deceased drivers blood -tested for drugs was evaluated by examining how often they tested positive for any cannabinoid (Figure 5). 202 Figure 5. Number of deceased drivers given a blood test for drugs testing positive for any cannabinoid When examining the frequency in which deceased drive rs given a blood test for drugs tested positive for any cannabinoid, a noticeable increase was observed in 2010 (Figure 6). Figure 6. Percentage of deceased drivers given a blood test for drugs who tested positive for any cannabinoid The data was further examined by driver sex, race, and age in order to identify potential differences in marijuana use in these demographic groups (Table 10). 203 Table 10. Number of deceased drivers given a blood test for drugs who tested positive for any ca nnabinoid by sex, race, and age Demographic Category Any Cannabinoid No Cannabinoids Total n % n % Male 1167 79.7% 1464 Female Asian, non -Hispanic 1 7.7% 12 92.3% 13 Other, non -Hispanic 12 52 64 Any Hispanic/Latino 38 <18 12 18-20 99 644 65+ years 8 2.9% 272 97.1% 280 Note: Rows percentages are reported. Any cannabinoid + no cannabinoid will sum to 100% within demographic groups. When examining cannabinoid presence, there was no statistically significant difference between male and female drivers (Figure 7). Figure 7. Percentage of deceased drivers given a blood test for drugs who tested positive for any cannabinoid, by driver sex 204 When examining race/ethnicity of dec eased drivers given a blood test for drugs, the proportion of individuals of any Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and Black, non -Hispanic race/ethnicity who tested positive for cannabinoids was higher than for White, non - Hispanic drivers (Figure 8). There were ve ry small samples of deceased Asian, non - Hispanic and Other, non -Hispanic drivers. Figure 8. Percentage of all deceased drivers given a blood test for drugs who tested positive for any cannabinoid, by driver race/ethnicity Figure note: NH=non -Hispani c The presence of any cannabinoid in deceased drivers given a blood test for drugs was most common in young drivers and decreased precipitously from the 26 -34 age group to the 35 -64 age group, as shown in Figure 9. 205 Figure 9. Percentage of deceased d rivers given a blood for drugs who tested positive for any cannabinoid by driver age Alcohol and Drug Use Reducing the prevalence of drunk driving has long been a focal point for the public health community as a way to reduce motor vehicle crash injuries and deaths. As such, the presence of alcohol in fatal crashes was examined, both by itself and in conjunction with the presence of cannabinoids (Table 11). For all demographic categories, with the exception of Black, non -Hispanics there were more blood -tested, deceased drivers with a blood alcohol content greater than or equal to 0.08% than with cannabinoids in their system. Cannabinoid results were examined in conjunction with alcohol use. Table 11 displays the number of deceased drivers given a blood test for drugs and alcohol who tested positive for any cannabinoid only, had a BAC 0.08% only, had both a positive cannabinoid result and a BAC 0.08% or tested negative for cannabinoids and had a BAC less than 0.08%. 206 Table 11.

A small portion (2.4%) of all deceased drivers given a blood test for alcohol and drugs had an unknown alcohol result and are excluded from the table. When examining alcohol and cannabis presence in fatal crash -involved drivers by age group, a trend emerges. The proportion of drivers that had only a BAC 0.08% increased with age until peaking in the 26 -34 years age category, whereas those with only a po sitive cannabinoid result peaked in the 18 -20 years age group and then declined with age (Figure 10). As expected from these two trends, having both a positive cannabinoid result and a BAC 0.08% peaked in the 21 -25 years age group. 207 Figure 10. Percentage of all deceased drivers given a blood test for alcohol and drugs who tested positive for any cannabinoid and/or had a blood alcohol content (BAC) 0.08%, by driver age (years). The trend in drivers with a BAC 0.08% and/or positive cannabin oid results was examined over time (Figure 11.) In 2007 and 2008, nearly 40% of all deceased drivers given a blood test for alcohol and drugs had a BAC 0.08%. Figure 11. Percentage of all deceased drivers given a blood test for alcohol and drugs who tested positive for any cannabinoid and/or had a BAC >= 0.08% in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2016 208 The number of deaths resulting from these crashes has followed a similar trend (Figure 12). While the number of deaths from drivers with a BAC 0.08% and n o cannabinoids in their blood has steadily decreased since 2006, the number of deaths from drivers with cannabinoids and with a BAC below the legal limit of 0.08%, has steadily increased. Figure 12. Number of deaths per year resulting from crashes with deceased drivers given a blood test for alcohol and drugs who tested positive for any cannabinoid and/or had a BAC 0.08% in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2016. The presence of other drugs was examined in addition to alcohol and cannabinoids. Figure 13 shows the frequency at which other drugs were present in blood -tested, deceased drivers. The drug categories were taken from the 2016 FARS/NASS GES Coding and Validation Manual (National Highway Traffic Safety Administr ation, 2016) with \"Other\" encompassing all drugs other than cannabinoids, narcotics, stimulants, depressants, and hallucinogens/PCP. Overall, all drug categories have generally trended upwards in the past 11 years. 209 Figure 13. Percentage of all deceased, drivers given a blood test for drugs who tested positive for various drug categories in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2016. Figure note: Totals will not sum to 100% as drivers could test positive in multiple categories. Cases wi th a positive test result but unknown drug type are excluded (0.2% of drivers given a blood test for drugs). Drugs besides cannabinoids were analyzed in conjunction with alcohol (BAC 0.08) and any cannabinoids (Table 12). When examining racial/ethnic di fferences, White, non-Hispanic drivers were more likely to have only other drugs in their system than cannabinoids (Table 13). The same did not hold true for drivers with any Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and Black, non -Hispanic drivers. Those groups were equa lly or more likely to have cannabinoids only in their system than other drugs only. Sample sizes were too small for the other racial/ethnic categories to make similar comparisons. Table 12, Table 13 and Table 14 show the number and frequency of deceased d rivers by sex, race and age (respectively) testing positive for the seven combinations of cannabinoids, drugs and alcohol (defined as a BAC 0.08%) or none of those results.. Females were less likely than males to have a blood alcohol content above the legal limit or test positive for cannabinoids only, but were more likely than males to have a positive result for only other drugs (Table 12). 210 Table 12. Number and proportion of deceased drivers given a blood test for drugs who tested positive for any cannabinoid and/or had a blood alcohol content (BAC) 0.08% and/or positive results for other drugs, by driver sex Type Male Female n % n % Cannabinoids Only (MJ) 98 6.7% 12 2.9% BAC 0.08% BAC + 35.5% Total 1464 100% 414 100% Table 13.

Deceased blood -tested drivers in this age range rarel y tested positive for cannabinoids or had a BAC above 0.08%, but frequently tested positive for other drugs (Table 14b). This is likely due to the number of medications taken by older individuals that are reported in FARS drug results. 211 Table 14a and 14b.

This figure displays the number of non -fatal crashes pe r year with a crash narrative containing one or more of these keywords. Data from 2017 was included because it was available from CDS. The number of crashes per year where the responding officer suspected marijuana -involvement has followed the same increas ing trend as has fatal crashes (Figure 14). 212 Figure 14. Non -fatal motor vehicle crashes which contain a crash narrative containing the keywords \"marijuana\", \"weed\", and/or \"cannabis,\" by year Discussion In 2017, 7.2% of Massachusetts adults drove under the influence of marijuana (DUI) and 11.7% rode with a driver who was under the influence of marijuana (RUI). Among marijuana users, nearly 4 in 10 reported DUI and or RUI -marijuana. When stratified by age, younger age groups appeared more likely to engage in both behaviors. We found that DUI -marijuana was reported by 25.6% of individuals age 18 -20 years and 24.1% of those age 21 -24 years. RUI -marijuana was reported by 36% of those age 18 -20 years and 38% of those age 21 -25 years. Prevalence was much lower for both DUI -marijuana and RUI -marijuana among adults age 25 years and older compared to those age 24 years and younger. Compared to estimates from other states, the prevalence in Massachusetts of DUI - and RUI-marijuana appear higher, especially when stratified by age. However, some aspects of our results are consistent with prior work. For example, prior estimates from Colorado published in 2016 show that 6% of young adults age 18 -25 years reported drivin g after using marijuana, while 4.8% 26 -34 years old reported the behavior. Thus, our point estimates among Massachusetts adults are more than four times higher than estimates from Colorado (Department of Health and Environment) . The results across states, however, are consistent in finding that prevalence of DUI -marijuana am ong older age groups is lower compared to younger age groups. Cross -state differences in results may be due to several factors, including regional beliefs, attitudes and policies related to DUI-marijuana. Some prior studies have found that males are over -represented among those who drive under the influence of Caldeira, Vincent, al., 2014) . In the present study, this was not the case, with females 213 representing about 42% of marijuana users, and a similar proportion of those who DUI - marijuan a. About 4 out of 10 Massachusetts adults who drove under the influence of marijuana reported driving under the influence of alcohol and marijuana, simultaneously. This is concerning, since studies suggest that the crash risk from the combination of alco hol and marijuana may be higher than the risk from using either substance alone (Chihuri, Li, & Chen, 2017) . Monitoring and preventing driving under the combination of alcohol and marijuana is an important consideration as legalization is implemented. The analysis of data f rom fatal crashes in Massachusetts demonstrated that there were approximately 360 crashes in 2016 in which at least one person died, with a total of nearly 390 fatalities, of which 234 were drivers. Many of these crashes are preventable and reducing potent ially-impairing alcohol and drug use by drivers should remain a priority as marijuana policies are changing within the state. Among the fatal crashes, approximately 36% of drivers received a blood drug test between 2002 -2016. This included testing 73% of fatally injured drivers, and less than 1% of surviving drivers. To contextualize these numbers, prior studies seeking to establish national or cross -state comparisons using FARS data only include states in which testing rates are above 80% for deceased dri vers. Thus, comparisons to other states may not be appropriate due to lower -than-ideal testing rates in Massachusetts. We observed a trend that may indicate an increasing proportion of decreased drivers involved in fatal motor vehicle crashes testing pos itive for cannabinoids. This does not mean the drivers were impaired by marijuana at the time of the crash, and could merely indicate increasing population -level marijuana use, which would be consistent with the results from the adult survey. The analysis of FARS data showed a decrease over time in the number of deaths per year resulting from crashes with drivers who had a blood alcohol content above 0.08%, but an increase in the number of deaths with drivers testing positive for cannabinoids or a blood alc ohol content above 0.08% plus cannabinoids. This trend is something that warrants future investigation in alternate data sources with regard to the possibility of either substitution (i.e. drivers using marijuana instead of alcohol) or combination (e.g. dr ivers using alcohol and marijuana) effects. Limitations As with all studies, these data are subject to several limitations. As reported in Task 1, Chapter 2, the survey response rate was 21.7%. Although this rate is in line with surveys of this kind, t here is a possibility for response bias on a measure not accounted for by the weighting, which would impact generalizability. For example, if adults who did not use marijuana discarded the survey but those who used marijuana were more likely to return it, this could lead to overestimation of the prevalence of marijuana use, and related measures like driving under the influence. As marijuana legalization continues to be implemented in the Commonwealth, it will be important to replicate this survey as well as expand data collection to additional modalities that will provide a robust picture of marijuana use and related behaviors. 214 The cross -sectional survey design precludes determining the temporal sequencing of experiences and prevents drawing of causal infer ences. Marijuana and other substance use were both self -reported, and not corroborated by testing of biological samples. Social desirability bias can lead to underestimates in survey research, however a unique contribution of this study is that it is the f irst to be conducted in Massachusetts after legalization of marijuana for adult recreational use. Data was collected in late 2017, nearly one year after marijuana became legal for recreational use by adults, and several years after legalization of medical marijuana in Massachusetts. This should reduce potential for social desirability bias that leads to under -reporting of marijuana use. Illegal behaviors (e.g. use of illicit drugs; driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs) may be underreported. Small cell sizes for categories of some variables likely means that models including them are underpowered. For some variables, fewer than 5 respondents endorsed the items. Weighted estimates based on these few data should be interpreted carefully. In conclu sion, this study presents the first estimate of prevalence of DUI -marijuana and RUI-marijuana among Massachusetts adults after the legalization of marijuana for use by all adults over 21 years. Driving under the influence of marijuana is common among marij uana users, particularly among young adults. Riding as a passenger with a marijuana -using driver is even more common. Efforts to address social norms about driving under the influence of marijuana is one strategy that may reduce this behavior. In the mean time, more research to understand the true crash risk and methods for deterring impaired driving are needed. Analysis of fatality data is also subject to limitations. In addition to a lower -than-ideal rate of testing, described above, prior studies have questioned the validity of drug data in FARS due to variability in drug testing practices, even within states (Berning & Smither, 2014) . The data used for this study, which showed a dramatic dip to near -zero levels of recorded delta -9-THC results in 2011 -2012 and precluded use of that data for this analysis likely reflects the type of testing and/or dat a coding problems that plague the FARS data. 215 References Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute.

Am J Epidemiol, 159 (7), 702 -706. 219 Chapter 3: Marijuana -Related Health System Contacts in Massachusetts 220 Introduction Problems related to marijuana use may lead users to require medical care. This care seeking includes incidents in which someone seeks treatment for a cannabis use disorder, or could be related to an acute injury (e.g. from a cannabis -involved motor vehicle crash) or episode of marijuana -related illness. For this study, we brought together three sources of data to document the current several aspects of the current picture of health system contacts related to marijuana. Specifically, we sought to document t he number and prevalence of (1) substance use treatment admissions for a primary diagnosis of cannabis use disorder; (2) emergency room and urgent care services due to marijuana, and (3) marijuana -related exposure calls received by the regional poison cont rol center (PCC). Since historical data is not available on use of emergency room and urgent care services for marijuana, we sought to obtain a 2017 point estimate. For treatment admissions and cannabis exposures (including unintentional exposure among y outh 0 - 9) through poison control calls will capture trends associated with regulations, legislation and cultural shifts. As marijuana legalization of marijuana for adult use is implemented, these are valuable indicator that can serve as a benchmark against which future policy changes change be compared. Methods Treatment Episode D ata The national Substance Use and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) collects and publishes annual data episodes of substance use treatment in each U.S. This data includes information on the raw number and population adjusted number of admissions to substance abuse treatment by primary substance of abuse and by year. We compiled th e number of marijuana -related treatment episodes for 2004 -2014, with 2014 being the most recent year of data available. We also extracted information on alcohol, opioid, cocaine, and methamphetamine/amphetamine admissions for comparison purposes. We graph ed the trend over time in population -adjusted admissions for marijuana, and the proportion of all admissions due to marijuana. Population Survey of Massachusetts A dults We analyzed the survey conducted as part of the MBHS included questions on seeking emergency or urgent care related to marijuana use. Briefly, we conducted a population - based, mail and Internet survey of Massachusetts residents age 18 years and older. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The survey instrument can be found in Appendix A. Details on the methods of survey design, data collection, measures, and statistical procedures, including survey weighting, can be found in Task 1, Chapter 2. In addition to the measures described therein, several questions were added to the survey for the 221 purpose of addressing use of emergency room or urgent care services related to substance use. For individuals who reported yes to using a par ticular substance (alcohol, marijuana, or other substances) in the past 30 days, the survey asked if they had utilized emergency room or urgent care services in relation to that substance within the past year. Poison Control Center Exposure C alls It can be difficult to distinguish, from secondary data, the intentionality of an exposure. For example, if teenagers intentionally experiment with marijuana but have adverse reactions, they may call poison control claiming unintentional exposure. Therefore, pri or studies have coded all exposures under the age of 9 years as unintentional. As restricting cases to children 9 years old and under has been utilized in previous studies to ensure the analysis is accurately assessing unintentional exposures and exclude adolescents, this study looked at this age range separately as well as examined cases in different age groups. Other age groups of interest revolved around youth and adolescents. As adolescence varies by individual, sex and national differences, this analysis used age categories of 10 -19 years, based on the World Health Organization identification as this time period as the general span of adolescents (World Health Organization, 2017) . We also used a category for 20 -24 years as this age span is described as late adolescence in the United States (Arnett & Tanner, 2004) and utilized in similar studies in Colorado (Wang et al., 2014) . Unknown age includes teen, unknown adult, unknown 20's and unknown. Adults 30 and over with decade specification but no specific age they were assig ned the median of their decade, e.g. 50's was assigned 55. A listing of marijuana -involved exposure calls and aggregate numbers of all PCC exposure calls by age group and by year was provided by the PCC for calls originating from within Massachusetts. We excluded calls from Rhode Island. We included the following product codes: 310124 Marijuana: Concentrated Extract 310121 Marijuana: Edible Capsule or Pill P reparation, 310126 Marijuana: Other or Unknown Preparation, 200618 Flavors, 310035 eCigarettes: Marijuana Liquid Without Added Fla vors. There were five cases exposed to two marijuana codes: one exposure always being dried plant there was 1 synthetic, 2 edibles, 1 concentrate, and 1 other/unknown. These were recoded as 2 marijuana codes. No combination of marijuana preparations exce eded two preparations, for example dried plant and edible. For calls involving multiple substances, we did not have the information on what other substances were involved, for example acetometaphin. 222 To explore population fluctuations that could influenc e prevalence, we examined the percent change in the MA population in 2007, 2010, and 2016 within age categories, using census data. If the change was less than 10%, we used 2010 census data to calculate calls per 100,000 people. There was a greater than 10% change in 25 -34, 35 - 44, 60 -64, and 65 -74 year age groups, but when collapsed into adults 25 and older, there was no significant change. We, therefore, used 2010 census data as the denominator for population prevalence rates. We graphed trend lines for the percentage of all PCC calls due to marijuana exposure, and graphed the number of exposure calls due to various preparations of marijuana. Medical marijuana became legal in Massachusetts in late 2012, so we examined whether the proportion of all PCC ca lls due to marijuana was statistically significantly different before this change (2007 -2012) versus after (2013 -2016). Chi -squared tests or Fisher's exact tests were used for those analyses. All analyses were stratified by age group. Results Episodes of Marijuana -Related Substance Use T reatment As shown in Table 1, the number of admissions to substance use treatment for marijuana was 2652 in 2014. This represents an increase from 2012 and 2013 levels, but a decrease from the historic levels in the 200 4-2010. The prevalence of marijuana - related admissions to treatment was 45 per 100,000 in 2014. This was consistent in the last few years, and a decline from peak levels in 2006 -2005 (Figure 1). Table 1.

Massachusetts Admissions to Substance Use Treatment with Marijuana as Primary Substance of Abuse, Age 12+, 2004 -2014 As shown in Figure 2, the proportion of substance abuse treatment admissions due to marijuana use has remained at less than 5% of all admissions. However, it is important to note that in the midst of the opioid epidemic, which has taxed the capacity of the treatment system, the proportion of ad missions due to all other substances would inherently be reduced. Figure 2. Proportion of Substance Abuse Treatment Admissions by Primary Substance of Abuse, 2004 -2014 224 Substance Use -Related Emergency C are Among those who used marijuana in the past 30 days, no respondents reported marijuana -related use of emergency room or urgent care services in the prior year. Nearly 70% of Massachusetts adults used alcohol in the past 30 days. Among this group, 1.7% repor ted use of emergency use of healthcare due to alcohol in the past year. Additionally, 4.1% of the population reported past 30 -day use of other substances (e.g. cocaine, opioids, etc.); 4.7% of these individuals sought emergency care related to their substa nce use, although we note that this estimate is based on fewer than five individuals in the sample and should be interpreted with caution. Marijuana -Related Exposure Calls to the Poison Control C enter During the 10 -year study period (2007 -2016) there we re 641 calls to the PCC that included marijuana exposure (Table 2) with an upward trend over time (Figure 3). The overall period prevalence from 2007 -2016 was 9.4 per 100,000 population. In 2016, there were 78 calls to the PCC with marijuana exposure. Si x of these calls pertained to marijuana exposure in youth age 0 -9 years, 33 among youth 10 -19 years, 12 among young adults age 20 -24 years, and 27 among individuals age 25 years and older. These numbers correspond to a prevalence of 0.79 per 100,000 among children age 0 - 9 years was; 3.8 among 10 -19 year olds, 2.5 among 20 -24, and 0.6 per 100,000 among those over age 25 years. For youth under age 18, the proportion of all PCC calls that were due to marijuana, by age group, is shown in Figure 3. The proport ion was highest for youth between 10 -19 years. Although the magnitude is small, with the highest proportion being under 0.5% (among 10 -17 year olds), this is concerning, since the youngest children 0 -9 years are being impacted at increasingly levels, presu mably through unintentional exposure (Figure 3). We also observed increasing proportions of calls due to marijuana for adults (Figure 4). 225 Figure 3. Proportion of MA Poison Control Calls due to Marijuana, Youth Age 0 - 17, 3 -Year Moving A verage, and 2004 -2016 Figure 4. Proportion of MA Poison Control Calls Related to Marijuana Exposure, Adults 18+ Years, 3 -Year Moving A verage, 2004 -2016 226 Table 2 . Demographics and Medical O utcomes of Cannabis -Involved E xposure Calls to the Poison Control Center, Massachusetts, 2007 -2016 One substance was a non -synthetic preparation of Marijuana; Proportion in parentheses represents the proportion of all cannabis -involved calls within each medical outcome that were due to only one cannabis code. Table 2 shows the medical outcomes reported by PCC professionals. Not surprisingly, there was a higher proportion of calls involving a death or major effect for calls involving multiple substances (as many as 14 involved) compared to calls involving only o ne cannabis code. The multi -substance calls included substances that were not marijuana. We examined whether there was an increase in the proportion of PCC calls due to marijuana after medical marijuana was legalized in Massachusetts versus before.

See Table 3. When examining the different marijuana product codes involved in calls to the PCC, we found that over time and across age groups, most calls involved dried marijuana plant. The next most common prepar ation involved was edible preparations, more frequently seen after 2012 (Figures 5 -7). 228 Table 3.

Frequency of Poison Control Center Reported Marijuana Exposures by Product Code, 2007 -2016, Age 21 Years and Older Discussion In MA from 2005 -2016, the period prevalence was 3.5 per 100,000 in children age 0 -9 years. A study of Colorado between 2005 and 2011 found cases of children under the age of 9 who had Poison control calls for marijuana related exposures was 6.6 per 100,000; this was compared to generally less than 2 calls per 100,000 in states without similar marijuana legislation (Wang et al., 2014) . That study raised discussions about whether the finding of increased prevalence in a state with medical m arijuana at the time was due to increased exposure or less stigma among parents or caregivers calling to report such an exposure (Hoffma n, 2016) . Our data indicated that there was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of calls to the PCC that were related to marijuana after medical marijuana was legalized in Massachusetts. Children age 0 -9 years accounted for less th an 5% of the calls to the PCC due to marijuana exposure during the study period, whereas youth aged 10 -19 years accounted for 40% of marijuana -related calls. 231 References Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute.

As part of the 2017 -2018 Massachusetts Marijuana Baseline Health Study, we estimated fiscal impacts of legalization for state and local governments. We develo ped a model to estimate changes expected in four key domains within the first two years of retail sales: tax revenue from marijuana purchases (based on a 20% combined sales, excise, and local tax rate); regulatory oversight; law enforcement activities; and public health effects. Methods Estimates of revenue or savings and costs or losses were derived from the literature (restricted to impacts attributable to legalization); expert interviews; and secondary sources (on marijuana pricing, marijuana use prevalence, regulatory costs and revenue, public health and safety outcomes, and Massachusetts population size and demographics). For each measure, we defined a range of values, then used Monte Carlo simulation to randomly choose a value to calculate post -legalization estimate. We calculated post -legalization impacts by combining information on pre -legalization estimates with estimates of change due to legalization. We summed estimates across all measures and domains to obtain an overall impact estimate. Results In our main model, which included measures that were major drivers of budgetary impacts (sales and business tax revenue, regulatory costs and revenue, and savings due to reduced marijuana -related law enforcement), we projected a gain of $215.8 million to the state budget. In a supplemental model that added in public health impacts thought to be less definitive or immediate, we projected an additional gain of $65.3 million, yielding a total impact of $281.1 million. Local tax revenue estimates (der ived using local data on marijuana use prevalence and pricing, when available) ranged from a median of $63,000 for suburban cities and towns to $583,000 for urban cities. Discussion The primary driver of fiscal gains (accounting for 53% of the total imp act) was sales and excise tax revenue collected on retail marijuana purchases. Other major contributors included new business tax revenue from marijuana dispensaries and increased individual income tax revenue due to worker productivity gains among older a dults who are able to control debilitating medical conditions with marijuana. 237 Background In November 2016, Massachusetts voters approved a ballot measure to legalize adult use of marijuana, joining a growing list of states approving and implementing si milar measures in the past five years. The adult use of marijuana program will build on the medical marijuana program that has been operating in Massachusetts since 2013, serving nearly 50,000 active patients as of January 2018.1 The program will also build on the experiences from other states that have legalized marijuana in recent years. However, given that retail sales of marijuana have only been legal in the United States for about four years, there is a sparse body of literat ure on the causal impacts of marijuana on a host of fiscal, health, public safety, and criminal justice outcomes. To better understand marijuana use in the state and to project fiscal impacts associated with retail sales, the state legislated that the Mass achusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) conduct the Marijuana Baseline Health Study (MBHS). The study examines the use, methods of consumption, and perceptions of marijuana; impaired driving and hospitalization related to marijuana use; and economic a nd fiscal impacts for state and local governments.2 In this report, we address the third aim to estimate the fiscal impacts of moving from a medical marijuana program to broad adult use. We focus on four key domains: (1) tax revenue from marijuana sales, ( 2) regulatory oversight, (3) law enforcement activities, and (4) public health effects. Retail sales of marijuana are planned to begin in July 2018, after legislation was passed in December 2016 to delay implementation of the program by six months.3 Where as the original ballot measure included a 3.75% excise tax, 6.25% state sales tax, and an optional local tax up to 2%, for a maximum tax rate of 12%, the state legislature later passed a bill to increase the excise tax to 10.75% and the maximum local tax t o 3%, yielding a total maximum tax rate of 20%.4 A share of the revenues collected by the state will be devoted to (1) public and behavioral health, (2) public safety, (3) municipal police training, (4) the Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund, and (5) a hos t of services for \"economically -disadvantaged persons in communities disproportionately impacted by high rates of arrest and incarceration for marijuana offenses.\"5 The existing medical marijuana program in Massachusetts registers nonprofit organizations to cultivate and dispense marijuana as well as patients and physicians.6 As of January 2018, the program had 227 registered certifying health care providers and nearly 50,000 active patients. The program has consistently added roughly 2,000 patients per mo nth over its history. There are 22 registered marijuana dispensaries with final certification and approval to sell, 6 with final certification but not yet approved to 1 https://www.mass.gov/lists/medical -use-of-marijuana -program -monthly -dashboards . 2 Mass. Session Laws 18 (2016). 3 Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94G, \u00a7 14. 4 Mass. Session Laws ch. 55, 12 (2017). 5 Mass. 6 https://www.mass.gov/medical -use-of-marijuana -program . 238 sell, and 99 with provisional certificates and in the inspection phase. In contrast to th e adult use program, the medical program requires those selling medical marijuana to follow a seed -to-sale model \u2014that is, the same entity is responsible for the product from cultivation to sale in licensed dispensaries. In addition, the marijuana is not su bject to any taxes, and only nonprofit organizations can participate. To implement and administer the adult use program and create a safely regulated industry, the state formed the Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) in 2017. The CCC will also take over reg ulatory activities for the medical marijuana program, currently administered by the MDPH Bureau of Health Care Safety and Quality.7 Massachusetts also created the Cannabis Advisory Board, a 25 -member group charged with studying and making recommendations t o the CCC on the regulation and taxation of marijuana in Massachusetts. The adult use program in Massachusetts and the study presented here have the benefit of learning from experiences in several other state s that have implemented similar programs in th e past four years. Colorado and Washington approved ballot measures in 2013 to legalize marijuana for adult use and began retail sales in 2014. In 2014, Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. voted to legalize adult use, with retail sales beginning in 2015 i n Oregon and in 2016 in Alaska; retail sales are not yet permitted in Washington, D.C. In 2016, California, Maine, Nevada, and Massachusetts approved ballot measures, with retail sales beginning in 2017 in Nevada and 2018 in California and Massachusetts; retail sales are not yet permitted in Maine. Finally, the state legislature in Vermont legalized adult use in 2018. Although the experiences with adult use of marijuana in these states have been brief, the states consistently saw substantial increases in revenue collected from retail sales after the first year. Revenue collected in the first year ranged from $1.7 million in Alaska to $67.6 million in Colorado.8 There were substantial increases in the second and third years of the programs; for example, the r evenue collected by the Washington Liquor Cannabis Board (LCB) increased from $64.9 million in the first year of the program to $314.8 million in the third year (Washington State LCB, n.d.). In addition, the revenue collected was substantially above the am ount projected by the states prior to implementation. Finally, there is some limited evidence suggesting that marijuana legalization could have positive impacts on public health and safety outcomes and criminal justice costs and outcomes (such as reduced incarcerations); however, the evidence is primarily for impacts from medical marijuana legalization, little evidence establishes causal links between legalization and the outcomes, and the timeline for observing impacts for legalization is brief (four years at most for the earliest implementers). There are a handful of differences between the planned program in Massachusetts and other states that will likely affect the implementation and impact of legalization. First, 7 https://mass see http://www.drugpolicy.org/legalization -status -report . 239 other states have implemented substantially higher tax rates than the planned 17% tax rate in Massachusetts (excluding the local tax rate), which influences the price of marijuana in the licit market and thus how much demand is met by retail sales versus the black market. In high -tax W ashington (44% point -of-sale tax, excluding the local tax rate), despite the fact that the licit price of marijuana has dropped over time and is only slightly above black market prices, licensed sales account for only about 30% of demand; the rest is met b y the state's loosely regulated medical marijuana market and other black market sources.9 By contrast, in Colorado, where marijuana taxes were lower (27.9% combined tax rate through July 2017, excluding the local tax rate), an estimated 70% of demand is me t by the licit market, with much of the remaining demand met by legal home -grown product. Differences in the structure of the medical marijuana programs will also influence the impact of legalization. The cultivation and sale of medical marijuana is strict ly regulated and less accessible to Massachusetts residents compared to other states. Out of 27 states with medical marijuana programs, Massachusetts ranks 15th highest in terms of the number of medical marijuana patients per 1,000 state residents (Marijua na Policy Project, 2018); programs in California, Colorado, and Oregon include a much greater proportion of residents.10 On the other hand, other states apply taxes to medical marijuana sales to varying degrees; the fact that the Massachusetts medical marij uana program is untaxed could make it more attractive to marijuana consumers once retail sales begin. In this study, we combine evidence from implementation in other states with the details and nuances of Massachusetts programs and residents to estimate fiscal impacts of legalizing adult use of marijuana on state and local budgets. We estimate impacts separately for key domains of interest: (1) sales and business tax revenue from retail marijuana sales, (2) law enforcement costs, (3) the costs of regulato ry oversight, and (4) estimated impacts on state public health expenditures and individual income tax revenue as a result of changes in worker productivity (both of which were included in a supplemental model). Our estimates reflect impacts expected only w ithin the first two years after retail sales are allowed but also include start -up costs and revenue. Given the uncertainty of many of the inputs used to estimate impacts in some of these domains (for example, the projected price of marijuana in the retail market or the percentage of current users that will purchase their marijuana in the licit market), we conducted a number of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results to our inputs. The results generated in the study will help the state an d municipalities plan for the impacts of legalization while also providing a point of comparison for early impacts once the program is implemented. Furthermore, the study will provide valuable information to other states considering legalization on the com plex public health, public safety, and economic impacts of . 240 Methods Data Sources We developed a model to estimate changes expected in four key domains within the first two years of retail sales. Each domain (for example, marijuana sales tax revenue) included individual measures (for example, marijuana use prevalence and the price of marijuana) that we estimated using three main sources of information: existing literature, interviews with academic and government experts, and secondar y data sources. For each measure that fed into the model, we defined a range of plausible values as follows: If multiple (high quality, rigorous) studies or sources estimated the same metric, we defined the range based on the point estimates from these so urces. If only a single study was used to estimate a metric, we defined the range based on the confidence interval around the point estimate from that paper. If there was no credible study or source for a given metric, we estimated a range using informati on from other states with legalized adult use or from expert stakeholder input. Literature Review To inform estimates of the impact of legalization in Massachusetts, we first reviewed the literature on the impacts of marijuana laws or policies on consum ption of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco; public health; public safety; and worker productivity. We also used the literature to identify major sources of direct costs and revenue stemming from marijuana legalization, plus demographic subgroups that are aff ected differentially by legalization. As a starting point, we first searched peer -reviewed publications based on key search terms (such as \"marijuana\" and \"legalization\") applied to the MEDLINE\u00ae, Scopus, and EconLit databases. To avoid excluding potentiall y relevant search results, we used a broad set of search terms related to marijuana legalization rather than searching by specific terms related to consumption, public health, public safety, and labor productivity. We then searched the gray literature to i dentify working papers from the National Bureau of Economic Research, research briefs, and other reports published from policy institutes and state governments. After excluding papers based on a review of titles, we reviewed the abstracts to ascertain rele vance. We identified 57 candidate papers, to which we uniformly applied a set of causal evidence criteria, as described below, to determine inclusion. Because the literature has focused mostly on medical marijuana legalization, and there is limited litera ture on adult use legalization, many of the model impacts derived from the literature are based on the experiences of medical marijuana programs. To account for the possibility that these impacts will not accurately reflect the experience of legalization i n Massachusetts, we incorporate ranges for estimates derived from this literature, along with a sensitivity analysis that removes all impacts taken from the medical marijuana literature. 241 Causal Criteria To ensure that our model estimates are based only on papers that demonstrate strong causal evidence that links outcomes directly to marijuana policies, we developed a set of guidelines to determine inclusion of impacts in our model estimates.11 We rated each paper based on the strength of evidence as high, m oderate, or low causal evidence for marijuana -attributable impacts. A high rating indicates that the analysis meets high methodological standards (for example, with a control group included in the analysis) and the impacts estimated are credible; it does n ot mean that the study found positive impacts. A moderate causal evidence rating means that we are somewhat confident that the estimated impacts are attributable to the intervention studied, but other factors that were not included in the analysis could ha ve contributed to the impacts observed. Research not meeting the criteria for a high or moderate causal evidence rating received a low causal evidence rating, indicating that we could not be certain that the impacts observed were attributable to the mariju ana law or policy being studied. To derive estimates for our model measures, we relied only on studies with a high causal rating. Of the 57 candidate papers reviewed, 16 met the criteria for high causal evidence. As our research progressed, we identified a n additional 3 papers published in 2017 that had high causal evidence, resulting in a total of 19 (out of 60) that met our criteria for high quality evidence of impacts attributed to marijuana. An implication of applying these strict causal guidelines to o ur inclusion criteria is that we ultimately excluded some studies and state government reports that used longitudinal data to examine how public health and safety outcomes (such as emergency room visits, suicides, and non -fatal crashes) changed after adult use of marijuana was legalized because these analyses lacked valid comparison groups. Our exclusion of these studies does not imply that the results are not valid or useful for certain purposes, but rather that we cannot be confident that the pre -post cha nges are attributable to legalization. Stakeholder Interviews For certain domains of interest, there was insufficient rigorous evidence from the literature on causal impacts of legalization to inform our model estimates. Instead, we gathered information from interviews with expert stakeholders in Massachusetts and other states with legalized marijuana retail sales as well as from researchers studying marijuana legalization. We also used these interviews to gain insight into contextual differences between Massachusetts and other states with legalized adult use that may affect our modeling approach or interpretation of estimates. We interviewed experts in the following knowledge areas: (1) regulatory costs to state and local governments, (2) regulation of the current Massachusetts medical marijuana program, (3) the degre e of shift from illicit to legal consumption, (4) current law enforcement practices in Massachusetts, and (5) public health experiences and budget expenditures in Colorado. For each interview, we developed separate protocols with tailored questions that we 11 These guidelines follow the Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research (CLEAR). CLEAR was established by the Department of Labor to promote informed decision making and policy development by providing a central and trusted source of research evidence. 242 asked in person, by phone, or through email correspondences. Our notes from these interviews informed the model estimates for measures and domains of interest, as detailed in Table 1. Table 1.

Secondary Data Sources We augmented information from the literature and key informant interviews with analyses of a number of secondary data sources. To estimate taxable sales from marijuana, we required information on marijuana pricing. We extracted this information from three websites that aggregate crowd -sourced information on marijuana pricing (as of December 2017): Budzu and PriceofWeed (which enables users to submit information on the location where they purchased marijuana and on the price, amount, and quality of t he marijuana purchased) and a document hosted on Google Sheets called Dispensary Sheet (which displays information about the price of marijuana for each amount sold at Massachusetts dispensaries). Because retail marijuana sales are not yet legal, informati on on the current price per gram of dried flower marijuana from these sites may contain a combination of prices in the illicit market and those in the medical market. We also used data supplied by MDPH to identify the median price of medical marijuana sold in registered marijuana dispensaries (RMDs) in Massachusetts (see Appendix D). 243 We obtained data on the prevalence of current marijuana use from a combination of the MBHS Task 1 survey of the general population in Massachusetts; the 2015 National Survey o n Drug Use and Health (NSDUH, based on national estimates because Massachusetts -specific detailed data were unavailable at the time of the analysis12); and the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of Massachusetts residents.13,14 For adolescent marijuana use prevalence, we obtained estimates from the 2015 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey of 9th through 12th grade students,15 the 2015 Massachusetts Youth Health Survey (YHS) of middle and high scho ol students,16 and 2015 -2016 NSDUH estimates.17 We gathered estimates of changes in regulatory costs and revenue attributable to retail legalization from CCC, MDPH, Washington, and Colorado budgets. Given that the CCC is expected to take over regulatory ov ersight of the medical marijuana program from MDPH, the increase in start -up costs for Massachusetts fiscal year (FY) 2018 were based on the difference between the CCC budget estimate18 and projected FY 2017 costs from the MDPH's Medical Marijuana Trust Fun d Annual Report.19 Thereafter, for FY 2019 and FY 2020, we inflated CCC and MDPH projections of costs to account for the expected growth in the number of RMDs in operation (estimated to be 26 by the end of FY 2018, 40 by the end of FY 2019, and 123 by the e nd of FY 2020, based on data posted by MDPH on the current status of all registered marijuana dispensaries and applications through January 12, 201820). We also translated recurring marijuana - related law enforcement costs incurred in Washington (based on th e I-502 Fiscal Impact Statement21) and public safety costs incurred in Colorado22 to Massachusetts' projected costs on a per capita basis. Sources of regulatory revenue within the first two years of legalization include marijuana dispensary application fee s and fines collected for infractions or deficiencies. To 12 https://www.samhsa.gov/samhsa -data-outcomes . 14 We defined respondents who indicated past -month or past -30 day marijuana use as current users. We chose past -month use because it wa s the most contemporary use option available, and because we identified only minor differences (less than 5%) between past -month and past -year users in 90% of records. inflated FY 2017 projections from MDPH's Medical Marijuana Trust Fund Annual Report, as described above for the start -up costs, to reflect the growth in RMDs. We also included estimated fines that the CCC will collect for infractions in FY 2019 and FY 2020. Though CCC fines can be as high as $25,000 per deficiency, we assumed an average fine of $1,000 (in line with Group 2 regulatory marijuana fines in Washington23) and assumed five deficiencies per RMD per year (based on conversations with MDPH). We did not factor in additional licensing revenue because, based on our analysis of data from MDPH on the current status of all registered marijuana dispensaries and applicatio ns through January 12, 2018, we do not expect to see a substantial increase in the number of RMD applications in the two - year study period compared to current application rates. Finally, several secondary data sources informed our estimates of public health effects of adult use legalization: treatment admission data from the 2011 and 2016 Massachusetts Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS)24 and the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, data on suicides from the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion National Vital Statistics System statistics on Massachusetts, traffic fatality statistics from the 2015 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (which were compiled by the MBHS Task 2 team), and 2016 data on the number of opioid -related deaths from MDPH. To translate estimates from other states to Massachusetts, we used data from the U.S. Census microdata (Ruggles, Genadek, Goeken, Grover, & Sobek, 2017) and the 2015 American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates (United States Census Bureau, 2015) on Massach usetts population size and demographics . MBHS Task 1 Survey We analyzed data from the Massachusetts general population adult survey, administered as part of MBHS Task 1 by the University of Massachusetts' Donahue Institute, to obtain estimates of the prev alence of marijuana use, the number of regular versus heavy users of marijuana, and use by mode of consumption. All estimates were based on weighted frequencies that were generated using SAS PROC SURVEYSELECT (SAS version 9.4). Our estimate of prevalence of current marijuana use came from a question on use of marijuana or hashish at least once within the past 30 days. We calculated the prevalence of use statewide (based on all individuals surveyed) and combined this information with data on the prevalence of use obtained from the NSDUH and BRFSS surveys to obtain a range of plausible values that fed into our models. We also estimated the number of regular versus heavy users of marijuana in Massachusetts based on definitions in the literature that rely on th e number of days of marijuana use in 23 http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=314 -55-525. 24 https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/TEDS2011St_Web/TEDS2011St_Web/TEDS2011St_We b.pdf (Tables 2.1 and 2.2) and https://wwwdasis.samhsa.gov/webt/quicklink/MA16.htm . 245 the past month (Kilmer et al., 2013). We calculated the number of individuals surveyed who used marijuana between 1 and 20 days in the past month (defined as regular users) and how many used marijuana 21 days or more in the past month (defined as heavy users). Finally, we examined modes of consumption and found that the clear majority of users (95%) consume marijuana as a dried flower product (by smoking or vaporization) \u2014either alone or in combination with other modes of consumption (such as by eating it, dabbing it, or applying it topically or sublingually). We therefore based our pricing of marijuana on price per gram of dried flower product. In addition, we estimated prevalence of marijuana use at the city or town le vel using data collected in the MBHS Task 1 survey by respondents' five -digit ZIP code. Because ZIP codes tend to span multiple cities, we used a two -part approach to allocate respondents to a single city or town, based on MassGIS data on city and town boundaries:25 (1) we associated each ZIP code to the city or town that contained the majority of the ZIP code boundary, and (2) if no city contained the majority of the ZIP code boundary, we used the town or city that contained the geographic center of the ZIP code. We then calculated the prevalence of current marijuana use in each city or town for cities and towns with at least 15 MBHS Task 1 survey respondents (to ensure we had sufficient data to produce a valid estimate); for the remaining municipalities, we estimated the prevalence by averaging the current marijuana use prevalence estimates from the national NSDUH and Massachusetts -specific BRFSS surveys. Statistical Modeling Our model estimates the fiscal impacts of shifting from a medical marijuana to a broader adult use program within the first two years after retail sales begin. We also include start-up costs and revenue. Our modeling consists of three models: (1) A main model, which includes primary measures that we hypothesize are major drivers of economic impacts to the state and for which there is strong evidence to inform estimates: sales tax revenue, regulatory oversight costs and revenue, and reductions in marijuana -related law enforcement activities (2) A supplemental model, which adds secondary impacts on public health, public safety, and income tax revenue for which the evidence is less definitive or immediate than those domains included in the main model (3) A local model, which estimates local tax revenue for each city or town in Massach usetts (assuming the maximum local tax rate of 3%) We first calculated measure -specific revenue or savings and measure -specific costs or losses by multiplying various input estimates (for example, to calculate marijuana sales revenue, we multiplied the es timated number of marijuana users by the average grams of marijuana used per day by the average price per gram of marijuana). To do so, we combined information on pre -legalization baseline measures (such as the number of marijuana users) with estimates of the post -legalization change (such as the percentage 25 https://docs.digital.mass.gov/dataset/massgis -data/zip -codes -5-digit-here0navteq -0. 246 change in the number of marijuana users). We next estimated the precision of our post - legalization estimates, and finally tested the sensitivity of the findings to key assumptions. To calculate the post -legalization fiscal impact of marijuana legalization for metrics in our model, we defined a range of plausible values using information from the literature, stakeholder interviews, secondary data sources, and the MBHS Task 1 survey. We then used Monte Carl o simulation \u2014a method that is useful when there is inherent uncertainty about model inputs \u2014to randomly draw a value from the range for each metric and then use that value to calculate the overall impact estimate. This process of randomly drawing values fro m the range was repeated 1,000 times, each time resulting in a different value, to generate a probability distribution of values for the impact metric. This simulated distribution was then used to calculate a 95% confidence interval \u2014a low and high range th at indicates precision \u2014around the impact estimate. To obtain an overall impact estimate of adult use legalization, we summed together measure -specific (for example, sales tax revenue from marijuana purchases by adults considered heavy users, adults consid ered regular users, and adolescents) for each domain included in the model.26 In Table 2, we summarize baseline and projected values for each input in our models (see Appendix C Table C .1 for detailed information on the variables and data sources used to co nstruct each measure). In the Limitations section, we indicate the measures we excluded from our model because we lacked sufficient data or causal evidence for their inclusion. 26 Because we produce a distribution of outcome values for each level of impact (measure, domain, and model), the average value for a summed outcome will not exactly equal t he sum of the average components that fed into it (for example, the sum of the individual measures used to calculate sales tax revenue does not exactly equal the total impact of the sales tax revenue domain); however, we the differences are small. 247 Table 2.

The first involves the number of current marijuana users in Massachusetts. In our primary analysis, we used the NSDUH and BRFSS population surveys to est ablish a range (8.6% to 12.1%) for the prevalence of current marijuana use in Massachusetts. In a sensitivity analysis, we expanded the high end of the range to 20.1%, based on the MBHS Task 1 survey estimate. It is unclear why the estimate of use prevalen ce was substantially higher in the MBHS Task 1 survey than in existing population surveys. On the one hand, because the NSDUH and BRFSS surveys were conducted prior to adult use legalization, they may have underreported marijuana use, which is a recognized problem in surveys targeting illegal substance use (Harrison, Martin, Enev, & Harrington, 2007). Because the MBHS Task 1 survey was conducted after the referendum to legalize retail marijuana was passed in Massachusetts, it may have captured more honest r eporting that captures true Massachusetts -specific consumption patterns. However, it should be noted that the rate of consumption reported in Colorado in the 2014 -2015 NSDUH \u2014 which was conducted after legalization \u2014was still only 17%. On the other hand, beca use the MBHS Task 1 survey response rate was low (roughly 20% of individuals who were mailed a survey completed the survey), it is not clear how representative MBHS Task 1 survey estimates are of the general adult population in Massachusetts and whether se lf- reporting bias affected the estimates obtained. In our sensitivity check, we examined what effect using the MBHS Task 1 survey consumption estimate as the high end of the range had on our overall impact estimate. In our second sensitivity analysis, we set all impacts based on the medical marijuana literature to zero, given the possibility that these impacts might have already been realized when Massachusetts implemented the medical marijuana program. In our primary analysis, we assume that the expansi on from the medical marijuana to the adult use of marijuana regime will generate similar impacts as the expansion from no legalization to the medical marijuana regime. However, while far from conclusive, the limited evidence of the impacts from the expansi on from medical to retail legalization are small or statistically insignificant (Dills, Goffard, & Miron, 2016, 2017). In this sensitivity analysis, we take the conservative view that there are no behavioral impacts generated from the shift from the medica l to adult use regimes beyond consumers switching from the black market to legal retail market. In other words, we do not anticipate any impacts of adult use legalization on the likelihood or frequency of marijuana consumption, nor do we anticipate any imp acts on public health outcomes explored in the supplemental model, such as alcohol or opioid consumption, or economic impacts from increased labor force participation of older adults. The results from this sensitivity analysis can therefore serve as a lowe r bound of the expected fiscal impact of marijuana legalization in Massachusetts. Local Analyses To estimate fiscal impacts to local governments, we projected the revenue that cities and towns would collect from local taxes imposed on retail marijuana sa les during the 249 first two years of adult use legalization. Unlike our main model, the local model does not factor in costs associated with adult use legalization (such as increased training and law enforcement costs that are anticipated at the local level) because of the high level of uncertainty associated with these costs, coupled with a lack of local -level data to inform such estimates. To estimate revenue, we assumed a local tax rate of 3% (the maximum local tax) in all cities and towns with an RMD expec ted to open within the first two years of retail marijuana sales. We applied this rate to the projected number of marijuana purchases, calculated using the prevalence of current marijuana use assumed in our state -level models (defined to range from 8.6% to 12.1%, based on the NSDUH and BRFSS surveys), which was assumed to be consistent across all cities and towns. In a sensitivity analysis, we used local -level prevalence estimates that were informed by the MBHS Task 1 survey for cities and towns with at lea st 15 individuals surveyed. We assumed that marijuana users in cities and towns without a projected RMD would purchase marijuana from the nearest city or town with an RMD. Based on the locations of RMDs expected to open within the two -year study period, we expect that individuals in the majority of cities and towns (n = 337) will reside within 10 miles of an open RMD and that all individuals in Massachusetts will reside within 20 miles of an RMD. Finally, in the primary local analysis, we assumed that 50% to 80% of marijuana users wou ld shift from purchasing their marijuana in the illicit market to purchasing from RMDs, based on information from the Washington State Institute of Public Policy (WSIPP) and a stakeholder interview. In a sensitivity analyses, we set the shift to 50% and 80 % to examine the effect on the results. Results Main Model Impacts Our main model included changes in the following primary measures: sales tax revenue (from marijuana purchases among adults with regular and heavy use and among adolescents using marijua na purchased from RMDs); business income tax revenue from RMDs (which we estimated by applying an 8% business tax rate to our estimate of gross revenue, excluding business -related expenses); regulatory costs and revenue; and marijuana -related law enforceme nt activities (related to decreases in arrests, convictions, incarcerations, and parolees/probationers). Based on our main model, we estimate that marijuana legalization will result in a net two -year fiscal contribution of $215.8 million (Figure 1 and Tabl e 3). The majority of this gain (70%, amounting to $150.3 million) will come from sales tax revenue, followed by RMD business tax revenue (28%, amounting to $60.1 million); about 2% will come from savings due to reduced law enforcement needs to police ille gal marijuana use; and less than 1% will come from regulatory revenue \u2014largely because we estimate that Massachusetts will spend about the same amount to regulate marijuana sales and production ($1.8 million) as it will receive in application fees and viola tion fines from marijuana dispensaries ($2.2 million). Based on the probability distribution generate from the Monte Carlo simulation, we estimate a 95% confidence interval of $95.7 to $405.9 million around our main model impact estimate. 250 Sales tax reven ue was driven largely by marijuana purchases anticipated by adults categorized as heavy users (we estimate these consumers are responsible for $89.8 million of the $150.3 million expected in new sales tax revenue). Additional sales tax revenue comes from: adults categorized as regular marijuana users ($23.3 million); adolescents who consume marijuana that was purchased by adults from RMDs ($14.6 million); tourist purchases ($14.4 million), which we assumed would comprise between 7% and 12% of total tax reve nue, based on estimates from Light et al. (2016) and Cooper et al. (2016) ; and new adult users ($7.7 million), whose use of marijuana begins after the commencement of retail sales. As a result of retail marijuana sales, we also forecast a $3.6 million redu ction in sales tax revenue from beer sales over the study period. The majority of law enforcement savings are realized through reductions in law enforcement costs related to vehicular crashes that result in fatalities ($3.8 million) and in the number of ma rijuana -related incarcerations ($1.4 million). Supplemental Model Impacts Our supplemental model included changes in the following health -related measures estimated with less certainty: income tax revenue (mainly as a result of increases in worker produc tivity among adults age 50 or over, coupled with extra years of life due to averted mortality), decreased MassHealth spending on prescription drugs replaced with marijuana, decreased spending on opioid addiction treatment, increased spending on cannabis ad diction treatment, and state -level savings due to averted deaths. With respect to averted deaths, the evidence from the medical marijuana literature suggests a decrease in traffic fatalities (Anderson, Hansen, & Rees, 2013; Santaella -Tenorio, Mauro, Wall, Kim, & Martins, 2017), which would decrease legal costs to the state, along with a decrease in suicides among males ages 20 to 39 ( Anderson, Rees, & Sabia, 2014), which would decrease state spending on related medical costs. Adding these measures to our ma in model increased our projected budgetary gain by $65.3 million, and yielded a total impact estimate of $281.1 million (Table 3). Across all domains, estimated changes in sales and business tax revenue represent approximately 75% of all economic and fisca l impacts, while revenue and savings as a result of public health effects account for an additional 23%; regulatory oversight and law enforcement fiscal impacts together constitute less than 5% of estimated impacts. The 95% confidence interval around the s econdary model impact estimate was $98.4 million to $528.3 million. 251 When we examine projected revenue or savings (without factoring in projected costs or losses), the single largest contributor is sales tax revenue for marijuana purchases at RMDs by heavy adult users, followed by marijuana -related business income tax reven ue (Appendix C Figure C .1). We also estimate substantial income tax revenue from gains in worker productivity ($54.4 million). In particular, we project growth in hours worked among men over age 50 ($46.7 million) and in full -time employment among women ov er age 50 ($20.9 million) who have a debilitating medical condition (such as chronic back pain or depression) that is well -controlled with marijuana. Retail marijuana legalization is estimated to reduce mortality from suicides, vehicular crashes, and opioi d-related deaths; together, these could increase income tax revenue by $1.1 million and reduce state public health spending by $0.7 million. When we look at costs or losses (data not shown), we project that a reduction in average hourly earnings as a resu lt of marijuana addiction or dependence will reduce state income tax revenue by $12.5 million. We also estimate a loss of $3.6 million in alcohol sales taxes because of substitution effects (whereby individuals purchase marijuana in lieu of alcohol). The e stimated impact on state spending for substance abuse treatment is minimal, composed of reduced spending on opioid addiction treatment ($1.0 million) that is offset by increased spending on cannabis addiction treatment ($1.1 million).

See Appendix C Table C .1 for data sources used to inform these estimates. Note: The sum across domains may not equal the overall estimate because of random variation in the simulations. The range is based on the 95% confidence interval around the model estimate. Sensitivity of Impacts In our first sensitivity analysis, in which we increased the upper end of the range of plausible values for prevalence of current marijuana use to include the MBHS Task 1 survey estimate, our main model impact estimate increased by 38% (from $215.8 million to $298.8 million), and our supplemental model estimate increased by 29% (from $281.1 million to $364.1 million). In our second sensitivity analysis, in which we adjusted all impacts derived from the medical marijuana literature to zero, our main model estimate decreased by only 8% (to $143.9 million), but our supplemental model estimate (which included a number of public health measures informed by the medical marijuana literature) decreased by 28% (to $201.4 million). Local Impact s In Figure 2, we show our estimated two -year local tax revenue, assuming a 3% local tax rate, along with information on the projected number of RMDs expected per city or town. With some exceptions, local tax revenue is generally higher on the coast and l ower in the western part of the state. In Table 4, we summarize estimated local tax revenue by city or town density, defined using the methodology of Pozzi and Small (2005) as rural ( 100 people/km2); suburban low, medium, and high density (100 people /km2, 500-1,000 people/km2, and 1,000 -10,000 people/km2, respectively); and urban (> 10,000 people/km2). As expected, revenue is highest in dense regions, though there is considerable fluctuation in tax revenue projections among the 51 high -density suburba n cities and towns (see Appendix C Table C.3 for detailed results). Both sets of results are 253 restricted to the 83 cities and towns in which an RMD is expected to be open within the first two years of retail marijuana sales. In Appendix C Figure C.2, Tabl e C.2, and Table C .3, we show how local revenue estimates would change if RMDs were open in all cities and towns across Massachusetts, such that marijuana users would no longer travel to nearby cities or towns to purchase marijuana. For some of the 83 cit ies and towns included in the primary analysis \u2014particularly those that will be more isolated from other RMDs in the state \u2014local tax revenue estimates dropped dramatically (for example, from about $992,000 in Burlington to about $108,000). In the sensitiv ity analysis in which we used local -level marijuana use prevalence estimates that were informed by the MBHS Task 1 survey (which were available mostly for urban and high -density suburban cities and towns), our estimate of local tax revenue increased by 215 % for urban cities (to almost $1.3 million) and by 20% for high -density suburban cities (to about $288,000). And in the sensitivity analysis in which we specified that the percentage shift in marijuana purchases from the illicit market to RMDs would be exa ctly 50% or 80% (instead of 65%, which we derived for the primary analysis based on the range of 50% to 80%), our median revenue estimates decreased and increased, respectively, by 18% for all density categories.

Appendix C Table C.2 provides estimates assuming RMDs are open in all Massachusetts cities and towns within the first two years of legalization. See Appendix C Table C.3 for estimates by city or town. Discussion We estimate that the legalization of adult use of marijuana will result in an increase of approximately $215.8 million to the Massachusetts state budget over the first two years of retail sales, largely as a result of sales and excise taxes collected on re tail marijuana purchases. Although our model includes fiscal impacts of legalization due to a number of domains, most are miniscule compared to increases expected from sales and business tax revenue. The increase will largely be a result of retail purchase s made by adults with heavy use \u2014defined as consuming marijuana an average of 21 days or more each month. New business income tax revenue from marijuana dispensaries will also be a major contributor, as will increases in income tax revenue (primarily due to increased worker productivity among adults over age 50 who are able to control debilitating medical ailments with marijuana). When we included measures calculated with less certainty (because of either a lack of data or an uncertain time frame within which impacts could occur), we estimate that the state may see an additional $65.3 million added to its budget. This increase would mainly come from added individual income tax revenue from worker productivity gains in older adults able to control serious ailments with marijuana. 255 Our estimate of tax revenue is heavily influenced by assumptions about the number of current marijuana users in Massachusetts. Because previous population surveys (used to inform our main model estimates) yielded a lower estimate of prevalence of use than the MBHS Task 1 survey, our main model estimate may be conservative. However, because we assumed that changes seen when moving from medical marijuana sales to retail marijuana sales could be as high as moving from no legal marijuana sales to medical marijuana sales, our fiscal estimates could also be somewhat higher than may be realized. A strength of our analytic approach is that the Monte Carlo simulation factors the uncertainty of inputs into the model estimates; that is, we were able to incorporate plausible ranges of values for inputs to not overstate their certainty. The combination of uncertain inputs leads to substantial uncertainty in the estimated impact of adult use legalization on the state budget, as indicated by the wide confidence interval around the estimate. As more studies are published on the impacts of adult use legalization, the ranges of estimates from the literature will be better defined and our impact estimates will become more precise. The results of our mod el should be interpreted in the context of Massachusetts -specific information, such as the proposed regulatory framework, tax regime, and existing medical marijuana program. Below, we provide additional details on the assumptions and implications of our ap proach with respect to the four domains included in our analysis: sales tax revenue, regulatory oversight, law enforcement, and public health. We also compare how our estimate of the fiscal impact of adult use of marijuana legalization compares with previo us impact estimates (generated from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue [DOR] and in other states with legalized use) and discuss limitations of our approach. Sales Tax Revenue We project fiscal impacts within a two -year window starting at the comm encement of retail marijuana sales, but it is important to note that the revenue generated is heavily weighted toward the tail end of the two -year period. Indeed, in other states that have implemented retail marijuana sales for at least two years (Colorado , Washington, and Oregon), 66% to 77% of sales tax revenue collected within the first two years was generated in the second year (Colorado DOR, 2018; Oregon DOR, n.d.; Washington State LCB, n.d.), and the data suggest that sales tax revenues are likely to increase substantially after consumers, suppliers, and regulators adjust to the new regime.27 Based on data from these states, we assumed that about 70% of the two -year estimate of sales tax revenue would be collected from Massachusetts RMDs in the second y ear of sales. This translates to an estimated $61.6 million collected in the first year and 27 Alaska collected less tax revenue from legal marijuana in its second year of sales than in its first. However, Alaska differs from other states that have legalized marijuana \u2014including Massachusetts \u2014in many respects, including the fact that they tax marijuana b y plant weight, rather than through a tax rate applied to retail sales ( http://tax.alaska.gov/programs/programs/reports/Annual.aspx?60000&Year=2017 ). Therefore, we excluded Alaska when reviewing the experiences of states that allow marijuana sales. 256 $154.2 million in the second year of retail sales. It is important to note we cannot claim with certainty that spending on marijuana represents new spending rather than a shift from other recreational options like spending on alcohol. Similarly, income tax revenue from new dispensary jobs may represent transfers from other industries. As a result, it is possible that some amount of tax revenue generated by legalizati on may be offset by a reduction in tax revenue elsewhere. Our methodology for estimating change in tax revenue attributable to marijuana legalization differs from other models in two major respects. First, we did not factor in changes in the price of mar ijuana over time because it is particularly difficult to know the rate at which prices will change within the first two years of legalization (Hunt & Pacula, 2017). Instead, we estimated a single, average price of marijuana during the study period based on crowd -sourced data and data from RMDs. We also did not link marijuana prices to sales volumes \u2014that is, examine the price elasticity of demand \u2014 because doing so compounds this uncertainty.28 Instead, we estimated changes in demand using marijuana use quantit ies derived from the literature and MBHS Task 1 survey results, coupled with changes in use behavior derived from the growing body of evidence from states that have legalized marijuana use. Second, we did not account for expected increases in revenue rela ted to the establishment and growth of the broader marijuana industry. Several previous studies attempted to quantify these macroeconomic impacts, with mixed results; one study concluded that previous analyses underestimate or overestimate impacts by up to 300% (Light, Orens, Rowberry, & Saloga, 2016). However, it is likely that the development of a novel industry will generate some amount of tax revenues from businesses that grow, manufacture, or test marijuana and stimulate growth among traditional busine sses that supply or interact with this new market. Our model also assumed a steady growth rate in medical marijuana patients (based on current growth trajectories) that would be unchanged after retail sales begin. Because medical marijuana is untaxed in M assachusetts, it may be more attractive to new marijuana consumers once retail sales begin. Accordingly, it is possible that the initiation of retail sales could actually increase the rate of growth in medical marijuana use. However, we did not model this scenario. Whenever possible, we benchmarked our estimates against other sources. For example, we found that the median price per gram of dried flower marijuana ($13.70) based on crowdsourced data for Massachusetts was nearly identical to the median price per gram sold by RMDs for medical use ($13.30). Also, based on stakeholder interviews, we estimated that the price of marijuana during the two -year study period will be roughly 75% of the current price. The prices also align with data from other sources, which suggest that post -legalization prices in other states have fallen roughly 20% per year (Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 2018). Finally, data on 28 This approach is similar to the one used by Cooper, Johnston, & Segal (2016) to model the economic impact of marijuana sales in California. 257 marijuana use frequency from the MBHS Task 1 survey align with data from the 2015 - 2016 NSDUH survey of Massachusetts residents in that both suggest that approximately two -thirds of current marijuana users are \"regular\" users based on their use frequency being between 1 and 20 days per month, and the remaining one -third are \"heavy\" users ba sed on a use frequency of 21 or more days per month. The sources also indicate that regular users average 7 use days per month, and heavy users average approximately 29 use days per month. Estimates of the average amount of marijuana consumed per day of use among current marijuana users were inconsistent between the MBHS Task 1 survey and the literature. To estimate dollars spent per day of marijuana use, we derived dollars spend in the past month on the average number of days marijuana was used in the pa st month -both of which were estimated using the MBHS Task 1 survey. We then divided this by the average price per gram of marijuana to estimate the average number of grams used per day. Our calculations yielded an average daily use of: 0.17 grams consumed by regular users and 0.32 grams consumed by heavy users. By contrast, estimates from Kilmer et al. (2013) were much higher: 0.67 grams and 1.6 grams, respectively. One explanation for the difference is that marijuana potency may have increased between 201 3 and 2017, such that consuming fewer grams now achieves the same effect as in 2013. Another possibility is that our estimate of the price per gram of marijuana was inaccurate. Our estimate combines information on black market and RMD pricing. If MBHS Task 1 survey respondents paid less per gram than we estimated, this would then result in higher estimates that may be more in line with Kilmer et al. (2013). To account for the uncertainty in average marijuana grams consumed each day of use, we varied the mod el estimate for use between the MBHS Task 1 survey estimate and the estimate from Kilmer et al. (2013). Regulatory Oversight Our model suggests that within the first two years of retail sales, the cost of regulatory oversight will be offset by revenue ge nerated from application fees and fines collected by the CCC. However, our analyses of regulatory costs incurred by other states that have legalized retail sales show a great deal of variability in the cost of regulating marijuana, even after accounting fo r differences in population size and number of RMDs. In Washington (which has approximately 100 marijuana dispensaries29), we estimated total regulatory costs to be $52,638 per dispensary per year, whereas in Colorado (which has approximately 371 marijuana dispensaries30), the corresponding estimate was $31,945. There are, however, notable differences in regulatory operations between states. For example, following legalization of adult use of marijuana in Washington in 2012, the state did not create a new reg ulatory agency but rather incorporated cannabis regulation under the state's LCB. Given that Massachusetts will have a separate regulatory body \u2014the CCC \u2014rather than incorporating cannabis regulation under the state's LCB, Massachusetts may incur additional costs not included 29 Based on data from https://www.marijuanadoctors.com/medical -marijuana -dispensaries/WA . -licensed -facilities . 258 in the estimates from Washington. Additionally, at the time of legalizing retail marijuana, Washington did not have a robust medical marijuana law or medical dispensaries prior to the legalization of adult use of marijuana (even though m edical marijuana had been legal in Washington since 1998).31 Medical marijuana became more formally regulated in Washington in 2015, requiring a second wave of regulatory work to incorporate medical use under the LCB. Data from Washington show that 55% of regulatory costs incurred within the first two years of legalization were associated with rulemaking, licensure, and enforcement; spending on health and social service programs accounting for another 38% of costs. In Washington, these costs totaled $105,2 50 per year after start -up, whereas in Colorado, the cost ranged from $164,634 to $172,031 per year. In our model, we considered as regulatory costs any recurring law enforcement activities at the state and local level, including employee blood testing for individuals suspected of driving under the influence as well as administrative, legal, and judicial costs associated with suspended or revoked licenses. We estimated these costs by translating the range of estimates from Washington and Colorado to Massach usetts on a per capita basis. Because of a lack of data, we did not attempt to factor regulatory costs at the local level into our model. We learned through a stakeholder interview that local governments in Washington struggled to keep up with ongoing re gulatory changes, which required several staff dedicated to monitoring these changes. Although local governments initially absorbed start -up costs required to regulate businesses locally, eventually the fees they collected on licenses ended up covering the costs of regulating businesses locally. Based on information from the CCC,32 we anticipate that the Marijuana Regulation Fund that the CCC establishes could cover much of the costs of education and prevention as well as municipal police training. The exper t we interviewed also indicated that the main factor differentiating local regulatory costs in Washington, from one city to another, is whether the city focuses on marijuana production or on retail sales. For producers (which are largely located in rural a reas), primary costs involve odor and environmental issues surrounding waste disposal and wastewater. For retailers (which are more concentrated in urban areas), age compliance and traceability have been major sources of concern that have added costs. Also , rural towns \u2014which were more likely to ban marijuana retail sales \u2014incurred costs associated with lawsuits by businesses wanting to open an RMD. Law Enforcement Our modest projected reductions of law enforcement costs reflect a two -thirds decrease in marijuana arrests in the years preceding legalization of retail sales.33 Because few 31https://www.doh.wa.gov/YouandYourFamily/Marijuana/MedicalMarijuana/LawsandRu les/HistoryinWashi ngton . 32 https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter94G/Section14 . 33 According to data supplied to the authors by the Massa chusetts Department of Corrections, the number of cases charged with a marijuana governing offense declined from 975 in 2010 to 336 in 2014. 259 people currently enter the criminal justice system for marijuana offenses, further decreases in incarcerations will have little effect on statewide expenditures. However, this estimate is subject to a few limitations. First, it is difficult to obtain reliable data on individuals charged with marijuana offenses who are also charged with other, more serious crimes. It is possible that sentence lengths assigned to this group wi ll be reduced when marijuana sales are legally permitted, further reducing costs. Second, some law enforcement officials in Massachusetts and elsewhere are skeptical of findings that marijuana legalization reduces vehicular crashes and express concern abou t increases in the incidence of driving under the influence of marijuana (Migoya, 2017; stakeholder interview). If these concerns are borne out, traffic fatalities will represent an increase rather than a decrease in expenditures. Also, there may be other benefits that manifest from reducing the proportion of the population incarcerated for marijuana -related crimes. However, such benefits are challenging to quantify, given a lack of evidence, and they may take longer than two years to be realized. With res pect to impaired driving, our model included an estimated decrease in motor vehicle fatalities attributed to adult use of marijuana legalization. There is some evidence of increases in THC blood concentrations among drivers after adult use legalization tha t could also contribute to increases in non -fatal motor vehicle crashes. For example, a report from Washington that analyzed trends over time before and after adult use of marijuana legalization found that the proportion of drivers testing positive for THC was fairly constant before and immediately after adult use legalization took effect, but that beginning approximately 9 months after adult use legalization took effect, the proportion began to increase substantially at a rate of 9.7% per year (Tefft, Arno ld, & Grabowski, 2016). In addition, the law enforcement communities in Colorado and Washington have expressed anecdotal concerns that marijuana is increasing both fatal - and non -fatal motor vehicle crashes (Migoya, 2017). Because these studies did not meet our causal evidence guidelines, we did not include estimates from them in our model. Finally, although our model factored in a start -up cost of $655,000 in Massachusetts (based on stakeholder input) for Drug Recognition Expert and Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement officer training, data from Washington indicate that the costs could be much higher. The Washington State Patrol spent $2.1 million on employee training on cannabis impaired driving, which accounts for 77% of the increase in law e nforcement costs attributed to marijuana legalization within the first five years. Additional costs may be incurred for driving campaigns and other public safety messaging. Public Health Our supplemental model added projected fiscal impacts due to public health impacts of legalizing adult use of marijuana. We estimate that revenue and savings related to public health impacts will account for about 23% of the total budgetary gains projected because of legalization, based on our supplemental model. The adde d budgetary gain in our supplemental model mainly comes from projected increases in worker 260 productivity (which would generate increases in individual income tax revenue) among older adults with debilitating medical conditions that are well controlled with marijuana (Nicholas & Maclean, 2016) . We assumed that these productivity gains would be fully realized within the first two years of retail sales; if they span longer than two years, model estimates would need to be proportionally reduced. We also suspect that some of the productivity gains projected may have already been realized by the medical marijuana population. However, when we adjusted the population to which we applied the impact estimate (by subtracting out older medical marijuana patients, based o n data from MDPH), our impact estimate decreased by only 8% for older women and 4% for older men. Other public health savings (for example, due to reduced spending by the state on the MassHealth program to cover prescription drugs for fee -for-service bene ficiaries) are expected to account for only 3% of the supplemental model estimate. Decreases in Medicaid prescription drug spending, estimated by Bradford and Bradford (2017), were based on treatment for medical conditions that medical marijuana is used to treat, including depression and psychosis. That is, we project that some individuals will use marijuana in lieu of prescription medications to treat these conditions. Because of a lack of information on how spending might change because of marijuana legal ization, our model did not account for changes in spending associated with inpatient, outpatient, or emergency treatment \u2014it was limited to prescription spending alone. It is also important to note that our model projects impacts only out to two years, and that the health effects associated with marijuana use could have a much longer latency, possibly taking decades before the full extent of benefits or harms would be seen. Projected savings of roughly $980,000 due to decreases in opioid addiction treatme nt were offset by projected spending amounting to $1.1 million due to increases in cannabis addiction treatment. For both sets of costs, we focused only on the costs of treatment admissions incurred by the state. However, many individuals with drug addicti on or dependence do not seek treatment; instead, costs incurred by the state government for these individuals may be related to costs associated with overdoses and emergency room visits. Because of a lack of data, we did not incorporate non -treatment costs related to addiction/dependence in our model. Likewise, when we factored in the measure related to reductions in opioid -related deaths into our model, we only accounted for increases in income tax revenue. We did not account for reductions in other costs that may be incurred for opioid -related deaths, such as the cost of ambulatory treatment (which is covered by MassHealth) or mortuary costs (which are expected to be relatively small, given a $1,500 cap on MassHealth coverage for these costs). In our mode l, expected decreases in suicides among males age 20 to 39 accounted for less than 1% of expected public health savings. Although there have been anecdotal concerns that legalization of adult use of marijuana has led to an increase in suicides in Colorado and Washington, neither the literature nor state -level data we examined reflect this measure. For example, the most recent Colorado Violent Death Reporting System report noted an increase in the suicide rate in 2014 and 2015, although there were no 261 statist ically significant changes observed during this time period (Jamison, Mintz, Herndon, & Bol, 2017). Using data from this report, we calculated the change in suicide rate from the three -year period before legalization (2011 -2013) to the two year -period after legalization (2014 -2015) and noted a 6.25% increase in suicides over this time period. However, gi ven that the report itself found that these changes were not statistically significant, we did not include them in our model. Comparison with Previous Estimates Our model included estimates of sales tax revenue as well as revenues and costs realized in other domains. Although there are no comparable estimates of projected revenues and costs related to business and income tax revenue, public health, and criminal justice costs, we discuss below the differences between our estimates of projected sales tax r evenue and estimates from other states and from the DOR for Massachusetts. Our estimate of taxable retail marijuana sales was $748.7 million ($224.6 million in the first year and $524.1 million in the second). The second year estimate amounts to $745 per adult user, which is similar to second year estimates from Oregon ($675) and Washington ($818) but is substantially lower than the second year estimate for Colorado ($1,128).34 Differences across the states could be attributed to any or all of the following : Differences in the speed at which the programs are fully implemented . Because it takes new dispensaries one to two years to be fully operational in Massachusetts, retail marijuana sales may be limited at first, particularly in areas without RMDs. Howeve r, the fact that Massachusetts has a well -established medical marijuana program (unlike Washington at the time of retail marijuana legalization) and can learn from the experiences of other states with legalized use could hasten implementation of the adult use program. Differences in tourist sales volumes . Marijuana purchases by tourists to Colorado may have been substantially higher in the first two years of legalized adult use than they will be in Massachusetts. Colorado was the first state to implement an adult use program, and even now most of its bord ering states do not have medical marijuana programs. By contrast, Massachusetts borders two other states that have legalized adult marijuana use (Vermont and Maine), and all its bordering states have medical marijuana programs. 34 For comparability with retail sales estimates in Massachusetts and in Oregon (calculated by dividing revenue esti mates from http://www.oregon.gov/DOR/programs/gov -research/Pages/research - marijuana.aspx by the 17% tax rate), we converted total sales revenue (which included me dical plus retail sales) in Colorado ( https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado -marijuana -sales -reports ) and Washington (Washington State LCB dashboard, n.d.) to retail sales revenue by subtracting the percentage of revenue due to medical sales, which we assumed would be equal to the percentage of total marijuana users (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUHsaeSpecificStates2016A/NSDUHsaeSpecificStat es2016.htm ) that in tax rates . The 17% sales plus excise tax rate in Massachusetts is lower than the rate of almost 30% in Colorado, and much lower than the rate of 44% in Washington. As a result, more of the total demand in Massachusetts could be met by RMDs, as opposed to the illicit m arket, resulting in higher sales volumes per user compared with other states. Our estimate of projected revenue collected through the maximum 20% tax rate in Massachusetts (assuming a maximum local tax of 3%) is substantially lower than estimates produced by the Massachusetts DOR. We estimate that the state will collect almost $105 million in tax revenue from $524 million in sales; the DOR report projects roughly $205 million in revenue from $1.1 billion in sales, after adjusting to the increase from a 12% to a 20% tax rate (Joint Committee on Marijuana Policy, 2017).35,36 However, the difference is reduced by roughly one -third when we compare the DOR estimate to the estimate from our sensitivity analysis that uses the Task 1 survey's estimate of prevalence o f current marijuana use. The difference between our estimate and the DOR estimate is primarily due to the DOR applying per capita sales estimates from the third year of legalized use in Colorado and Washington (which saw nearly 50% and 70% increases betw een years two and three, respectively) to the second year of legalization in Massachusetts, believing that Massachusetts will have a shorter implementation period because the state has the benefit of learning from the experiences in Colorado and Washington . If Massachusetts second -year sales approach third -year levels from those other states, our model may underestimate this component of the fiscal impacts of legalization. However, as noted above, the speed at which dispensaries are approved to begin retail sales across the state could limit the extent to which the state is able to ramp up sales. In Massachusetts, we project that the revenue in the second year will more than double the first year's revenue. For comparison, the second year's revenue nearly do ubled in Colorado and nearly tripled in Washington compared to the first year. Limitations Our models exclude a number of potential impacts of adult use of marijuana legalization that do not have supporting casual evidence to link the impact to marijuana laws and policies. For example, we do not have sufficient information on the impacts of legalization on a number of public health outcomes, including spending related to 35 The Massachusetts DOR estimates $128 million of tax revenue collected on $1.07 billion in taxable sales based on a 12% total tax rate (including sales, excise, and local taxes). In a sensitivity analysis, they estimate $237 million of tax revenue collected on $1.018 billion in sales assuming a total tax rate of 23.25%. Based on these estimates, we calculate that the DOR estimate would be roughly $205 million in tax revenue with a total tax rate of 20%. 36 The Massachusetts DOR report cites two reports with esti mates that were lower than its own - a Tax Foundation Report (estimating $747 million in taxable sales based on a 15% tax rate) and a study by the Massachusetts Special Senate Committee on Marijuana (estimating $500 million in taxable sales) - and a third report with an estimate that was similar to their own (a study by ArcView Market Research estimating $1.07 billion in taxable sales in 2020). 263 emergency room or urgent care visits and the prevalence of low birth weight, obesity, tobacco use or nicotine dependence, and non -fatal vehicular crashes. We also did not include changes in spending related to poison control center costs because the changes were estimated to be quite small. It is possible that adult use of marijuana legalization could lead to changes in marijuana consumption that would in turn affect these and oth er public health outcomes. Finally, we did not factor in potential spending related to increases in energy or water use related to marijuana growth and production. Second, because literature on adult use of marijuana is sparse, our model estimates rely mai nly on the medical marijuana literature. That is, we assumed that changes observed when migrating from no legal marijuana to medical marijuana would be similar to changes observed when migrating from medical marijuana to adult use of marijuana. Ideally, ca usal impacts taken from the literature would reflect the impacts of shifting from a medical marijuana market to a market that includes medical and broader adult use of marijuana. The limited studies on adult use of marijuana legalization have not found sta tistically significant impacts from the expansion of medical marijuana to broader adult use. However, a recently published study provides additional evidence that supports our strategy to use medical marijuana impact estimates. Powell, Pacula, & Jacobson ( 2015) found that the relationship between medical marijuana laws and the reduction in opioid deaths is influenced by the type of medical marijuana laws that states implemented. They found that opioid deaths decreased only in states in which marijuana dispe nsaries were easily available to patients. In Massachusetts, the medical marijuana program is more tightly regulated than in other states, and the state has fewer legal medical marijuana patients per 1,000 people than many other states that have legalized medical marijuana. Moreover, the number of qualifying conditions for medical marijuana use in Massachusetts is fewer than those in other states and does not include chronic pain, which is a qualifying condition in 13 of the states that have legalized medic al marijuana (ProcCon, 2017). Therefore, the impact of marijuana legalization in Massachusetts may not be fully realized prior to adult use legalization, and the impact of medical marijuana policies in states with more liberal guidelines may provide insigh t into the expected impact of adult use legalization in Massachusetts. A third potential limitation of our model is that we assumed that each input metric acts independently of other metrics; therefore, we did not account for the correlations between metri cs in our model. It is analytically feasible to incorporate relationships between metrics into the impact estimates, for example, by factoring in the price elasticity of demand to see how marijuana use changes as pricing changes. Finally, it is not clear whether the impacts projected from our model will sustain beyond the two -year time frame. Most of the impacts in our model can be considered one -time (but not necessarily immediate) shifts as a result of legalization. For example, we may not expect marijua na-related arrests to further decrease beyond the two -year time frame, nor do we expect the start -up costs of establishing the regulatory framework to persist. However, impacts on consumption and associated public health outcomes may take longer to realize because they depend on market prices, the accessibility of dispensaries, and other factors that are associated with a high degree of uncertainty. 264 Directions for Future Research The MBHS provides a valuable baseline understanding of the impacts of lega lization in Massachusetts and serves as a benchmark to improve the implementation of marijuana legalization in other states. In this report, we synthesize information from a number of sources to provide projections that serve as a reference to compare to t he actual experience in Massachusetts as the program unfolds. Such a comparison can be used to better understand the factors driving the fiscal impacts of adult use of marijuana and to project future impacts beyond the first two years of legalization. Our analysis should also help the state and localities anticipate what resources may be needed to roll out the adult use program. 265 References Anderson, D. M., Hansen, B., & Rees, D. I. (2013).

Briefly, these protocols describe evaluating dispensed products for contaminants and cannabinoid content, inclusive of evaluating finished (dried) plant material, cannabis resin, and cannabis concentrates. As some of these products (e.g., oils and resins) are tested and later incorporated into marijuana -infused products (MIPs) intended for use as edi bles (e.g., capsules, brownies, candy, etc.), or various personal care products (e.g., tinctures, lotions, suppositories, etc.), a marijuana -containing product may undergo multiple rounds of product testing before it is dispensed. Marijuana products of a similar variety are generally priced according to the cannabinoid content. In August 2017 Registere d Marijuana Dispensaries in Massachusetts were asked to complete a voluntary survey of retail marijuana prices to inform the economic and fiscal analyses being conducted as part of the MBHS. This appendix describes an overview of the cannabinoid content and price of medical marijuana products that were avail able through the DPH Medical Use of Marijuana Program. As these medical marijuana products were likely to be very similar in composition to the types of products available in adult -use marketplace, an earlier draft of the information provided in this Appendix was used to inform various analyses in the MBHS. A s such, a summary of the cannabinoid con tent and price of retail medical marijuana products available in Massachusetts over the period of May 14, 2015 through Dece mber 31, 2018 is included here as A ppendix D. Cannabinoid Content Summary Marijuana products that are dispensed for medical use i n Massachusetts must bear a label that identifies the percentage (by dry weight) of 9 -tetrahydrocannnabinol (9 - THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinoids, 9 -THC is the primary psych oactive component and cannabidiol (CBD) is the primary non -psychoactive component of cannabis. While regulating the sale and use of medical marijuan a in Massachusetts , DPH has evaluated over 15,000 laboratory reports, describing over 14,500 medical marijuana products, from thirteen different medical marijuana facilities. These reports have been voluntary submitted to DPH and describe the laboratory testing of flower products (44.6%), MIPs (27.0%), and concentrates, such as resin (3.7%), oil s (19.5%), shatter (3.0%), or wax (2.2%). Of these laboratory reports, a total of 12,375 describe an evaluation of cannabinoid profile testing that describes levels of : 9- tetrahydrocannnabinol 9-THC), (CBDa). The types of products tested for cannabinoids include flower products (37.2% ), concentrates (29.4%) , and MIPs ( 33.3%; see Figure 1). Table 1 describes the 320 cannabinoid testing results for flower, concentrates and MIPs . The cannabinoid Delta ()9-THC was detected in 93.3% of flower products, 98.6% of concentrate, and 95.2% of MIPs. The cannabinoid THCa was detected in 99.6% of flower products, 67.2% of concentrates, and 17.0% of MIPs. The cannabinoid CBD was detected i n 27.9% of flower products, 56.6% of concentrates, and 33.1% of MIPs. The cannabinoid CBDa was detected in 50.3% of flower products, 53.2% of concentrates, and 7.1% of MIPs. The cannabinoid content of the available products is shown in Table 2. Of the 4 ,605 flower s amples tested, THCa concentrations were most often between 14 -28%. Approximately 5% of flower samples had THCa concentrations gre ater than 28%. CBDa was rarely detected in flower samples , and never at a concentration greater than 28%. The maj ority of flower samples (43.6%) , had THCa levels between 14 and 21%. Of the 3642 concentrate samples tested, the majority (38.2%) had THC co ncentrations between 60 and 80% . Approximately, 15.4% of concentrate samples had THC concentrations greater than 80%, w hile only 0.6% had CBD concentrations greater than 80%. Retail Price Summary A summary of the price of retail marijua na products available at 11 of the 12 open and operating RMD locations in August of 2017 is shown in Table 4. Similar products across various RMDs were combined to provide an overview and summary (e.g., same product types) using the RMD retail price survey found in Figure 2. The p roduct 's dose of THC (in milligrams ) was calculated for any product with a dose presented as a percen tage, using the product net weight (i.e., dose percentage multiplied by product net weight). 321 Reference Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), 2016.

Itemized prices are most useful but a price range may additionally be provided to capture market variability and other closely related products. Appendix C: 2015 -2016 Cohort Patient -Reported Negative Effects Note: Word choice and spellings have been retained as written by respondent to avoid inadvertent mischaracterization of intent. Brackets have been used to explain words redacted to prevent individual identification or for other reasons. Negative effects are broken down negative effect type , and by negative effect score rating. Access -Related Issues No Score Can use cannabis as in a group home Travel to get the product 1: No Negative Effects none, other than difficulty/inconvenience in accessing medical ca nnabis I have to ride 3 to 3 1/2 hours one way for my medicine because there are none in southwest Minnesota. The only issue is the distance I need to travel to get it if I don't take into account the cost I have to ride 3 to 3 1/2 hours one way for my med icine because there are none in southwest Minnesota. the only negative effect i have experienced is when i had to find a Doctor that would certify me. All my health care providers were told not to participate in the cannabis program. Finally my Doctor wa s able to certify me. Also the self exam questions when getting the medical cannabis from the dispensary are useless. Locations of dispensaries. We have to drive from [CITY] to the cities. 2 Travel to pick up my prescription. Difficulty accessing medical cannibis Time consuming to order, drive and pick up medicine. unable to use outside of the state of MN. 3 Physically having to pick up medication by myself 4 The fact that my son's home care nursing staff is not permitted to ad minister PRN or scheduled Medical Cannabis is a difficult component at times. Driving so far away to get meds. And [CANNABIS PATIENT CENTER] not being open as much!!! H E A D E R R E P E A T S F R O M P A G E 2 O N W A R D 2 7: Great Deal of Negative Effects Distance.... DISTANCE. Physical Negative Effects No Sc ore tired Did not like inhaling the cannabis. Irritated my lungs. a moderate dry mouth. seizures worsened but unsure if completelly related to medical canibis 1: No Negative Effects Dry mouth , and too many trips to the fridge some nausea after capsule f orm. I experience fatigue but that is a plus because I had problems sleeping at night because of pain. it seems to help with that sleep Cotton mouth! Stomach upset only when not taken with food. slight fatigue Mild drowsiness Do you feel a little tired at times . Sometimes my mouth can become dry, but it's fine if I'm hydrated. 2 Had a bad reaction to oil suspension, this was corrected by adjusting dosage Initial increase in seizures We noticed the combination of CBD/THC worse ned seizures for [PATIENT]. CBD also seems to be upsetting on her stomach with changes/increases in dosing. Getting chest colds from vape pen. e-cig- too much inhaled caused excessive coughing and vomiting. more small seizures sore throat fatigue Yes ~ In the morning I have to be careful with my blood pressure. It does lower it a bit. I have to watch my fluid intake because of my cathing schedule. Plus I already have low blood pressure in the morning. This lowers it a bit. I'm finding I need to drink Gat orade and get up a bit slower and then I'm fine. But out all the benefits this side effect is so minor and manageable. I could go into the crazy cost, the monthly travel time from [CITY] and having others pick it up for you without having to pay for anothe r background H E A D E R R E P E A T S F R O M P A G E 2 O N W A R D 3 check when the company they work for through you already did one. I shouldn't have to pay for another PCA criminal background study for a current PCA that works for me. That is redundant request. Suggestions: Could there be a 3 month supply gi ven instead of a 30 day supply? This would eliminate some winter driving months, gas money and for people who are suffering in pain (dying of cancer or children having seizures) it's so hard for them to travel. Some days even hard for them to get out of be d or eat. I wish people understood. I wish people would be more compassionate. People hurting ~ suffering are willing to pay for this with in reason, travel within reason and doctors are willing to come on board but without fear (so I don't blame them). I do not feel it's fair to ask a question on negative effects of a drug without asking the positive and negative effects of the process too! I am only one voice but today please allow me to be the voice of many...

Sometime s the cannabis in oral liquid makes me a little queasy. I have gastroparesis with a stomach implant. I found when taking the heather solution it caused constipation. Like to rest a moment after vaping a dose.... but just time my day accordingly. The vap ing can cause congestion, and you already have that going on because of the Chemo. Some fatigue, but it's once you have been up and moving, so it's not so bad that it causes you to rest from time to time. It's hard to know if mental clouding is caused fro m the chemo or the cannabis. However it's not enough to be alarmed. Very sleepy if I don't go to bed in a timely matter after my evening dose.

And since there is no raw flower available to purchase, I'm stuck with a sore throat.

Mental Negative Effects No Score b in the que stion below 1: No Negative Effects Anxiety increases on occasion. None -just cloudiness sometimes felt buzzed twice 2 The most irritating part of the program is we have to do oil. I have never liked oil because it makes my short term memory a little worse and gives me mental clouding. It's not that big of a problem but I get annoyed if I forget something or I'm not thinking at my full ability. I had never had any negative side effects when I smoked the plants buds. In my experience oils good if you wa nt to get high. But for treating crohns smoking the plants buds are better. This is because bud contains other chemicals than just thc or cbd that help with crohns while oil doesn't. This rule makes absolutely no sense. I understand that this was made law because someone who was ignorant in regards to cannabis thought \"\"vaping oil\"\" sounded better th an \"\"smoking bud\" But please please please fix this stupid law and let me treat my crohns with no negative side effects again. H E A D E R R E P E A T S F R O M P A G E 2 O N W A R D 8 The fact that the oil makes me t oo high, mellows me out too much; regular cannabis lets me function on a normal level I need to time my dosage at night so I don't feel groggy in morning. Some decrease in motivation. Generally makes me feel lousy. I couldn't function even with a small dos e. Slight memory loss (short -term memory) Very rarely happens, but losing train of thought when making a point. Now practicing my own \"tickler techniques\" to get my thought pattern quickly back on track. The high, it's not bad but I only use at night just a couple of times feeling high. At first, I had to try the different cbd/thc formulas. There were some times when I felt confused or lightheaded. Now, I know what blend to take to address my symptoms and I've figured out which delivery method works best for me. Now I have almost no negative effects. Would prefer not feeling altered and sometimes vapor pen doesn't seem to be releasing and I take in more than planned - very short term impact. At first it made my head feel a little funny, but very quickl y that has gone away and having less pain has been a huge improvement. I have many more good days. nothing significant noticed. maybe some slight \"\"mental cloudiness\"\" but not every time and very mild Getting stupid. Short term memory loss. Forgetfulness/L osing train of thought Some confusion using the cbd oil, at times I have felt out of it. 3 Makes me lazy. I cannot take any cannabis with THC in it. Must take only pure cannabis. With the THC I get anxiety. With out is everything is good depression Loss of judgment. In the beginning he seemed very lethargic, now that is better but [PATIENT] still has lack of appetite often Makes me feel rather lazy - I try to use that to my advantage and catch up on some sleep or to relax. unmotivated, subdued, weak and tired if too much THC - still trying to find that right balance Unable to drive for four hours after taking . Not being able to drive when using the cannabis Some mental clouding for about 2 hours H E A D E R R E P E A T S F R O M P A G E 2 O N W A R D 9 mental clouding mental fog Some cognition fog that seems to decrease with time.

Which effects my work....however it helps with my intense pain & migraines, which is why i wanted to take it.. It has added to my cognitive confusion/fibro brain symptoms at times. It does a really good job of masking the pain I get from physical exertion which has been a downside because then I've over -done at time s which then has added to my fatigue and exhaustion and pain. Prior to the MM, my pain was my greatest problem. Now that the pain has been managed to a better extent, I now am dealing with overwhelming fatigue and exhaustion a lot of the time. Balancing previous existing mental health issues. If I use enough to better \"control\" pain, I can get paranoid. It can also cause urinary retention, but other times, it helps me to go. I do not feel like myself Anxiety, chills, sometimes fatigue and/or confusion, sore throat/coughing from vaporizer High feeling increased sedation, lightheadedness social anxiety not wanting to be around people when I'm on the medicine makes me loopy Small amount of paranoia High feeling Uncooperative I've felt depressed and sad and wanting to be in the dark liking it to be very silent and also not wanting to be around others. I'm not effective or efficient when I'm using canabis. I'm awake, but impaired. When I've had to use different things in the past like opioids, I'm ineffect ive, but I'm usually asleep the whole time. Being awake and impaired, I spend a lot of time confused and unable to follow conversations, read or watch TV. Canabis doesn't make me sleepy.

I wish it was covered by insu rance. Our insurance premiums are so high and then the additional cost for this just puts us up over the edge in costs...which depresses me.

Some want the canbabis glowered bud to consume in smoking or edibles extracted from the cannabis buds. The price. cost The cost of the medicine. The extract version of the cannabis plant is definitely more potent than loose leaf cannabis. However, the introduction of lower cost leaf cannabis would help patients afford the medicine. The cost of the ca nnabis and it NOT at all whatsoever being covered by insurance it is medicine just as any other medicine. none just cost The cost Cost cost! None beyond funding. the cost of medication is high for someone out of pocket with out insurance paying for it None,no negative effects .,only the cost has been a factor as it is not covered by medical insurance and it is too much money and is hard to afford. cost Besides cost , nothing is negative. 2 The cost for a young person.

Negative Attitudes Toward Medical Cannabis Use 1: No Negative Effects the only negative effect i have experienced is when i had to find a Doctor that would certify me. All my health care providers were told not to participate in the cannabis program. Finally my Doctor was able to certify me. Also the self exam questions when getting the medical can nabis from the dispensary are useless. what other people would think if they know - so I don't tell them The only negative impact would be not telling anyone what is turning my health around because of the views of some people with cannabis. Poor recept ion to cannibis at [HOSPITAL]. Serious lack of staff knowledge and support. 2 The nay -sayers tire me out. Two [HOSPITAL] employees (my sister/aunt of my son and a [HOSPITAL] doctor friend of our family) insisted that there is no proof that medical cannab is helps. \"You might as well give your son dirt\". Was a comment I heard from the [HOSPITAL] MD friend. I typically, patiently, point out that our son is on 4'heavy duty anti seizure medicines, has been most of his life, that can't be increased due to il l effects, has a VNS, yet is still slammed to the ground, on to his face, from seizures many times a day, or can't breath for up to 30 seconds during a tonic seizure. So are we not to try anything that might help?! Now, 3 -months in to starting medical ca nnabis, I can show anyonemwho,asks how,it is,going his seizure diary, where there are far fewer entries for daily seizures. Just a glance at my son's monthly calendar these past 3 H E A D E R R E P E A T S F R O M P A G E 2 O N W A R D 13 months tells it all. Is medical cannabis perfect? No, it is not as fast a cting as anti seizure mess (for those that work), it is a very slow process, ramping up the oil, trying to get it just right. The beauty of medical cannabis is that we are seeing no negative side effects! No shortening of his QT waves, no lowered white b lood cell counts, no rage and attacks on family. Just a slow improvement on seizures, making all of our lives so much easier. People laugh when I tell them I'm trying Medical Marijuana. No one believes it can help they believe it's only recreation. The o nly people that understand are people like me that have run out of options. Public opinion. Stigma of MJ I have only shared that I use cannibas to very few people. One person shared her (negative) opinion. I let go of her. The only negative effect is the possible stigma that I face from using, what most people consider, a drug. Getting over the stigma of marijuana use in society. I.E. Some family members don't approve. 3 New neighbors felt that it wasn't right for anyone to used medical cannabis. 4 Care providers, other than my registered provider, that are apprehensive to participate in the program. Lack of education, wide spread communication in the medical community regarding the benefits and laws regarding medical cannabis in MN. Medical communi ties (hospitals) need to be educated on medical cannabis. We were not allowed to bring into the hospital embarrassment taking treatment with others around. 5 People saying that I am on drugs Doctors dont wanna treat medical cannabis patients. Cost.

So I a m having a hard time giving up my street pot. Maybe if they add more so it can last longer it leaves so quickly even if I measure the time. A negative impact of having only THC and CBD products is that they aren't as effective as natural whole plant cannab is. 2 Not fully effective Seizures cluster after 7 days or so and she gets tired too. Inconsistency of seizure activity. It took several tries to find an appropriate dosage and combination to work at minimizing tics. It has not helped the increased ammonia level [PATIENT] has had the past few years. With the direction of his neurologist, we are currently weaning off one of his seizure medications, depakote, which he has been taking for 26 years!

I also had a Warning of illegal drug use in a urine test from the so called pain clinic I'm required to go to by [CLINIC] By my now ex primary Dr of 20 years. I told the pain clinic when I signed contract not to use illegal drugs that I took cannabis by prescription in medical form thru Dept of Health etc. The Dr said OK, as long as it wasn't in organic form for smoking! He said I was the 1st patient at [CLINIC] to be on legal cannabis. I advised him, I maybe to 1st but surely not the last patient. They said this will be resolved ok but I still was warned for illegal thc drug use, which is upsetting but it will be straightened out. Thank u!! The stick does not always work I have sciatica nerve pain, and don't get as much pain relief for that. Also, it is hard to get the dosages down right so that a steady stream of it stays in your system. I mainly use the gel caps. No help with seizures. As an adult with muscle spasms I need [HIGH CBD PRODUCT] or maybe even [HIGH CBD PRODUCT], I would like to have a broader range of treatments on the CBD CBD range. I understand that this is more for children, but vaporizer for adults would be wonderful. I can not take pills due to stomach problems. I do have vaporizers to help wit h pain, sleeping issues due to spasms. Please consider more CBD CBD VAPORIZERS for adults. Some negative ONLY because of the MCT, not the cannabis it self! Why do they add such an expensive product like (MCT) to something when it could be more reasonably priced without it??? I had to really do my research on MCT to know what this awful stuff can do. There is blog after blog with people complaining about MCT. There are people out there that have not done their research and think it is the cannabis. It is really too bad because they could really benefit from the cannabis without the MCT. Again it would be cheaper without the MCT in it. Variations in batches.

Benefits Reported on the Patient Self -Evaluation: Patients with First Enrollment July 2015 -June 2017 Summary Of patients included on the standard 8 symptom analysis (n = 6924 ), more than half experienced moderate to severe symptoms at baseline on al l measures except for nausea (49%) and vomiting ( 23%). Of patients experiencing moderate to severe symptoms at baseline , anywhere between 33% and 66 % achieved at least a 30% reduction in symptom severity (symptom improvement) within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase. The lowest proportion of patients reporting symptom improvements in the initial 4 -month period were for pain (33%) and fatigue (44 %) symptoms, while the greatest proportion of patients reporting symptom im provement s were for vomiting (66%), nausea (60%), depression (59%), and lack of appetite (58 %) symptoms. Similarly, a smaller proportion of patients were able to maintain those symptom improvements in the following 4 -months for pain (41 %) and fatigue (50%) symptoms compared to all other sym ptoms (maintained anywhere by 56% -66% of patients) . Benefits Reported on the Patient Self -Evaluation : Patients with First Enrollment July 2015 -June 2017 The patient self -evaluation is required for patients to complete prior to each medical cannabis purchase. It includes questions to assess symptom severity, some of which are administered to all patients (standard set of 8 symptom measures) and some of whic h are tailored to symptoms for a given condition (condition -specific symptom measures). Since symptom data is collected prior to each patient's first medical cannabis purchase, symptom changes can be assess ed over time and compared to baseline ( baseline = patient responses to symptom questions just prior to their first medical cannabis purchase ). Standard 8 Symptom Measures The standard 8 symptom mea sures that all patients receive are answered on a 0 -10 numerical rating scale (NRS), with 0 indicating absen ce of the symptom to 10 indicating that the symptom is as bad as the patient can imagine (see Box 1 ). Therefore, higher scores on these measures indicate poorer management of these symptoms. Patients are asked to rate symptom severity over the past 24 hour s. B E N E F I T S R E P O R T E D O N T H E P A T I E N T S E L F -E V A L U A T I O N : P A T I E N T S W I T H F I R S T E N R O L L M E N T J U L Y 2 0 1 5 -J U N E 2 0 1 7 2 Box 1 . Listing of the Standard 8 symptom measures that all patients answer, including the response options available to patients. To understand whether patients derived any symptom benefits during their participation in the program, the following two questions were explored for each Standard 8 symptom measure: QUESTION 1 Of those patients who experienced moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (score of 4 or higher at baseline), what percentage of them experienced at least a 30% improvement in symptoms within four months of their first medica l cannabis purchase? The thresh old of 30% reduction on a 0 -10 point scale was chosen because this threshold has been documented in clinical trials to represent clinically meaningful change - especially for pain reduction and spasticity reduction. Examples of 30% change include moving from a score of 10 to a score of 7, from 9 to 6, from 8 to 5, from 7 to 4, etc. QUESTION 2 If a patient achieved at least a 30% improvement on symptoms within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase (determined in Q uestion 1), what percentage of them will, on average, still maintain that level of improvement in the four months following that initial 30% symptom improvement? [Four -month follow -up period] Results on Standard 8 Symptom Measures See Table 1 for results. The third column display s the percentage and number of patients (out of 6924 patients) experiencing moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (baseline response 4) on a given Standard 8 measure. Fourth column represents answer to Question 1: percentage (and number) of moderate to severe scorers at baseline who achieved at least a 30% symptom improvement at any time within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase.

These include, among others, questions on seizure frequency for seizure patients, questi ons on spasm frequency for muscle spasm and ALS patients, and Crohn's activity in Crohn's patients. While patients received the same response options on the Standard 8 measures (respond from 1 -10 on a numerical rating scale), response options for conditio n- specific measure s varied as indic ated in Table 12 . All condition -specific measures were investigated within the same framework as the Standard 8 measures: 1) what percentage of patients achieved symptom improvement within the four months since their firs t medical cannabis purchase compared to their baseline responses, and 2) what percentage of those achieving symptom improvement showed general persistence in the 4 -month follow -up period. A summary of results are similarly presented in a table like those presented for the Standard 8 measure s (see Table 12 below). Table 12 .

However, rather than analyz ing for changes on the IOP test compared to a baseline IOP result, the se results are presented below as repor ted by the patien ts (see Table 13 ). All IOP test results represented to the left of the \"First Visit\" column indicate results from tests occurring prior to the patient's first medical cannabis purchase; everything to the right of that column are results occurring after the patient's first purchase. Column names refer to month in which the test was reported to occur prior to or after first purchase. Note that these results are not directly coming from the practitioner who administered the IOP test - reliance on patient documentation and/or me mory is a limitation in interpreting these results.

It is possible that patients report incorrect values and dates of testing. Importantly, reported data provides little or no insight into changes in glaucoma therapies or other medications during the period after medical cannabis initiation. And, though we have record of which products are purchased when, wi thout patient -level comparison of changes in product with changes in observed effect, we could miss differential impact of products. That analysis is beyond the scope of this report. With those caveats, we make the following summary observations. After ini tiating medical cannabis use, 23 of the 61 patients (38%) reported intraocular pressure measurements with a decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) 4 mm Hg in at least one eye, 18 (30%) reported no follow -up results in the year after medical cannabis initi ation, and 20 (33%) reported follow -up values with no decrease in IOP 4 mm Hg (three had IOP decrease = 3 mm Hg in one eye). Among the 23 showing a decrease in IOP 4 mm Hg, 17 reported more than one measurement during the year after following medical ca nnabis initiation. Among these 17 with multiple reported measurements, the 4 mm Hg decrease in IOP was present in the first reported post - initiation result for elevn (at months 1[x6], 2[x3], 3, and 4). In six patients, the 4 mm Hg decrease in IOP wasn't seen in initial reported result(s), but was present in a later result (at months 4, 5, 7, 8[x2], and 9). Among the six with only one post -initiation reported result, the 4 mm Hg decrease in IOP was seen at months 1, 2, 3[x2], 4, and 10. From these pattern s, it appears that if medical cannabis use results in decreased IOP, the timing of that effect varies considerably.

Benefits Reported on the Patient Self -Evaluation: Patients with First Enrollment July 2016 -June 2017 Summary Of patients included on the standard 8 symptom analysis (n = 5412), more than half experienced moderate to severe symptoms at baseline on all measures except for nausea (46%) and vomiting (20%). Of patients experiencing moderate to severe symptoms at basel ine, anywhere between 32% and 68% achieved at least a 30% reduction in symptom severity (symptom improvement) within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase. The lowest proportion of patients reporting symptom improvements in the initial 4 -month period were for pain (32%) and fatigue (45%) symptoms, while the greatest proportion of patients reportin g symptom improvements were for vomiting (68%), nausea (61%), depression (60%), and lack of appetite (59%) symptoms. Similarly, a smaller proportion of patients were able to maintain those symptom improvements in the following 4 -months for pain (40%) and fatigue (50%) symptoms compared to all other symptoms (maintained anywhere by 57% -69% of patients) . Benefits Reported on the Patient Self -Evaluation : Patients with First Enrollment July 2016 -June 2017 The patient self -evaluation is required for patients to complete prior to each medical cannabis purchase. It includes questions to assess symptom severity, some of which are administered to all patients (sta ndard set of 8 symptom measures) and some of which are tailored to symptoms for a given condition (condition -specific symptom measures). Since symptom data is collected prior to each patient's first medical cannabis purchase, symptom changes can be assess ed over time and compared to baseline ( baseline = patient responses to symptom questions just prior to their first medical cannabis purchase ). Standard 8 Symptom Measures The standard 8 symptom mea sures that all patients receive are answered on a 0 -10 numerical rating scale (NRS), with 0 indicating absence of the symptom to 10 indicating that the symptom is as bad as the patient can imagine (see Box 1 ). Therefore, higher scores on these measures indicate poorer management of thes e symptoms. Patients are asked to rate symptom severity over the past 24 hours.

Listing of the Standard 8 symptom measures that all patients answer, including the response options available to patients. Standard 8 Symptom Measures: Anxiety; Lack of appetite; Depression; Disturbed Sleep; Fatigue; Vomiting Response Options (0 -10 Numerical Rating Scale): 0 = Symptom not present; 10 = Symptom as bad as one can imagine To understand whether patients derived any symptom benefits during their participation in the program, the following two questions were explored for each Standard 8 symptom measure: QUESTION 1 Of those patients who experienced moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (score of 4 or higher at baseline), what percent age of them experienced at least a 30% improvement in symptoms within four months of their first medical cannabis purchase? The thresh old of 30% reduction on a 0 -10 point scale was chosen because this threshold has been documented in clinical trials to re present clinically meaningful change - especially for pain reduction and spasticity reduction. Examples of 30% change include moving from a score of 10 to a score of 7, from 9 to 6, from 8 to 5, from 7 to 4, etc. QUESTION 2 If a patient achieved at least a 30% improvement on symptoms within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase (determined in Question 1), what percentage of them will, on average, still maintain that level of improvement in the four months following that initial 30% symptom impr ovement? [Four -month follow -up period] To address Question 1 the following procedure was adopted for each standard 8 measure: all patients who scored 4 or higher at baseline were identified as those experiencing moderate to severe symptoms, and all standa rd 8 responses that were submitted within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase were retained. From this dataset, each patient's standard 8 responses were compared to their baseline response over time. The first instance a patient achieved at least a 30% symptom improvement was recorded, effectively demonstrating when - during the first 4 months following their first medical cannabis purchase - the patient achieved symptom improvement, if at all. Calculating the percentage of patients who achie ved 30% symptom improvement within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase (Question 1) was done in two ways. In one method, the number of patients who achieved 30% symptom improvement within 4 months B E N E F I T S R E P O R T E D O N T H E P A T I E N T S E L F -E V A L U A T I O N : P A T I E N T S W I T H F I R S T E N R O L L M E N T J U L Y 2 0 1 6 -J U N E 2 0 1 7 3 was divided by the total number of patients that ever made a first purchase (patients with baseline PSE data). In the other method, the number of patients achieving 30% symptom improvement within 4 months was divided by patients who had submitted add itional PSE data (beyond their baseline response ) within 4 months of their first purchase. The denominator in the former method includes all patients who made a first purchase (all patients with a baseline PSE submission), while the latter method effectively restricts the dominator to those patients who submitted additional PSE symptom data following their baseline submission and within 4 months of their first purchase. Therefore, the former method allows for a more conservative estimation of symptom benefit. In the text of this report, we present result s using the former, more conservative estimate of benefit. Those who made no additional purchases after their first purchase may have discontinued use because of lack of effectiveness, though they may have discontinued use for other reasons as well (i.e., medical cannabis cost, side effects, etc.). Question 2 was addressed by observing all symptom responses in the four months following the time point when the patient first achieved 30% symptom improvement. For each patient, all symptom responses identifie d during those follow -up four months were ave raged together. Patients who, on average, still maintained at least a 30% symptom improvement from baseline were identified as those showing persistence in their symptom benefits. Results on Standard 8 Symptom Measures See Table 1 for results. The third column display s the percentage and number of patients (out of 5412 patients) experiencing moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (baseline response 4) on a given Standard 8 measure. Fourth column represents answer to Question 1: percentage (and number) of moderate to severe scorers at baseline who achieved at least a 30% symptom improvement at any time within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase . Fifth column shows the number of patients that had submitted symptom data during their designated 4 -mo follow -up period (4 month time window that followed their i nitial symptom improvement) . Symptom responses during this 4-mo time period were averaged together within each patient. The sixth column shows the percentage and number of patients who had achieved 30% symptom improvement that had - on average - maintaine d at least that level of improvement in the 4 -month follow -up period. Lastly, the seventh column shows the percentage of all patients who both achieved at least a 30% improvement in the first 4 months since their first medical cannabis purchase and maintai ned that improvement on average in the 4 -month follow -up period .

These include, among others, questions on seizure frequency for seizure patients, questions on s pasm frequency for muscle spasm and ALS patients, and Crohn's activity in Crohn's patients. While patients received the same response options on the Standard 8 measures (respond from 1 -10 on a numerical rating scale), response options for conditio n- specifi c measure s varied as indicated in Table 12 . All condition -specific measures were investigated within the same framework as the Standard 8 measures: 1) what percentage of patients achieved symptom improvement within the four months since their first medica l cannabis purchase compared to their baseline responses, and 2) what percentage of those achieving symptom improvement showed general persistence in the 4 -month follow -up period. A summary of results are similarly presented in a table like those presented for the Standard 8 measures (see Table 12 below). Table 12 .

However, rather than analyz ing for changes on the IOP test compared to a baseline IOP result, the se results are presented below as repor ted by the patients (see Table 13 ). All IOP test results represented to the left of the \"First Visit\" column indicate results from tests occurring prior to the patient's first medical cannabis purchase; everything to the right of that column are results occurring after the patient's first purchase. Column names refer to month in which the test was reported to occur prior to or after first purchase. N ote that these results are not directly coming from the practitioner who administered the IOP test - reliance on patient documentation and/or memory is a limitation in interpreting these results.

It is possible that patients report incorrect values and dates of testing. Importantly, reported data provides little or no insight into ch anges in glaucoma therapies or other medications during the period after medical cannabis initiation. And, though we have record of which products are purchased when, without patient -level comparison of changes in product with changes in observed effect, w e could miss differential impact of products. That analysis is beyond the scope of this report. With those caveats, we make the following summary observations. After initiating medical cannabis use, fifteen of the 40 patients (38%) reported intraocular pressure measurements with a decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) 4 mm Hg in at least one eye, 14 (35%) reported no follow -up results in the year after medical cannabis initiation, and 11 (28%) reported follow -up values with no decrease in IOP 4 mm Hg (three had IOP decrease = 3 mm Hg in one eye). Among the 15 showing a decrease in IOP 4 mm Hg, 11 reported more than one measurement during the year after followi ng medical cannabis initiation. Among these 11 with multiple reported measurements, the 4 mm Hg decrease in IOP was present in the first reported post - initiation result for six (at months 1[x3], 2[x2], and 3). In five patients, the 4 mm Hg decrease in IO P wasn't seen in initial reported result(s), but was present in a later result (at months 4, 5, 7, and 8 [x2]). Among the four with only one post -initiation reported result, the 4 mm Hg decrease in IOP was seen at months 3[x2], 4, and 10. From these patte rns, it appears that if medical cannabis use results in decreased IOP, the timing of that effect varies considerably.

Benefits Reported on the Patient Self -Evaluation: Patients with First Enrollment July 2015 -June 2016 Summary Of patients included on the standard 8 symptom analysis (n = 1512 ), more than half experienced moderate to severe symptoms at baseline on all measures except for vomiting (32%). Of patients experiencing moderate to severe symptoms at baseline , anywhere between 36% and 60% achieved at least a 30% reduction in symptom sev erity (symptom improvement) within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase. The lowest proportion of patients reporting symptom improvements in the initial 4 -month period were for pain (36%) and fatigue (40%) symptoms, while the greatest proporti on of patients reporting symptom im provements were for vomiting (60 %), depression (57 %), and nausea (56 %) symptoms. Similarly, a smaller proportion of patients were able to maintain those symptom improvements in the following 4 - months for pain (45%) and fa tigue (49 %) symptoms compared to all other symptom s (maintained anywhere by 52% -59% of patients) . Benefits Reported on the Patient Self -Evaluation: Patients with First Enrollment July 2015 -June 2016 The patient self -evaluation is required for patients to c omplete prior to each medical cannabis purchase. It includes questions to assess symptom severity, some of which are administered to all patients (standard set of 8 symptom measures) and some of which are tailored to symptoms for a given condition (conditi on-specific symptom measures). Since symptom data is collected prior to each patient's first medical cannabis purchase, symptom changes can be assess ed over time and compared to baseline ( baseline = patient responses to symptom questions just prior to their first medical cannabis purchase ). Standard 8 Symptom Measures The standard 8 symptom mea sures that all patients receive are answered on a 0 -10 numerical rating scale (NRS), with 0 indicating absence of the symptom to 10 indicating that the symptom is as bad as the patient can imagine (see Box 1 ). Therefore, higher scores on these measures indicate poorer management of these symptoms. Patients are asked to rate symptom severity over the past 24 hours.

Listing of the Standard 8 symptom measur es that all patients answer, including the response options available to patients. Standard 8 Symptom Measures: Anxiety; Lack of appetite; Depression; Disturbed Sleep; Fatigue; Vomiting Response Options (0 -10 Numerical Rating Scale): 0 = Symptom not present; 10 = Symptom as bad as one can imagine To understand whether patients derived any symptom benefits during their participation in the program, the following two questions were explored for each Standard 8 symptom measure: QUESTION 1 Of those patients who experienced moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (score of 4 or higher at baseline), what percentage of them experienced at least a 30% improvement in symptoms within four months of their first medical cannabis purchase ? The thresh old of 30% reduction on a 0 -10 point scale was chosen because this threshold has been documented in clinical trials to represent clinically meaningful change - especially for pain reduction and spasticity reduction. Examples of 30% change inc lude moving from a score of 10 to a score of 7, from 9 to 6, from 8 to 5, from 7 to 4, etc. QUESTION 2 If a patient achieved at least a 30% improvement on symptoms within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase (determined in Question 1), what pe rcentage of them will, on average, still maintain that level of improvement in the four months following that initial 30% symptom improvement? [Four -month follow -up period] Results on Standard 8 Symptom Measures See Table 1 for results. The third column display s the percentage and number of patients (out of 1,512 patients) experiencing moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (baseline response 4) on a given Standard 8 measure. Fourth column represents answer to Question 1: percentage (and number) of mode rate to severe scorers at baseline who achieved at least a 30% symptom improvement at any time within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase. Fifth column shows the number of patients that had submitted symptom data during their designated 4 -mo follow -up period (4 month time window that followed their initial symptom improvement) . Symptom responses during this 4 -mo time period were averaged together within each patient. The sixth column shows the percentage and number of patients who had achieved 30% B E N E F I T S R E P O R T E D O N T H E P A T I E N T S E L F -E V A L U A T I O N : P A T I E N T S W I T H F I R S T E N R O L L M E N T J U L Y 2 0 1 5 -J U N E 2 0 1 6 3 symptom improvement that had - on average - maintained at least that level of improvement in the 4 -month follow -up period. Lastly, the seventh column shows the percentage of all patients who both achieved at least a 30% improvement in the first 4 mon ths since their first medical cannabis purchase and maintained that improvement on average in the 4 -month follow -up period .

These include, among others, questions on seizure frequency for s eizure patients, questions on spasm frequency for muscle spasm and ALS patients, and Crohn's activity in Crohn's patients. While patients received the same response options on the Standard 8 measures (respond from 1 -10 on a numerical rating scale), respons e options for condition - specific measures varied as indicated in Table 11 . All condition -specific measures were investigated within the same framework as the Standard 8 measures: 1) what percentage of patients achieved symptom improvement within the four months since their first medical cannabis purchase compared to their baseline responses, and 2) what percentage of those achieving symptom improvement showed general persistence in the 4 -month follow -up period. A summary of results are similarly presented in a table like those presented for the Standard 8 measures (see Table 11 below). Table 11 .

However, rather than analyz ing for changes on the IOP test compared to a baseline IOP result, the se results are presented below as report ed by the patients (see Table 12 ). All IOP test results represented to the left of the \"First Visit\" column indicate results from tests occurring prior to the patient's first medical cannabis purchase; everything to the right of that column are results occurring after the patient's first purchase. Column names refer to month in which the test was reported to occur prior to or after first purchase. N ote that these results are not directly coming from the practitioner who administered the IOP test - reliance on patient documentation and/or memory is a limitation in interpreting these results.

It is possible that patients report incorrect values and dates of testing. Importantly, reported data provides little or no insight into changes in glaucoma therapies or other medications during the period after medical cannabis initiation. And, though we have record of which products are purchased when, without patient -level comparison of changes in product with changes in observed effect, we could miss differential impact of products. That analysis is beyond the scope of this report. With those caveats, we make the following summary observations. After initiating medical cannabis use, eight of the 21 patients (38%) reported in traocular pressure measurements with a decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) 4 mm Hg in at least one eye, 4 (19%) reported no follow -up results in the year after medical cannabis initiation, and 9 (43%) reported follow -up values with no decrease in IOP 4 mm Hg. Among the 8 showing a decrease in IOP 4 mm Hg, 6 reported more than one measurement during the year after following medical cannabis initiation. Among these 6 with multiple reported measurements, the 4 mm Hg decrease in IOP was present in the f irst reported post - initiation result for five (at months 1[x3], 2, and 4). In one patient, the 4 mm Hg decrease in IOP wasn 't seen in the initial reported result, but was present in a later result (at month 9). Among the two with only one post -initiation reported result, the 4 mm Hg decrease in IOP was seen at months 1 and 2. From these patterns, it appears that if medical cannabis use results in decreased IOP, that effect usually occurs within the first few months but can vary.

SB174 Measure Title: RELATING TO MEDICAL Title: Medical Marijuana; Debilitating Medical Condition Description: Amends the definition of debilitating medical condition to include lupus, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, autism, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress as conditions that qualify for the legal use of medical marijuana. Companion: Kidani DAVID Y. IGE GOVERNOR OF HAWAII VIRGINIA PRESSLER, M.D. DIRECTOR OF HEALTH STATE OF HAWAII DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH P. O. Box 3378 Honolulu, HI 96801- 3378 doh.testimony@doh.hawaii.gov Testimony in OPPOSITION to SB174 RELATING TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA SENATOR ROSALYN H. BAKER , CHAIR SENATE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, CONSUMER PROTECTION, AND HEALTH Hearing Date: February 8, 2017 Room Number: 229 Fiscal Implications: None 1 Department Testimony: The purpose of this bill is to amend the list of debilitating conditions 2 for the medical use of marijuana by adding a number of new conditions. The Department 3 opposes the passage of new laws related to marijuana until the medical marijuana dispensaries 4 open and we can gauge the impact upon the State. The Department through its Hawaii 5 Administrative Rules \u00a711-160-7 has already laid out a comprehensive annual process to consider 6 addition or eletion of qualifying conditions for the medical use of marijuana. Physicians or 7 potential medical marijuana patients may petition the Department for new conditions. This 8 process will focus on all available medical evidence and research on efficacy and safety for 9 patients. It will include a public hearing where testimony from the public can be provided. The 10 Department has already queried registering physicians and several plan to petition for a variety 11 of conditions. The f irst annual petition process will be implemented this year. Decisions will be 12 grounded in science that shows that medical marijuana helps treat or relieve any proposed 13 additional conditions. 14 Thank you for the opportunity to testify. 15 678767_1 TESTIMONY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TWENTY-NINTH LEGISLATURE, 2017 ON THE FOLLOWING MEASURE: S.B. NO. 174, RELATING TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA. BEFORE THE: SENATE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, CONSUMER PROTECTION, AND HEALTH DATE: Wednesday, February 8, 2017 TIME: 9:00 a.m. LOCATION: State Capitol, Room 229 TESTIFIER(S): Douglas S. Chin, Attorney General, or Jill T. Nagamine, Deputy Attorney General Chair Baker and Members of the Committee: The Department of the Atto rney General opposes this bill. We generally oppose the passage of new laws related to marij uana until the medical marijuana dispensaries open and we get the chance to gauge the impact on the State. This bill would expand the list of medi cal conditions for which a patient can be certified for the medical use of marijuana. It would add lupus, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, autism, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stre ss to the list of debilitating medical conditions already approved in section 329-121, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The Attorney General's specific concern abo ut this bill is that, without a scientific or other basis to indicate t hat the use of marijuana helps tr eat or provide relief for the additional proposed conditions, the proposed expansion may appear to move the State closer to deregulation of marijuana, a schedule I controlled substance under federal law. Adding so many new conditions, some of which are common and have multiple traditional treatments, could be viewed by the federal gover nment as contrary to the goal of having a robust regulatory scheme for the medical us e of marijuana in Hawaii. We respectfully ask this Committee to hold this bill. P.O. Box 83, Honolulu, HI 96810-0083 Phone: 808-518-3213 Email: info@dpfhi.org Website: www.dpfhi.org Dedicated to safe, responsible, humane and effective drug policies since 1993 TO: Senate Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and Health FR OM: Carl Bergquist, Executive Director HEARING DATE: 9 February 2017, 9AM RE: SB174, Relating to Medical Marijuana, SUPPORT De ar Chair Baker, Vice Chair Nishihara, Committee Members: The Drug Policy Forum of Hawai'i (DPFHI) supports this measure to add various new medical conditions as qualifying for the legal use of medical cannabis in Hawai 'i. Several of these conditions are specifically listed by various other states (lupus, austism, multiple sclerosis, a rithis and epilepsy) while the others (anxiety, depression, insomnia or stress) are broad c onditions with symptoms that are arguably better relieved with medical cannabis than with va rious prescription pharmaceutical products. While we support the Department of Health 's ongoing process to set up a petition process to a dd further conditions - indeed we are planning to help petition for \"opiate use disorder\" - we see it as a complement to expeditiously adding specific conditions by statute. Accordingly, we re spectfully request your support for this bill that can help relieve the suffering of many patients who other wise may find no relief or risk becoming addicted to more powerful narcotics.

I am able to manage all of these conditions with cannabis therapy and was able to disconti nue use of a pulmonary walker in 2012, less than two years after beginning cannabis therapy. When examining SB174 it is easy to see this piece of legislation is a positive step toward ensuring patients with severe, debilitating diseases have a full complem ent of treatment options available to them. Both the HVCA and I feel this legislation reflects the desire of the Hawaiian people to see the medical use of marijuana program expanded to cover more conditions. I personally support this legislation and the HV CA is in support of this legislation, particularly considering many of the conditions mentioned are commonly diagnosed in our veterans.

Re: Testimony in Support of Senate Bill (SB) 174 RELATING TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA. Amends the definition of debilitating medical condition to include lupus, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, arthr itis, autism, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress as conditions that qualify for the legal use of medical marijuana. Dear Chair Baker, Vice-Chair Nishihara, and Members of the Committee: HEALTH is a recently formed trade association made up of the eight (8) licensed medical marijuana dispensaries under Haw. Rev. Stat. (HRS) Chapter 329D. HEALTH's members are all committed to ensuring the goals of patient safety, product safety and public safety. We strongly support SB174 which adds additional conditions to qualify for the legal use of medical marijuana. Attached, is a list of the state's that allow medical marijuana and the qualifying conditions. See https://www.leafly.com/news/health/qualifying-conditions-for -medical -marijuana - by-state While we note that the range of conditions vary state to state with some more restrictive, some broader, than Hawaii, we think it is important to note that Hawaii was one of the first states to authorize the use of medical marijuana program in 2000 . Yet, since that time, the list of conditions remained the same until 2015' s Act 241 added \"post-traumatic stress disorder.\" However, we believe that there is an abundance of evidence to demonstrate and substantiate the medicinal benefits of medical marijuana for certain conditions, including those in this bill. As with any other medication, a patient has the opportunity to try the product and see if it produces positive results, and weigh that against any negative side- effects. In close collaboration with their physician who provided the certification, they can then make their own decision whether to continue or discontinue the use of medical marijuana. Therefore, we support this bill. Thank you for your consideration.

The Hawaii Dispensary Alliance is a patient-centric organizatio n that aims to appropriately introduce the legitimate cannabis industry to the state of Hawa ii. Our membership is drawn from patients and caregivers, ancillary busin esses related to and involved in the physical and inte llectual cannabis space, and those who generally supp ort the value of a legal right to cannabis-based medicine. The Alliance has established itself as a consistent voice in the co nversation for greater pa tient access to safe and quality cannabis re sources; and it is fro m this perspective that we support SB174. Our board and membership find that the language of this measure will provide greater access to less invasive medical soluti ons, by expanding the applicability of cannabis-based medicine. If passed, this measure will place Hawaii on th e list of states as one of the m ore inclusive state regulated medical cannabis programs in the nati on. Including these qualifying con ditions on our roster would benefit future medical cannabis studies conduc ted by the University of Hawaii system as well as those conducted in private by local firms. This is an opportunity to help more pat ients and to conduct the sound medical research the international medical cannabis industry desperatel y needs. For all of the foregoing reasons, the Hawai'i Dispensary Allia nce SUPPORTS the language of this measure and recommends that SB174 be moved forward for further discussion. A 2016 version of a state-by-state list of qualifying conditio ns has been attached for your review and comparison. This list has been vetted and approved by the State of Hawaii Department of Health. Thank you very much for the opport unity to provide testimony on this measure. Hawai? i Dispensary Alliance 2016 \u00a9 1110 RELATING TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA Senate Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection, and Health Wednesday February 8, 2017 9:00 AM State Capitol, Conference Room 229 Aloha Chair Baker, Vice Chair Nishihara, and Members of the Committee, Pakall Suite , a Hawai'i based community organization of qualified medical marijuana patients, STRONGLY SUPPORTS SB174. SB174 would amend the definition of \"debilitating medical condition\" to include lupus, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, autism, anxiety , depression, insomnia, and stress.\" The medical use of marijuana has provided comfort and relief to countless individuals suffering from medical conditions that they would undoubtedly define as \"debilitating.\" However, state laws have narrowly defined, or left ambiguous, those qualifying medical conditions necessary to become a qualified medical marijuana patient. Cannabidiol, or CBD , a non -psychoactive compound of marijuana (cannabis), has gained momentum in its positive treatment of the debilitating symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism or neurological disorders like epilepsy - two medical conditions enumerated in SB174's expanded definition of \"debilitating medical condition.\" The state's progression toward a compassionate approach t o the medical use of marijuana has authorized the licensing and establishment of medical marijuana dispensaries. Individuals suffering from debilitating medical conditions now have greater access to proven medical treatment. By expanding the definition o f \"debilitating medical condition,\" the state would provide greater access to medical treatment for a much larger group of people in need. Mahalo nui loa for this oppor tunity to share our testimony, Mhealani Traub Pakall Suite Prime Advocate February 6 , 2017 Senator Rosalyn H. Baker Senator Clarence K. Nishihara Chair, Senate Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection , and Health Vice Chair, Senate Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection , and Health Hawaii State Senate Hawaii State Senate Hawaii State Capitol, Room 230 Hawaii State Capitol, Room 214 RE: SB174 - Support Senator Baker and Senator Nishihara , My name is Robert Wiedmeyer , and I have been a resident of Waikoloa, Hawaii for two and a half years. My legislators are Representative Cindy Evans and Senator Lorraine Inouye. I am writin g to express my support for SB174, which a mends the definition of debilitating medical condition s to include lupus, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, arth ritis, autism, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress as conditions that qualify for the legal use of medical marijuana. SB174 takes positive steps toward updating Hawaii law to enhance access to a safe, effective medication for a number of serious and sometimes chronic medical conditions. When used under the supervision of a qualified medical professional, cannabis has been shown to help relieve these conditions and potentially allow patients to reduce reliance on opiates and other medicines that have potentially serious, harmful side effects. With the state's dispensaries set to open in the near future, this is the time to expand legal access to more patients who stand to benefit from cannabis -based medicine. I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of this legislation . Sincerely, Robert Wiedmeyer PATIENTS WITHOUT TIME PATIENTS WITHOUT TIME, MAUI HI email: PWTmaui.org website: http://pwtmaui.org February 7, 2017 Aloha Legislators, LEGALIZE MARIJUANA NOW! SAVE LIVES! 90,000 Americans die from alcohol every year, yet Hawaii celebrates the success of Hawaii's wineries and microbreweries . Tourists are encourag ed to visit production centers and tasting rooms . Meanwhile, requiring cannabis production centers to have 24/7 video surveillance, and concealment from the public view. This is unfounded prejudice and paranoia. The CDC states marijuana kills ZERO America ns, so why the prejudice against it ? For 16 years, Hawaii has practiced SELECTIVE PROSECUTION against marijuana consumers. Protecting some folks with \"329 cards\" from prosecution (stating that marijuana is medicine), while sending others to jail for \"ma rijuana crimes,\" (stating marijuana has no medical value). There exists a clear, facial contradiction between marijuana's classification as a schedule I drug and its allowable use by qualifying patients for medical conditions. The only just solution is to legalize marijuana. Tax and regulate Hawaii's estimated $billion - plus dollar -a-year illegal marijuana industry, and raise a $100-million -plus dollars -a-year in revenue , decrease expenses fighting the failed prohibi tion, clear court dockets, save families broken by incarceration, and create thousands of new legal jobs and business.

My name is Fehren Jones, I reside in the Honolulu area. I am in full support of SB174 which states that \"Amends the definition of debilitating medical condition to include lupus, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, autism, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress as conditions that qualify for the legal use of medical marijuana.\" At the moment, no, I do not have any of these serious health conditions, but, I am starting to feel the arthritis, it comes with age. I do come across anxiety from time to time and the daily stress, but who doesn't come across stress and anxiety from time to time? I am a medical marijuana card holder and, yes, I do use my medical marijuana medicine when these symptoms arrive and IT DOES HELP. As for the lupus, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis I do not know what it feels like to go through those uncomfortable diseases/sickness but I have read numerous of articles and I have watched many shows on how medical marijuana have helped countless of individuals get through the da y, and to just getting through the day is a milestone for many of these ones.

Baker, Chair Senator Clarence K. Nishihara, Vice Chair From: D. Douglas Smith, M.D. Re: SB 174, Relating to Medical Marijuana IN OPPOSE I would like to thank Chair Baker, Vice Chair Nishihara , and members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and Health for the opportunity to submit comments on SB174. I am a physician who specializes in psychiatry and have spent my career practicing in Hawaii. For 11 years I was on the faculty of the JABSOM department of psychiatry and I treated patients and supervised residents at the Hawaii State Hospital and Queens Medi - cal Center. I have also worked in private practice and with the Adult Mental Health Divi - sion's Assertive Community Treatment Program. I oppose this bill, and urge you to reconsider some of its important health implications for access to mental health care in Hawaii. SB174 would expand the definition of \"debilitating medical conditions\" that qualify for the legal use of medical marijuana to include \"autism, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress as conditions.\" This is reckless expansion of qualifying diagnoses flies in the face of clinical experience and available medical literature. It would be a regrettable health policy that promises to add to the burdens on our strained mental health system. The 2013 position statement of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is clear in this regard. It states, \"There is no current scientific evidence that marijuana is in any way 1D.

In contrast, current evidence sup - ports, at minimum, a strong association of cannabis use with the onset of psychiatric dis - orders. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to harm, given the effects of cannabis on neurological development.\" (see attachment) Before authorizing this legislation, committee members should consider the evidence of limited benefit and serious mental health risks posed by high-potency medical cannabis, including its association with an increased incidence and worse outcomes for Depression, Bipolar disorder, Schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions. As the referenced APA resource document concludes: There is currently no scientific evidence to support the use of marijuana as an effective treatment for any psychiatric illness. Several studies have shown that cannabis use may in fact exacerbate or hasten the onset of psychiatric illnesses, as evidenced by both international trials and meta- analyses. This includes the contribution of marijuana to symptoms of mood disorders, anxiety and psychosis, particularly in young adulthood. Cannabis use is associated with the emergence of mood disorders, partic - ularly symptoms of bipolar disorder, among those with a family history of mood disorder. Among those with major depressive disorder, co-morbid cannabis use is associated with increased rates of both suicidal ideation and attempts, raising grave safety concerns. Among those with a predis - position to psychotic disorders, cannabis may hasten the emergence of both positive and negative psychotic symptoms. The use of higher po - tency cannabis, for longer periods of time and with more frequency, is also associated with increased risk of psychosis. Several studies have demonstrated the link between marijuana use and mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders among adolescents. Cannabis use is associated with increased depression, suicidal ideation, use of other substances and risky behavior among adolescents. Regular adolescent cannabis use is also associated with increased incidence of anxiety disor - ders. Cannabis use significantly increases the risk of psychotic disorders 2among young adults. Additionally, younger age of cannabis use is associ - ated with an earlier onset of psychosis among those at risk. Adolescents with a history of cannabis use tend to have higher severity of illness, lower psychosocial functioning, less insight, and longer courses of untreated psychosis compared to those without a history of cannabis use. These findings are of particular concern as symptoms often persist into adult - hood, and therefore cannabis use may increase the risk of lifelong symp - toms and disability due to mental illness. (see attachment) While there exist the future possibility that certain varieties of cannabis, administered at certain predicable dosages and schedules will be proven to benefit certain mental health conditions while avoiding the risks of toxicity or withdrawal symptoms, this is not yet the case. As with any potent psychotropic drug, unpredictable composition and strengths will inevitably lead to inconsistent effects with problems from excessive dose (i.e. intoxica - tion) and inadequate dose (withdrawal). In my medical opinion, the one area of expanded indication for medical cannabis, where the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks, would be as an alternative to the manage - ment of chronic pain with harmful and ineffective opioids. There are several other Medical Marijuana bills that have been scheduled for hearing (SB1159, SB173, SB716, SB319, SB970), indicating that expanding access to high-po - tency cannabis has a higher priority for the legislature, than doing the work necessary to ensure that health plan members have access to the safe and effective medical care they are paying for and are legally entitled to. With all the oversight and attention being paid to expanded use of high potency cannabis, a marginal issue for most people, why has there been so little legislative oversight of the health plan provider networks that nearly all of our people depend on for access to proven care? Most worrisome is the foreseeable worsening of the shortage of psychiatric physicians likely due to this bill. By expanding the numbers of individuals with qualifying diag - noses, particularly to those most vulnerable to adverse effects of high-potency medical cannabis, SB174 would predictably increase the burden of mental illness on Hawaii's 3health system. In addition to the triggering of episodes of Anxiety, Depression, Mania or Psychosis, the likelihood of toxicity from excessive dosing or of withdrawal from re - duced dose will add to the burden on our strained mental health system. This is the oppo - site of the preventive approach needed to reduce unnecessary demands on our healthcare system. From the perspective of consumer protection and public health, this makes no sense. Please, committee members, defer SB174, or amend qualifying conditions to include treatment for chronic pain and to remove the list of mental health problems it is known to cause or worsen (autism, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress). Thank you for allowing me to testify on SB174, and your consideration of these concerns is appreciated. Sincerely, D.

Position Statement on Marijuana as Medicine Approved by the Board of Trustees, December 2013 Approved by the Assembly, November 2013 \"Policy documents are approved by the APA Assembly and Board of Trustees...These are...position statements that define APA official policy on specific subjects...\" - APA Operations Manual . There is no current scien tific evidence that mari- juana is in any way beneficial for the treatment of any psychiatric disorder. In contrast, current evi- dence supports, at minimu m, a strong association of cannabis use with the onset of psychiatric disorders. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to harm, given the effect s of cannabis on neurolo- gical development. Further research on the use of cannabis-derived substances as medicine should be encouraged and facilitated by the federal government. The adverse effects of marijuana, including, but not limited to, the likelihood of addiction, must be simulta-neously studied. Policy and practice surrounding cannabis-derived substances should not be altered until sufficient clinical evidence supports such changes. If scientific evidence su pports the use of cannabis- derived substances to treat specific conditions, the medication should be subject to the approval process of the FDA. Regarding state initiatives to authorize the use of marijuana for medical purposes: Medical treatment should be evidence-based and determined by professional standards of care; it should not be authorized by ballot initiatives. No medication approved by the FDA is smoked. Marijuana that is dispensed under a state-authorized program is not a specific product with controlled dosages. The buyer has no way of knowing the strength or purity of the product, as cannabis lacks the quality control of FDA-approved medicines. Prescribers and patients should be aware that the dosage administered by smoking is related to the depth and duration of the inhalation, and therefore difficult to standardize. The content and potency of various cannabinoids contained in marijuana can also vary, making dose standardization a challenging task. Physicians who recommend use of smoked marijuana for \"medical\" purposes should be fully aware of the risks and liabilities inherent in doing so. AUTHORS: Tauheed Zaman, M.D. Richard N.

Views expressed are those of the authors .\" -- APA Operations Manual. Tauheed Zaman, M.D. Richard N. Rosenthal, M.D. John A. Renner, Jr., M.D. Herbert D. Kleber, M.D. Robert Milin, M.D. Abstract The medical use of marijuana has received considerable attention as several states have voted to re move civil and criminal penalties for patients with qualifying condit ions. Yet, on a national level, marijuana remains a schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the most restrictive schedule enforced by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) (1). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), resp onsible for approving treatments after appropriate and rigorous study, additionally does not support the use of marijuana for medical purposes. This juxta-position of practice and policy has prompted many professional medical organizations to issue offici al positions on the topic. This statement reflects the position of the American Psychiatric Associ- ation (APA) on the use of marijuana for psychiatric indications. It does not cover the use of synthetic cannabis-derived medications such as Dronabinol (Marinol) , which has been studied and approved by the FDA for specific indications. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Medical Indications for Marijuana as Medicine Much of the evidence supporting marijuana use for non-psychiatric medical diagno ses remains anecdotal. The indications with the most evid ence include: severe nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy (2), cachexia associated with Ac quired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (3), spasticity secondary to neurological diseases such as muscular sclerosis (4), management of neuropathic pain (5), and rheumatoid arthritis (6). Several medical organizations have issued statements regarding indications for marijuana as medicine based on scientific evidence. Contribution of Marijuana to Psychiatric Illness There is currently no scientific evidence to support the use of marijuana as an effective treatment for any psychiatric illness. Several studies have shown that cannabis use may in fact exacerbate or hasten the onset of psychiatric illnesses, as evidenced by bo th international trials and meta-analyses (7-9). This includes the contribution of marijuana to symptoms of mood disorders, anxiety and psychosis, particularly in yo ung adulthood10, 11. Cannabis use is associated with the emergence of mood disorders, particularly symptoms of bipolar disorder, among those with a family history of mood disorder (12). Among those with major depressive disorder, co-morbid cannabis use is associated with increased rate s of both suicidal ideation and attempts, raising grave safety concerns (13). Among those with a predisposition to psychotic disorders, cannabis may hasten the emergence of both positive and negative psychotic symptoms (14). The use of higher potency cannabis, for longer pe riods of time and with more frequency, is also associated with increased risk of psychosis (15). Several studies have demonstrated the link between marijuana use and mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders among adolescents. Cannabis use is associated with increased depression, suicidal ideation, use of other substances and risky behavior among adolescents16. Regular adolescent cannabis use is also associated with increased incidence of anxiety disorders (17). Cannabis use significantly increases the ri sk of psychotic disorders among young adults (18). Additionally, younger age of cannabis use is associated with an earlier onset of psycho- sis among those at risk (19). Adolescents with a history of cannabis use tend to have high er severity of illness, lower psychosocial functioning, less insight, and longer courses of untreated psychosis compared to those without a history of cannabis use20. These findin gs are of particular concern as symptoms often persist into adulthood, and therefore cannabis use may increase the risk of lifelong symptoms and disability due to mental illness. APA Official Actions MARIJUANA AS MEDICINE Serious Adverse Effects of Marijuana Use Cognitive and Functional Marijuana use is associated with serious cognitive problems such as short-term memory deficits, poor concentration, attention, and information processing (21). These impairments might be ca used by neurotoxic effects of cannabis on the developing brain, the effects of which can lead to long-term cogn itive problems well into adulthood (22, 23). Adolescents with daily cannabis use show deficits in learning up to six weeks after stopping marijuana use (24). This may contribute to significantly decreased academic achievem ent, including increased rates of school dropout, failure to enter higher education or attain higher degrees (25). Among both adolescents and adults, cannabis significantly impairs driving, particularly as the drug affects automatic driving functions in a highly dose-dependent fashion (26). Cannabis use, particularly in combination with alcohol, greatly increases the risk of motor vehicle crashes due to effects on cognition and coordination (27). Addiction and burden of psychiatric illness: Cannabis use is associated wi th an increased risk of developing a cannabis use diso rder. Studies indicate that 9% of users become dependent on cannabis, and this number increases to 25-50% among daily users and to 1 in 6 among adolescents (28). Adolescents remain at particular risk for cannabis use disorder, and can experience signi- ficant withdrawal symptoms including appetite changes, restlessness, irritability, depression, and shakes, perspiration, and thoughts/cravings of cannabis (29). Marijuana use is also associated with poorer outcomes among those with mental illness. Among individuals with schizophrenia, cannabis use is associated with poorer long-term clinical outcomes (30). Individuals with psychotic illness may be more sensitive to both the psychosis-inducing and mood-altering effects of cannabis (31). This may explain why even among those taking medications for psychotic disorders, cannabis use is associated with an increased ri sk of relapse into psychotic symptoms (32). Legalization of medical marijuana may reduce the perceived risks of use, th e perception of societal disapproval, or the barriers to access, and potentially increase the incidence of the adverse events noted above. Summary Given the gravity of concer ns regarding marijuana as medicine, professionals in both neurology and psychiatry have emphasized the importance of prospective studies to understand the mechanisms by which cannabis functions, and its impact on mental health and behavior before instituting changes in practice and policy (33, 34).

The intent of our Medical Use of Marijuana Program i s to reduce the suffering of our patients by respecting the right of patients to choose the type of medical treatment that works best for them.

This petition includes new scientific research supporting the request to add \"Anxiety\" as a qualifying condition that was not present in the \"General Anxiety Disorder\" petition. This petition should be reviewed and not rejected for its similarity to an earlier petition due to the new evidence published by the Minnesota Department of Health , the Massachusettes Department of Health and other peer -reviewed medical research attached and Health Study (MBHS) A legislative mandate required the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to conduct a baseline study to investigate marijuana use in Massachusetts. The report published confirms the consensus that marijuana use improves mood and or mental health for a large percentage of people. Page 148: Results from this survey suggest that respondents appear to be treating a wide range of medical conditions, and often more than one at a time. The top 5 medical conditions being treated were anxiety (60% or all respondents) , chronic pain (46%), insomni a (43%), depression (42%), and stress (41%), and the average number of conditions being treated by medical marijuana is 4.7. In the 1999 National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine report on marijuana, the National Academy of Science found that thorough medical research shows that marijuana reduces anxiety movement disorders most often considered for marijuana or cannabinoid therapy are dystonia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Tourette's syndrome. Movement disorders are often transiently exacerbated by stress and activity and improved by factors that reduce str ess. This is of particular interest because for many people marijuana reduces anxiety . In a study of medical marijuana patients in Arizona, many patients reported significant relief levels of anxiety. (REF #13) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26317379 367 medical marijuana patients in Arizona were surveyed. 181 patients reported using medical marijuana to experience relief from Anxiety General relief from Anxiety symptoms was 82.9% with medical marijuana, Relief by medical marijuana compared to other medications was 79.3% for Anxiety Less frequent use of other medications was 85.9% for Anxiety Patients who suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder find relief of anxiety with medical cannabis. PTSD is a qualifying condition in Hawaii and other states. It makes logical sense to allow people who do not have PTSD to gain relief of anxiety by adding anxiety to the list of qualifying conditions. In a small percentage of people, medical cannabis can aggravate t heir anxiety. For the majority of people, cannabis reduces anxiety. This contraindication is similar to other anti -anxiety prescriptions, for whom a small percentage, their anxiety can be aggravated. This is not a reason to reject a qualifying condition, merely a reality of using any medication. Some epilepsy medicines make seizures worse or more frequent. Marijuana is safer than all prescription medications and most of OTC medications. Cannabis has less side effects, and no severe, toxic or dangerous side effects compared to all of the prescription medications used to treat Anxiety. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental -health- medications/index.shtm l For example Benzodiazepines commonly used as anti anxiety medic ations, are responsible for hundreds of deaths each year in the United States. of anxiety and stress is one of the most common reasons that people give for using marijuana Anti-Anxiety medication Ativan may be implicated in Soundgarden's http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/ativan- what -you-need- -anxiety -pills-w483638 A safety profile of Medical Marijuana can be found in the first year report of the Minnesota medical marijuana program. The Minnesota Department of Health surveyed 1500+ medical marijuana patients enrolled in the program. (REF #98) https://www.health.stat e.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/firstyearreport.html Adverse Side Effects: At this point, the safety profile of the medical cannabis products available through the Minnesota program seems quite favorable. Approximately 20 -25% of enrolled patients report negative physical or mental side effects of some kind, with the majority - around 60% - reporting only one and 90% reporting three or fewer. The vast majority of adverse side effects, around 90%, are mild to moderate in severity. An assessment of the 30 pa tients reporting severe side effects, meaning \"interrupts usual daily activities,\" found no apparent pattern of patient age, medical condition, or type of medical cannabis used. The most common adverse side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, and fatigue. Fortunately, up to the present no serious adverse events (life threatening or requiring hospitalization) have been reported. Medical Marijuana's mild to moderate side effects of dry mouth, drowsiness and fatigue are easily tolerated by the vast majority o f patients. The Mayo Clinic website has assembled dosage information on Medical Marijuana. http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs -supplements/marijuana/dosing/hrb -20059701 In the latest petition to add Anxiety to Ohio's medical marijuana program, the New Jersey Department of Health's final decision on a petition to add anxiety in New Jersey was included. (REF 96) https://med.ohio.gov/Portals/0/Publications/Medical%20Marijuana%20Petitions%202019/0133%20- %20Anxiety%20[Rosenberger].pdf?ver=2020- 01-28-104750- 247 (REF 97) https://www.nj.gov/health/medicalmarijuana/documents/agency_decision_letters/MMP_FAD_conditions_012319.p df New cannabis program is similar to Hawaii's medical cannabis program. With similar requirements for petitions to meet. On July 5, 2016, the Department published the Request for Petitions in the New Jersey Register advising that from August 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016, it was accepting petitions to establish additional medical conditions as \"debilitating\" under the MMP. 43 NJR. 1395(a). The Request for Petitions stated that the Department was seeking petitions in accordance with the Act, which authorizes the Department to include additional debilitating medical conditions under the MMP. In the Request for Petitions, the publ ic was advised that submitted petitions were required to include the following information, pursuant to N.J.A.C. 8:64- 53: (1) The extent to which the condition is generally accepted by the medical community and other experts as a valid, existing medical c ondition; (2) If one or more treatments of the condition, rather than the condition itself. are alleged to be the cause of the patient's suffering, the extent to which the treatments causing suffering are generally accepted by the medical community and ot her experts as valid treatments for the condition; (3) The extent to which the condition itself andfor the treatments thereof cause severe suffering, such as severe and/or chronic pain. severe nausea and/or vomiting, or othenrvise severely impair the pati ent's ability to carry on activities of daily living; (4) The availability of conventional medical therapies other than those that cause suffering to alleviate suffering caused by the condition andlorthe treatment thereof; (5) The extent to which evidenc e that is generally accepted among the medical community and other experts supports a nding that the use of marijuana alleviates suffering caused by the condition and/or the treatment thereof; and (6) Letters of support from physicians or other licensed health care professional knowledgeable about the condition. New Jersey found that Anxiety met the requirements and accepted Anxiety as a qualifying condition. Anxiety Based upon my independent review of the petitions, I am granting those seeking to add anxiety to the MMP. In coming to this conclusion, I reviewed these petitions against the six regulatory criteria cited above and found that the condition meets the requirements for inclusion in the MMP. Regarding the rst factor, which is whether the condition is generally accepted in the medical community as a valid medical condition, I find that anxiety satisfies this criteria. Specically, the American Psychiatric Association defines anxiety and anxiety disorders as conditions characterized by excessiv e fear and behavioral disturbances. Anxiety results from anticipation of a future threat and may be associated with symptoms of muscle tension, vigilance in preparation for future danger, and overly cautious or avoidant behaviors. Additionally, there are m ultiple ICD- 10-CM codes for anxiety disorders. Because anxiety maintains a common definition in the medical community and has |CD \u201410\u2014CM codes, I nd that anxiety is a valid and recognized medical condition. Under the second factor, I must consider whether the treatments for the condition, rather than the condition itself, are causing the patient's suffering and the extent to which the treatments causing the patient suffering are generally accepted by the medical community and other experts as valid treatments for the condition. From my review of this condition, the generally accepted treatments for anxiety are dependent on the symptoms and the severity of the particular disorder. Mild and moderate forms of anxiety may not require a pharmacologic interventi on, but may necessitate other forms of treatment, such as meditation, mindfulness, breathing techniques as well as psychotherapy (counseling) or cognitive therapy.\" The most common classes of medications used to combat anxiety disorders are antidepressants , anti -anxiety drugs, and beta\u2014 blockers.49 Antidepressants are safe and effective but they may be risky for children, teens, and young adults.50 Antidepressants aiso come with a \"black box\" warning \u2014 the FDA's strongest warning \u2014 advising that some people may have suicidal thoughts or make suicide attempts while taking the medication.51 The most common anti -anxiety medications are called benzodiazepines. As noted by the Panel, the common sides effects of benzodiazepines include headache, confusion, tiredness, and in some causes nightmares and memory impairments.52 And, benzodiazepines carry a risk of dependence and addiction.53 Furthermore, the FDA notes that the number of patients who were prescribed both an opioid analgesic and benzodiazepine increased by 41% between 2002 and 2014.54 As a result, the FDA requires black box warnings and patient -focused Medication Guides for prescription opioid analgesics, opioid- containing cough products, and benzodiazepines to inform the patient about the serious risks ass ociated with using these medications at the same time.55 Thus, I find that the treatments for anxiety are recognized and accepted by the medical community as the treatments forthis condition and relate to the suffering of the patient. As for the third fac tor, which is whether the condition itself andfor the treatments thereof cause severe suffering, such as severe andior chronic pain, severe nausea andlor vomiting or othenntise severely impair the patient's ability to carry on activities of daily living, I nd that both the anxiety condition itself as well as the treatments for this condition cause severe suffering for patients. Specifically, anxiety may lead to problems that negatively impact an individual's activities of daily iiving and quaiity of life and may lead to suicide and depression. Anxiety disorders can also cause signicant distress or interfere with social, occupational, and other areas of functioning. In fact, an estimated 31.1% of US. adults experience an anxiety disorder at some time in their lives.56 Medications, in some instances, may exacerbate the symptoms and are associated with debilitating side effects that can prevent a patient from engaging in activities of daily living, thereby diminishing one's quality of life. Accordingly, I nd that both the condition of anxiety as well as the therapies to treat it cause severe suffering. Under the fourth factor, I must evaluate the availability of conventional medical therapies, other than those that cause suffering, to alleviate the patients s uffering caused by the condition and or the treatment thereof. As discussed above, mild and moderate forms of anxiety may be treated with meditation, mindfulness, breathing techniques as well as counseling or cognitive therapy that can be effective. Progression to medication therapy may be initiated; however, in both instances, one must consider the therapeutic response. Failure to respond to therapies or side effects associated with treatments may result in signicant impacts on quality of life. As such, I find that there is an absence of medicaIIy -accepted, alternative medical therapies to the conventional therapies currently prescribed for migraine that cause suffering. Regarding the fth factor, which is whether there is generally accepted evidence in t he medical community that the use of marijuana alleviates suffering relating to the condition, I find that cannabis is generaliy accepted as an effective treatment for anxiety. The Panel discussed medical evidence that cannabis may exacerbate anxiety sympt oms or that an effect related to cannabis may be associated with anxiety, such as dependence and cravings. Literature suggests that individuals with anxiety sensitivity may be more likely to turn to cannabis as a mechanism for coping with stress, which may in turn lead to problematic use behaviors.57 However, the Panel further discussed a review published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2017, which found that there is limited evidence that cannabidiol is an effective trea tment for the improvement of anxiety symptoms, which was assessed by a public speaking test utilizing individuais with social anxiety disorders.58 On balance, the Panel recommended adding anxiety as an allowable condition under the MMP as research suggests that it could be helpful to some patients with this condition. I agree. While marijuana may not be effective for all anxiety sufferers, there is research evidencing that it may be helpful to some, especially those with social anxiety disorders. Thus , I find that there is acceptance in the medical community that marijuana is likely to relieve the suffering associated with some anxiety conditions. However, like any medical condition, the use of medical marijuana to treat anxiety must be explored by the medical professional treating the patient to determine whether it is the best and most appropriate course of treatment for the patient. As for the nal factor, which is whether there were letters from physicians or other licensed health care professional s knowledgeable about the condition supporting the inclusion of anxiety under the MMP, I nd that the petitions were submitted with support from medical professionals. Based upon the above analysis, | find that the condition of anxiety is \"debilitating\" and that medical marijuana is more likely than not to be potentially beneficial to treat or alleviate the debilitating effect of this condition. As such, I nd that anxiety should be added to the MMP. In a previous qualifying condition petition for General ized Anxiety Disorder, the Director of Health at the Hawaii Department of Health rejected adding the condition to the medical marijuana program. The main reason being that there is a lack of peer -reviewed scientific evidence showing beneficial use to treat GAD. This idea that peer -reviewed scientific evidence needs to conclusively show medical benefit or else no other qualifying conditions could be approved is wrong; due to the political nature of marijuana. Please allow me to explain. The Hawaii medical cannabis law was created based on medical and anecdotal evidence. Anecdotal evidence was accepted because there is a lack of scientific research on the benefits of marijuana. Due to cannabis's placement in schedule 1 of controlled substances in both state and federal laws. Quoting from the Hawaii Medical Cannabis Law: https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2000/acts/Act228_SB862_HD1_.htm There is sufficient medical and anecdotal evidence to support the proposition that these diseases and conditions may respond favorably to a medically controlled use of marijuana. This lack of research is due to the funding of marijuana research being regulated by NIDA, the National I nstitute of Drug Abuse. NIDA's purpose is investigating the abuse potential of drugs, including cannabis, with focus solely on trying to prove the negatives of marijuana use. Since NIDA funds negative effects of marijuana research, research is granted on the flimsiest of theories and has corrupted and biased science. Forcing researchers to chase more NIDA grants for research to ensure they continue to have jobs. Negative research findings are promoted wildly by NIDA when they are published. Even if the methodology of the study is flawed beyond belief. Even when other researchers try to duplicate the results and fail, NIDA continues to promote the flawed study as though it still has merit. An example of this can be found on that the twins' IQ was affected by factors that twins share in their genes or family background, rather than factors in which they differed (e.g., drug use). A further analysis, comparing the impact of marijuana use on fraternal vers us identical twins, suggested that family -wide environmental influences are more decisive than genes for determining IQ trajectory. NIDA, without any evidence to back up the statement, goes on: These findings contrast but are not entirely inconsistent wi th those of an earlier study that linked teen- onset regular marijuana use to IQ deficits in the fourth decade of life (see Early -Onset, Regular Cannabis Use Is Linked to IQ Decline). The researchers say that although their evidence indicates that marijuana exposure does not cause persistent loss of intellectual function up to age 20, prolonged regular exposure for decades might do so. NIDA contradicts itself often, and continues to promote failed theories that bear no relationship to reality. Especially trying to say that marijuana is a gateway drug. https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research -reports/marijuana/marijuana -gateway -drug These findings are consistent with the idea of marijuana as a \"gateway drug.\" However, the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, \"harder\" substances. A more sinister theory promoted by NIDA, the DEA, and even physicians is that marijuana use increases the risk of Schizophrenia. This is so unbelievable that it is a slap in the face of science. Simply looking at reality, the larger numbers of people using, or admitting to use of marijuana, the large number of registered medical cannabis pat ients in the USA (roughly 1,000,000 to 2,000,000) and the flat schizophrenia rates as reported by the NIH and WHO completely invalidate all peer -reviewed published research on the topic of marijuana causing schizophrenia. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/st atistics/schizophrenia.shtml https://www.who.int/news -room/fact -sheets/detail/schizophrenia In fact, a percentage of people diagnosed with schizophrenia use marijuana to reduce anxiety and help with symptoms. People with more severe schizophrenia use more marijuana, this is the basis for the theory that marijuana causes more severe symptoms of schizophrenia. Similar thinking is used against patients who have more severe pain, that marijuana somehow makes pain worse for patients and they have to use more m arijuana to gain pain relief. Instead of the observable theory that people with more severe pain use more marijuana to treat their more severe pain than people who have less severe pain. No one makes the theory that aspirin makes pain worse, because people with more pain use more aspirin. Bad science. The whole point of a state medical marijuana law is that the federal government has engineered a catch- 22 circular logic loop about marijuana. States, mostly via people's ballot initiatives have sideswiped the FDA in approving a medicine. This is because the FDA has adopted a policy of only endorsing and approving of monotherapies , e.g. one or two isolated and specific chemicals per approved medicine. There is another policy to reject crude botanical medicines due to variations from plant to plant. These comments by the FDA are found in the DEA response to a petition to reschedule marijuana to schedule 2 and in congressional testimony. Even if a company submitted an IND to the FDA to study marijuana for the treatment of a disease, it would be rejected by the FDA on both of those policies. The catch -22 comes when patients, nurses, physicians, governors, senators and representatives suggest that marijuana be investigated as a medicine. In congressional t estimony, the FDA says we need more research before endorsing that. NIDA says we need more research before utilizing marijuana as a medicine. The DEA says we need more research before marijuana could be considered a medicine. So, if everyone agrees we need more research, where exactly is the research? Individual physicians have attempted to research the benefits of marijuana within universities. What happens is that, at every turn, approval to study is blocked, delayed and rejected. See for example the 10 years of trying to study medical marijuana for treatment of PTSD -of-planning- research -1.570986 Sisley and her team had to gain approval and support from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse to initiate the research - a process that lasted years. One study took several years just to begin. After NIDA provided marijuana for research that was full of seeds, stems and mold. https://health.hawaii.gov/medicalcannabisregistry/files/2017/08/Generalized -Anxiety -Disorder- 08.09.17 -Redacted.pdf The GAD petition submitted in 2017 included anecdotal evidence, peer -reviewed patient surveys, marijuana use reports and other information. It was rejected by the director due to not having enough peer -reviewed scientific research. One reason given for the rejection was that there was \"no specific evidence to GAD\". This is why exact specific conditions and waiting for peer -reviewed medical research will never work as an administrative rule for reviewing qualifying condition petitions. There will never be medical marijuana research that specifically mentions each of the hundreds of conditions that include anxiety as a symptom. Research studies are done with one drug and one condition. A rejection for not having a specific condition mentioned seems more like a pedantic nitpick and less like a legitimate reason when both GAD and anxiety share anxiety as the core symptom. This GAD petition rejection uses the same reason the federal government does not approve of medical marijuana. If this requirement barrier of peer -reviewed research was erected, no state would have a medical marijuana program. Due to the federal policies which are a de facto prohibition on research for medical marijuana benefits. These state medical marijuana progra ms were created because the federal government failed to do research, and continues to prohibit new research. While the reality is that cannabis is a non toxic medicine, has always been a medicine and always will be a medicine. Anxiety was also included w ith a bill in the Hawaii legislature to add qualifying conditions. The Department of Health testified, and in opposing the bill, the DOH stated it would rather include conditions via the petition process. The HDOH also gave another reason, that the dept wanted to delay adding the condition until dispensaries were active. Try naming another medication that is delayed and kept illegal because the department was waiting for a pharmacy to open. The DOH needs to stop these petty games played with sick people's lives, rights and freedoms. (REF #95) https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2018/testimony/SB174_TESTIMONY_CPH_02 -08-17.pdf This is another wrong- headed approach to the process, and ignores why and what the medical marijuana law does. Allow me to explain the purpose of the law and the role of the DOH in it. From the Hawaii medical cannabis law: The legislature is aware of the legal problems associat ed with the legal acquisition of marijuana for medical use. However, the legislature believes that medical scientific evidence on the medicinal benefits of marijuana should be recognized. ... Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to ensure that seriously ill people are not penalized by the State for the use of marijuana for strictly medical purposes when the patient's treating physician provides a professional opinion that the benefits of medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks for the qualifying patient. The whole point of the medical marijuana program is not to endorse, nor recommend medical marijuana to patients. The purpose of the law is to NOT PENALIZE patients using medical marijuana with recommendations from their physicians. To protect patients from the laws prohibiting the use of marijuana. Said another way, it is not the Department of Health's role to become the FDA and research medical marijuana. It is not the DOH's role to judge if medical marijuana is a medicine or not. It is not the DOH's role to decide which conditions marijuana is beneficial for either. That role is solely for a patient to decide if medical marijuana works for their conditi ons or not. Physicians have a role to make sure the patient's health is f irst priority over any medication. The DOH's only role in the petition process is to protect medical marijuana patients from arrest. People are currently illegally using marijuana to treat their conditions, specifically anxiety. The DOH has the power to protect these patients by adding qualifying conditions. Instead, the DOH has assumed the role of the FDA, denying petitions and opposing adding conditions legislatively. Waiting for peer -reviewed medical evidence that by all accounts is not comi ng within the next two decades. This delay and denial of the reality of medical marijuana patients conditions needs to stop.

Anxiety is a recognized medical condition affecting millions of Americans each year. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any -anxiety -disorder.shtml The wide variety of anxiety disorders differ by the objects or situations that induce them, but share features of excessive anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Anxiety disorders can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, school work, and relationships. Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS -R), Figure 1 shows past year prevalence of any anxiety disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 or older.1 An estimated 19.1% of U.S. adults had any anxiety disorder in the past year. Past year prevalence of any anxiety disorder was higher for females (23.4%) than for males (14.3%). An es timated 31.1% of U.S. adults experience any anxiety disorder at some time in their lives. Anxiety affects a large portion of the people in the United States, costing billions of dollars in medical treatment costs. https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/basics/burden.htm Anxiety: Anxiety disorders, which include panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder, phobias, and separation anxiety disorder, are the most common class of mental disorders present in the general population. The estimated lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder is over 15%, while the 12- month prevalence is more than 10%. Prevalence estimates of anxiety disorders are generally higher in developed countries than in developing countries. Most anxiety dis orders are more prevalent in women than in men. One study estimated the annual cost of anxiety disorders in the United States to be approximately $42.3 billion in the 1990s, a majority of which was due to non- psychiatric medical treatment costs. This estimate focused on short -term effects and did not include the effect of outcomes such as the increased risk of other disorders.

Anxiety can diminish or completely debilitate a person from interviewing for a job, making day to day decisions, making personal relationships or thriving. Instead of dealing and treating anxiety, the world instead decided to call anxiety being an introvert. An \"introvert\" is a \"shy, reticent person\". In other w ords, a person who has so much anxiety that they would rather hide than speak to someone else. Shyness is anxiety. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/social -anxiety -disorder -more -than-just-shyness/index.shtml The reason this \"Anx iety\" and not \"social anxiety disorder\" is because each year there seems to be a new disorder with the core symptom being anxiety. Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, PTSD. Anxiety is the common condition. https://www.n imh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any -anxiety -disorder.shtml Any Anxiety Disorder with Impairment Among Adults Of adults with any anxiety disorder in the past year, degree of impairment ranged from mild to severe, as shown in Figure 2. Impairment was determined by scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale. Among adults with any anxiety disorder, an estimated 22.8% had serious impairment , and 33.7% had moderate impairment.1 A majority of people with any anxiety disorder experienced mild impairment (43.5%). 1 1.

Data Table 2: 12- month prevalence DSM -IV/WMH -CIDI disorders by sex and cohort. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181171/ Although the principal symptoms of anxiety disorders include fear, excessive worry, nervousness, and obsessions, a multitude of physical symptoms also may be present. These somatic symptoms \u2014which include heart palpitations, gastrointestinal problems, sweating, fainting, and chronic pain\u2014 can confound the diagnosis and resist all forms of medical management, unless the underlying anxiety source is identified and treated. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can be expensive for the patient, physician, and society: unnecessary tests and ineffective treatments increase medical costs, and anxiety symptoms may lead to loss of income and productivity, financial dependence, and even suicide.

Selected quotes and transcribed tables are taken from the following research and presented below. 1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998228/ Ninety -seven per cent of respondents used cannabis primarily for chronic pain. Average pain improvement on a 0- 10 pain scale was 5.0 (from 7.8 to 2.8), which translates to a 64% relative decrease in average pain. Half of all respondents also noted relief from stress/anxiety , and nearly half (45%) reported relief from insomnia. Most patients (71%) reported no adverse effects, while 6% reported a cough or throat irritation and 5% feared arrest even though medical cannabis is legal in Hawai'i. No serious adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that Cannabis is an extremely safe and effective medication for many chronic pain patients. Cannabis appears to alleviate pain, insomnia, and may be helpful in relieving anxiety. Cannabis has shown extreme promise in the treatment of numerous medical problems and deserves to be released from the current Schedule I federal prohibition against research and prescription. 2. https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477- 7517- 2-18 Approximately three quarters of participants (71%) claimed to have experienced a return of their symptoms or condition on stopping cannabis, especially: pain (53% of those who claimed areturn of symptoms), depression or anxiety (30%), insomnia (11%), spasm (10%) and nausea/vomiting https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2007.09.002 A randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial was conducted to determine the benefit of nabilone in pain management and quality of life improvement in 40 patients with fibromyalgia. There were significant decreases in the VAS, FIQ, and anxiety in the nabilone treated group at 4 weeks. There were no significant improvements in the placebo g roup. The treatment group experienced more side effects per person at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Nabilone appears to be a beneficial, well -tolerated treatment option for fibromyalgia patients, with significant benefits in pain relief and functional improvement. 4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2683812/ Thematic analysis revealed that these teens differentiated themselves from recreational users and positioned their use of marijuana for relief by emphasizing their inability to find other ways to deal with their health problems, the sophisticated ways in which they titrated their intake, and the benefits that they experienced. These teens used marijuana to gain relief from difficult feelings (including depression, anxiety and stress), sleep difficulties, problems with concentration and physical pain. 5. https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2011.587700 Of 1,746 patients, 37.8% self -reported therapeutic benefits from medical marijuana for anxiety. 16.9% of patients self -reported therapeutic benefits from medical marijuana for panic attacks. 6. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6117575 The results of the study showed a dramatic improvement in anxiety in the nabilone group when compared with placebo (P less than 0.001). Side effects reported were dry mouth, dry eyes, and drowsiness. Patients did not report any of the subjective \"altered state\" experience of marihuana. 7. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857739 Following Ethics Committee approval, HIV -positive individuals attending a large clinic were recruited into an anonymous cross- sectional questionnaire study. Up to one- third (27%, 143/523) reported using cannabis for treating symptoms. Patients reported improved appetite (97%), muscle pain (94%), nausea (93%), anxiety (85%). 8. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5101100/ Cannabidiol oil, an increasingly popular treatment of anxiety and sleep issues, has been documented as being an effective alternative to pharmaceutical medications. This case study provides clinical data that support the use of cannabidiol oil as a safe treatment for reducing anxiety and improving sleep in a young girl with posttraumatic stress disorder. 9. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24095000 Patients reported using cannabis to treat multiple symptoms, with sleep, pain, and anxiety being the most common. Cannabis was perceived to provide effect ive symptoms relief across medical conditions. Patterns of use were also consistent across medical conditions. Notable differences were observed with regard to modes of access. 10. https:/ /www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15184623/ Of 21 patients reporting stress, 20 said medical marijuana helped moderate- complete relief. Of 16 patients reporting mood, all 16 said medical marijuana helped moderate -complete relief. The symptoms reported by medical cannabis users to be most effectively relieved were stress, sleep, mood, stiffness/spasm, and pain. 11. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5312634/ Finally, preliminary clinical trials suggest that high -dose oral CBD (150- 600 mg per day) may exert a therapeutic effect for epilepsy, insomnia, and social anxiety disorder. Nonetheless, such doses of CBD have also been shown to cause sedation. 12. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5165161/ In addition, we have assessed the role of the cannabinoid system and marijuana constituents in neuroprotection as well as considered other beneficial effects of marijuana. Marijuana has been shown to improve nonmotor symptoms of PD such as depression, pain, sleep, and anxiety. Moreover, components of cannabis have been dem onstrated to have neuroprotective effect due to their anti - inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiexcitotoxic properties. 13. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26317379 367 medical marijuana patients in Arizona were surveyed. 181 patients reported using medical marijuana to experience relief from Anxiety 164 patients reported using medical marijuana to experience relief from Stress. General relief from Anxiety symptoms was 82.9% and 87.2% for Stress, Relief by medical marijuana compared to other medications was 79.3% for Anxiety and 91.6 for Stress. Less frequent use of other medications was 85.9% for Anxiety and 79.1% for Stress. 14. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3285527/ One Hundred Canadian medical marijuana patients were surveyed in 2007 -2008. 60.2% said they used medical marijuana to reduce anxiety. 15. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262744/ This exploratory study examined the patterns of medicinal cannabis use among a sample of 128 Australian adults who responded to media stories about this issue. Nearly one in ten (8%) reported no effect on depression or anxiety . More than one in ten (14%) specified that while cannabis could ease their symptoms and enabled them to cope, they realised that it could not cure their underlying condition. Approximately three quarters o f participants (71%) claimed to have experienced a return of their symptoms or condition on stopping cannabis, especially: pain (53% of those who claimed a return of symptoms), depression or anxiety (30%) , insomnia (11%), spasm (10%) and nausea/vomiting or lack of appetite (9%). Almost two thirds (62%) of respondents claimed that they decreased or discontinued their use of other medicines when they started using cannabis medicinally. This was more common in males (65% vs. 58% of females) and older partic ipants (aged 50 years +) (70% vs. 59% among younger participants). For some people this was a substantial change, representing a shift away from chronic, high- dose medication use. Perhaps not surprisingly, cannabis was typically perceived as superior to other medications in terms of undesirable effects, and the extent of relief provided . Thus, cannabis was rated to produce equivalent (8%) or worse side effects (3%) by a minority of therapeutic users. It was considered to work \"a bit\" or \"much better\" t han other medicines, or to be the only source of relief, by more than three quarters (82%). 16. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189912 In regards to conditions, pain- related conditions were the most common, reported by 53% of participants (n = 144; chronic pain 36%; (n = 98), arthritis 12% (n = 32), headache 5% (n = 14)). The second most prominent class was mental health (eating disorder, PTSD & psyc hiatric disorder), reported by 15% (n = 41). Other prominent conditions included gastrointestinal disorders (11%, n = 29), insomnia (7%, n = 18) and multiple sclerosis (4%, n = 11). In regards to symptoms; the most highly endorsed were chronic pain (73%, n = 197), stress (60%,n=162), insomnia (57%, n = 155), depression (46%, n = 126) and headache (32%, n = 87). g astrointestinal (GI) issues also featured prominently, with 29% (n = 79) citing appetite loss and another 29% (n = 79) nausea. Cannabis was per ceived to be very effective at symptom relief, with 95% (n = 257) reporting that it \"often\" or \"always\" helped alleviate their symptoms. 17. https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.12323 Participants presented with the range of conditions that is generally consistent with surveys of CTP users, the most prominent conditions being pain (32%), mood (i.e. anxiety and depression (18%), arthritis (15%), HIV (10%), gastrointestinal disorder (7%) 18. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5422566/ We previously reported in an earlier survey that of 1,429 respondents, 61% reported using cannabis for managing pain, 58% reported using cannabis for anxiety and 50% reported using cannabis for depression. In the current analysis, these same conditions were also the most commonly reported conditions by respondents. Of the 1,040 participants reporting pain and/or intractable pain, 619 (59.52%) reported depression and anxiety as comorbidities. As such, t he odds of reporting substituting cannabis for prescription drugs were more than one and a half times greater (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.27- 2.16) among those reporting using it to manage pain, anxiety and depression than among those using it to manage only one of the three conditions. This team previously reported that in a survey of 1,429 medical cannabis users, 61% reported cannabis use for pain, 58% reported cannabis use for anxiety and 50% reported using cannabis to manage depression. In 2016, Dale and Stace y reported that those using cannabis for pain were more likely to be substituting for prescription drugs. In 2017, Walsh et al published a review of medical cannabis and mental health to try to better understand how medical cannabis use may impact areas of potential concern for clinicians. \"Relaxation and relief of anxiety\" and \"relief of negative mood\" or depression were among the most widely reported conditions in 60 publications included in their analysis. Because it is common for chronic pain patients to be prescribed combinatorial pharmacotherapy to address comorbidity with depression and/or anxiety, it is largely unknown how often patients may be discontinuing prescription medications when initiating cannabis use. Taken with preclinical data on the role of the endocannabinoid system in stress, pain processing and immune homeostasis, it is clear that future investigation is warranted using controlled trials with human subjects to better understand the role that cannabis may play in treating pai n, anxiety, depression and other conditions. 19. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277530/ Most of the respondents (from the clinic and online groups) reported that cannabis improved their mood , pain, muscle spasms, and sleep. 20. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11210205 Of 628 Canadian medical marijuana patients: 463 patients reported using medic al marijuana to treat anxiety. This article reports on an exploratory study of medical cannabis users. Interviews were completed with 50 self -identified medical cannabis users recruited through notices in newspapers and on bulletin boards. They reported using cannabis for a variety of conditions including HIV -AIDS -related problems, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, menstrual cramps, migraine, narcotic addiction as well as everyday aches, pains , stresses and sleeping difficulties. However, cannabis was also used to treat menstrual cramps, anorexia, narcotic addiction, migraine, Tourette's Syndrome, lupus, Grave 's Disease, epilepsy, retinitis, chemotherapy -induced loss of appetite, Crohn 's Disease, arthritis and everyday aches, pains, stresses and sleeping difficulties. Many reported benefits of cannabis were consistent with those reported elsewhere. Cannabis was typically used for its sedative, analgesic, antispasmodic, appetite stimulating, anticonvulsant and euphoric properties. These properties were well known in the past century when cannabis was used to treat conditions that required medications with these properties. Although scientific evidence in favor of medical cannabis is limited (Gurley, Aranow & Katz 1998), self -treatment with cannabis could become popular as more users publicize their own experiences. This is especially so if the everyday aches and pains and psychological problems are promoted as medical reasons for using cannabis. 21. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2683812/ The use of marijuana to manage stress and anxiety was described by 12 teens in our sample. Dealing with bullying at school, heavy demands of school work, taxing shifts at work, and just \"giving as much as you can\" along side difficult relationships with parents or guardians, and receiving threats from neighbors all took its toll on these youth. For some, these experiences contributed to high levels of stress and anxiety, and for others uncomfortable levels of anger - both were difficult to manage. Although some had friends they could turn to, marijuana provided an additional source of stress relief that was ready at hand. \"Lots of people know me, know I do pot and they think that I'm a pot head but really the thing they don't realize is that I have a reason for it. It's for my stress and an antidepressant. I get really upset. It [pot] helps me feel better about myself, because you know people don't do that [help me], like m y friend [name] can, but nobody else can.\" [Female, 14 years, non- daily use] There was general agreement among the teens that marijuana calmed them down, and helped them feel \"not so nervous\" and \"not so uptight about everything.\" One teen recognized, however, that despite the fact that marijuana could be a very effective stress reliever, it might not work for everyone: \"Well as far as pot goes, the good thing is that it's definitely a stress reliever, hands down. I know lots of people who would be just a complete wreck if they weren't smoking pot but then there's also people who are a complete wreck because they do smoke pot, so it's kind of a hard thing.\" [Male, 16 years, non- daily use] 22. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691841/ While the controversies surrounding cannabis are far from subdued (and are often permeated and masked by conflicting ideological credos), standardized studies on cannabinoids have highlighted that the psychological and behavioral outcomes of this substance are highly variable and range from relaxation, euthymia and heightened sociability to panic, paranoid ideation and psychosis [ 112 - 116 ]. A corollary of this observation is that the high c omorbidity rate between cannabis use disorders and psychiatric conditions [ 100 - 105 ] may indicate that cannabis consumption is either a concurring cause or a \"self -therapeutic\" strategy for anxiety and mood disorders [ 117 - 123 ]. The latter interpret ation is supported by the observation that anxiety -spectrum disturbances and traumas in early developmental stages are a strong predictor for later cannabis use disorders [ 124 - 127 ]; furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that the anxiolytic eff ects of THC may partially account for the high prevalence of cannabis use in patients affected by PTSD [ 128 - 131 ] and OCD [ 132 ]. Accordingly, recent clinical studies have shown that THC elicits therapeutic effects in OCD [ 133 ] and trichotillomania, an impulse- control disorder characterized by compulsive hair -pulling [ 134 ]. 23. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604171/ Overall, current evidence indicates CBD has considerable potential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders, with need for further study of chronic and therapeutic effects in relevant clinical populations. 24. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604174/ Although clinical studies in this area are difficult to do, even in countries where the use of cannabis has been al lowed for years, there is a clear role for cannabis products in symptom management for these difficult conditions. 25. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22729452 RESULTS: Studies using anim al models of anxiety and involving healthy volunteers clearly suggest an anxiolytic -like effect of CBD. Moreover, CBD was shown to reduce anxiety in patients with social anxiety disorder. CONCLUSION: Future clinical trials involving patients with different anxiety disorders are warranted, especially of panic disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The adequate therapeutic window of CBD and the precise mechanisms involved in its anxiolytic acti on remain to be determined. 26. https://doi.org/10.2202/1941- 2851.1017 1655 Patients reported using medical marijuana for these conditions: Anxiety disorders 18.7% of patients Applicants most frequently reported using medical marijuana for pain relief (82.6%), improved sleep (70.6%), and relaxation (55.6%) . The next most frequently reported benefits included relief of muscle spasms (41.3%), headache (40.8%), relief of anxiety (38.1%) , improved appetite (38.0%), relief of nausea and vomiting (27.7%), and relief of depression (26.1%). Half the applicants (50.8%) reported using marijuana as a substitute for prescription medication and 13.2% reported using marijuana as a substitute for alcohol. 27. https://doi.org/ 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07061016 Hence, it can be speculated that the anti -obsessive effect observed in our patients may have been a consequence of the glutam ate modulation of the cannabinoid dronabinol. 28. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349825/ The findings from the study indicate that cannabis use is associated with a subsequent changein positive affect, depressive symptoms and manic symptoms over the course of daily life. No evidence for the use of cannabis to self - medicate minor fluctuations in negative affect or BD symptoms was revealed. Participants in the study were currently well and out of episode. Future research should explore whether the self -medication hypothesis is more relevant to individuals that are in the acute stages of depres sion or mania. This would be consistent with the broader self - medication hypothesis in BD where individuals have reported finding cannabis useful in the management of their symptoms. 29. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9692379 The authors present case histories indicating that a number of patients find cannabis (marihuana) useful in the treatment of their bipolar disorder. Some used it to treat mania, depression, or both. They stated that it was more effective than conventional drugs, or helped relieve the side effects of those drugs. One woman found that cannabis curbed her manic rages; she and her husband have worked to make it legally available as a medicine. Others described the us e of cannabis as a supplement to lithium (allowing reduced consumption) or for relief of lithium's side effects. Another case illustrates the fact that medical cannabis users are in danger of arrest, especially when children are encouraged to inform on pa rents by some drug prevention programs. An analogy is drawn between the status of cannabis today and that of lithium in the early 1950s, when its effect on mania had been discovered but there were no controlled studies. In the case of cannabis, the law has made such studies almost impossible, and the only available evidence is anecdotal. The potential for cannabis as a treatment for bipolar disorder unfortunately can not be fully explored in the present social circumstances. 30. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898690/ Findings suggest that for some bipolar patients, marijuana may result in partial alleviation of clinical symptoms. Moreover, this improvement is not at the expense of additional cognitive impairment. 31. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17703715 Subjective reports by patients suggest an overall positive effect, but these may be unreliable. We herein report a case in which mood data was prospectively collected over two years of total substance abstinence and two years of extreme marijuana use. Marijuana use did not alter the total number of days of abnormal mood, however, marijuana was associated with an increase in the number of hypomanic days and a decrease in the number of depressed days. While not conclusive, the data suggest that marijuana may indeed have an effect on mood in bipolar patients that needs to be systematically examine d. 32. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5652027/ Cannabis use diminishes some of the adverse effects of neurological and psychiatric disorders. 33. https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4323143/ These results suggest that cannabis use has clinical implications for the early course of BD (Bipolar Disorder) by increasing mood level. 34. https://doi. org/10.1111/j.1368- 5031.2005.00271.x Medicinal cannabis use was Reported by patients with chronic pain(25%), multiple sclerosis and depression (22% each), arthritis (21%) and neuropathy (19%).

Minnesota has undertaken the most comprehensive research on the medical cannabis patients in its medical cannabis program in the United States. Including surveys by both the patients and their physicians. Tracking which medical cannabis products they purchase, use and continue using to treat each qualifying condition. The Minnesota Department of Health publishes reports of the medical cannabis patients and how medical marij uana helps them with anxiety. In its first year of reports, the Minnesota DOH published patient comments about the beneficial effects of the medical marijuana. (REF #98) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/firstyearreport.html (REF #94) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/appendixa.pdf Many such comments are found within the above report. Further reports in the following years also track which patients under each condition report benefits of medical marijuana on anxiety. https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/omcreport.html https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/cohort.html (REF #93) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/cohort/2015_2016_benefitspse.pdf The patient self -evaluation is required for patients to complete prior to each medical cannabis purchase. It includes questions to assess symptom severit y, some of which are administered to all patients (standard set of 8 symptom measures) and some of which are tailored to symptoms for a given condition (condition- specific symptom measures). Since symptom data is collected prior to each patient's first medical cannabis purchase, symptom changes can be assessed over time and compared to baseline (baseline = patient responses to symptom questions just prior to their first medical cannabis purchase) These reports are useful to show that medical marijuana pati ents find a greater than 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms, and a large percentage of patients continue to maintain that reduction of anxiety for 4 months. (REF #92) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/cohort/2016_2017_benefitspse.pdf (REF #91) https://www.health.state .mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/cohort/c2015_2017_benefitspse.pdf MDOH publishes Adverse Side Effects reports which show a very small percentage of people experience a worsening of anxiety symptoms.

I also had a Warning of illegal drug use in a urine test from the so called pain clinic I'm required to go to by [CLINIC]By my now ex primary Dr of 20 years. I told the pain clinic when I signed contract not to use illegal drugs that I took cannabis by prescription in medical form thru Dept of Health etc. The Dr said OK, as long as it wasn't in organic form for smoking! He said I was the 1st patient at [CLINIC]to be on legal cannabis. I advised him, I maybe to 1st but surely not the last patient. They said this wi ll be resolved ok but I still was warned for illegal THC drug use, which is upsetting but it will be straightened out. Thank u! Massachusetts published a report on its medical marijuana patients and their Health Study (MBHS) A legislative mandate required the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to conduct a baseline study to investigate marijuana use in Massachusetts. The report published confirms the consensus that marijuana use improves mood and or mental health for a large percentage of people. Page 10: Among all respondents, 78% reported positive changes in their mood or mental health, and 67% reported improved physical health. In addition, 83% of respondents reported no negative outcomes/consequences related to their marijuana use. Page 148: Results from this survey suggest that respondents appear to be treating a wide range of medical conditions, and often more than one at a time. The top 5 medical conditions being treated were anxiety (60% or all respondents), chronic pain (46%), insomnia (43%), depression (42%), and stress (41%), and the average number of conditions being treated by medical marijuana is 4.7.

This petition includes new scientific research supporting the request to add \"Anxiety\" as a qualifying condition that was not present in the \"General Anxiety Disorder\" petition. This petition should be reviewed and not rejected for its similarity to an earlier petition due to the new evidence published by the Minnesota Department of Health , the Massachusettes Department of Health and other peer -reviewed medical research attached and Health Study (MBHS) A legislative mandate required the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to conduct a baseline study to investigate marijuana use in Massachusetts. The report published confirms the consensus that marijuana use improves mood and or mental health for a large percentage of people. Page 148: Results from this survey suggest that respondents appear to be treating a wide range of medical conditions, and often more than one at a time.

In the 1999 National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine report on marijuana, the National Academy of Science found that thorough medical research shows that marijuana reduces anxiety movement disorders most often considered for marijuana or cannabinoid therapy are dystonia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Tourette's syndrome. Movement disorders are often transiently exacerbated by stress and activity and improved by factors that reduce str ess. This is of particular interest because for many people marijuana reduces anxiety . In a study of medical marijuana patients in Arizona, many patients reported significant relief levels of anxiety. (REF #13) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26317379 367 medical marijuana patients in Arizona were surveyed. 181 patients reported using medical marijuana to experience relief from Anxiety General relief from Anxiety symptoms was 82.9% with medical marijuana, Relief by medical marijuana compared to other medications was 79.3% for Anxiety Less frequent use of other medications was 85.9% for Anxiety Patients who suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder find relief of anxiety with medical cannabis. PTSD is a qualifying condition in Hawaii and other states. It makes logical sense to allow people who do not have PTSD to gain relief of anxiety by adding anxiety to the list of qualifying conditions. In a small percentage of people, medical cannabis can aggravate t heir anxiety. For the majority of people, cannabis reduces anxiety. This contraindication is similar to other anti -anxiety prescriptions, for whom a small percentage, their anxiety can be aggravated. This is not a reason to reject a qualifying condition, merely a reality of using any medication. Some epilepsy medicines make seizures worse or more frequent. Marijuana is safer than all prescription medications and most of OTC medications. Cannabis has less side effects, and no severe, toxic or dangerous side effects compared to all of the prescription medications used to treat Anxiety. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental -health- medications/index.shtm l For example Benzodiazepines commonly used as anti anxiety medic ations, are responsible for hundreds of deaths each year in the United States. of anxiety and stress is one of the most common reasons that people give for using marijuana Anti-Anxiety medication Ativan may be implicated in Soundgarden's http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/ativan- what -you-need- -anxiety -pills-w483638 A safety profile of Medical Marijuana can be found in the first year report of the Minnesota medical marijuana program. The Minnesota Department of Health surveyed 1500+ medical marijuana patients enrolled in the program. (REF #98) https://www.health.stat e.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/firstyearreport.html Adverse Side Effects: At this point, the safety profile of the medical cannabis products available through the Minnesota program seems quite favorable. Approximately 20 -25% of enrolled patients report negative physical or mental side effects of some kind, with the majority - around 60% - reporting only one and 90% reporting three or fewer. The vast majority of adverse side effects, around 90%, are mild to moderate in severity. An assessment of the 30 pa tients reporting severe side effects, meaning \"interrupts usual daily activities,\" found no apparent pattern of patient age, medical condition, or type of medical cannabis used. The most common adverse side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, and fatigue. Fortunately, up to the present no serious adverse events (life threatening or requiring hospitalization) have been reported. Medical Marijuana's mild to moderate side effects of dry mouth, drowsiness and fatigue are easily tolerated by the vast majority o f patients. The Mayo Clinic website has assembled dosage information on Medical Marijuana. http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs -supplements/marijuana/dosing/hrb -20059701 In the latest petition to add Anxiety to Ohio's medical marijuana program, the New Jersey Department of Health's final decision on a petition to add anxiety in New Jersey was included. (REF 96) https://med.ohio.gov/Portals/0/Publications/Medical%20Marijuana%20Petitions%202019/0133%20- %20Anxiety%20[Rosenberger].pdf?ver=2020- 01-28-104750- 247 (REF 97) https://www.nj.gov/health/medicalmarijuana/documents/agency_decision_letters/MMP_FAD_conditions_012319.p df New cannabis program is similar to Hawaii's medical cannabis program. With similar requirements for petitions to meet. On July 5, 2016, the Department published the Request for Petitions in the New Jersey Register advising that from August 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016, it was accepting petitions to establish additional medical conditions as \"debilitating\" under the MMP. 43 NJR. 1395(a). The Request for Petitions stated that the Department was seeking petitions in accordance with the Act, which authorizes the Department to include additional debilitating medical conditions under the MMP. In the Request for Petitions, the publ ic was advised that submitted petitions were required to include the following information, pursuant to N.J.A.C. 8:64- 53: (1) The extent to which the condition is generally accepted by the medical community and other experts as a valid, existing medical c ondition; (2) If one or more treatments of the condition, rather than the condition itself. are alleged to be the cause of the patient's suffering, the extent to which the treatments causing suffering are generally accepted by the medical community and ot her experts as valid treatments for the condition; (3) The extent to which the condition itself andfor the treatments thereof cause severe suffering, such as severe and/or chronic pain. severe nausea and/or vomiting, or othenrvise severely impair the pati ent's ability to carry on activities of daily living; (4) The availability of conventional medical therapies other than those that cause suffering to alleviate suffering caused by the condition andlorthe treatment thereof; (5) The extent to which evidenc e that is generally accepted among the medical community and other experts supports a nding that the use of marijuana alleviates suffering caused by the condition and/or the treatment thereof; and (6) Letters of support from physicians or other licensed health care professional knowledgeable about the condition. New Jersey found that Anxiety met the requirements and accepted Anxiety as a qualifying condition. Anxiety Based upon my independent review of the petitions, I am granting those seeking to add anxiety to the MMP. In coming to this conclusion, I reviewed these petitions against the six regulatory criteria cited above and found that the condition meets the requirements for inclusion in the MMP. Regarding the rst factor, which is whether the condition is generally accepted in the medical community as a valid medical condition, I find that anxiety satisfies this criteria. Specically, the American Psychiatric Association defines anxiety and anxiety disorders as conditions characterized by excessiv e fear and behavioral disturbances. Anxiety results from anticipation of a future threat and may be associated with symptoms of muscle tension, vigilance in preparation for future danger, and overly cautious or avoidant behaviors. Additionally, there are m ultiple ICD- 10-CM codes for anxiety disorders. Because anxiety maintains a common definition in the medical community and has |CD \u201410\u2014CM codes, I nd that anxiety is a valid and recognized medical condition. Under the second factor, I must consider whether the treatments for the condition, rather than the condition itself, are causing the patient's suffering and the extent to which the treatments causing the patient suffering are generally accepted by the medical community and other experts as valid treatments for the condition. From my review of this condition, the generally accepted treatments for anxiety are dependent on the symptoms and the severity of the particular disorder. Mild and moderate forms of anxiety may not require a pharmacologic interventi on, but may necessitate other forms of treatment, such as meditation, mindfulness, breathing techniques as well as psychotherapy (counseling) or cognitive therapy.\" The most common classes of medications used to combat anxiety disorders are antidepressants , anti -anxiety drugs, and beta\u2014 blockers.49 Antidepressants are safe and effective but they may be risky for children, teens, and young adults.50 Antidepressants aiso come with a \"black box\" warning \u2014 the FDA's strongest warning \u2014 advising that some people may have suicidal thoughts or make suicide attempts while taking the medication.51 The most common anti -anxiety medications are called benzodiazepines. As noted by the Panel, the common sides effects of benzodiazepines include headache, confusion, tiredness, and in some causes nightmares and memory impairments.52 And, benzodiazepines carry a risk of dependence and addiction.53 Furthermore, the FDA notes that the number of patients who were prescribed both an opioid analgesic and benzodiazepine increased by 41% between 2002 and 2014.54 As a result, the FDA requires black box warnings and patient -focused Medication Guides for prescription opioid analgesics, opioid- containing cough products, and benzodiazepines to inform the patient about the serious risks ass ociated with using these medications at the same time.55 Thus, I find that the treatments for anxiety are recognized and accepted by the medical community as the treatments forthis condition and relate to the suffering of the patient. As for the third fac tor, which is whether the condition itself andfor the treatments thereof cause severe suffering, such as severe andior chronic pain, severe nausea andlor vomiting or othenntise severely impair the patient's ability to carry on activities of daily living, I nd that both the anxiety condition itself as well as the treatments for this condition cause severe suffering for patients. Specifically, anxiety may lead to problems that negatively impact an individual's activities of daily iiving and quaiity of life and may lead to suicide and depression. Anxiety disorders can also cause signicant distress or interfere with social, occupational, and other areas of functioning. In fact, an estimated 31.1% of US. adults experience an anxiety disorder at some time in their lives.56 Medications, in some instances, may exacerbate the symptoms and are associated with debilitating side effects that can prevent a patient from engaging in activities of daily living, thereby diminishing one's quality of life. Accordingly, I nd that both the condition of anxiety as well as the therapies to treat it cause severe suffering. Under the fourth factor, I must evaluate the availability of conventional medical therapies, other than those that cause suffering, to alleviate the patients s uffering caused by the condition and or the treatment thereof. As discussed above, mild and moderate forms of anxiety may be treated with meditation, mindfulness, breathing techniques as well as counseling or cognitive therapy that can be effective. Progression to medication therapy may be initiated; however, in both instances, one must consider the therapeutic response. Failure to respond to therapies or side effects associated with treatments may result in signicant impacts on quality of life. As such, I find that there is an absence of medicaIIy -accepted, alternative medical therapies to the conventional therapies currently prescribed for migraine that cause suffering. Regarding the fth factor, which is whether there is generally accepted evidence in t he medical community that the use of marijuana alleviates suffering relating to the condition, I find that cannabis is generaliy accepted as an effective treatment for anxiety. The Panel discussed medical evidence that cannabis may exacerbate anxiety sympt oms or that an effect related to cannabis may be associated with anxiety, such as dependence and cravings. Literature suggests that individuals with anxiety sensitivity may be more likely to turn to cannabis as a mechanism for coping with stress, which may in turn lead to problematic use behaviors.57 However, the Panel further discussed a review published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2017, which found that there is limited evidence that cannabidiol is an effective trea tment for the improvement of anxiety symptoms, which was assessed by a public speaking test utilizing individuais with social anxiety disorders.58 On balance, the Panel recommended adding anxiety as an allowable condition under the MMP as research suggests that it could be helpful to some patients with this condition. I agree. While marijuana may not be effective for all anxiety sufferers, there is research evidencing that it may be helpful to some, especially those with social anxiety disorders. Thus , I find that there is acceptance in the medical community that marijuana is likely to relieve the suffering associated with some anxiety conditions. However, like any medical condition, the use of medical marijuana to treat anxiety must be explored by the medical professional treating the patient to determine whether it is the best and most appropriate course of treatment for the patient. As for the nal factor, which is whether there were letters from physicians or other licensed health care professional s knowledgeable about the condition supporting the inclusion of anxiety under the MMP, I nd that the petitions were submitted with support from medical professionals. Based upon the above analysis, | find that the condition of anxiety is \"debilitating\" and that medical marijuana is more likely than not to be potentially beneficial to treat or alleviate the debilitating effect of this condition. As such, I nd that anxiety should be added to the MMP. In a previous qualifying condition petition for General ized Anxiety Disorder, the Director of Health at the Hawaii Department of Health rejected adding the condition to the medical marijuana program. The main reason being that there is a lack of peer -reviewed scientific evidence showing beneficial use to treat GAD. This idea that peer -reviewed scientific evidence needs to conclusively show medical benefit or else no other qualifying conditions could be approved is wrong; due to the political nature of marijuana. Please allow me to explain. The Hawaii medical cannabis law was created based on medical and anecdotal evidence. Anecdotal evidence was accepted because there is a lack of scientific research on the benefits of marijuana. Due to cannabis's placement in schedule 1 of controlled substances in both state and federal laws. Quoting from the Hawaii Medical Cannabis Law: https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2000/acts/Act228_SB862_HD1_.htm There is sufficient medical and anecdotal evidence to support the proposition that these diseases and conditions may respond favorably to a medically controlled use of marijuana. This lack of research is due to the funding of marijuana research being regulated by NIDA, the National I nstitute of Drug Abuse. NIDA's purpose is investigating the abuse potential of drugs, including cannabis, with focus solely on trying to prove the negatives of marijuana use. Since NIDA funds negative effects of marijuana research, research is granted on the flimsiest of theories and has corrupted and biased science. Forcing researchers to chase more NIDA grants for research to ensure they continue to have jobs. Negative research findings are promoted wildly by NIDA when they are published. Even if the methodology of the study is flawed beyond belief. Even when other researchers try to duplicate the results and fail, NIDA continues to promote the flawed study as though it still has merit. An example of this can be found on that the twins' IQ was affected by factors that twins share in their genes or family background, rather than factors in which they differed (e.g., drug use). A further analysis, comparing the impact of marijuana use on fraternal vers us identical twins, suggested that family -wide environmental influences are more decisive than genes for determining IQ trajectory. NIDA, without any evidence to back up the statement, goes on: These findings contrast but are not entirely inconsistent wi th those of an earlier study that linked teen- onset regular marijuana use to IQ deficits in the fourth decade of life (see Early -Onset, Regular Cannabis Use Is Linked to IQ Decline). The researchers say that although their evidence indicates that marijuana exposure does not cause persistent loss of intellectual function up to age 20, prolonged regular exposure for decades might do so. NIDA contradicts itself often, and continues to promote failed theories that bear no relationship to reality. Especially trying to say that marijuana is a gateway drug. https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research -reports/marijuana/marijuana -gateway -drug These findings are consistent with the idea of marijuana as a \"gateway drug.\" However, the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, \"harder\" substances. A more sinister theory promoted by NIDA, the DEA, and even physicians is that marijuana use increases the risk of Schizophrenia. This is so unbelievable that it is a slap in the face of science. Simply looking at reality, the larger numbers of people using, or admitting to use of marijuana, the large number of registered medical cannabis pat ients in the USA (roughly 1,000,000 to 2,000,000) and the flat schizophrenia rates as reported by the NIH and WHO completely invalidate all peer -reviewed published research on the topic of marijuana causing schizophrenia. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/st atistics/schizophrenia.shtml https://www.who.int/news -room/fact -sheets/detail/schizophrenia In fact, a percentage of people diagnosed with schizophrenia use marijuana to reduce anxiety and help with symptoms. People with more severe schizophrenia use more marijuana, this is the basis for the theory that marijuana causes more severe symptoms of schizophrenia. Similar thinking is used against patients who have more severe pain, that marijuana somehow makes pain worse for patients and they have to use more m arijuana to gain pain relief. Instead of the observable theory that people with more severe pain use more marijuana to treat their more severe pain than people who have less severe pain. No one makes the theory that aspirin makes pain worse, because people with more pain use more aspirin. Bad science. The whole point of a state medical marijuana law is that the federal government has engineered a catch- 22 circular logic loop about marijuana. States, mostly via people's ballot initiatives have sideswiped the FDA in approving a medicine. This is because the FDA has adopted a policy of only endorsing and approving of monotherapies , e.g. one or two isolated and specific chemicals per approved medicine. There is another policy to reject crude botanical medicines due to variations from plant to plant. These comments by the FDA are found in the DEA response to a petition to reschedule marijuana to schedule 2 and in congressional testimony. Even if a company submitted an IND to the FDA to study marijuana for the treatment of a disease, it would be rejected by the FDA on both of those policies. The catch -22 comes when patients, nurses, physicians, governors, senators and representatives suggest that marijuana be investigated as a medicine. In congressional t estimony, the FDA says we need more research before endorsing that. NIDA says we need more research before utilizing marijuana as a medicine. The DEA says we need more research before marijuana could be considered a medicine. So, if everyone agrees we need more research, where exactly is the research? Individual physicians have attempted to research the benefits of marijuana within universities. What happens is that, at every turn, approval to study is blocked, delayed and rejected. See for example the 10 years of trying to study medical marijuana for treatment of PTSD -of-planning- research -1.570986 Sisley and her team had to gain approval and support from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse to initiate the research - a process that lasted years. One study took several years just to begin. After NIDA provided marijuana for research that was full of seeds, stems and mold. https://health.hawaii.gov/medicalcannabisregistry/files/2017/08/Generalized -Anxiety -Disorder- 08.09.17 -Redacted.pdf The GAD petition submitted in 2017 included anecdotal evidence, peer -reviewed patient surveys, marijuana use reports and other information. It was rejected by the director due to not having enough peer -reviewed scientific research. One reason given for the rejection was that there was \"no specific evidence to GAD\". This is why exact specific conditions and waiting for peer -reviewed medical research will never work as an administrative rule for reviewing qualifying condition petitions. There will never be medical marijuana research that specifically mentions each of the hundreds of conditions that include anxiety as a symptom. Research studies are done with one drug and one condition. A rejection for not having a specific condition mentioned seems more like a pedantic nitpick and less like a legitimate reason when both GAD and anxiety share anxiety as the core symptom. This GAD petition rejection uses the same reason the federal government does not approve of medical marijuana. If this requirement barrier of peer -reviewed research was erected, no state would have a medical marijuana program. Due to the federal policies which are a de facto prohibition on research for medical marijuana benefits. These state medical marijuana progra ms were created because the federal government failed to do research, and continues to prohibit new research. While the reality is that cannabis is a non toxic medicine, has always been a medicine and always will be a medicine. Anxiety was also included w ith a bill in the Hawaii legislature to add qualifying conditions. The Department of Health testified, and in opposing the bill, the DOH stated it would rather include conditions via the petition process. The HDOH also gave another reason, that the dept wanted to delay adding the condition until dispensaries were active. Try naming another medication that is delayed and kept illegal because the department was waiting for a pharmacy to open. The DOH needs to stop these petty games played with sick people's lives, rights and freedoms. (REF #95) https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2018/testimony/SB174_TESTIMONY_CPH_02 -08-17.pdf This is another wrong- headed approach to the process, and ignores why and what the medical marijuana law does. Allow me to explain the purpose of the law and the role of the DOH in it. From the Hawaii medical cannabis law: The legislature is aware of the legal problems associat ed with the legal acquisition of marijuana for medical use. However, the legislature believes that medical scientific evidence on the medicinal benefits of marijuana should be recognized. ... Therefore, the purpose of this Act is to ensure that seriously ill people are not penalized by the State for the use of marijuana for strictly medical purposes when the patient's treating physician provides a professional opinion that the benefits of medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks for the qualifying patient. The whole point of the medical marijuana program is not to endorse, nor recommend medical marijuana to patients. The purpose of the law is to NOT PENALIZE patients using medical marijuana with recommendations from their physicians. To protect patients from the laws prohibiting the use of marijuana. Said another way, it is not the Department of Health's role to become the FDA and research medical marijuana. It is not the DOH's role to judge if medical marijuana is a medicine or not. It is not the DOH's role to decide which conditions marijuana is beneficial for either. That role is solely for a patient to decide if medical marijuana works for their conditi ons or not. Physicians have a role to make sure the patient's health is f irst priority over any medication. The DOH's only role in the petition process is to protect medical marijuana patients from arrest. People are currently illegally using marijuana to treat their conditions, specifically anxiety. The DOH has the power to protect these patients by adding qualifying conditions. Instead, the DOH has assumed the role of the FDA, denying petitions and opposing adding conditions legislatively. Waiting for peer -reviewed medical evidence that by all accounts is not comi ng within the next two decades. This delay and denial of the reality of medical marijuana patients conditions needs to stop.

Anxiety is a recognized medical condition affecting millions of Americans each year. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any -anxiety -disorder.shtml The wide variety of anxiety disorders differ by the objects or situations that induce them, but share features of excessive anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Anxiety disorders can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, school work, and relationships. Based on diagnostic interview data from the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS -R), Figure 1 shows past year prevalence of any anxiety disorder among U.S. adults aged 18 or older.1 An estimated 19.1% of U.S. adults had any anxiety disorder in the past year. Past year prevalence of any anxiety disorder was higher for females (23.4%) than for males (14.3%). An es timated 31.1% of U.S. adults experience any anxiety disorder at some time in their lives. Anxiety affects a large portion of the people in the United States, costing billions of dollars in medical treatment costs. https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/basics/burden.htm Anxiety: Anxiety disorders, which include panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder, phobias, and separation anxiety disorder, are the most common class of mental disorders present in the general population. The estimated lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder is over 15%, while the 12- month prevalence is more than 10%. Prevalence estimates of anxiety disorders are generally higher in developed countries than in developing countries. Most anxiety dis orders are more prevalent in women than in men. One study estimated the annual cost of anxiety disorders in the United States to be approximately $42.3 billion in the 1990s, a majority of which was due to non- psychiatric medical treatment costs. This estimate focused on short -term effects and did not include the effect of outcomes such as the increased risk of other disorders. (4) Describe the symptoms and other physiological or psychological effects experienced by an individual suffering from the medical condition or its treatment and the extent to which these symptoms and physiological or psychological effects are debilitating.

Please use standard AMA format as outlined in the instructions. Anxiety can cause a person to withdrawal from talking to other people or even going outside. Anxiety can diminish or completely debilitate a person from interviewing for a job, making day to day decisions, making personal relationships or thriving. Instead of dealing and treating anxiety, the world instead decided to call anxiety being an introvert. An \"introvert\" is a \"shy, reticent person\". In other w ords, a person who has so much anxiety that they would rather hide than speak to someone else. Shyness is anxiety. https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/social -anxiety -disorder -more -than-just-shyness/index.shtml The reason this \"Anx iety\" and not \"social anxiety disorder\" is because each year there seems to be a new disorder with the core symptom being anxiety. Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, PTSD. Anxiety is the common condition. https://www.n imh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any -anxiety -disorder.shtml Any Anxiety Disorder with Impairment Among Adults Of adults with any anxiety disorder in the past year, degree of impairment ranged from mild to severe, as shown in Figure 2. Impairment was determined by scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale. Among adults with any anxiety disorder, an estimated 22.8% had serious impairment , and 33.7% had moderate impairment.1 A majority of people with any anxiety disorder experienced mild impairment (43.5%). 1 1.

Data Table 2: 12- month prevalence DSM -IV/WMH -CIDI disorders by sex and cohort. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181171/ Although the principal symptoms of anxiety disorders include fear, excessive worry, nervousness, and obsessions, a multitude of physical symptoms also may be present. These somatic symptoms \u2014which include heart palpitations, gastrointestinal problems, sweating, fainting, and chronic pain\u2014 can confound the diagnosis and resist all forms of medical management, unless the underlying anxiety source is identified and treated. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can be expensive for the patient, physician, and society: unnecessary tests and ineffective treatments increase medical costs, and anxiety symptoms may lead to loss of income and productivity, financial dependence, and even suicide.

Selected quotes and transcribed tables are taken from the following research and presented below. 1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998228/ Ninety -seven per cent of respondents used cannabis primarily for chronic pain. Average pain improvement on a 0- 10 pain scale was 5.0 (from 7.8 to 2.8), which translates to a 64% relative decrease in average pain. Half of all respondents also noted relief from stress/anxiety , and nearly half (45%) reported relief from insomnia. Most patients (71%) reported no adverse effects, while 6% reported a cough or throat irritation and 5% feared arrest even though medical cannabis is legal in Hawai'i. No serious adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that Cannabis is an extremely safe and effective medication for many chronic pain patients. Cannabis appears to alleviate pain, insomnia, and may be helpful in relieving anxiety. Cannabis has shown extreme promise in the treatment of numerous medical problems and deserves to be released from the current Schedule I federal prohibition against research and prescription. 2. https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477- 7517- 2-18 Approximately three quarters of participants (71%) claimed to have experienced a return of their symptoms or condition on stopping cannabis, especially: pain (53% of those who claimed areturn of symptoms), depression or anxiety (30%), insomnia (11%), spasm (10%) and nausea/vomiting https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2007.09.002 A randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial was conducted to determine the benefit of nabilone in pain management and quality of life improvement in 40 patients with fibromyalgia. There were significant decreases in the VAS, FIQ, and anxiety in the nabilone treated group at 4 weeks. There were no significant improvements in the placebo g roup. The treatment group experienced more side effects per person at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Nabilone appears to be a beneficial, well -tolerated treatment option for fibromyalgia patients, with significant benefits in pain relief and functional improvement. 4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2683812/ Thematic analysis revealed that these teens differentiated themselves from recreational users and positioned their use of marijuana for relief by emphasizing their inability to find other ways to deal with their health problems, the sophisticated ways in which they titrated their intake, and the benefits that they experienced. These teens used marijuana to gain relief from difficult feelings (including depression, anxiety and stress), sleep difficulties, problems with concentration and physical pain. 5. https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2011.587700 Of 1,746 patients, 37.8% self -reported therapeutic benefits from medical marijuana for anxiety. 16.9% of patients self -reported therapeutic benefits from medical marijuana for panic attacks. 6. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6117575 The results of the study showed a dramatic improvement in anxiety in the nabilone group when compared with placebo (P less than 0.001). Side effects reported were dry mouth, dry eyes, and drowsiness. Patients did not report any of the subjective \"altered state\" experience of marihuana. 7. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857739 Following Ethics Committee approval, HIV -positive individuals attending a large clinic were recruited into an anonymous cross- sectional questionnaire study. Up to one- third (27%, 143/523) reported using cannabis for treating symptoms. Patients reported improved appetite (97%), muscle pain (94%), nausea (93%), anxiety (85%). 8. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5101100/ Cannabidiol oil, an increasingly popular treatment of anxiety and sleep issues, has been documented as being an effective alternative to pharmaceutical medications. This case study provides clinical data that support the use of cannabidiol oil as a safe treatment for reducing anxiety and improving sleep in a young girl with posttraumatic stress disorder. 9. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24095000 Patients reported using cannabis to treat multiple symptoms, with sleep, pain, and anxiety being the most common. Cannabis was perceived to provide effect ive symptoms relief across medical conditions. Patterns of use were also consistent across medical conditions. Notable differences were observed with regard to modes of access. 10. https:/ /www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15184623/ Of 21 patients reporting stress, 20 said medical marijuana helped moderate- complete relief. Of 16 patients reporting mood, all 16 said medical marijuana helped moderate -complete relief. The symptoms reported by medical cannabis users to be most effectively relieved were stress, sleep, mood, stiffness/spasm, and pain. 11. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5312634/ Finally, preliminary clinical trials suggest that high -dose oral CBD (150- 600 mg per day) may exert a therapeutic effect for epilepsy, insomnia, and social anxiety disorder. Nonetheless, such doses of CBD have also been shown to cause sedation. 12. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5165161/ In addition, we have assessed the role of the cannabinoid system and marijuana constituents in neuroprotection as well as considered other beneficial effects of marijuana. Marijuana has been shown to improve nonmotor symptoms of PD such as depression, pain, sleep, and anxiety. Moreover, components of cannabis have been dem onstrated to have neuroprotective effect due to their anti - inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiexcitotoxic properties. 13. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26317379 367 medical marijuana patients in Arizona were surveyed. 181 patients reported using medical marijuana to experience relief from Anxiety 164 patients reported using medical marijuana to experience relief from Stress. General relief from Anxiety symptoms was 82.9% and 87.2% for Stress, Relief by medical marijuana compared to other medications was 79.3% for Anxiety and 91.6 for Stress. Less frequent use of other medications was 85.9% for Anxiety and 79.1% for Stress. 14. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3285527/ One Hundred Canadian medical marijuana patients were surveyed in 2007 -2008. 60.2% said they used medical marijuana to reduce anxiety. 15. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262744/ This exploratory study examined the patterns of medicinal cannabis use among a sample of 128 Australian adults who responded to media stories about this issue. Nearly one in ten (8%) reported no effect on depression or anxiety . More than one in ten (14%) specified that while cannabis could ease their symptoms and enabled them to cope, they realised that it could not cure their underlying condition. Approximately three quarters o f participants (71%) claimed to have experienced a return of their symptoms or condition on stopping cannabis, especially: pain (53% of those who claimed a return of symptoms), depression or anxiety (30%) , insomnia (11%), spasm (10%) and nausea/vomiting or lack of appetite (9%). Almost two thirds (62%) of respondents claimed that they decreased or discontinued their use of other medicines when they started using cannabis medicinally. This was more common in males (65% vs. 58% of females) and older partic ipants (aged 50 years +) (70% vs. 59% among younger participants). For some people this was a substantial change, representing a shift away from chronic, high- dose medication use. Perhaps not surprisingly, cannabis was typically perceived as superior to other medications in terms of undesirable effects, and the extent of relief provided . Thus, cannabis was rated to produce equivalent (8%) or worse side effects (3%) by a minority of therapeutic users. It was considered to work \"a bit\" or \"much better\" t han other medicines, or to be the only source of relief, by more than three quarters (82%). 16. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189912 In regards to conditions, pain- related conditions were the most common, reported by 53% of participants (n = 144; chronic pain 36%; (n = 98), arthritis 12% (n = 32), headache 5% (n = 14)). The second most prominent class was mental health (eating disorder, PTSD & psychiatric disorder), reported by 15% (n = 41). Other prominent conditions included gastrointestinal disorders (11%, n = 29), insomnia (7%, n = 18) and multiple sclerosis (4%, n = 11). In regards to symptoms; the most highly endorsed were chronic pain (73%, n = 197), stress (60%,n=162), insomnia (57%, n = 155), depression (46%, n = 126) and headache (32%, n = 87). g astrointestinal (GI) issues also featured prominently, with 29% (n = 79) citing appetite loss and another 29% (n = 79) nausea. Cannabis was perceived to be very effectiv e at symptom relief, with 95% (n = 257) reporting that it \"often\" or \"always\" helped alleviate their symptoms. 17. https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.12323 Participants presented with the range of conditions that is generally consistent with surveys of CTP users , the most prominent conditions being pain (32%), mood (i.e. anxiety and depression (18%), arthritis (15%), HIV (10%), gastrointestinal disorder (7%) 18. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5422566/ We previously reported in an earlier survey that of 1,429 respondents, 61% reported using cannabis for managing pain, 58% reported using cannabis for anxiety and 50% reported using cannabis for depression. In the current analysi s, these same conditions were also the most commonly reported conditions by respondents. Of the 1,040 participants reporting pain and/or intractable pain, 619 (59.52%) reported depression and anxiety as comorbidities. As such, the odds of reporting subst ituting cannabis for prescription drugs were more than one and a half times greater (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.27- 2.16) among those reporting using it to manage pain, anxiety and depression than among those using it to manage only one of the three conditions. This team previously reported that in a survey of 1,429 medical cannabis users, 61% reported cannabis use for pain, 58% reported cannabis use for anxiety and 50% reported using cannabis to manage depression. In 2016, Dale and Stacey reported that those using cannabis for pain were more likely to be substituting for prescription drugs. In 2017, Walsh et al published a review of medical cannabis and mental health to try to better understand how medical cannabis use may impact areas of potential concern for cl inicians. \"Relaxation and relief of anxiety\" and \"relief of negative mood\" or depression were among the most widely reported conditions in 60 publications included in their analysis. Because it is common for chronic pain patients to be prescribed combinatorial pharmacotherapy to address comorbidity with depression and/or anxiety, it is largely unknown how often patients may be discontinuing prescription medications when initiating cannabis use. Taken with preclinical data on the role of the endocannabinoid system in stress, pain processing and immune homeostasis, it is clear that future investigation is warranted using controlled trials with human subjects to better understand the role that cannabis may play in treating pain, anxiety, dep ression and other conditions. 19. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277530/ Most of the respondents (from the clinic and online groups) reported that cannabis improved their mood , pain, muscle spasms, and sleep. 20. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11210205 Of 628 Canadian medical marijuana patients: 463 patients reported using medical marijuana to treat anxiety. This article reports on an exploratory study of medical cannabis users. Interviews were completed with 50 self -identified medical cannabis users recruited through notices in newspapers and on bulletin boards. They reported using cannabis for a variety of conditions including HIV -AIDS -related problems, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, menstrual cramps, migraine, narcotic addiction as well as everyday aches, pains , stresses and sleeping difficulties. However, cannabis was also used to treat menstrual cramps, anorexia, narcotic addiction, migraine, Tourette's Syndrome, lupus, Grave 's Disease, epilepsy, retinitis, chemotherapy -induced loss of appetite, Crohn 's Disease, arthritis and everyday aches, pains, stresses and sleeping diff iculties. Many reported benefits of cannabis were consistent with those reported elsewhere. Cannabis was typically used for its sedative, analgesic, antispasmodic, appetite stimulating, anticonvulsant and euphoric properties. These properties were well k nown in the past century when cannabis was used to treat conditions that required medications with these properties. Although scientific evidence in favor of medical cannabis is limited (Gurley, Aranow & Katz 1998), self -treatment with cannabis could becom e popular as more users publicize their own experiences. This is especially so if the everyday aches and pains and psychological problems are promoted as medical reasons for using cannabis. 21. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2683812/ The use of marijuana to manage stress and anxiety was described by 12 teens in our sample. Dealing with bullying at school, heavy demands of school work, taxing shifts at work, and just \"giving as much as you can\" along side difficult relationships with parents or guardians, and receiving threats from neighbors all took its toll on these youth. For some, these experiences contributed to high levels of stress and anxiety, and for others uncomfortable levels of anger - both were difficult to manage. Although some had friends they could turn to, marijuana provided an additional source of stress relief that was ready at hand. \"Lots of people know me, know I do pot and they think that I'm a pot head but really the thing they don't realize is that I have a reason for it. It's for my stress and an antidepressant. I get really upset. It [pot] helps me feel better about myself, because you know people don't do that [help me], like my fr iend [name] can, but nobody else can.\" [Female, 14 years, non- daily use] There was general agreement among the teens that marijuana calmed them down, and helped them feel \"not so nervous\" and \"not so uptight about everything.\" One teen recognized, however , that despite the fact that marijuana could be a very effective stress reliever, it might not work for everyone: \"Well as far as pot goes, the good thing is that it's definitely a stress reliever, hands down. I know lots of people who would be just a com plete wreck if they weren't smoking pot but then there's also people who are a complete wreck because they do smoke pot, so it's kind of a hard thing.\" [Male, 16 years, non- daily use] 22. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691841/ While the controversies surrounding cannabis are far from subdued (and are often permeated and masked by conflicting ideological credos), standardized studies on cannabinoids have highlighted that the psychological and behavioral outcomes of this substance are highly variable and range from relaxation, euthymia and heightened sociability to panic, paranoid ideation and psychosis [ 112 - 116 ]. A corollary of this observation is that the high comor bidity rate between cannabis use disorders and psychiatric conditions [ 100 - 105 ] may indicate that cannabis consumption is either a concurring cause or a \"self -therapeutic\" strategy for anxiety and mood disorders [ 117 - 123 ]. The latter interpretation is supported by the observation that anxiety -spectrum disturbances and traumas in early developmental stages are a strong predictor for later cannabis use disorders [ 124 - 127 ]; furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that the anxiolytic effects of THC may partially account for the high prevalence of cannabis use in patients affected by PTSD [ 128 - 131 ] and OCD [ 132 ]. Accordingly, recent clinical studies have shown that THC elicits therapeutic effects in OCD [ 133 ] and trichotillomania, an impulse -control disorder characterized by compulsive hair -pulling [ 134 ]. 23. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604171/ Overall, current evidence indicates CBD has considerable potential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders, with need for further study of chronic and therapeutic effects in relevant clinical populations. 24. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604174/ Although clinical studies in this area are difficult to do, even in countries where the use of cannabis has been al lowed for years, there is a clear role for cannabis products in symptom management for these difficult conditions. 25. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22729452 RESULTS: Studies using anim al models of anxiety and involving healthy volunteers clearly suggest an anxiolytic -like effect of CBD. Moreover, CBD was shown to reduce anxiety in patients with social anxiety disorder. CONCLUSION: Future clinical trials involving patients with different anxiety disorders are warranted, especially of panic disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The adequate therapeutic window of CBD and the precise mechanisms involved in its anxiolytic acti on remain to be determined. 26. https://doi.org/10.2202/1941- 2851.1017 1655 Patients reported using medical marijuana for these conditions: Anxiety disorders 18.7% of patients Applicants most frequently reported using medical marijuana for pain relief (82.6%), improved sleep (70.6%), and relaxation (55.6%) . The next most frequently reported benefits included relief of muscle spasms (41.3%), headache (40.8%), relief of anxiety (38.1%) , improved appetite (38.0%), relief of nausea and vomiting (27.7%), and relief of depression (26.1%). Half the applicants (50.8%) reported using marijuana as a substitute for prescription medication and 13.2% reported using marijuana as a substitute for alcohol. 27. https://doi.org/ 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07061016 Hence, it can be speculated that the anti -obsessive effect observed in our patients may have been a consequence of the glutam ate modulation of the cannabinoid dronabinol. 28. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349825/ The findings from the study indicate that cannabis use is associated with a subsequent changein positive affect, depressive symptoms and manic symptoms over the course of daily life. No evidence for the use of cannabis to self - medicate minor fluctuations in negative affect or BD symptoms was revealed. Participants in the study were currently well and out of episode. Future research should explore whether the self -medication hypothesis is more relevant to individuals that are in the acute stages of depres sion or mania. This would be consistent with the broader self - medication hypothesis in BD where individuals have reported finding cannabis useful in the management of their symptoms. 29. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9692379 The authors present case histories indicating that a number of patients find cannabis (marihuana) useful in the treatment of their bipolar disorder. Some used it to treat mania, depression, or both. They stated that it was more effective than conventional drugs, or helped relieve the side effects of those drugs. One woman found that cannabis curbed her manic rages; she and her husband have worked to make it legally available as a medicine. Others described the us e of cannabis as a supplement to lithium (allowing reduced consumption) or for relief of lithium's side effects. Another case illustrates the fact that medical cannabis users are in danger of arrest, especially when children are encouraged to inform on pa rents by some drug prevention programs. An analogy is drawn between the status of cannabis today and that of lithium in the early 1950s, when its effect on mania had been discovered but there were no controlled studies. In the case of cannabis, the law has made such studies almost impossible, and the only available evidence is anecdotal. The potential for cannabis as a treatment for bipolar disorder unfortunately can not be fully explored in the present social circumstances. 30. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898690/ Findings suggest that for some bipolar patients, marijuana may result in partial alleviation of clinical symptoms. Moreover, this improvement is not at the expense of additional cognitive impairment. 31. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17703715 Subjective reports by patients suggest an overall positive effect, but these may be unreliable. We herein report a case in which mood data was prospectively collected over two years of total substance abstinence and two years of extreme marijuana use. Marijuana use did not alter the total number of days of abnormal mood, however, marijuana was associated with an increase in the number of hypomanic days and a decrease in the number of depressed days. While not conclusive, the data suggest that marijuana may indeed have an effect on mood in bipolar patients that needs to be systematically examine d. 32. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5652027/ Cannabis use diminishes some of the adverse effects of neurological and psychiatric disorders. 33. https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4323143/ These results suggest that cannabis use has clinical implications for the early course of BD (Bipolar Disorder) by increasing mood level. 34. https://doi. org/10.1111/j.1368- 5031.2005.00271.x Medicinal cannabis use was Reported by patients with chronic pain(25%), multiple sclerosis and depression (22% each), arthritis (21%) and neuropathy (19%).

Minnesota has undertaken the most comprehensive research on the medical cannabis patients in its medical cannabis program in the United States. Including surveys by both the patients and their physicians. Tracking which medical cannabis products they purchase, use and continue using to treat each qualifying condition. The Minnesota Department of Health publishes reports of the medical cannabis patients and how medical marij uana helps them with anxiety. In its first year of reports, the Minnesota DOH published patient comments about the beneficial effects of the medical marijuana. (REF #98) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/firstyearreport.html (REF #94) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/appendixa.pdf Many such comments are found within the above report. Further reports in the following years also track which patients under each condition report benefits of medical marijuana on anxiety. https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/omcreport.html https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/cohort.html (REF #93) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/cohort/2015_2016_benefitspse.pdf The patient self -evaluation is required for patients to complete prior to each medical cannabis purchase. It includes questions to assess symptom severit y, some of which are administered to all patients (standard set of 8 symptom measures) and some of which are tailored to symptoms for a given condition (condition- specific symptom measures). Since symptom data is collected prior to each patient's first medical cannabis purchase, symptom changes can be assessed over time and compared to baseline (baseline = patient responses to symptom questions just prior to their first medical cannabis purchase) These reports are useful to show that medical marijuana pati ents find a greater than 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms, and a large percentage of patients continue to maintain that reduction of anxiety for 4 months. (REF #92) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/cohort/2016_2017_benefitspse.pdf (REF #91) https://www.health.state .mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/cohort/c2015_2017_benefitspse.pdf MDOH publishes Adverse Side Effects reports which show a very small percentage of people experience a worsening of anxiety symptoms. I urge you to read them all as it shows how small the number of adverse anxiety reports are. https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/about/cohort.html (REF #90) https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/docs/about/cohort/appendix_c_2015_2016_patientreportednegativeeffe cts.pdf Although the comments mention anxiety as a side ef fect, sometimes it is not the cannabis's fault, but prohibition's fault, as this comment rated at score level 4 shows: I have more anxiety that police may take me for a blood test of charge me with DUI if they know I'm a patient at dispensary. I also had a Warning of illegal drug use in a urine test from the so called pain clinic I'm required to go to by [CLINIC]By my now ex primary Dr of 20 years. I told the pain clinic when I signed contract not to use illegal drugs that I took cannabis by prescription in medical form thru Dept of Health etc. The Dr said OK, as long as it wasn't in organic form for smoking! He said I was the 1st patient at [CLINIC]to be on legal cannabis. I advised him, I maybe to 1st but surely not the last patient. They said this wi ll be resolved ok but I still was warned for illegal THC drug use, which is upsetting but it will be straightened out. Thank u! Massachusetts published a report on its medical marijuana patients and their Health Study (MBHS) A legislative mandate required the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to conduct a baseline study to investigate marijuana use in Massachusetts. The report published confirms the consensus that marijuana use improves mood and or mental health for a large percentage of people. Page 10: Among all respondents, 78% reported positive changes in their mood or mental health, and 67% reported improved physical health. In addition, 83% of respondents reported no negative outcomes/consequences related to their marijuana use. Page 148: Results from this survey suggest that respondents appear to be treating a wide range of medical conditions, and often more than one at a time. The top 5 medical conditions being treated were anxiety (60% or all respondents), chronic pain (46%), insomnia (43%), depression (42%), and stress (41%), and the average number of conditions being treated by medical marijuana is 4.7. (9) Attach letters of support from physicians or other licensed health care professionals knowledgeable about the medical condition.

Severe and Persistent Muscle Spasms 1: No Benefit no benefits none yet 2 Did not help control my son's seizures but we at least never seen any negative side effects of the medication Don't recognize sublingual drops Helps relaxing Improved sleep physical movement The \"Patient Discontinuation Survey\" didn't have a place to comment when choosing \"won't buy again\", so I want to be sure someone got this. What I get from the medical market in other states works much better for pain relief and spasm reduction, in both flower and concentrate. I think it's because the critically important terpenes (more important than THC/CBD) are removed in the processing at [MANUFACTURER] and not added back, like they are in other places. Without better processing (more expensive) or giving patients access to flower (least expensive), MN's processing is removing nearly all of what makes cannabis a medicine - terpenes. 3 Less overall pain Mood may have been better slightly.

In the middle of a flare, I didn't have any form of relief so I'd panic because of severity of symptoms and no treatment. Now, I still have MS PTSD because I've had problems for so long, but I know I have >something< that will help the problem.

I used to experience a great deal of muscle spasms and tics. Since stating the program I have had many comments from friends and family saying that they have hardly noticed any tics in the previous few months. I could walk better. I feel less s tress resulting in fewer muscle spasms. I can sleep sometimes at night without using the Ambien which I have needed for over 15yrs. It allows me to have a better perspective of any given situation because I am not feeling stressed out or as if I were a criminal. I have been able to discontinue my opioid pain medicine that I took for over four years after my accident. I can remain calm in many situations that used to upset me emotionally. I can enjoy my grandchildren and family so much more now that both phy sical and emotion health are improved with medical cannabis. I have a great deal of relief from my muscle spasms.

I sleep better at night with less pain. I move more freely I was qui ckly able to get off both Valium and Ambien Both were heavy duty drugs that I was dependent on, not because I wanted to take them, but had to. I was so glad to get off them and feel somewhat normal. I'm not kicking my wife while I'm asleep. The leg is still restless but not as bad as before.

It has helped my sleep thru the night and a lot less spasms it has made my quality of life better to make it short and sweet It has reduced my muscle spasms by 90%. It helps me sleep at night. For example, it helps control my spasms so they don't wake up and I have less pain. The amazing thing it's also a nerve blocker like neurontin or gabapentin. Here' s another amazing fact. It helps control my autonomic dysreflexia. Out of every benefit this has undoubtedly given me my quality of life back. At night, if you understand autonomic dysreflexia, my blood pressure would shoot up too 150 or 180 before bedtime . This is dangerous as my normal range is 80 or 90 over something. My muscle spasms at night shoot my blood pressure up. I felt like I was going to have a stroke and could have if they are not controlled. My head would pound like it was going to explode wi th a severe headache, my face becomes extremely hot and flushed, my hands and fingers become numb (weird side effect), my heart starts to pound against my chest as it has to work harder to pump blood. So heart rate goes down as blood pressure goes up. It' s helped the inflammation of my joints because they ache less. There is not \"one\" benefit in my case but many. All of them are important to my quality of life. I finally feel like I have that back now!!!

With out the program I would be unable to stay functioning because the narcotics make me tired and worn out and want to do nothing. With the use of Medical Marijuana and keeping the N arcotics down allows me to keep my day to a functioning day no matter how slow I may be, but I am not worn out because I can use the vaporizers to help the muscles so much. That in return makes me feel that my life is somewhat productive instead of dormant . It works on too many levels. I can eat better and I usually get nausea and it works great for that. My arthritis is much better. I am still dealing with the side effects of radiation my cancer Dr. says. I guess with no stomach and most intestines gone I don't usually eat as well or feel good (healthy) enough to even get up and go to my office.

I have less dizziness from vertigo with the cannabis I have better mobility of my neck I have gone from having diarrhea daily, to having it once a month. That's a huge quality of life improvement for me. It stops vomiting almost as quickly as IV drugs for nausea Just a general improvement of quality of life with the symptoms of my Crohn's disease. I have extremely benefited from cannabis. Less nausea Lessens the amount of stools per day. Increases my appetite so that I can maintain my weight. Allows me to digest my food slower increasing the amount of nutrition absorbed. My overall inflammation has dropped significantly thanks to medical cannabis. this has resulted in me having to drop my daily amount of background (Lantus) insulin throughout the day by 10 units. with my diabetes, I am less insulin resistant and probably use 15 units less per day on top of the 10 units less per day from my Lantus. I also have been sleeping much better and am have been able to completely remove opiates from my life which is a huge accomplishment for me.

Method: The articles selected for the review were identified through searches in English, Portuguese, and Spanish in the electronic databases ISI Web of Knowledge, SciELO, PubMed, and PsycINFO, combining the search terms \"cannabidiol and anxiolytic\", \"cannabidiol and anxiolytic-like\", and \"cannabidiol and anxiety\". The reference lists of the publications included, review articles, and book chapters were handsearched for additional references. Experimental animal and human studies were included, with no time restraints. Results: Studies using animal models of anxiety and involving healthy volunteers clearly suggest an anxiolytic-like effect of CBD. Moreover, CBD was shown to reduce anxiety in patients with social anxiety disorder. Conclusion: Future clinical trials involving patients with different anxiety disorders are warranted, especially of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The adequate therapeutic window of CBD and the precise mechanisms involved in its anxiolytic action remain to be determined.Cannabidiol, a Cannabis sativa constituent, as an anxiolytic Zuardi3,4 1 Laboratory of Panic and Respiration, Institute of Psychiatry (IPUB), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil 2 Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil 3 Department of Neuroscience and Behavioral Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Universidade de S\u00e3o Nacional de Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia Translacional em Medicina (National Institute for Translational Medicine; INCT-TM), Brazil Received on March 2, 2011; 18, 2011 anxiolytic drugS105 Introduction Cannabis sativa is the most used drug of abuse worldwide and around 20% of youth use it heavily and regularly around the globe.1 The main psychoactive component of the plant is 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC), one of the substances responsible for the psychoactive effects of Cannabis. 2-4 Cannabidiol (CBD) is another abundant in around 40% of the plant's active substances.5 The pharmacological effects of CBD are different and often opposite to those of 9-THC.6 The number of pub- lications on CBD has increased remarkably over the last years and support the view that CBD has a vast array of possible therapeutic effects. Among these possibilities, the anxiolytic and antipsychotic properties of CBD stand out.7-10 CBD's anx- iolytic effects are apparently similar to those of approved drugs to treat anxiety, 11 although its effective doses have not been clearly established and the mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood. The low affinity of CBD for cannabinoid neuroreceptors12,13 and its agonist properties at 5-HT1A receptors14,15 have been repeatedly demonstrated. Most studies on CBD have been conducted with rodents, but studies with human samples have also provided promis - ing results.16,17 Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review the scientific literature on the anxiolytic properties of CBD in animal and in humans. Method The articles selected for this review were identified by searches in English, Portuguese, and Spanish in the elec - tronic databases ISI Web of Knowledge, SciELO, PubMed, and PsycINFO combining the search terms \"cannabidiol and anx - iolytic\", \"cannabidiol and anxiolytic-like\", and \"cannabidiol and anxiety\". In addition, the reference lists of the selected articles and relevant literature reviews and book chapters were handsearched for additional references. We included experimental studies with human and animal samples with no time limits. We sought to exclude studies that used smoked Cannabis, as it is not possible to establish the dose, composition, and proportion of the different cannabinoids in this case, besides the great individual variations in the samples enrolled. Finally, we did not include studies using extracts containing both THC and CBD in oral (Cannador\u00ae) or oromucosal spray (Sativex\u00ae) forms due to the difficulty to establish the effects of CBD alone (Table 1). Animal studies The two first articles about the effects of CBD on experi - mental anxiety were published in journals that were not indexed in the databases used for this review but were lo - cated through handsearch in the reference lists of relevant literature. These two investigations showed contradictory results. In one study, no significant effects of high doses of CBD (100 mg/kg) were seen in rats in the Geller-Seifter conflict test. 18 In the other, a low dose of CBD (10 mg/kg) had anxiolytic effects in rats submitted to the conditioned emotional response test.19 Later studies using the elevated plus maze (EPM) helped to elucidate this contradiction.9 The EPM consists of two opposing open arms (50 x 10 cm) and two closed arms (50 x 10 x 40 cm) that intersect in their central portion. The arms are made of wood and stand 50 cm above the ground. In this study, mice injected with CBD, diazepam or vehicle (no active substances) were placed in the center of the maze facing the closed arms. The time spent and the numbers of entries in the open and closed arms were measured for 10 minutes. The frequency of entries in the open arms of ani - mals receiving CBD presented an inverted U-shaped curve, with significantly higher rates than those observed in animals treated with vehicle, at the doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg. The measures of mice treated with CBD 20 mg/kg did not dif- fer from those of controls, suggesting that anxiolytic effects are only present at low doses, which explains the absence of effects with CBD 100 mg/kg reported in 1981. 18 The same inverted U-shaped dose-response curve was obtained with a wider range of doses of CBD in the EPM (Onaivi et al.).20 Furthermore, the same pattern was observed with the direct infusion of CBD in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of rats tested in the EPM,15,21 confirming that anxiolytic effects should only be expected with low doses of CBD. The mechanisms through which CBD acts to diminish anxiety have been studied in a number of animal models of anxiety using rodents. One of these studies used Vogel's conflict test, 22 in which the animal is water-deprived from and placed in a cage with an electrified grid at the bottom through which the animal receives a shock after licking wa- ter for a predetermined number of times. Three substances were tested in rats using the following procedure: CBD (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg), diazepam, and flumazenil (an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors), in addition to vehicle (placebo). The tests showed that CBD produced effects consistent with those of diazepam by increasing the number of licks, even if they resulted in punishment. Flumazenil antagonized the anxiolytic effect of diazepam, but not that of CBD, suggesting that the effects of CBD are not mediated by the activation of benzodiazepine receptors. There is strong evidence showing that the serotonergic system is involved in the anxiolytic action of CBD. The injec - tion of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (WAY) directly into the dorsolateral portion of the PAG (dlPAG) in rats antagonized the anxiolytic effects of CBD in the EPM and in Vogel's conflict test. 15 The participation of 5-HT1A recep- tors in the anxiolytic action of CBD was also derived from behavioral and cardiovascular responses to restraint stress in rats. 11 In this study, animals were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle or CBD (1, 10 and 20 mg/kg) and, after 30 min - utes, they were restrained for 60 minutes. Immobilization increased blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety responses in the EPM 24 hours later, and these effects were attenuated by CBD. Pretreatment with WAY blocked the anxiolytic action of CBD. The injection of CBD into the intra-dorsal PAG also blocked panic-like responses in the elevated T-maze (ETM) and flight responses to the electrical stimulation of this area. 23 The ETM has three arms with the same dimensions, two open and one closed, and allows the measure of entrance avoidance in the open arms when the animal is placed in the closed arm, as well as of escape when the animal is placed in the open arm. The panic-like response seen with CBD in the two procedures was antagonized by the previous intra-dlPAG administration of WAY . 22 Chronic oral administration of CBD also had anti-panic effects in the ETM that were neutralized A.R.M.

However, chronic administra- tion of CBD did not change the extracellular concentration of serotonin in the dlPAG or the expression of 5-HT1A or 5-HT2C, indicating that CBD directly activates 5-HT1A receptors. 24 CBD was also found to activate the vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) 25 and there is evidence that this activation could explain the inverted U-shaped dose-response curve of CBD's anxiolytic effect seen in the EPM. TRPV1 receptors regulate the release of glutamate in the dlPAG and the increased activation of this system would result in increased anxiety. Thus, it has been suggested that elevated doses of CBD in the dlPAG could activate local TRPV1 receptors facilitating the glutamatergic neurotransmission and increasing anxiety. To test this hypothesis, rats pre-treated with the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine in the dlPAG were injected with CBD (30 and 60 mg/kg) in the same region and tested in the EPM. The dose of 60 mg/kg CBD, which had no anxiolytic action before, was able to reduce anxiety after pre-treatment with capsazepine, suggesting that the activation of TRPV1 receptors by the higher dose of CBD would counterbalance the anxiolytic effect of CBD produced by the activation of 5-HT1A receptors. 21 Because serotonin has also been implicated in obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), the effects of CBD were tested in mice submitted to the marble-burying test (MBT), an animal model of compulsive behavior. CBD induced a significant re- duction in the number of buried marbles at different doses (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) compared to controls in a dose-depen- dent pattern. The same was found with the administration of the ISRS paroxetine (10 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg). However, the effects of CBD 30 mg/kg persisted even after seven days of repeated daily administration, whereas the effects of diazepam disappeared. Pre-treatment with WAY (3 mg/kg) counteracted the effects of paroxetine, but did not affect the action of CBD, which was prevented by pre- treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (1 mg/ kg). 26 This action of CBD in the MBT was recently replicated by another group using a higher dose (120 mg/kg).27 The participation of specific cannabinoid receptors (CB1) in the anxiolytic action of CBD has also been investigated using animal models. In the study with the EPM that reported the antagonism of the anxiolytic effect of intra-dlPAG CBD by WAY , the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 was unable to avoid this effect. 15 However, this receptor system seems to be involved in another anxiolytic-like action of CBD, ac-cording to tests using a procedure known as contextual fear conditioning. In this procedure, animals are pre-conditioned to a hostile environment (foot shocks) and later exposed to the same environment, when they normally present freez- ing, the duration of which can be monitored as a measure of anxiety. Both CBD and diazepam are successful in attenuating freezing in rats, as well as the increased heart rate and blood pressure induced by re-exposure to the contextually feared environment. 10 This effect of CBD on contextual memory is also produced by the endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor AM404, which increases the availability of cannabinoids in the synaptic cleft. 28 In this study, the two drugs were injected into the ventricles and their effects were counteracted by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A, suggesting the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the anxiolytic action of CBD in this model. The pre-limbic region of the prefrontal cortex appears to underlie this effect of CBD, as the reduction in contextual fear produced by systemic administration of CBD (10 mg/kg) is associated with reduced c-Fos expression in this area. In addition, the microinjection of CBD (30 nmol) in the pre-limbic region of the frontal cortex reduced freezing induced by re-exposure to the aversive context. 29 The effects of CBD on contextual fear indicate a possible therapeutic action of this cannabinoid in post-traumatic stress disorder. Another area that is apparently involved in the anxiolytic- like effects of CBD is the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). The intra-BNST injection of CBD (15, 30, and 60 nmol) increased the number of punished licks in Vogel's conflict test and the number of open arm entries in the EPM. These effects were blocked in rats pre-treated with WAY . 30 CBD was also effective in an ethologic model that inves- tigates behaviors induced by innate fear, the predator-prey paradigm. 31 This procedure was performed using a semi-trans- parent plexiglass box in the shape of a quadrangular arena (154x72x64 cm) with walls covered with a light-reflecting film and floor in transparent plexiglass over a board of stainless steel divided in 20 equal rectangles. One of the corners of the arena has a shelter box with black walls and a complex maze inside. Three days prior to the experiment, the mice were placed and kept in this arena, with free access to food and water until the day of the trial. The \"no threat\" group had its behaviors recorded for five minutes. Animals exposed to the predator (snake) were divided into four groups (n = 12/11 per group) and pre-treated with intraperitoneal injections of CBD (0.3, 3 and 30 mg/kg) or vehicle (control group). The group of animals that were not confronted with the preda - tor presented no defensive behaviors. Animals pre-treated with CBD had significant reductions in explosive flight and defensive immobility, responses related to panic models. Risk assessment and defensive attention were unaltered in animals treated with CBD. These results suggest that CBD can be effective in the control of panic attacks. Human studies The first evidence of CBD's anxiolytic effects in humans, documented with assessment scales, was published in 1982 in a study on the interaction between CBD and THC. 7 The study sample consisted of eight volunteers with a mean age of 27 years, no health problems and who had not used Cannabis sativa in the previous 15 days. In a double-blind procedure, the volunteers received CBD, THC, THC + CBD, diazepam, and placebo in different sequences and days. The results showed that the increased anxiety following the administration of THC was significantly attenuated with the simultaneous administration of CBD (THC + CBD). Based on this preliminary evidence, researchers de- cided to investigate a possible anxiolytic action of CBD in experimentally induced anxiety in healthy volunteers using the simulated public speaking (SPS) model. 32 The procedure consists of asking a subject to speak in front of a video camera for a few minutes, while subjective anxiety is measured with self-rated scales and physiological correlates of anxiety are recorded (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance). CBD (300 mg), as well as the anxiolytic drugs diazepam (10 mg) and ipsapirone (5 mg), administered in a double-blind design, significantly attenuated SPS-induced anxiety.A.R.M. Schier et al.S108 The SPS test may be regarded as a good model of anxiety and has apparent validity for social anxiety disorder (SAD), as the fear of speaking in public is considered a central feature in this condition. Therefore, the anxiolytic effect of CBD in healthy volunteers observed in this test led to the hypothesis that this cannabinoid could be effective to treat SAD. This hypothesis was recently tested in 24 patients with SAD who had their performance in the SPS test compared to that of a group of 12 healthy controls. 33 The patients with SAD were divided into two groups of 12, one of which received CBD 600 mg and the other placebo, in a double-blind procedure. The results showed that the levels of anxiety, somatic symptoms, and negative self-assessment were higher in patients who took placebo than in those of the CBD group who performed similarly to healthy controls in some measures. In another study that investigated the effects of CBD on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in healthy volunteers using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), SPS-induced anxiety was reduced in patients receiving CBD. 34 In that study, patients received either CBD (400 mg) or pla- cebo, in a crossed double-blind design, in two experimental sessions with an interval of one week. CBD significantly re-duced subjective anxiety as measured by rating scales, while brain activity was increased in the left parahippocampal gyrus and decreased in the left amygdala-hippocampus complex, including the fusiform gyrus. This pattern of SPECT results is compatible with an anxiolytic action. SPECT was also used later to investigate the neural cor - relates of CBD's anxiolytic effects in a sample of patients with SAD. 17 A single dose of CBD 400 mg was able to reduce subjective anxiety measures and SPECT showed changes in the same regions previously identified in healthy volunteers. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which allows the acquisition of larger series of images with better temporal and spatial resolution, was used to investigate the neural correlates of the anxiolytic effects of CBD in 15 healthy volunteers. 35 This experiment showed that CBD (600 mg) attenuated fMRI responses during the recognition of fearful facial expressions in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate, and that this attenuation pattern correlated with skin conductance responses to the stimuli. The same group also reported that the anxiolytic action of CBD occurs by altering the subcortical prefrontal connectivity via amygdala and anterior cingulated. 16 Conclusion Together, the results from laboratory animals, healthy vol - unteers, and patients with anxiety disorders support the proposition of CBD as a new drug with anxiolytic properties. Because it has no psychoactive effects and does not affect cognition; has an adequate safety profile, good tolerability, positive results in trials with humans, and a broad spectrum of pharmacological actions, 36 CBD appears to be the can - nabinoid compound that is closer to have its preliminary findings in anxiety translated into clinical practice. 37 Future studies should test this possibility in clinical trials involving patients with different anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disor - der, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, because the actions of CBD are biphasic, the adequate therapeutic window for each anxiety disorder remains to be determined. Regarding the mechanism underlying the anxiolytic effects of CBD, the most consistent evidence points to the involvement of the serotonergic system, probably through direct action on 5-HT1A receptors, although other systems, as the endo - cannabinoid system itself, may also be implicated. Further investigation is warranted to clarify these issues, especially if we consider that CBD is a drug with a variety of effects in the nervous system. 38-40 Disclosures Alexandre Rafael de Mello Schier Employment : Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil.

Abstract: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the benet of nabilone in pain management and quality of life improvement in 40 patients with bromyalgia. After a baseline assessment, subjects were titrated up on nabilone, from 0.5 mg PO atbedtime to 1 mg BID over 4 weeks or received a corresponding placebo. At the 2- and 4-week visits,the primary outcome measure, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and the secondary outcomemeasures, number of tender points, the average tender point pain threshold, and the FibromyalgiaImpact Questionnaire (FIQ), were evaluated. After a 4-week washout period, subjects returned forreassessment of the outcome measures. There were no signicant differences in population demo-graphics between groups at baseline. There were signicant decreases in the VAS ( in the nabilone treated group at 4 weeks. There were no signicant improvements in the placebo group. The treatment group experienced more sideeffects per person at 2 and 4 weeks (1.58, P<.02 and 1.54, P<.05), respectively. Nabilone appears to be a benecial, well-tolerated treatment option for bromyalgia patients, with signicant benetsin pain relief and functional improvement. Perspective: To our knowledge, this is the rst randomized, controlled trial to assess the benet of nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, on pain reduction and quality of life improvement in patients withbromyalgia. As nabilone improved symptoms and was well-tolerated, it may be a useful adjunct forpain management in bromyalgia. \u00a9 2008 by the American Pain Society Key words: Nabilone, cannabinoid, bromyalgia, pain. Fibromyalgia is a syndrome of unknown etiology, characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain, fa-tigue, and sleep disturbance. 38It affects 2% to 4% of the general population35,36,37and is 4 to 7 times more common in women, with symptoms usually arising be-tween 20 and 55 years of age. 15 The diagnostic criteria for bromyalgia, established in 1990 by the American College of Rheumatology, in-cludes widespread pain for at least 3 months and pointtenderness with 4 kg of pressure at 11 or more of 18characteristic tender points. 38These criteria allow for thedifferentiation of bromyalgia from other chronic mus- culoskeletal pain with a sensitivity and specicity of al-most 85%. 16 Patients with bromyalgia have lower pain thresholds to both mechanical and thermal insults, give higher painratings, and experience an altered temporal summation to painful stimuli. 16The sensitization of pain perception that is present in these patients can occur both peripher-ally and centrally after tissue damage but may also bepresent in patients with no obvious tissue damage. 20 Sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of patients withbromyalgia, as activity of both unmyelinated C bersand A- /H9254bers is increased 14,21; however, it is unknown whether sensitization is due to increased pain ber facil-itation, or decreased inhibition. 20 Given the lack of understanding in the pathophysiol- ogy of bromyalgia, it is not surprising that until re-cently, with the approval of pregabalin, no medical treat-ment had been specically approved by the United StatesFood and Drug Administration for its management. 13 There is also evidence that tricyclic antidepressants, cardio-vascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy and patientReceived April 19, 2007; Revised August 27, 2007; Accepted September 26, 2007.

The CB1 receptor is found predominantlyin the central and peripheral nervous system, 25whereas CB2 receptors are found principally in the immune sys-tem. 27Endogenous cannabinoids have been isolated that interact with these receptors.10CB1 agonists have been shown to have an analgesic effect in acute andchronic pain models. 10The CB1 agonists act at many sites along pain transmission pathways including activation ofperipheral, spinal, and supraspinal CB1 receptors, eachindependently decreasing nociception. 10 The endocannabinoid system shares several similarities with the opioid system.9CB1 and opioid receptors are both found in similar areas of the nervous system in-volved in pain control, including the periaqueductal graymatter, rostral ventromedial and with the opioid system, cannabinoids have also been shown to inhibit prosta-glandin E-2 synthesis, 8reduce platelet aggregation,31 and have an anti-inflammatory effect twice as great ashydrocortisone and 20 times that of aspirin. 12 Nabilone is 1 of 2 orally administered cannabinoids available in Canada and is currently approved for themanagement of nausea and vomiting during chemo-therapy. Research into oral cannabinoid use in the man-agement of chronic and neuropathic pain has been en-couraging. 18,32As no treatment has been specically approved for management of bromyalgia, further re-search into treatment strategies is important. To date, norandomized, controlled trials have been conducted toassess the efcacy of a synthetic cannabinoid on pain andquality of life in patients with bromyalgia. Our hypothesis was that nabilone will signicantly re- duce the pain and improve quality of life in bromyalgiapatients compared with placebo, as evidenced by signif-icant improvements in visual analog scale pain scores(VAS), number of tender points, average tender pointpain threshold, and scores on the Fibromyalgia ImpactQuestionnaire (FIQ). Materials and Methods Setting The study was conducted in the Outpatient Musculo- skeletal Clinic at the Rehabilitation Hospital, Health Sci-ences Centre (HSC), Department of Physical Medicineand Rehabilitation, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada,from April 2006 to November 2006. Patients were re-cruited from the musculoskeletal practices of attendingPhysiatrists and Rheumatologists at the RehabilitationHospital. Inclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria for the study included the subject meeting The American College of Rheumatology (1990)criteria for the classication of bromyalgia38; patients between 18 and 70 years of age; having continued paindespite the use of other oral medications; and no previ-ous use of oral cannabinoids for pain management. Exclusion Criteria Subjects were excluded from participating in the study if their pain was better explained by a diagnosis otherthan bromyalgia; for abnormalities on routine baselineblood work including electrolytes, urea and creatinine, acomplete blood count, and liver function tests; heart dis-ease; schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder; severeliver of ahistory of drug dependency; or a known sensitivity tomarijuana or other cannabinoid agents. Protocol Subjects met the eligibility criteria through a struc- tured interview process, and participants provided in-formed consent. HSC Research ethics board, HSC ImpactCommittee and Health Canada approval was obtainedprior to proceeding with the study. Subjects were randomly assigned by the HSC pharmacy into treatment and control groups, each consisting of 20participants (Fig 1). The examining physicians and thesubjects were blinded to the randomization process. Allof the study medication was provided by Valeant CanadaLimited (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and was identical toplacebo. Subjects in both groups were seen at baseline,after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of treatment and after a4-week washout period. Subjects in the treatment groupreceived 0.5 mg nabilone PO at bedtime for a 1-weekperiod, with instructions to increase to 0.5 mg BID after 7days. At the 2-week visit, subjects were evaluated for thepresence of side effects and drug tolerance, and if theyconsented to continue, had the prescription increased tonabilone 0.5 mg PO in the morning and 1 mg PO atbedtime, with instructions to increase to 1 mg BID after 7days. Subjects in the control group received a corre-sponding placebo. Subjects were assessed for the safetyand efcacy of their prescription based on the outcomemeasures at the 2-, 4-, and 8-week follow-up visits. Sub-jects were asked to continue any current treatment forbromyalgia, including breakthrough pain medications,but not to begin any new therapies. Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure was a 10 cm VAS for pain. The secondary outcome measures included thenumber of positive tender points; the average tenderpoint pain threshold; and the subject's score on the FIQ. At each visit, subjects were asked to rate their current level of pain on the 10 cm VAS, (0 /H11005no pain; 10 /H11005worst pain imaginable), a valid and reliable scale for ratingpain intensity. 26Subjects then lled out the FIQ, which is a validated, self-administered test, scored out of 100,that evaluates physical function, work status, depression,165 ORIGINAL REPORT/Skrabek et alanxiety, sleep, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well-being in patients with bromyalgia.7,23The higher the score on the FIQ, the greater the impact of bromyalgia on thesubject's quality of life. 7Subjects were then assessed for the number of positive tender points by digital palpationover the 18 characteristic tender point sites in the ACRcriteria for the diagnosis of bromyalgia, 38which has been previously shown to have both good intrarater andinterrater reliability. 33The subjects were asked to iden - tify if a given point was painful as slow steady digitalpressure was applied. The same evaluation of the tenderpoints was then repeated with a hand-held Fischer al-gometer. This test has also demonstrated good interra-ter and test-retest reliability. 33Pressure was applied over each tender point at a rate of 1 kilogram per squarecentimeter per second, and subjects were asked to iden-tify the moment the pressure became painful. The painthreshold at each of the 18 tender points was recordedand an average tender point pain threshold for each visitwas calculated. During each visit, any reported side ef-fects as well as weight, blood pressure, and heart ratewere recorded. Statistical Analysis Based on the previous case series investigating nabilone use in bromyalgia,18we calculated that 16 patients would be necessary in each group to detect achange of 2 cm on the 10 cm VAS, using an /H9251of/H110210.05 and a power of 80%. Allowing for dropouts, our aim wasto have 20 subjects in each group start the study. Statis-tical analysis was conducted, and we considered P/H11021.05 to be statistically signicant for all of our outcome mea-sures. The mean and standard deviation was calculatedfor each outcome measure at each visit and a Student'sttest was performed to compare the change in the mean from baseline within and between groups. Results Forty-four subjects were screened to participate in the study between April and November of 2006. Four sub-jects did not meet the entrance requirements for thestudy. Reasons for their exclusion included a history ofmultiple medical problems (n /H110051); subjects did not like the stigma associated with the use of cannabinoids (n /H11005 2); and previous oral cannabinoid use (n /H110051). The remaining 40 subjects were randomly assigned by the HSC pharmacy into either the nabilone or placebogroup (Fig 1). The examining physicians and patientswere blinded to the randomization process. The baselinedemographic data and baseline outcome measures arepresented for both groups (Table 1). No signicant dif-ferences in baseline demographic data or primary andsecondary outcome measures were present. The percent-age of subjects employed and the use of opioid medica-tions for pain were not signicantly different betweenthe 2 groups. A total of 5 subjects from the treatment group and 2 Figure 1.

All of the subjects who withdrew fromthe study did so at or before the rst follow-up visit. Inthe control group, one subject discontinued the medica-tion after 4 days because of headaches; the other with-drew at the rst follow-up visit, after 2 weeks, althoughno side effects or reason for dropping out was stated. Ofthe subjects in the treatment group, 3 withdrew beforethe rst follow-up visit. Two of these subjects did notstate a reason for withdrawal and listed no side effects,whereas the other subject experienced dizziness, disori-entation, and nausea. The remaining 2 subjects in thetreatment group to withdraw did so at the rst fol-low-up visit, after 2 weeks. One subject stated poor co-ordination, dizziness, headache, and nausea as the rea-sons for withdrawing from the study, whereas the otherexperienced drowsiness and fatigue. All patients in thetreatment group that continued with the study achieveda nabilone dose of 1 mg BID. There was a signicant increase in the weight of sub- jects treated with nabilone for 2 weeks, (1.13 kg, P/H11021.01).This effect, however, was transient, as there was no sig-nicant difference in weight change observed betweenthe 2 groups during the 4-week and 8-week visits. When compared with baseline, at the 2-, 4-, and 8-week visits, no statistically signicant differences wereobserved in any of the outcome measures in the placebogroup. There were no statistically signicant differences from baseline in the outcome measures in the nabilonetreated subjects, at a dose of 0.5 mg BID, after 2 weeks oftreatment. However, at the 4-week follow-up visit, at anabilone dose of 1 mg BID, statistically signicant im-provements were seen in the VAS, FIQ, and FIQ anxietyscale. The VAS scores for pain decreased from baseline at4 weeks ( /H110022.04, P/H11021.02) (Fig 2). Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores also signicantly decreased ( /H1100212.07, P/H11021.02) (Fig 3). The 10-point anxiety scale within the FIQ was the nal outcome to be statistically improved frombaseline after 4 weeks of treatment ( /H110021.67, P/H11021.02) (Fig 4).

Comparing the treatment and placebo groups at 2 weeks of treatment, no signicant differences were seenin VAS, number of tender points, tender point painthreshold, or FIQ. Of the 3 separately analyzed questionsin the FIQ concerning anxiety, depression, and fatigue,only anxiety was signicantly less at the 2-week visit inthe nabilone group. The score on the 10-point scale foranxiety decreased in the treatment group at a nabilonedose of 0.5 mg BID ( /H110021.92, P/H11021.025). At the 4-week visit, statistically signicant differences between the treatment and placebo groups were alsopresent.

Side effects were more common in the nabilone- treated subjects compared with placebo controls at both2 and 4 weeks of treatment, (1.58, P/H11021.02 and 1.54, P/H11021 .05), respectively. The frequency of the most commonside effects for both groups is listed in Table 2. The mostcommon side effects reported by subjects in the nabilonegroup include (7/15), dry mouth (3/15).

Signicant reductions in VAS score for pain, FIQ score, and FIQ anxiety score were seen in thetreatment group at the 4-week visit. These signicantreductions are found both when comparing the treat-ment group with their baseline values and when com-paring the change from baseline to the placebo group at4 weeks. None of the study participants achieved a totalremission of their bromyalgia symptoms.Although improvements in VAS and FIQ scores were present after 4 weeks of treatment, there was no signif-icant change in the number of tender points or tenderpoint pain threshold, which is supported by other stud-ies. 2,23 Subjects in the placebo group did not obtain any sig- nicant benet in the outcome measures at any timeduring the study. After a 4-week washout period, out- Figure 5. Change in VAS score, nabilone vs placebo, mean /H11006SE.

Nabilone does not appear tohave any lasting benet in subjects when treatment isdiscontinued. Comparing the baseline FIQ scores in our study to some recent studies that used the FIQ, our subjects scored onaverage 12 to 22 points higher, 2,5,30indicating their quality of life was more severely affected by bromyal-gia. 23As our recruitment practices were similar, the rea - son for the disparity in the baseline FIQ scores and itseffect on our results is unclear. The signicant drop in the VAS ( /H110022.04, P/H11021.02) in our treatment group was similar to those of other drug trials,which ranged from 1.2 to 2.2. 2,5,17Our nding of a sig - nicant drop in the FIQ score ( /H1100212.07, P/H11021.02) was also similar to other drug trials whose drop in FIQ scoreranged from 5.53 to 15.8. 2,3,5,17,30Despite the poorerbaseline quality of life of our subjects, they still manageda signicant improvement in FIQ scores on par with otherstudies. This suggests that nabilone is an effective treat-ment even for those with severe cases of bromyalgiawith marked functional impairment. Although statistically signicant reductions in VAS score for pain, FIQ score, and FIQ anxiety score wereobserved in this study, the question remains whetherthese ndings are clinically signicant? With the cur-rent lack of understanding of the pathophysiology ofbromyalgia, and options in its medical manage-ment, 13the statistically signicant benets obtained in this study are promising and require considerationas an adjunct to the current medical management ofbromyalgia. The analgesic benets of cannabinoids in the treat- ment of acute and chronic pain have already been estab- Figure 7. Change in FIQ anxiety subset scores, nabilone vs placebo, mean /H11006SE. There was a signicant improvement in the change in anxiety score in the nabilone group when compared with placebo at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, with differences of ( /H110021.92, P/H11021 .025*) and ( /H110022.20, P/H11021.01**), respectively. Table 2. Side Effects Reported in the Treatment and Placebo Groups at 2 and 4 Weeks SIDEEFFECTPLACEBO NABILONE SIDEEFFECTPLACEBO in Fibromyalgialished,10so their benet in bromyalgia patients is not surprising. Whether this benet is secondary to a clinical endocannabinoid deciency in bromyalgia patients ashas been suggested 28or the synergistic relationship with endogenous opioids,27it is clear from previous studies that cannabinoids act at many sites along pain transmis-sion pathways. Other known actions of cannabinoids including inhibi- tion of prostaglandin E-2 synthesis, 8its anti-inflamma - tory effect,12experimental increases in /H9252-endorphins,34 and the regulation of substance P and enkephalin mRNAlevels in the basal ganglia 22could all contribute to less pain experienced in the nabilone-treated patients. Anxiety on the FIQ was also decreased in the treatment group at the 4-week visit, which is not exclusive to ourstudy. A trial assessing the effects of tramadol and acet-aminophen on patients with bromyalgia found similarimprovements in VAS, FIQ, and anxiety, without signif-icant improvements in depression or fatigue. 5Al- though part of the benet obtained in pain reductionand quality-of-life improvement in these patients maybe secondary to reduced anxiety, other studies havenot shown a change in anxiety despite signicant func-tional improvements. 30Further studies with validated scales for anxiety need to be conducted to explore thisissue. Nabilone was generally well tolerated by participants throughout the study. This is reassuring, as it is well known that patients with bromyalgia are sensitive tomost medications and have difculty tolerating medica-tion side effects. 15Although there were signicantly more side effects per person in the treatment group at 2and 4 weeks (1.58, P/H11021.02 and 1.54, P/H11021.05), respectively, no serious adverse effects were seen in the nabilone-treated subjects during the study. Three-quarters of thesubjects in the treatment group tolerated the medica-tion well and completed the study. Those who withdrewfrom the study did so at or before the rst follow-up visitat 2 weeks. The reported side effects of nabilone weregenerally mild, and nabilone did not appear to have ad-verse interactions with any of the concomitant medica-tions patients were taking, including antidepressants, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories,and opioids. This supports the ndings the conducted case series with nabilone and bro-myalgia patients. 18Slowing the titration of the medi - cation in longer studies may further reduce treatmentside effects. When prescribing nabilone, cost must be taken into consideration. Participants using nabilone at the dose wefound to be effective in the study should expect to payover four thousand dollars for a year's supply of the med-ication in Canada. Patients must weigh these costsagainst the potential benets of pain reduction and im-proved quality of life. As the medication's cost may beprohibitive to some patients, nabilone probably wouldnot be the rst line therapy prescribed to patients withbromyalgia but should be considered if other treat-ments have been ineffective.The current study is not without its limitations. Partic- ipants in both groups were allowed to continue any treatments for pain, with the use of nabilone as an ad-junctive therapy. Despite the benet in pain and anxietyreduction and quality of life improvement in the treat-ment group, it cannot be denitively concluded that thebenet was not a result of the combination of therapies.We thought that allowing both groups to continue theirongoing pain therapies controlled for this variable, andas bromyalgia patients using complementary therapiesranges in studies from 60 to 90 percent, 4the use of nabilone as an adjunct is clinically relevant. Future stud-ies could be done using nabilone as a single agent todetermine its effect on pain and quality of life alone. Given the fluctuating nature of bromyalgia symp- toms, 15our study was limited by its short duration and limited number of visits. To control for the fluctuatingnature of bromyalgia symptoms a pain journal could begiven to subjects; however, this requires more effort ontheir behalf and may lead to decreased adherence to theprotocol. Subjects were only trialed on nabilone for a total of 4 weeks, of which only the last week of treatment was at 1mg BID. The long-term effect of nabilone in alleviatingpain and improving quality of life in patients with bro-myalgia cannot be determined based on the short dura-tion of the study. As this study was the rst randomized,controlled trial to assess the benets of nabilone in sub-jects with bromyalgia, it was reasonable to conduct thisstudy for a shorter duration. Now that our study has shown signicant improvements for bromyalgia pa-tients, future studies should involve a longer duration ofthe treatment, at a stable dose. Although anxiety, depression, and fatigue were as- sessed in this study with single questions on the FIQ,these single questions are not validated scales for therespective symptoms. As the outcome measures in ourstudy focused on pain and quality of life, the VAS forpain and FIQ were the scales used to assess them. Reportsexist for 19,24and against1the incidence of depression and anxiety being higher in the bromyalgia popula-tion, and this area is still up for debate. Chronic fatiguesyndrome is associated with bromyalgia, 6and it has been reported that patients with bromyalgia have lessrestorative sleep. 11Future studies to evaluate the effect of nabilone on anxiety, depression, and fatigue in pa-tients with bromyalgia should use validated scales foreach. To our knowledge, this is the rst randomized, con- trolled trial to demonstrate the benet of nabilone onpain and quality of life in subjects with bromyalgia. Thesignicant reductions in VAS, FIQ, and anxiety seen in thetreatment group, coupled with minimal side effects, sug-gest that nabilone may be a benecial, well-tolerated,treatment option in patients with bromyalgia. Futurestudies are still necessary to assess the long-term benetof nabilone on pain and quality of life, and secondaryoutcome measures such as anxiety, depression, and171 ORIGINAL REPORT/Skrabek et alfatigue should be further explored with validated assess- ment tools.

Australians who currently use ca nnabis medicinally do so illegally and without assurances of quality control. Given the dearth of local information on this issue, this study explored the experiences of medical cannabis users. Methods: Australian adults who had us ed cannabis for medical purp oses were recruited using media stories. A total of 147 respondents were screened by phone and anonymous questionnaires were mailed, to be returned by postage paid envelope. Results: Data were available for 128 participants. Long term and regular medical cannabis use was frequently reported for multiple medical conditions including chronic pain (57%), depression (56%), arthritis (35%), persistent nausea (27%) and weight loss (26%). Cannabis was perceived to provide \"great relief\" overall (86%), and substantial relief of specific symptoms such as pain, nausea and insomnia. It was also typically perceived as supe rior to other medications in terms of undesirable effects, and the extent of relief provided. Howeve r, nearly one half (41%) experienced conditions or symptoms that were not helped by its use. Th e most prevalent concerns related to its illegality. Participants reported strong support for their use from clinicians and family. There was almost universal interest (89%) in participating in a clin ical trial of medical cannabis, and strong support (79%) for investigating alternative delivery methods. Conclusion: Australian medical cannabis users are riskin g legal ramifications, but consistent with users elsewhere, claim moderate to substantial benefits from its use in the management of their medical condition. In addition to strong public support, medical cannabis users show strong interest in clinical cannabis research, including the investigation of alternative delivery methods. Background While cannabis has long been part of folk pharmacopeia, there is a burgeoning body of research on its therapeutic potential. This has largely drawn on scientific advances in our understanding of the pharmacology of cannabis, and its complex interactions with the central nervous system, particularly endogenous brain reward pathways [1]. In addition to basic experimental research, case reports, sur-veys of people using cannabis for medical conditions and prospective clinical trials of cannabis-based medicines are consolidating the evidence that cannabis may play a role in the management of some medical conditions. Authori- tative reviews of this evidence indicate that cannabis has therapeutic potential for conditions such as HIV- and can- cer-related wasting, nausea and vomiting resulting fromPublished: 04 October 2005 Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 doi:10.1186/1477-7517-2-18Received: 17 August 2005 Accepted: 04 October 2005 This article is available from: http:// www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/2/1/18 \u00a9 2005 Swift et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

While current research reveals exciting therapeutic oppor- tunities, there is an ongoing debate about the virtues of obtaining such benefits from the complex chemical cock- tail contained in the whole plant or from one or more components isolated and developed into a synthetic phar- maceutical product. This debate cross-cuts important issues such as the difficulties of reliable dosing when using the natural product, whether the potential harms of smoking cannabis due to its ease of titration overshadow its therapeutic benefits, and whether different medical conditions will respond more favourably to the whole plant or to different constituents in isolation or combina- tion. However, underlying these issues is the reality that most people who use cannabis medicinally do so by using black market supplies of an illicit drug. As with the opiates, evaluations of the therapeutic poten- tial of cannabis occur in the context of a vigorous political debate on the use of an illicit drug with dependence potential for medicinal purposes. This situation is clearly evident in the United States, where there is an ongoing legal challenge by the Federal Government over the States' rights to allow cannabis to be used by registered medical users. Despite Canada's recent decision to provide a con- trolled supply of natural cannabis to registered users, and approvals for the marketing of Sativex, a pharmaceutical cannabis extract, in some countries, currently most users would rely on home-grown cannabis, or supplies obtained from friends, families, dealers and medical com- passion clubs. To date, there has been little interest in Australia in for- mally investigating the therapeutic potential of cannabis or investigating the practices of current medical users. In 1999 the NSW State Government commissioned a Work- ing Party to investigate the issue and recommend research and legislative options. Among their recommendations were: controlled clinical trials of cannabis, investigations into delivery methods other than smoking, surveys of cur- rent medical cannabis users and legislative amendments to allow compassionate use [4]. Subsequently, in 2003 the NSW Government announced it would conduct clini- cal trials, but despite generating significant publicity, there has been no further commitment by the NSW Gov- ernment on this issue. The 2004 National Drug Strategy Household Survey found widespread public support for medical cannabis use, with 68% supporting a change in legislation to permit use for medical purposes and 74% supporting a clinical trial of medicinal cannabis use [5]. It is not known how many people use cannabis for medici- nal purposes in Australia. Those who do use it engage in an illegal behaviour and risk arrest. Those that rely onblack market supplies use a product of unknown source and quality. Several surveys in the US, UK, Germany and Canada [6- 12] have reported perceived improvements in a variety of medical conditions following cannabis use. However, we know very little about the experiences of Australian users, and how they compare to findings in other studies. These authors are aware of only two unpublished Australian studies conducted in northern NSW; in 1998 a survey of 202 users recruited at the Nimbin HEMP Embassy [13], and in 2003 a survey of 48 members of a medical canna- bis information service [14]. This paper presents the results of a study of 128 users, which aimed to learn more about their patterns of use, experiences and concerns, and interest in participating in a medical cannabis trial. Methods Sample The sample comprised 128 people who used cannabis for medical purposes. To be eligible for the study, participants had to be living in Australia and to be currently using/ have previously used cannabis for medical purposes. While the study targeted residents of Australia's most pop- ulous state, NSW (pop: approximately 6.7 million), we did not exclude participants from other parts of Australia (total pop: approximately 20 million). As it is not known how many Australians use cannabis for medical purposes it was not possible to obtain a repre- sentative sample of such users. As this was an exploratory study to see who responded to a general call for participa- tion in the survey, we did not target groups representing people with specific medical conditions (e.g., HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis) or hospital departments known to treat patients who may benefit (e.g., oncology, chronic pain clinics). Participants were primarily recruited from oppor- tunistic media stories between November 2003 and August 2004, in newspapers, on radio and television. In addition, the Medical Cannabis Information Service (MCIS) in Nimbin, NSW, offered to tell its members about the survey and the International Association for Cannabis as Medicine (IACM), in Germany, placed the questionnaire on its website. A total of 147 enquiries were received between December 2003 and August 2004 by telephone and email and approximately 170 questionnaires distributed (some peo- ple requested multiple copies to distribute). For example, the media stories generated enquiries from several GPs who said they would inform certain patients of the study. Of the 131 questionnaires returned, 128 were used for analysis (75% of questionnaires sent out). Of the threeHarm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 3 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)discarded questionnaires, one respondent was a recrea- tional cannabis user and two had never used cannabis. Questionnaire The survey comprised an anonymous mail-out question- naire, adapted from one developed by the MCIS in a recent study of its members [14]. Several issues were cov- ered, including medical conditions/symptoms experi- enced, patterns of medical cannabis use, symptom relief and effects of use, comparison of cannabis to other medi- cations, source and legal concerns (e.g., arrest), other con- cerns over use, opinion of family, friends and medical personnel, and interest in participating in a cannabis trial. The final version incorporated comments from research- ers and clinicians interested in this issue. Procedure The study received ethics approval from the University of New South Wales Social/Health Human Research Ethics Advisory (HREA) Panel. Interested persons were screened for eligibility over the phone and informed of the purpose of the survey; assurances of anonymity and confidentiality were provided. Questionnaires were mailed to partici- pants, completed anonymously and returned in a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Addresses were destroyed when the questionnaire was posted.Analyses Data were entered into SPSS (Version 12.0.1). As this was an exploratory study with a small sample size, this paper reports descriptive statistics only. Percentages are pre- sented for categorical data; means (for normally distrib- uted) and medians (for skewed data) are presented for continuous data. While data are usually presented on the overall sample, gender and age differences are presented for some variables, where they are of interest. Results Demographics The sample was 63% male. Participants had a median age of 45 yrs (range 24-88), with almost one third (31%) aged 50 years or over, and one in ten (9%) aged 60 years plus. While the study targeted NSW residents (who repre- sented 58% of participants), responses came from across Australia, especially Queensland (15%) and Victoria (12%). Residents of other States and Territories each com- prised less than 3% of participants. Participants reported a wide range of medical conditions and symptoms associated in the literature with the use of medicinal cannabis (Table 1), most commonly chronic pain (53%) and arthritis (38%). Approximately one in five reported migraine (22%), weight loss (21%) and per- sistent nausea (20%). However, depression was the most commonly reported condition/symptom (60%). Up to 35 other conditions/symptoms were listed, most commonlyTable 1: Conditions/symptoms experienced, duration, and conditions/symptoms requiring cannabis relief (n = 128).

It is important to note that we did not ask participants to distinguish between primary symp- toms/conditions for which they sought treatment (e.g., cancer) and conditions which may have been secondary to this (e.g., depression) or consequent to treatment (e.g., chronic nausea). Multiple conditions (mean = 3.7, SD = 2.1, range = 1-10), of lengthy duration, were the norm, with three quarters (84%) reporting more than one con- dition and two thirds (67%) at least three conditions. Congruent with this picture, cannabis was used to relieve multiple symptoms (median = 3, range = 1-12), espe- cially chronic pain (57%), depression (56%), arthritis (35%), nausea (27%) and weight loss (26%).Patterns of medical cannabis use Participants had first tried cannabis for medical purposes at a median age of 31 years (range = 14-77). More than one quarter (29%) had discovered its therapeutic benefits as a spin-off from recreational use; others had tried it fol- lowing concerns about the side-effects of their medica- tions (14%), or a belief their medications or treatment were ineffective (13%), or had acted on the recommenda- tion of a medical practitioner (10%) or friend (10%). Table 2 presents data on patterns of medical use. Most (85%) were currently using cannabis therapeutically, even if sporadically. For those who had stopped, the main rea- sons were: their inability to obtain a regular supply (9/19 people), its illegality (7/19), cost (7/19) and disliking the side effects or route of use (each 3/19). Of those using intermittently, many reported their use would be more regular if it were more readily availability and cheaper. Medical use was typically long-term and regular. Use of less than one year was uncommon (12%), with more than half (61%) having used it for at least six years; one in five reported very long-term use (more than 20 years). Most used at least weekly (75%), and more than half (59%) used almost daily or daily. Approximately one in five (22%) specified they used it \"as required\" for their condi- tion (e.g., when pain was severe). Women tended to report shorter term use than men (52% vs. 31% citing use of 5 years or less). It was most common for participants' medical use to be stable (22%) or largely unchanged since they started (17%), although it was most common for the amount used to vary according to their condition (35%). About one in ten indicated some increase in dose had been required (12%), while few reported a decrease (5%). Women tended to report more variable (44% vs. 29% of men) or short term use (15% vs. 6% of men); men tended to report an increase in the amount needed (17% vs. 4% of women). In addition to medical use, three quarters (80%) of partic- ipants had used cannabis recreationally. Recreational use was less common among older participants (75% and 97% of recreational users were aged less than 50 years and 65 years, respectively). For almost half (46%), use in the past year had been solely medicinal, but the remainder reported recent recreational use - 29% in the past week, 19% in the past month and a further 6% in the past year. Route of use While most people had tried multiple routes for relief, overall smoking was the route most commonly reported (91%). Approximately half the sample (49%) alsoTable 2: Patterns of medical cannabis use (n = 128 unless specified) Total (%)Male (%)Female (%) Current use 85 86 83 Length of use <1 year 12 9 17 1-5 yrs 27 23 35 6-10 yrs 20 26 10 11-15 yrs 9 10 8 16-20 yrs 10 10 10 >20 yrs 21 23 19 Frequency of use (n = 126) several times a day 39 45 29 6-7 days/wk 24 19 31 1-5 days/wk 14 14 13 less than weekly 2 3 2 very seldom 2 1 2 as required 20 18 23 Method(s) of use (n = 127) eaten as cooked recipe 49 48 50 drunk as tea 7 8 6 smoked as cigarette (joint) 65 58 77 smoked as dry pipe (chillum) 24 28 19 smoked as water pipe (bong) 54 58 46 vaporiser 8 11 2 eaten as leaf/flower matter 3 4 2 Most helpful method of use (n = 126) eaten as cooked recipe 16 15 17 drunk as tea 2 3 2 smoked as cigarette (joint) 31 26 40 smoked as dry pipe (chillum) 10 13 4 smoked as water pipe (bong) 33 36 29 vaporiser 2 3 2 other 6 5 6Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 5 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)smoked tobacco, and two thirds (64.1%) mixed their can- nabis with tobacco. Eating cannabis in cooked recipes was also very prevalent (49%). While vaporisers are not readily available in Aus- tralia, 8% had used them. In addition, four people had used tinctures and one used it topically in the bath or as a cream for a skin condition. Overall, smoking was also considered to be the most helpful route of use for symp- tom relief (74%), although concerns about this route of use were widespread. Consistent with Australian research on preferred route of use and age [15], older users (aged 50 years +) typically found joints the most helpful method of use (41% vs. 26% of younger users), while younger users preferred the use of waterpipes (43% vs. 13% of older users). When asked to comment on the good and bad points of different methods of ingestion the most consistent response was that smoking of any form, particularly with tobacco, was detrimental to respiratory function (and health). This was of particular concern to non-smokers, some of whom did not know how to cook cannabis reci- pes. Despite attracting the bulk of negative comments, its popularity seemed to lie with its instant effect, its ease of titration and cost-effectiveness compared to the oral route. It seemed to \"do the job\". Eating was seen to be a much healthier option - it was \"safer\", tasty when cooked in a recipe, less obvious than smoking and could be done virtually anywhere. Some people liked its slow onset and long-lasting effects, but others claimed difficulties with titration and slow onset made it expensive and ineffective for rapid symptom relief. Effects of cannabis use When asked to rate the overall effects of cannabis on a Lik- ert scale ranging from \"I feel a lot worse\" to \"gives me great relief\", cannabis was perceived to provide \"great relief\" (86%) or a little relief (14%). No one believed it had been detrimental to their condition or symptoms. Positive ratings were (\"great\" or \"good\" relief) were also typical for its ability to relieve specific symptoms (Table 3). In addition, several other symptoms were noted, primarily insomnia (13% used for insomnia; of these 82% derived \"great\" relief). Approximately three quarters of participants (71%) claimed to have experienced a return of their symptoms or condition on stopping cannabis, especially: pain (53% of those who claimed a return of symptoms), depression or anxiety (30%), insomnia (11%), spasm (10%) and nau- sea/vomiting or lack of appetite (9%).Only one in ten (11%) participants reported symptoms they believed were unrelated to their medical condition upon stopping cannabis, citing symptoms congruent with cannabis withdrawal such as anxiety or mood disturbance (including paranoia), insomnia, loss of appetite, restless- ness and vivid dreams. Comparison with other medicines Almost two thirds (62%) of respondents claimed that they decreased or discontinued their use of other medi- cines when they started using cannabis medicinally. This was more common in males (65% vs. 58% of females) and older participants (aged 50 years +) (70% vs. 59% among younger participants). For some people this was aTable 3: Symptom relief (n = 128) Symptom relief required...* Total (%)Male (%)Female (%) Nausea relief 48 56 44 Of these, received: great relief 53 51 62 good relief 44 46 35 no effect 3 3 4 Pain relief 83 83 83 Of these, received: great relief 55 49 65 good relief 45 52 35 no effect 0 0 0 Ability to cope emotionally 66 70 60 Of these, received: great relief 45 40 54 good relief 54 58 46 no effect 1 2 0 Appetite stimulant 51 55 44 Of these, received: great relief 52 55 48 good relief 46 46 48 no effect 2 0 5 Decrease in spasms/tremor 39 36 44 Of these, received: great relief 43 43 43 good relief 55 54 57 no effect 2 4 0 Relief through relaxation 83 88 75 Of these, received: great relief 72 69 78 good relief 28 31 22 no effect 0 0 0 * No-one reported their condition was made worseHarm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 6 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)substantial change, representing a shift away from chronic, high-dose medication use. Perhaps not surprisingly, cannabis was typically perceived as superior to other medications in terms of undesirable effects, and the extent of relief provided (Table 4). Thus, cannabis was rated to produce equivalent (8%) or worse side effects (3%) by a minority of therapeutic users. It was considered to work \"a bit\" or \"much better\" than other medicines, or to be the only source of relief, by more than three quarters (82%). Two participants made the interest- ing comment that cannabis worked differently to other medicines, so could not be directly compared. Despite the very positive response to the use of cannabis, nearly one half (41%; 36% of men and 50% of women) found it did not help certain conditions/symptoms. Almost one third (29%) said cannabis was less effective for certain types of pain, or extreme pain, with a further 12% specifying migraine or headache pain. Nearly one in ten (8%) reported no effect on depression or anxiety. More than one in ten (14%) specified that while cannabis could ease their symptoms and enabled them to cope, they realised that it could not cure their underlying condi- tion. Younger participants were more likely than older participants to claim a condition not helped by cannabis (45% vs. 32% of those aged 50 years +).Supply issues Participants obtained medical cannabis from multiple sources (median = 1, range = 1-6; 44% had two or more sources), especially friends or family (58%) and dealers (42%). A substantial proportion grew their own (38%) while few (6%) obtained it from a compassion club or cooperative. Among those who purchased cannabis, the median weekly outlay was $50 (range = $1-$500, n = 95). When asked to comment on the variability of the canna- bis they used, those who could obtain a consistent supply of high quality cannabis that suited their needs were in the minority. Typically, participants noticed variability along a number of lines, such as potency, effectiveness, intoxica- tion and side-effects, which made titration difficult. While some noted the importance of factors such as the part of the plant used (e.g., leaf versus head/buds), strain (e.g., sativa versus indica ), soil and climate, the overwhelming responses focussed on hydroponic versus soil-grown can- nabis (\"bush bud\" or cannabis versus purchased cannabis. Hydroponic cannabis was almost universally unpopular and was avoided where possible - despite its greater potency, it was also considered shorter acting, produced greater tolerance and worse side-effects than other canna- bis. By comparison, soil-grown cannabis was perceived toTable 4: Comparison of cannabis with oth er medications (n = 128 unless specified).

However, it was also perceived as harder to get. Home grown canna- bis was seen as the best method of obtaining a consistent, safe supply of medicinal quality. A common response was that purchased cannabis was not to be trusted, and that unscrupulous growers who were more concerned with yield and greed compromised the quality of their crop with chemicals such as growth hormone and pesticides. Concerns A minority (13%) had no concerns over their medical can- nabis use. Concerns over potential health effects (32%) or the risk of dependence (21%) were overshadowed by those relating to its illegal status (76%), the fear of being arrested (60%) and cost (51%). Indeed, one quarter (27%) claimed to have been arrested, cautioned or con- victed in relation to their medical cannabis use, with this outcome more commonly reported by men (31% vs. 19% of women) and younger users (30% vs. 16% of users aged 50 years +). Other concerns mentioned (15%) were: the stigma of using, issues around parenting, pregnancy and relationships, availability, quality and difficulties in dose adjustment. Support from others and interest in clinical trial Most participants had a regular doctor (90%) and about a half had a regular specialist (55%). Virtually all (90%) had informed a clinician of their therapeutic use, typically reporting a supportive response from GPs (75% of those told), specialists (74%) and nurses (81%). Family and friends were largely considered supportive of the partici- pant's use (71%). Not surprisingly, there was widespread support for Gov- ernment provision of cannabis to patients in a variety of circumstances. At least three quarters supported the sup- ply of cannabis to any patient who was permitted to use it by being registered under a Government scheme (82%); more specifically, those patients who: could not afford to buy it on a regular basis (82%), could only purchase it on the black market (81%), couldn't ensure a consistent sup- ply (75%), or were worried about quality control issues (77%). More than half endorsed the supply of patients who did not know anyone capable of growing it (72%), were concerned about hydroponically grown cannabis (72%), or who needed a supply quickly (66%). Although not all participants were NSW residents, there was almost universal interest (89%) in participating in a clinical trial, in which a controlled supply of cannabis was grown and provided to registered medical cannabis users. There was also strong, although lesser, interest in trying alternative delivery methods such as a spray or tablet (79%).While for some people, the availability of any cannabis- derived product that worked was their prime concern, alternative delivery methods were considered attractive as they obviated the necessity to smoke, removed concern about engaging in illegal behaviour and having to access the black market, and were more portable and acceptable than smoking. The main caveats on an alternative were that it was easy to titrate, quick, efficient, reliable and nat- ural or safe - sprays and vaporisers were mentioned spe- cifically by some as preferable to pills in this regard. A clear theme was the desire to keep the holistic, natural properties of cannabis rather than produce a chemical/ synthetic drug with numerous binding and carrying agents. Nevertheless, there was recognition that different medical conditions may require different approaches, such as different active agents (e.g., THC versus other can- nabinoids), strains or methods (e.g., slow release pill ver- sus fast-acting spray). The main reason for not supporting alternatives appeared to be that using the whole plant in its natural state was perceived to be the best method. In addition, for some the ritual of cannabis use was perceived as part of its medici- nal benefit. There was also concern at political interfer- ence and its potential for exploitation and corruption in a trial. Discussion This exploratory study examined the patterns of medicinal cannabis use among a sample of 128 Australian adults who responded to media stories about this issue. Firstly, we need to acknowledge its limitations. As we do not know how many Australians use cannabis medicinally or their characteristics, we relied on the recruitment of vol- unteers through purposive sampling. Instead of targeting a particular group we used media stories disseminated widely on the radio, television and in newspapers to attract a cross-section of people. Thus, these results may not be representative of the experiences of all medicinal users, and may be affected by selection bias by excluding those who did not have access to these media, who did not wish to or could not contact us or did not return the questionnaire. We also attracted participants whose expe- riences with medical cannabis were typically positive, so they have little to tell us about people who have not found cannabis helpful or pleasant therapeutically. However, they still provide important information on these people's experiences, and raise important issues regarding the use of black market supplies of the cannabis plant and the development of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. As the questionnaire was self-completed, there was potential for misunderstanding of the questions. However, the word- ing was straightforward, contact details were provided in the event of misunderstanding, and the results were remarkably consistent across participants, which encour-Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 8 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)ages us that the questions were understood. Despite being anonymous, several participants provided us with contact details in case further information was needed, and wrote additional comments about their experiences and atti- tudes. In addition, many of the findings are remarkably consistent with the findings of other local and interna- tional studies, as indicated below. People in this study reported regular, ongoing medical use over quite long periods - with 61% using for more than five years and 20% reporting very long-term use of more than 20 years. However, as Ware and colleagues noted in their study of almost 1000 medical users [10], this was a group of chronically ill people with multiple long-stand- ing conditions. The perceived need for alternative or addi- tional symptom relief may reflect the fact that we recruited a sample of particularly entrenched medicinal cannabis users who were dissatisfied with conventional treatments, that medicinal cannabis use is more likely to considered an option by people who find conventional treatments and medications unsatisfactory, or that many had been exposed to its perceived medical benefits quite early due to their recreational use. Larger studies addressing a broad cross-section of users may better answer this question. Consistent with the literature on the conditions for which cannabis has been indicated, chronic pain, arthritis, per- sistent nausea and weight loss were among the most com- mon conditions for which cannabis relief was sought. However, depression was the most common condition: m o r e t h a n h a l f ( 5 6 % ) u s e d c a n n a b i s t o r e l i e v e d e p r e s - sion, and two thirds (66%) used it to cope emotionally, universally obtaining great or good relief. Other studies have also reported cannabis use for the relief of depres- sion, although not at this level [8-10,14]. The relationship between depression and cannabis use is controversial, with recent literature indicating that cannabis use may be implicated in depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviours This would suggest that regular medicinal use may be contraindicated by placing people at risk of depres- sion or self-harm. However, we do not know the type or aetiology of the depression cited by our participants. Many may have experienced depression and stress associ- ated with their physical condition, which may have been alleviated along with any physical relief. The risk may also be greatest among heavy, younger users and those who may already be vulnerable to mental ill health due to their life circumstances [16-18]. Medical cannabis use patterns may not typically be regular enough to pose a great risk. Regardless, it is important that people considering the use of medical cannabis are aware of the risks of use [19]. A recent paper [20] has suggested that THC and cannabid- iol, two major components of cannabis, may help allevi- ate bipolar disorder, recommending a pharmaceuticalproduct would be a safer option than crude cannabis, in which the balance of components is variable. Consistent with local and international research on peo- ple with a variety of medical conditions [8-12,14], most participants claimed moderate to substantial benefits from cannabis, both in terms of their overall condition and management of individual symptoms. It was typically considered more effective and less aversive than other medications in managing their condition(s), the symp- toms of which commonly re-emerged upon stopping (71%). While their use was often complementary to other medications and treatment, 62% had decreased or discon- tinued use of other medications when they commenced medicinal cannabis use. Nevertheless, cannabis was not a panacea - it did not help all conditions, particularly cer- tain types of pain, and there was recognition that while it substantially improved quality of life it was not a cure. This is not necessarily surprising, as overall well-being and specific symptoms have multiple causes and can be affected by several factors, and is borne out by recent con- trolled clinical trials, for example, on chronic pain [21]. As others have reported (e.g., [8-10] we also found that in addition to medical use, recreational use was common: most (80%) had used cannabis recreationally, with about one half (54%) of these reporting some recent use. Indeed, 29% had discovered its therapeutic potential through their recreational use. One participant raised the issue that part of the therapeutic effect for them was the ritual of use and the \"high\" experienced [6]. This demonstrates the difficulty of precisely identifying the therapeutic component when people are using the natural plant matter, and will continue to present a challenge for the development of cannabis pharmaceuticals. While some people may find the illegality, route of use and psy- choactive effects of natural cannabis undesirable and pre- fer a manufactured pharmaceutical product, several in this survey claimed to prefer the holistic delivery of all the compounds present when using the natural plant. We need to know more about the effect of the different active chemicals on medical conditions and how their therapeu- tic potential is mediated by the context of use. Nonetheless, this was not simply a sample of recreational users, especially as we attracted many older users who used exclusively for medical reasons (75% of those aged 50 years+). They did not fit the recreational user stereo- type, were willing to take the risk of using an illicit drug, exposure to the illicit drug market and the possibility of arrest to gain symptom relief. Indeed, the most common concern over medicinal use was its illegality, fear of arrest and cost (all >50%). One quarter (27%) of participants had experienced legal ramifications due to their use. Sev- eral people commented that they had no alternative thanHarm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:18 http://www.harmreduction journal.com/content/2/1/18 Page 9 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)using an illegal drug, claiming that other medicines with negative and toxic effects (e.g., opiates) were legally pre- scribed, and that if nothing else worked for them they had the right to access cannabis without fear or stigma. Several made pleas for medical cannabis use to be treated as a medical, rather than a legal, issue, as their health and quality of life were at stake. Smoking was the most common method of use; in addi- tion, many were tobacco smokers or mixed cannabis with tobacco. Given the similarities between cannabis and tobacco smoke this is of particular concern for people who are ill, especially those with compromised immune systems. Despite acknowledgement of the risks of smok- ing and concerns expressed over its effects, it was consid- ered the most helpful route of use. While eating was perceived as much healthier, until satisfactory solutions are achieved on titration and dosing issues, smoking will no doubt continue to be a popular method of obtaining relief. Cannabis dependence was a concern for one in five partic- ipants (21%). This study provided indirect evidence that participants were unlikely to experience withdrawal symptoms on ceasing medical use, but this was only a crude measure. While the risk of dependence is probably low when used medicinally, this risk needs to be weighed up with the other concerns of the patient - for example, it may be low on the list of concerns for those with terminal illness [19]. Finally, participants reported that family and friends were likely to know about and support their medical cannabis use. These data also indicate that the medical profession is encountering, and frequently supporting, patients who use cannabis for symptom relief. Given their central role in the management of illness, it is important that clini- cians are educated about the effects of cannabis, in order to assist patients in making informed decisions about their treatment. There was also clearly great interest among participants in a clinical trial and scope to investi- gate methods of delivery that avoid the health concerns associated with smoking cannabis, keeping in mind that some participants were reluctant to use a pharmaceutical product. In addition to distrust of unscrupulous partici- pants in the black market, some were also distrustful of Government's motives and role in therapeutic research. It is therefore vital that any clinical trials are conducted in a rigorous, independent manner. Conclusion Overall, these findings are consistent with those of other surveys, in revealing the perceived effectiveness of canna- bis for the relief of symptoms associated with several med- ical conditions. While a small study, it has severalimplications. Firstly, people are risking the use of an illicit drug for its perceived therapeutic effects, and in some cases being arrested. Secondly, they are informing their clinicians about their medical use and frequently receiv- ing support, highlighting the importance of ensuring cli- nicians are informed about cannabis. Finally, in addition to strong public support, medical cannabis users show strong interest in clinical cannabis research, including the investigation of alternative delivery methods.

Population Characteristics from Nine California Assessment Clinics Ph.D.*; Helen \u2014 Marijuana is a currently illegal psychoactive drug that many physicians believe has sub- stantial therapeutic uses. The medical literature contains a growing number of studies on cannabinoidsas well as case studies and anecdotal reports suggesting therapeutic potential. Fifteen states have passedmedical marijuana laws, but little is known about the growing population of patients who use mari-juana medicinally. This article reports on a sample of 1,746 patients from a network of nine medicalmarijuana evaluation clinics in California. Patients completed a standardized medical history form;evaluating physicians completed standardized evaluation forms. From this data we describe patientcharacteristics, self-reported presenting symptoms, physician evaluations, other treatments tried, otherdrug use, and medical marijuana use practices. Pain, insomnia, and anxiety were the most commonconditions for which evaluating physicians recommended medical marijuana. Shifts in the medicalmarijuana patient population over time, the need for further research, and the issue of diversion arediscussed. Keywords \u2014 anxiety, cannabis therapeutics, insomnia, medical marijuana, pain Medicinal preparations containing marijuana (cannabis) were widely used in many societies for centuries.

Marijuana was admitted to theUnited States Pharmacopoeia in 1850 and listed in theNational Formulary and the US Dispensatory . Major pharmaceutical companies including Lilly, Burroughs- Wellcome, and Parke-Davis produced cannabis-basedtherapeutic agents (Brecher et al. 1972). In 1936, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics advocated a law prohibiting its use, which Congress passed in 1937, against the advice of the American Medical Association (Grinspoon & Bakalar 1993:9-11). This law, along withincreased prescribing of aspirin and barbiturates, pushed cannabis out of the United States Pharmacopoeia and common medical practice by 1942. After nonmedical cannabis use spread in the 1960s, the number of Americans reporting lifetime prevalence Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 128 V olume 43 (2), April - June 2011 Downloaded by [Portland State University] at 10:24 26 November 2014 Reinarman et al. Who Are Medical Marijuana Patients? increased sharply. Recent estimates from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health show that 102,404,000 Americans have used this drug, 41% of the population aged 12 and over, or about half the adult population (SAMHSA 2010). This widespread use led to a gradual rediscovery of the therapeutic uses of cannabis, albeit largely withoutphysician involvement. Alongside the spread of nonmedical use, in 1964 sci- entists determined the precise chemical structure of delta-9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), thought to be the most sig- nicant psychoactive ingredient in cannabis (Gaoni & Mechoulam stimulated research in the clin-ical pharmacology of cannabinoids. Many physicians in clinical practice also recognized the therapeutic potential of cannabis (Irvine 2006; Charuvastra, Freidmann & Stein2005), specically, for example, for pain (Woolridge et al. 2005), as an antiemetic for chemotherapy patients (Doblin & Kleiman 1991), or for symptoms of AIDS (Abramset al. 2003). More recently a broader medical litera- ture documenting the therapeutic properties of endogenous cannabinoids has developed (e.g., Nicoll & Alger 2004; Lehmann et al. 2002; Hall, Degenhart & Currow 2001). Numerous case reports in the medical literature also havesuggested that cannabis has therapeutic potential for a vari- ety of conditions. But rigorous experimental research that might determine more precisely the therapeutic efcacyof cannabis for specic conditions has been blocked by the Drug Enforcement Administration (see Zeese 1999; Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug EnforcementAdministration 1994). This combination of increasing therapeutic use and federal government opposition ultimately led to passage ofnew state laws providing for the medical use of cannabis upon physician recommendation. Since 1996, 15 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have passed suchlaws: California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Maine, Montana, Michigan, and Washington, DC by ballot initiative; Rhode Island, New Mexico, Vermont, Hawaii, and New Jersey by state legislation. The rst of these laws was California's Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act, passed in 1996 ( San Francisco Chronicle 1996). This act made it legal under state law for patients to possess and use cannabis if recom-mended by their physicians. Numerous medical and scien- tic associations endorsed medical use of cannabis and /or supported further research into its therapeutic poten-tial. These included the American College of Physicians (2008), the American Public Health Association (1995), the British Medical Association (1997), the Canadian MedicalAssociation (2005), and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences (1999). Such elections and endorsements notwithstanding, the Bush Administration's Ofce of National Drug Control Policy threatened to revoke the license sof physicians who recommended cannabis to patients. One physicianchallenged this policy and the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled (inConant v. Walters) in 2002 that it unconstitutionally infringed physicians' First Amendment rights to freedom of speech with their patients (McCarthy 2004). Subsequent legislation and case law have left medical marijuana (MM) patients and their physicians in legal limbo: \u0081 In 2003, the California legislature passed SB 420 to provide specic implementation guidelines for Proposition 215, including how counties should han-dle MM patient ID cards. \u0081 Most drug law enforcement is done by local police who enforce state, not federal, drug laws.In 2005, The California Attorney General ruled that Proposition 215 is the legitimate will of the voters and is therefore valid under the CaliforniaConstitution for purposes of state law enforcement. He advised the Highway Patrol and other state law enforcement agencies that under California law MMpatients were legally entitled to possess and use cannabis for therapeutic purposes (Hoge 2005). \u0081 In 2006, Bush administration Attorney General Gonzales sought to invalidate state MM laws, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled ( Gonzales v. Raich 2006 )that the Compassionate Use Act\u2014its legiti- mate electoral provenance notwithstanding\u2014neither supersedes nor invalidates federal laws that prohibitmarijuana use (see Mikos 2009 for a legal analysis of the states' neglected power to legalize behavior that is criminalized under federal law). \u0081 In 2008 the Supreme Court denied without comment an appeal by two California counties that had refused to implement Proposition 215 ( County of San Diego v. San Diego NORML 2008), thereby letting stand a lower court ruling that upheld SB 420's provisions regarding counties issuing MM identication cards. \u0081 In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder issued a pol- icy stating that federal drug control agencies would no longer raid MM dispensaries if they operated within state and local laws (Moore 2009). \u0081 That policy notwithstanding, the DEA has continued to raid MM dispensaries in California into 2011 (e.g., Blankstein 2009). Within this grey area between conflicting state and federal laws, the number of patients who have received rec- ommendations for medical marijuana from physicians has continued to grow, albeit by how much remains unknown.Over 1,000 MM dispensaries, delivery services, and coop- eratives are said to be operating in California to meet the demand (NORML 2007). A rough estimate of the number of MM patients in California can be extrapolated from Oregon gures. Unlike California's Compassionate Use Act, Oregon's MM law set up an Oregon MedicalMarijuana Program that requires centralized record keep- ing. As of July, 2009, some 2,983 Oregon-licensed physi- cians had approved 20,307 applications for MM (Oregon Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 129 V olume 43 (2), April - June 2011 Downloaded by [Portland State University] at 10:24 26 November 2014 Reinarman et al. Who Are Medical Marijuana Patients? Department of Human Services 2008 ). The population of California is 9.7 times that of Oregon (U.S. Census 2007), which yields a crude estimate of 196,978 MM patients in California. This is likely an underestimate because the California statute affords greater latitude to physicians regarding the conditions for which they can recommendMM (\". . . any other illness for which marijuana provides relief\"). Americans for Safe Access (2008), a MM patient advocacy group, has estimated that there are well over200,000 physician-sanctioned MM patients in California. Despite their growing numbers, however, the ambigu- ous legal status of MM patients renders them a half-hiddenpopulation whose characteristics are not well documented, with the partial exception of the San Francisco Bay Area (O'Connell & Bou-Matar 2007; Reiman 2007a). Medicalmarijuana will likely continue to be a contentious issue, but across fteen states and the District of Columbia several hundred thousand people are using marijuana as a medicinerecommended by physicians, and yet little is known about them as a patient population. We intend this study as a modest contribution toward lling this gap. It presents data on the demographic char- acteristics, presenting symptoms, physician evaluations,conventional treatments tried, and MM use practices of patients from a network of MM assessment clinics in California. METHODS These data were drawn from 1,746 consecutive admissions to nine MM assessment clinics operating inCalifornia in July, August, and September 2006. These assessment clinics are not dispensaries and are not con- nected to dispensaries. They were located throughout thestate\u2014in the north and south, coast and central valley, and large and small cities: Modesto, Oakland, Sacramento, Hollywood, San Diego, Santa Cruz, Ukiah, San Francisco, and Santa Rosa. They charged $100 to $125 for an assess- ment. At the time our sample was drawn, these assessmentclinics had evaluated over 54,000 MM patients. Without a comprehensive patient database or representative house- hold surveys, there is no way to determine precisely howrepresentative this sample is of the overall population of MM patients. Moreover, there is a large albeit unknown number of people who use marijuana medicinally but whohave not sought physician recommendations or ofcial patient ID cards, perhaps because of the expense of the assessment. 1 Evaluating physicians interviewed potential patients and evaluated their patient medical histories for purposes of recommending MM and issuing patient identication cardsunder the Compassionate Use Act and SB 420. The eval- uation instruments were (1) a basic patient-administered medical history questionnaire covering demographics, pre-senting symptoms or conditions, brief medical history,conventional and alternative medical treatments tried, drug use history, and MM use practices; and (2) a physician eval- uation form using International Classication of Diseases codes (ICD-9). Each patient received and signed an exten- sive informed consent form noting condentiality, which was approved by the clinics' IRB. Most prior studies of MM patients are based on small, symptom-specic samples. Initially, the population of MM patients in the San Francisco Bay Area were people withHIV/AIDS and cancer (e.g., Harris, Mendelson & Jones 1998). Later, physicians began to recommend cannabis to patients with chronic pain, mood disorders and other psy-chiatric conditions (Gieringer 2002). The data reported here describe what is among the largest and most symp- tomatically and demographically diverse samples of medi-cal cannabis patients to date (cf., O'Connell & Bou-Matar 2007). RESULTS As Table 1 indicates, the MM patients are three-fourths male and three-fths White. Compared to the US Censusof California, the patients in this sample are on average somewhat younger, report slightly more years of formal education, and are more often employed. The comparisonalso indicates that women, Latinos, and Asian Americans are underrepresented. Given the limitations of our data, we can offer only informed speculation as to why. The underrepresentation of women may be in part an epidemiological artifact of the gender distribution of certain kinds of injuries (e.g., workplace, sports, and motor-cycle accidents). It may also have to do with the double stigma women face in seeking MM\u2014for using an illicit drug and for violating gender-specic norms against ille-gal behavior in general. Moreover, as with alcohol use, pregnant women and women considering pregnancy are likely to have health concerns and many may fear that MM could put them in jeopardy if discovered by child protection agencies. Given the high poverty rate among Latinos and their concentration in the manual labor end of the occupational structure, Latinos are exposed to equal or greater risksof work-related injuries and to no less epidemiologic risk of other conditions for which MM is sometimes used. It seems likely that their under-representation has to do withthe undocumented status of many Latinos in California. The undocumented often avoid contact with government agencies for fear of apprehension by law enforcement,for beyond arrest and incarceration this carries the risk of deportation. Such fears reduce the likelihood of Latinos accessing health care in general and MM in particular.Asian Americans are also underrepresented, but this may be because they have lower prevalence of marijuana use than other racial /ethnic groups and /or because they have their own venerable traditions of herbal medicine.

African-Americans, conversely, are over-represented in this sample. This does not appear to stem from theirprevalence of marijuana use, for representative national surveys show that Blacks generally do not have signif- icantly higher prevalence of marijuana use than Whites(SAMHSA 2005). African-Americans may be more likely to seek MM for any of several reasons: because they are disproportionately poor, more often lack health insur- ance, are signicantly less likely to be prescribed other medication for pain (Pletcher et al. 2008) or to receivetreatment for cancer (Gross et al. 2008), and because African-Americans are a growing proportion of HIV /AIDS cases. Some of these same reasons may help to explain whyNative Americans are also overrepresented, although their proportion of both this sample and the general population is too small to judge representativeness accurately. In their medical history questionnaires, patients were asked \"Which of the following best describe the therapeu- tic benet you receive from medicinal cannabis? (Checkthe most important).\" Patients typically reported more than one therapeutic benet (mean =3). Early studies showed most patients used MM to relieve symptoms of HIV /AIDS (Woolridge et al. 2005) or cancer, and it is likely that the majority of patients in our sample who reported \"nausea\" were cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. However,Table 2 suggests that cancer and AIDS patients are now aTABLE 2 Patient Self-Reports of Therapeutic Benets from Medicinal Marijuana Percent To Relieve: Pain 82.6 Muscle Spasms 41.1 Headaches 40.7Anxiety 37.8 Nausea /V omiting 27.7 Depression 26.1Cramps 19.0 Panic Attacks 16.9 Diarrhea 5.0Itching 2.8 To Improve: Sleep 70.7Relaxation 55.1 Appetite 37.7 Concentration /Focus 22.9 Energy 15.9 To Prevent: Medication Side Effects 22.5Anger 22.4 Involuntary Movements 6.2 Seizures 3.2 As Substitute for: Prescription Medication 50.9Alcohol 13.0 N=1,745; patients could report more than one benet in more than one category. signicantly smaller proportion of the total (e.g., \"to relieve nausea /vomiting\" 27.7%, \"to improve appetite\" 37.7%) and that the MM patient population has become more diverse since the Compassionate Use Act was passed in 1996 (cf. Ware, Adams & Guy 2005, on MM use in the UK, and Grotenherman 2002 on MM use in Germany). Instead, relief of pain, muscle spasms, headache, and anxiety, as well as to improve sleep and relaxation were the most common reasons patients cited for using MM.Chronic pain also topped the list of maladies for which MM was used in another California clinical sample (Reiman 2007b). Table 3 shows the ICD-9 diagnostic codes most fre- quently recorded by evaluating physicians. Pain from back and neck injuries was the most frequently coded. Thisappears consistent with a nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which found a 19.3% increase in the prevalence of spine problems between 1997 and2005 (Martin et al. 2008). Back and neck pain was fol- lowed in frequency by sleep disorders (also increasing), anxiety /depression, muscle spasms, and arthritis. Fully half of this sample reported using MM as a substitute Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 131 V olume 43 (2), April - June 2011 Downloaded by [Portland State University] at 10:24 26 November 2014 Reinarman et al.

Table 4 indicates that the MM patients in the sample had tried a variety of other treatments, conventional andalternative, for the conditions for which they were seek- ing a MM identication card. Four in ve (79.3%) reported having tried other medications prescribed by their physi-cians (almost half were opiates); about half (48.7%) had tried physical therapy; over a third (36.3%) had tried chi- ropractic; nearly one-fourth (22.3%) reported having hadsurgery for their condition.

Data not available in comparable form. use was somewhat higher than in the general popula- tion, but prevalence of alcohol use was signicantly lower.Many patients reported that they valued MM because it allowed them to reduce their alcohol use. It is possible that self-reports on a self-administered instrument will under-estimate illicit drug use, particularly if patients felt that admitting illicit drug use could reduce their chances of obtaining a MM identication card. Rigorous assessmentsof the reliability of such data must await further research, but limitations aside, these data suggest low prevalence of other illicit drug use among MM patients. While it is truethat the great majority of our respondents had used mari- juana recreationally, in response to a separate question over two-fths (41.2%) reported that they had notbeen using it recreationally prior to trying it for medicinal purposes. Table 6 presents data on patients' medical marijuana use practices. Amounts used per week varied from three grams or less (40.1%) to seven or more grams (23.3%). Two-thirds (67%) reported using MM daily while one-fourth (26%) reported using less than once a week. Half (52.9%) reported using one or two times per day while one in ten (10%) reported using three or more times per day.Patients consumed MM primarily in the evenings (52.3%) or prior to sleep (56.1%). More than two in ve (42.3%) reported that when they used depended on their medi-cal symptoms. Patients ingested MM predominantly by smoking (86.1%), although one-fourth (24.4%) reported ingesting orally and nearly a fourth (21.8%) reported usinga vaporizer. These latter gures suggest that at least some of the time, many MM patients are choosing modes of inges- tion that reduce the perceived risk of harms from smoking(Tan et al. 2009; Hashibe et al. 2006).

DISCUSSION Rediscovery of Medicinal Utility and Diversifying Patient Population Compared to earlier studies of MM patients, these data suggest that the patient population has evolved from mostly HIV/AIDS and cancer patients to a signicantly more diverse array. The diffusion of marijuana as a medicine may have been slower than that of other medicines in con- ventional clinical practice because the flow of informationfrom physician to patient is impeded by MM's ambiguous legal status. Thus, information about the potential thera- peutic utility of cannabis is spread mostly via word ofmouth and other informal means. This suggests that the patient population is likely to continue evolving as new patients and physicians discover the therapeutic uses ofcannabis. Ironically, this trend toward increasing thera- peutic uses is bringing marijuana back to the position it held in the U.S. Pharmacopeia prior to its prohibition in1937.Further Research Like other medicines, marijuana's therapeutic efcacy varies across conditions and patient groups. This variation seems more likely when supplies remain illicit because standardized dosages or other quality controls are more dif- cult to achieve. To gain maximum therapeutic potentialacross the growing range of conditions for which MM is being recommended, more systematic research is needed. Longitudinal, case control, and double-blind studies arerequired to rigorously assess marijuana's therapeutic ef- cacy for specic patient groups, conditions, and diseases. With regard to shifts in the patient population, it also wouldbe very useful to have follow-up studies of patients access- ing the assessment clinics in our sample and others drawn from similar assessment clinics. Diversion Critics have argued that some MM patients are \"gam- ing the system\" to get marijuana for nonmedical use. Neither our data nor any other data we are aware of allow any clear-cut, empirical estimate of the scale of such diver- sion. Given the widespread nonmedical use marijuana inthe (102,404,000 Americans report life- time prevalence; see SAMHSA 2010) and the risk of arrest (847,864 Americans were arrested for marijuana offensesin 2008, 754,224 or 88.96% of them for possession alone; FBI 2009), it seems likely that at least some MM patients use MM dispensaries as sources of supply for nonmedicaluse. Dening and measuring such diversion, however, is complicated at best. Given the high prevalence of nonmed-ical use, it is not surprising that most MM patients in our sample reported having used it recreationally before using it therapeutically. But as noted above, two-fths had not been using marijuana recreationally prior to trying it for medicinal purposes. Their self-reported rates of other illicit drug use are slightly lower than those found among the gen- eral population, and their levels of educational attainment and rate of employment are comparable to the Californiapopulation. Our data have clear limitations, but they con- tain no obvious signs that MM patients differ from the general population. Nor is drug diversion unique to medical marijuana. A signicant albeit unknown proportion of other patients obtain prescriptions for numerous drugs through legalmedical channels that they then use for nonmedical pur- poses, for example, Valium and ADHD, and Oxycontin and other opiates prescribed for pain. The diversion issue will likely become more impor- tant as the line between medical and nonmedical drug use is increasingly blurred (Murray, Gaylin & Macklin 1984). Beyond the spread of MM, Prozac and other SSRI-type antidepressants, for example, are often prescribed Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 133 V olume 43 (2), April - June 2011 Downloaded by [Portland State University] at 10:24 26 November 2014 Reinarman et al. Who Are Medical Marijuana Patients? for patients who do not meet DSM criteria for clinical depression but who simply feel better when taking it. Such \"cosmetic psychopharmacology\" (Kramer 1993) is likely to grow as new psychiatric medications come to market. The line between medical and nonmedical drug use has also been blurred by performance enhancing drugs suchas steroids, so-called \"smart drugs\" that combine vitamins with psychoactive ingredients, and herbal remedies like ma huang (ephedra) available in health food stores (Burros & Jay 1996). These examples suggest that despite the best intentions of physicians and law makers, much drug use does not t into two neat boxes, medical and nonmedical, but ratherexists on a continuum where one shades into the other aspatients' purposes shift to suit situational exigencies in their health and their daily lives. It is not clear where a border line between medical and nonmedical marijuana orother drug use might be drawn nor how it might be effec- tively policed (see Reinarman & Levine 1997: 334-44). NOTE 1. We are grateful to one anonymous reviewer for pointing out that the cost of these assessments may well have prevented some potential MM patients\u2014includingmany impoverished HIV /AIDS patients\u2014from obtaining ID cards, which may have affected the demographics of this sample.

All rights reserved.Preface Public opinion on the medical value of marijuana has been sharply divided. Some dismiss medical marijuana as ahoax that exploits our natural compassion for the sick; oth-ers claim it is a uniquely soothing medicine that has beenwithheld from patients through regulations based on falseclaims. Proponents of both views cite \"scientific evidence \" to support their views and have expressed those views atthe ballot box in recent state elections. In January 1997, theWhite House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) asked the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review of the scien-tific evidence to assess the potential health benefits and risks of marijuanaand its constituent cannabinoids. That review began in August 1997 andculminates with this report. The ONDCP request came in the wake of state \"medical marijuana \" initiatives. In November 1996, voters in California and Arizona passedreferenda designed to permit the use of marijuana as medicine. AlthoughArizona 's referendum was invalidated five months later, the referenda galvanized a national response. In November 1998, voters in six states(Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) passedballot initiatives in support of medical marijuana. (The Colorado vote willnot count, however, because after the vote was taken a court ruling deter-mined there had not been enough valid signatures to place the initiativeon the ballot.) viiMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The three 2-day workshops \u2014in Irvine, California; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Washington, D.C. \u2014were open to the public and included scientific presentations and individual reports, mostly frompatients and their families, about experiences with and perspectives onthe medical use of marijuana. Scientific experts in various fields were se-lected to talk about the latest research on marijuana, cannabinoids, andrelated topics. (Cannabinoids are drugs with actions similar to THC, theprimary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.) In addition, advocates forand against the medical use of marijuana were invited to present scien-tific evidence in support of their positions. Finally, the Institute of Medi-cine appointed a panel of nine experts to advise the study team on techni-cal issues. Public outreach included setting up a Web site that provided infor- mation about the study and asked for input from the public. The Web sitewas open for comment from November 1997 until November 1998. Some130 organizations were invited to participate in the public workshops.Many people in the organizations \u2014particularly those opposed to the medical use of marijuana \u2014felt that a public forum was not conducive to expressing their views; they were invited to communicate their opinions(and reasons for holding them) by mail or telephone. As a result, roughlyequal numbers of persons and organizations opposed to and in favor ofthe medical use of marijuana were heard from. Advances in cannabinoid science over the past 16 years have given rise to a wealth of new opportunities for the development of medicallyuseful cannabinoid-based drugs. The accumulated data suggest a varietyof indications, particularly for pain relief, antiemesis, and appetite stimu-lation. For patients who suffer simultaneously from severe pain, nausea,and appetite loss, such as those with AIDS or who are undergoing che-motherapy, cannabinoid drugs might offer broad-spectrum relief notfound in any other single medication. Marijuana is not a completely benign substance. It is a powerful drug with a variety of effects. However, the harmful effects to individuals fromthe perspective of possible medical use of marijuana are not necessarilythe same as the harmful physical effects of drug abuse. Although marijuana smoke delivers THC and other cannabinoids to the body, it also delivers harmful substances, including most of thosefound in tobacco smoke. In addition, plants contain a variable mixture ofbiologically active compounds and cannot be expected to provide a pre-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

For those reasons, the report concludes that the future of cannabinoid drugs lies not in smoked marijuana but in chemi-cally defined drugs that act on the cannabinoid systems that are a naturalcomponent of human physiology. Until such drugs can be developed andmade available for medical use, the report recommends interim solutions. John A. Benson, Jr. Stanley J.

Some dismiss medical marijuana as ahoax that exploits our natural compassion for the sick; oth-ers claim it is a uniquely soothing medicine that has beenwithheld from patients through regulations based on falseclaims. Proponents of both views cite \"scientific evidence\"to support their views and have expressed those views atthe ballot box in recent state elections. In January 1997, theWhite House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct a review ofthe scientific evidence to assess the potential health benefits and risks ofmarijuana and its constituent cannabinoids (see the Statement of Task onpage 9). That review began in August 1997 and culminates with this re-port. The ONDCP request came in the wake of state \"medical marijuana\" initiatives. In November 1996, voters in California and Arizona passedreferenda designed to permit the use of marijuana as medicine.

Can marijuana relieve health problems? Is it safe for medical use? Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.2 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE Those straightforward questions are embedded in a web of social con- cerns, most of which lie outside the scope of this report. Controversiesconcerning the nonmedical use of marijuana spill over into the medicalmarijuana debate and obscure the real state of scientific knowledge. Incontrast with the many disagreements bearing on social issues, the studyteam found substantial consensus among experts in the relevant disci-plines on the scientific evidence about potential medical uses of marijuana. This report summarizes and analyzes what is known about the medi- cal use of marijuana; it emphasizes evidence-based medicine (derivedfrom knowledge and experience informed by rigorous scientific analysis),as opposed to belief-based medicine (derived from judgment, intuition,and beliefs untested by rigorous science). Throughout this report, marijuana refers to unpurified plant sub- stances, including leaves or flower tops whether consumed by ingestionor smoking. References to the \"effects of marijuana \" should be under- stood to include the composite effects of its various components; that is,the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the primary psycho-active ingredient in marijuana, are included among its effects, but not allthe effects of marijuana are necessarily due to THC. Cannabinoids are the group of compounds related to THC, whether found in the marijuanaplant, in animals, or synthesized in chemistry laboratories. Three focal concerns in evaluating the medical use of marijuana are: 1. Evaluation of the effects of isolated cannabinoids; 2. Evaluation of the risks associated with the medical use of mari- juana; and 3. Evaluation of the use of smoked marijuana. EFFECTS OF ISOLATED CANNABINOIDS Cannabinoid Biology Much has been learned since the 1982 IOM report Marijuana and Health . Although it was clear then that most of the effects of marijuana were due to its actions on the brain, there was little information abouthow THC acted on brain cells (neurons), which cells were affected byTHC, or even what general areas of the brain were most affected by THC.In addition, too little was known about cannabinoid physiology to offerany scientific insights into the harmful or therapeutic effects of marijuana.That all changed with the identification and characterization of cannab-inoid receptors in the 1980s and 1990s. During the past 16 years, sciencehas advanced greatly and can tell us much more about the potential medi-cal benefits of cannabinoids.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3 CONCLUSION :At this point, our knowledge about the biology of marijuana and cannabinoids allows us to make some general con-clusions: Cannabinoids likely have a natural role in pain modulation, control of movement, and memory. The natural role of cannabinoids in immune systems is likely multi-faceted and remains unclear. The brain develops tolerance to cannabinoids. Animal research demonstrates the potential for dependence, but this potential is observed under a narrower range of condi-tions than with benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, or nicotine. Withdrawal symptoms can be observed in animals but appear to be mild compared to opiates or benzodiazepines, such asdiazepam (Valium). C ONCLUSION :The different cannabinoid receptor types found in the body appear to play different roles in normal human physiol-ogy. In addition, some effects of cannabinoids appear to be inde-pendent of those receptors. The variety of mechanisms throughwhich cannabinoids can influence human physiology underliesthe variety of potential therapeutic uses for drugs that might actselectively on different cannabinoid systems. R ECOMMENDATION 1: Research should continue into the physi- ological effects of synthetic and plant-derived cannabinoids andthe natural function of cannabinoids found in the body. Becausedifferent cannabinoids appear to have different effects, cannab-inoid research should include, but not be restricted to, effectsattributable to THC alone. Efficacy of Cannabinoid Drugs The accumulated data indicate a potential therapeutic value for can- nabinoid drugs, particularly for symptoms such as pain relief, control ofnausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation. The therapeutic effects ofcannabinoids are best established for THC, which is generally one of thetwo most abundant of the cannabinoids in marijuana. (Cannabidiol is gen-erally the other most abundant cannabinoid.) The effects of cannabinoids on the symptoms studied are generally modest, and in most cases there are more effective medications. However,people vary in their responses to medications, and there will likely al-ways be a subpopulation of patients who do not respond well to otherMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.4 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE medications. The combination of cannabinoid drug effects (anxiety reduc- tion, appetite stimulation, nausea reduction, and pain relief) suggests thatcannabinoids would be moderately well suited for particular conditions,such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and AIDS wasting. Defined substances, such as purified cannabinoid compounds, are preferable to plant products, which are of variable and uncertain compo-sition. Use of defined cannabinoids permits a more precise evaluation oftheir effects, whether in combination or alone. Medications that can maxi-mize the desired effects of cannabinoids and minimize the undesired ef-fects can very likely be identified. Although most scientists who study cannabinoids agree that the path- ways to cannabinoid drug development are clearly marked, there is noguarantee that the fruits of scientific research will be made available tothe public for medical use. Cannabinoid-based drugs will only becomeavailable if public investment in cannabinoid drug research is sustainedand if there is enough incentive for private enterprise to develop andmarket such drugs. C ONCLUSION :Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs, primarily THC, for pain relief, con-trol of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation; smokedmarijuana, however, is a crude THC delivery system that alsodelivers harmful substances. R ECOMMENDATION 2: Clinical trials of cannabinoid drugs for symptom management should be conducted with the goal ofdeveloping rapid-onset, reliable, and safe delivery systems. Influence of Psychological Effects on Therapeutic Effects The psychological effects of THC and similar cannabinoids pose three issues for the therapeutic use of cannabinoid drugs. First, for somepatients \u2014particularly older patients with no previous marijuana experi- ence \u2014the psychological effects are disturbing. Those patients report ex- periencing unpleasant feelings and disorientation after being treated withTHC, generally more severe for oral THC than for smoked marijuana.Second, for conditions such as movement disorders or nausea, in whichanxiety exacerbates the symptoms, the antianxiety effects of cannabinoiddrugs can influence symptoms indirectly. This can be beneficial or cancreate false impressions of the drug effect. Third, for cases in which symp-toms are multifaceted, the combination of THC effects might provide aform of adjunctive therapy; for example, AIDS wasting patients wouldlikely benefit from a medication that simultaneously reduces anxiety,pain, and nausea while stimulating appetite.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 CONCLUSION :The psychological effects of cannabinoids, such as anxiety reduction, sedation, and euphoria can influence their po-tential therapeutic value. Those effects are potentially undesir-able for certain patients and situations and beneficial for others.In addition, psychological effects can complicate the interpreta-tion of other aspects of the drug 's effect. R ECOMMENDATION 3: Psychological effects of cannabinoids such as anxiety reduction and sedation, which can influence medicalbenefits, should be evaluated in clinical trials. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA Physiological Risks Marijuana is not a completely benign substance. It is a powerful drug with a variety of effects. However, except for the harms associated withsmoking, the adverse effects of marijuana use are within the range of ef-fects tolerated for other medications. The harmful effects to individualsfrom the perspective of possible medical use of marijuana are not neces-sarily the same as the harmful physical effects of drug abuse. When inter-preting studies purporting to show the harmful effects of marijuana, it isimportant to keep in mind that the majority of those studies are based onsmoked marijuana, and cannabinoid effects cannot be separated from the effects of inhaling smoke from burning plant material and contaminants. For most people the primary adverse effect of acute marijuana use is diminished psychomotor performance. It is, therefore, inadvisable to op-erate any vehicle or potentially dangerous equipment while under theinfluence of marijuana, THC, or any cannabinoid drug with comparableeffects. In addition, a minority of marijuana users experience dysphoria,or unpleasant feelings. Finally, the short-term immunosuppressive effectsare not well established but, if they exist, are not likely great enough topreclude a legitimate medical use. The chronic effects of marijuana are of greater concern for medical use and fall into two categories: the effects of chronic smoking and the effectsof THC. Marijuana smoking is associated with abnormalities of cells lin-ing the human respiratory tract. Marijuana smoke, like tobacco smoke, isassociated with increased risk of cancer, lung damage, and poor preg-nancy outcomes. Although cellular, genetic, and human studies all sug-gest that marijuana smoke is an important risk factor for the developmentof respiratory cancer, proof that habitual marijuana smoking does or doesnot cause cancer awaits the results of well-designed studies.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.6 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE CONCLUSION :Numerous studies suggest that marijuana smoke is an important risk factor in the development of respiratory dis-ease. R ECOMMENDATION 4: Studies to define the individual health risks of smoking marijuana should be conducted, particularly amongpopulations in which marijuana use is prevalent. Marijuana Dependence and Withdrawal A second concern associated with chronic marijuana use is depen- dence on the psychoactive effects of THC. Although few marijuana usersdevelop dependence, some do. Risk factors for marijuana dependence aresimilar to those for other forms of substance abuse. In particular, anti-social personality and conduct disorders are closely associated with sub-stance abuse. C ONCLUSION : A distinctive marijuana withdrawal syndrome has been identified, but it is mild and short lived. The syndrome in-cludes restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep dis-turbance, nausea, and cramping. Marijuana as a \"Gateway\" Drug Patterns in progression of drug use from adolescence to adulthood are strikingly regular. Because it is the most widely used illicit drug, mari-juana is predictably the first illicit drug most people encounter. Not sur-prisingly, most users of other illicit drugs have used marijuana first. Infact, most drug users begin with alcohol and nicotine before marijuana \u2014 usually before they are of legal age. In the sense that marijuana use typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use, it is indeed a \"gateway \" drug. But be- cause underage smoking and alcohol use typically precede marijuana use,marijuana is not the most common, and is rarely the first, \"gateway \" to illicit drug use. There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects ofmarijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicitdrugs. An important caution is that data on drug use progression cannotbe assumed to apply to the use of drugs for medical purposes. It does notfollow from those data that if marijuana were available by prescriptionfor medical use, the pattern of drug use would remain the same as seen inillicit use. Finally, there is a broad social concern that sanctioning the medical use of marijuana might increase its use among the general population. AtMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 7 this point there are no convincing data to support this concern. The exist- ing data are consistent with the idea that this would not be a problem ifthe medical use of marijuana were as closely regulated as other medica-tions with abuse potential. C ONCLUSION :Present data on drug use progression neither sup- port nor refute the suggestion that medical availability would in-crease drug abuse. However, this question is beyond the issuesnormally considered for medical uses of drugs and should not bea factor in evaluating the therapeutic potential of marijuana orcannabinoids. USE OF SMOKED MARIJUANA Because of the health risks associated with smoking, smoked mari- juana should generally not be recommended for long-term medical use.Nonetheless, for certain patients, such as the terminally ill or those withdebilitating symptoms, the long-term risks are not of great concern. Fur-ther, despite the legal, social, and health problems associated with smok-ing marijuana, it is widely used by certain patient groups. R ECOMMENDATION 5: Clinical trials of marijuana use for medical purposes should be conducted under the following limited cir-cumstances: trials should involve only short-term marijuana use(less than six months), should be conducted in patients withconditions for which there is reasonable expectation of efficacy,should be approved by institutional review boards, and shouldcollect data about efficacy. The goal of clinical trials of smoked marijuana would not be to de- velop marijuana as a licensed drug but rather to serve as a first step to-ward the possible development of nonsmoked rapid-onset cannabinoiddelivery systems. However, it will likely be many years before a safe andeffective cannabinoid delivery system, such as an inhaler, is available forpatients. In the meantime there are patients with debilitating symptomsfor whom smoked marijuana might provide relief. The use of smokedmarijuana for those patients should weigh both the expected efficacy ofmarijuana and ethical issues in patient care, including providing informa-tion about the known and suspected risks of smoked marijuana use. R ECOMMENDATION 6: Short-term use of smoked marijuana (less than six months) for patients with debilitating symptoms (suchas intractable pain or vomiting) must meet the following condi-tions:Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.8 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE failure of all approved medications to provide relief has been documented, the symptoms can reasonably be expected to be relieved by rapid-onset cannabinoid drugs, such treatment is administered under medical supervision in a manner that allows for assessment of treatment effec-tiveness, and involves an oversight strategy comparable to an institu- tional review board process that could provide guidancewithin 24 hours of a submission by a physician to providemarijuana to a patient for a specified use. Until a nonsmoked rapid-onset cannabinoid drug delivery system becomes available, we acknowledge that there is no clear alternative forpeople suffering from chronic conditions that might be relieved by smok- ing marijuana, such as pain or AIDS wasting. One possible approach is totreat patients as n-of-1 clinical trials (single-patient trials), in which pa- tients are fully informed of their status as experimental subjects using aharmful drug delivery system and in which their condition is closelymonitored and documented under medical supervision, thereby increas-ing the knowledge base of the risks and benefits of marijuana use undersuch conditions.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

It will include a review of the science base re- garding the mechanism of action of marijuana, an examination of the peer- reviewed scientific literature on the efficacy of therapeutic uses of mari-juana, and the costs of using various forms of marijuana versus approved drugs for specific medical conditions (e.g., glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, wasting diseases, nausea, and pain). The study will also include an evaluation of the acute and chronic ef- fects of marijuana on health and behavior; a consideration of the adverse effects of marijuana use compared with approved drugs; an evaluation ofthe efficacy of different delivery systems for marijuana (e.g., inhalation vs. oral); an analysis of the data concerning marijuana as a gateway drug; and an examination of the possible differences in the effects of marijuana dueto age and type of medical condition. Specific Issues Specific issues to be addressed fall under three broad categories: sci- ence base, therapeutic use, and economics. Science Base Review of the neuroscience related to marijuana, particularly the relevance of new studies on addiction and craving Review of the behavioral and social science base of marijuana use, particularly an assessment of the relative risk of progression to other drugs following marijuana use Review of the literature determining which chemical components of crude marijuana are responsible for possible therapeutic effects and for side effects Therapeutic Use Evaluation of any conclusions on the medical use of marijuana drawn by other groups Efficacy and side effects of various delivery systems for marijuana compared to existing medications for glaucoma, wasting syndrome, pain, nausea, or other symptoms Differential effects of various forms of marijuana that relate to age or type of disease Economics Costs of various forms of marijuana compared with costs of existing medications for glaucoma, wasting syndrome, pain, nausea, or other symp- toms Assessment of differences between marijuana and existing medica- tions in terms of access and availabilityMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.10 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATION 1: Research should continue into the physiological ef- fects of synthetic and plant-derived cannabinoids and the natural func-tion of cannabinoids found in the body. Because different cannabinoids appear to have different effects, cannabinoid research should include, but not be restricted to, effects attributable to THC alone. Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimula- tion. This value would be enhanced by a rapid onset of drug effect. R ECOMMENDATION 2: Clinical trials of cannabinoid drugs for symptom man- agement should be conducted with the goal of developing rapid-onset,reliable, and safe delivery systems. The psychological effects of cannabinoids are probably important de- terminants of their potential therapeutic value. They can influence symp-toms indirectly which could create false impressions of the drug effect or be beneficial as a form of adjunctive therapy. R ECOMMENDATION 3: Psychological effects of cannabinoids such as anxiety reduction and sedation, which can influence medical benefits, should be evaluated in clinical trials. Numerous studies suggest that marijuana smoke is an important risk factor in the development of respiratory diseases, but the data that could conclusively establish or refute this suspected link have not been collected. RECOMMENDATION 4: Studies to define the individual health risks of smoking marijuana should be conducted, particularly among populations in which marijuana use is prevalent.

RECOMMENDATION 5: Clinical trials of marijuana use for medical purposes should be conducted under the following limited circumstances: trials should involve only short-term marijuana use (less than six months), should be conducted in patients with conditions for which there is rea-sonable expectation of efficacy, should be approved by institutional re- view boards, and should collect data about efficacy. If there is any future for marijuana as a medicine, it lies in its isolated components, the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives. Isolated can- nabinoids will provide more reliable effects than crude plant mixtures. Therefore, the purpose of clinical trials of smoked marijuana would not beto develop marijuana as a licensed drug but rather to serve as a first step toward the development of nonsmoked rapid-onset cannabinoid delivery systems. R ECOMMENDATION 6: Short-term use of smoked marijuana (less than six months) for patients with debilitating symptoms (such as intractable painor vomiting) must meet the following conditions: failure of all approved medications to provide relief has been docu- mented, the symptoms can reasonably be expected to be relieved by rapid- onset cannabinoid drugs, such treatment is administered under medical supervision in a man- ner that allows for assessment of treatment effectiveness, and involves an oversight strategy comparable to an institutional review board process that could provide guidance within 24 hours of asubmission by a physician to provide marijuana to a patient for a specified use.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Scientific data on controversial subjects are commonly misinterpreted, overinterpreted, and misrepresented, andthe medical marijuana debate is no exception. We have tried to present the scientific studies in such a way as to reveal theirstrengths and limitations. One of the goals of this report is to help peopleto understand the scientific data, including the logic behind the scientificconclusions, so it goes into greater detail than previous reports on thesubject. In many cases, we have explained why particular studies are in-conclusive and what sort of evidence is needed to support particularclaims about the harms or benefits attributed to marijuana. Ideally, thisreport will enable the thoughtful reader to interpret new informationabout marijuana that will continue to emerge rapidly well after this reportis published. Can marijuana relieve health problems? Is it safe for medical use? Those straightforward questions are embedded in a web of social con-cerns, which lie outside the scope of this report. Controversies concerningnonmedical use of marijuana spill over onto the medical marijuana de-bate and tend to obscure the real state of scientific knowledge. In contrastMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.14 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE with the many disagreements bearing on the social issues, the study team found substantial consensus, among experts in the relevant disciplines,on the scientific evidence bearing on potential medical use. This reportanalyzes science, not the law. As in any policy debate, the value of scien-tific analysis is that it can provide a foundation for further discussion.Distilling scientific evidence does not in itself solve a policy problem.What it can do is illuminate the common ground, bringing to light funda-mental differences out of the shadows of misunderstanding and misinfor-mation that currently prevail. Scientific analysis cannot be the end of thedebate, but it should at least provide the basis for an honest and informeddiscussion. Our analysis of the evidence and arguments concerning the medical use of marijuana focuses on the strength of the supporting evidence anddoes not refer to the motivations of people who put forth the evidenceand arguments. That is, it is not relevant to scientific validity whether anargument is put forth by someone who believes that all marijuana useshould be legal or by someone who believes that any marijuana use ishighly damaging to individual users and to society as a whole. Nor doesthis report comment on the degree to which scientific analysis is compat-ible with current regulatory policy. Although many have argued that cur-rent drug laws pertaining to marijuana are inconsistent with scientificdata, it is important to understand that decisions about drug regulationare based on a variety of moral and social considerations, as well as onmedical and scientific ones. Even when a drug is used only for medical purposes, value judg- ments affect policy decisions concerning its medical use. For example, themagnitude of a drug's expected medical benefit affects regulatory judg-ments about the acceptability of risks associated with its use. Also, al-though a drug is normally approved for medical use only on proof of its\"safety and efficacy,\" patients with life-threatening conditions are some-times (under protocols for \"compassionate use\") allowed access to unap-proved drugs whose benefits and risks are uncertain. Value judgmentsplay an even more substantial role in regulatory decisions concerningdrugs, such as marijuana, that are sought and used for nonmedical pur-poses. Then policymakers must take into account not only the risks andbenefits associated with medical use but also possible interactions be-tween the regulatory arrangements governing medical use and the integ-rity of the legal controls set up to restrict nonmedical use. It should be clear that many elements of drug control policy lie out- side the realm of biology and medicine. Ultimately, the complex moraland social judgments that underlie drug control policy must be made bythe American people and their elected officials. A goal of this report is toMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

HOW THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED Information was gathered through scientific workshops, site visits, analysis of the relevant scientific literature, and extensive consultationwith biomedical and social scientists. The three 2-day workshops \u2014in Irvine, California; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Washington, D.C. \u2014were open to the public and included scientific presentations and reports,mostly from patients and their families, about their experiences with andperspectives on the medical use of marijuana. Scientific experts in variousfields were selected to talk about the latest research on marijuana, cannab-inoids, and related topics (listed in Appendix B). Selection of the expertswas based on recommendations by their peers, who ranked them amongthe most accomplished scientists and the most knowledgeable about mari-juana and cannabinoids in their own fields. In addition, advocates for(John Morgan) and against (Eric A. Voth) the medical use of marijuanawere invited to present scientific evidence in support of their positions. Information presented at the scientific workshops was supplemented by analysis of the scientific literature and evaluating the methods used invarious studies and the validity of the authors ' conclusions. Different kinds of clinical studies are useful in different ways: results of a controlleddouble-blind study with adequate sample sizes can be expected to applyto the general population from which study subjects were drawn; an iso-lated case report can suggest further studies but cannot be presumed tobe broadly applicable; and survey data can be highly informative but aregenerally limited by the need to rely on self-reports of drug use and onunconfirmed medical diagnoses. This report relies mainly on the mostrelevant and methodologically rigorous studies available and treats theresults of more limited studies cautiously. In addition, study results arepresented in such a way as to allow thoughtful readers to judge the re-sults themselves. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) appointed a panel of nine experts to advise the study team on technical issues. These included neurology andthe treatment of pain (Howard Fields); regulation of prescription drugs (J.Richard Crout); AIDS wasting and clinical trials (Judith Feinberg); treat-ment and pathology of multiple sclerosis (Timothy Vollmer); drug depen-dence among adolescents (Thomas Crowley); varieties of drug depen-dence (Dorothy Hatsukami); internal medicine, health care delivery, andclinical epidemiology (Eric B. Larson); cannabinoids and (Steven R.Childers).Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The Web sitewas open for comment from November 1997 until November 1998. Some130 organizations were invited to participate in the public workshops.Many people in the organizations \u2014particularly those opposed to the medical use of marijuana \u2014felt that a public forum was not conducive to expressing their views; they were invited to communicate their opinions(and reasons for holding them) by mail or telephone. As a result, roughlyequal numbers of persons and organizations opposed to and in favor ofthe medical use of marijuana were heard from. The study team visited four cannabis buyers ' clubs in California (the Oakland Cannabis Buyers ' Cooperative, the San Francisco Cannabis Cul- tivators Club, the Los Angeles Cannabis Resource Center, and Califor-nians Helping Alleviate Medical Problems, or CHAMPS) and two HIV/AIDS clinics (AIDS Health Care Foundation in Los Angeles and Louisi-ana State University Medical Center in New Orleans). We listened to manyindividual stories from the buyers ' clubs about using marijuana to treat a variety of symptoms and heard clinical observations on the use of Marinolto treat AIDS patients. Marinol is the brand name for dronabinol, which is 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in pill form and is available by prescrip- tion for the treatment of nausea associated with chemotherapy and AIDSwasting. MARIJUANA TODAY The Changing Legal Landscape In the 20th century, marijuana has been used more for its euphoric effects than as a medicine. Its psychological and behavioral effects haveconcerned public officials since the drug first appeared in the southwest-ern and southern states during the first two decades of the century. By1931, at least 29 states had prohibited use of the drug for nonmedical pur-poses. 3 Marijuana was first regulated at the federal level by the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which required anyone producing, distributing, or usingmarijuana for medical purposes to register and pay a tax and which effec-tively prohibited nonmedical use of the drug. Although the act did notmake medical use of marijuana illegal, it did make it expensive and incon-venient. In 1942, marijuana was removed from the U.S. Pharmacopoeiabecause it was believed to be a harmful and addictive drug that causedpsychoses, mental deterioration, and violent behavior. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a sharp increase in mari- juana use among adolescents and young adults. The current legal statusof marijuana was established in 1970 with the passage of the ControlledMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.INTRODUCTION 17 Substances Act, which divided drugs into five schedules and placed mari- juana in Schedule I, the category for drugs with high potential for abuseand no accepted medical use (see Appendix C, Scheduling Definitions).In 1972, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Legisla-tion (NORML), an organization that supports decriminalization of mari-juana, unsuccessfully petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and DangerousDrugs to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II. NORML arguedthat marijuana is therapeutic in numerous serious ailments, less toxic, andin many cases more effective than conventional medicines. 13 Thus, for 25 years the medical marijuana movement has been closely linked with themarijuana decriminalization movement, which has colored the debate.Many people criticized that association in their letters to IOM and duringthe public workshops of this study. The argument against the medical useMedical Marijuana Legislation Among the States The 1996 California referendum known as Proposition 215 allowed se- riously ill Californians to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposeswithout criminal prosecution or sanction. A physician's recommendation is needed. Under the law, physicians cannot be punished or denied any right or privilege for recommending marijuana to patients who suffer fromany illness for which marijuana will provide relief. The 1996 Arizona referendum known as Proposition 200 was largely about prison reform but also gave physicians the option to prescribe con-trolled substances, including those in Schedule I (e.g., marijuana), to treat the disease or relieve the suffering of seriously or terminally ill patients. Five months after the referendum was passed, it was stalled whenArizonalegislators voted that all prescription medications must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and marijuana is not so approved. In No- vember 1998, Arizona voters passed a second referendum designed to al-low physician's to prescribe marijuana as medicine, but this is still at odds with federal law. 8 As of summer 1998, eight states\u2014California, Connecticut, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Ohio, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014had laws that permit physicians to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes or to allow a medical necessity defense.8 In November 1998, five states\u2014Arizona, Alaska, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington\u2014passed medical marijuana bal-lot initiatives. The District of Columbia also voted on a medical marijuana initiative, but was barred from counting the votes because an amendment designed to prohibit them from doing so was added to the federal appro-priations bill; however, exit polls suggested that a majority of voters had approved the measure.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.18 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE of marijuana presented most often to the IOM study team was that \"the medical marijuana movement is a Trojan horse \"; that is, it is a deceptive tactic used by advocates of marijuana decriminalization who would ex-ploit the public 's sympathy for seriously ill patients. Since NORML 's petition in 1972, there have been a variety of legal decisions concerning marijuana. From 1973 to 1978, 11 states adopted stat-utes that decriminalized use of marijuana, although some of themrecriminalized marijuana use in the 1980s and 1990s. During the 1970s,reports of the medical value of marijuana began to appear, particularlyclaims that marijuana relieved the nausea associated with chemotherapy.Health departments in six states conducted small studies to investigatethe reports. When the AIDS epidemic spread in the 1980s, patients foundthat marijuana sometimes relieved their symptoms, most dramaticallythose associated with AIDS wasting. Over this period a number of defen-dants charged with unlawful possession of marijuana claimed that theywere using the drug to treat medical conditions and that violation of thelaw was therefore justified (the so-called medical necessity defense). Al-though most courts rejected these claims, some accepted them. 8 Against that backdrop, voters in California and Arizona in 1996 passed two referenda that attempted to legalize the medical use of mari-juana under particular conditions. Public support for patient access tomarijuana for medical use appears substantial; public opinion polls takenduring 1997 and 1998 generally reported 60 -70 percent of respondents in favor of allowing medical uses of marijuana. 15 However, those referenda are at odds with federal laws regulating marijuana, and their implemen-tation raises complex legal questions. Despite the current level of interest, referenda and public discussions have not been well informed by carefully reasoned scientific debate. Al-though previous reports have all called for more research, the nature ofthe research that will be most helpful depends greatly on the specifichealth conditions to be addressed. And while there have been importantrecent advances in our understanding of the physiological effects of mari-juana, few of the recent investigators have had the time or resources topermit detailed analysis. The results of those advances, only now begin-ning to be explored, have significant implications for the medical mari-juana debate. Several months after the passage of the California and Arizona medi- cal marijuana referendums, the Office of National Drug Control Policy(ONDCP) asked whether IOM would conduct a scientific review of themedical value of marijuana and its constituent compounds. In August1997, IOM formally began the study and appointed John A. Benson Jr.and Stanley J. Watson Jr. to serve as principal investigators for the study.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE Marijuana plants have been used since antiquity for both herbal medi- cation and intoxication. The current debate over the medical use of mari-juana is essentially a debate over the value of its medicinal propertiesrelative to the risk posed by its use. Marijuana 's use as an herbal remedy before the 20th century is well documented. 1,10,11 However, modern medicine adheres to different stan- dards from those used in the past. The question is not whether marijuanacan be used as an herbal remedy but rather how well this remedy meetstoday 's standards of efficacy and safety. We understand much more than previous generations about medical risks. Our society generally expectsits licensed medications to be safe, reliable, and of proven efficacy; con-taminants and inconsistent ingredients in our health treatments are nottolerated. That refers not only to prescription and over-the-counter drugsbut also to vitamin supplements and herbal remedies purchased at thegrocery store. For example, the essential amino acid l-tryptophan was widely sold in health food stores as a natural remedy for insomnia untilearly 1990 when it became linked to an epidemic of a new and potentiallyfatal illness (eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome). 9,12 When it was removed from the market shortly thereafter, there was little protest, despite the factthat it was safe for the vast majority of the population. The 1,536 cases and27 deaths were later traced to contaminants in a batch produced by asingle Japanese manufacturer. Although few herbal medicines meet today 's standards, they have provided the foundation for modern Western pharmaceuticals. Most cur-rent prescriptions have their roots either directly or indirectly in plantremedies. 7 At the same time, most current prescriptions are synthetic com- pounds that are only distantly related to the natural compounds that ledto their development. Digitalis was discovered in foxglove, morphine inpoppies, and taxol in the yew tree. Even aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) hasits counterpart in herbal medicine: for many generations, American Indi-ans relieved headaches by chewing the bark of the willow tree, which isrich in a related form of salicylic acid. Although plants continue to be valuable resources for medical ad- vances, drug development is likely to be less and less reliant on plantsand more reliant on the tools of modern science. Molecular biology,bioinformatics software, and DNA array-based analyses of genes andchemistry are all beginning to yield great advances in drug discovery anddevelopment. Until recently, drugs could only be discovered ; now they canMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.20 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE be designed . Even the discovery process has been accelerated through the use of modern drug-screening techniques. It is increasingly possible toidentify or isolate the chemical compounds in a plant, determine whichcompounds are responsible for the plant 's effects, and select the most ef- fective and safe compounds \u2014either for use as purified substances or as tools to develop even more effective, safer, or less expensive compounds. Yet even as the modern pharmacological toolbox becomes more so- phisticated and biotechnology yields an ever greater abundance of thera-peutic drugs, people increasingly seek alternative, low-technology thera-pies. 4,5 In 1997, 46 percent of Americans sought nontraditional medicines and spent over 27 billion unreimbursed dollars; the total number of visitsto alternative medicine practitioners appears to have exceeded the num-ber of visits to primary care physicians. 5,6 Recent interest in the medical use of marijuana coincides with this trend toward self-help and a searchfor \"natural \" therapies. Indeed, several people who spoke at the IOM pub- lic hearings in support of the medical use of marijuana said that they gen-erally preferred herbal medicines to standard pharmaceuticals. However,few alternative therapies have been carefully and systematically testedfor safety and efficacy, as is required for medications approved by theFDA (Food and Drug Administration). 2 WHO USES MEDICAL MARIJUANA? There have been no comprehensive surveys of the demographics and medical conditions of medical marijuana users, but a few reports providesome indication. In each case, survey results should be understood to re-flect the situation in which they were conducted and are not necessarilycharacteristic of medical marijuana users as a whole. Respondents to sur-veys reported to the IOM study team were all members of \"buyers ' clubs, \" organizations that provide their members with marijuana, although notnecessarily through direct cash transactions. The atmosphere of the mari-juana buyers ' clubs ranges from that of the comparatively formal and closely regulated Oakland Cannabis Buyers ' Cooperative to that of a \"country club for the indigent, \" as Denis Peron described the San Fran- cisco Cannabis Cultivators Club (SFCCC), which he directed. John Mendelson, an internist and pharmacologist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Pain Management Center, surveyed 100members of the SFCCC who were using marijuana at least weekly. Mostof the respondents were unemployed men in their forties. Subjects werepaid $50 to participate in the survey; this might have encouraged a greaterrepresentation of unemployed subjects. All subjects were tested for druguse. About half tested positive for marijuana only; the other half testedpositive for drugs in addition to marijuana (23% for cocaine and 13% forMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The predominant disorder was AIDS, followed by roughly equal numbers of members who reported chronic pain, mooddisorders, and musculoskeletal disorders (Table 1.1). The membership profile of the San Francisco club was similar to that of the Los Angeles Cannabis Resource Center (LACRC), where 83% of the739 patients were men, 45% were 36 -45 years old, and 71% were HIV positive. Table 1.2 shows a distribution of conditions somewhat differentfrom that in SFCCC respondents, probably because of a different mem-bership profile. For example, cancer is generally a disease that occurs latein life; 34 (4.7%) of LACRC members were over 55 years old; only 2% ofsurvey respondents in the SFCCC study were over 55 years old. Jeffrey Jones, executive director of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers ' Co- operative, reported that its largest group of patients is HIV-positive menin their forties. The second-largest group is patients with chronic pain. Among the 42 people who spoke at the public workshops or wrote to the study team, only six identified themselves as members of marijuanabuyers ' clubs. Nonetheless, they presented a similar profile: HIV/AIDS was the predominant disorder, followed by chronic pain (Tables 1.3 and1.4). All HIV/AIDS patients reported that marijuana relieved nausea andvomiting and improved their appetite. About half the patients who re-ported using marijuana for chronic pain also reported that it reduced nau-sea and vomiting. Note that the medical conditions referred to are only those reported to the study team or to interviewers; they cannot be assumed to representcomplete or accurate diagnoses. Michael Rowbotham, a neurologist at theUCSF Pain Management Center, noted that many pain patients referredTABLE 1.1 Self-Reported Disorders Treated with Marijuana by Members of San Francisco Cannabis Cultivators Club Disorder No. of Subjects HIV 60 Musculoskeletal disorders and arthritis 39 Psychiatric disorders (primarily depression) 27Neurological disorders and nonmusculoskeletal pain syndromes 9 Gastrointestinal disorders (most often nausea) 7 Other disorders Glaucoma, allergies, nephrolithiasis, and the skin manifestations of Reiter syndrome 7 Total disorders 149 Total number of respondents 100Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

At that center the patients who report medical benefit from marijuanasay that it does not reduce their pain but enables them to cope with it. Most \u2014not all \u2014people who use marijuana to relieve medical condi- tions have previously used it recreationally. An estimated 95% of theLACRC members had used marijuana before joining the club. It is impor-tant to emphasize the absence of comprehensive information on marijuanause before its use for medical conditions. Frequency of prior use almostcertainly depends on many factors, including membership in a buyers ' club, membership in a population sector that uses marijuana more oftenthan others (for example, men 20 -30 years old), and the medical condition being treated with marijuana (for example, there are probably relativelyfewer recreational marijuana users among cancer patients than amongAIDS patients).TABLE 1.2 Self-Reported Disorders Treated with Marijuana by Members of Los Angeles Cannabis Resource Center (LACRC),According to Center Staff a Treated Disorder No. of Subjects % of Subjects HIVb528 71 Cancer 40 5.4 Terminal cancer 10 1.4Mood disorders (depression) 4 0.5 Musculoskeletal (multiple sclerosis, arthritis) 30 4.1 Chronic pain and back pain 33 4.5 Gastrointestinal 7 2.3 Neurological disorders (epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, brain trauma) 7 0.9 Seizures or migraines c 13 1.8 Glaucoma 15 2.0Miscellaneous 42 5.7 Total number 739 100 aResults are based on a review of 739 individual records by LACRC staff members.

Their circumstances andsymptoms were varied, and the IOM study team was not in a position tomake medical evaluations or confirm diagnoses. Three representativecases presented to the IOM study team are presented in Box 1.1; the sto-ries have been edited for brevity, but each case is presented in the patient 's words and with the patient 's permission.TABLE 1.3 Summary of Reports to IOM Study Team by 43 Individuals Symptoms Dominant Disease Symptoms Dominant Disease Anorexia, AIDS Pain Migraine nausea, AIDS Injury vomiting AIDS Injury AIDS Epilepsy and postpolio syndrome AIDS Trauma and epilepsyAIDS Degenerative disk disease AIDS Rheumatoid arthritis AIDS and cancer Nail-patella syndromeCancer Reflex sympathetic dystrophy Testicular cancer Gulf War chemical exposure Cancer and multiple Multiple congenital sclerosis cartilaginous exostosis Thyroid condition a Histiocytosis X MigraineWilson 's disease Muscle Spasticity a spasticity Multiple sclerosis Mood Depression Multiple sclerosis disorders Depression Multiple sclerosis Depression and anxiety Paralysis Depression and anxiety Spinal-cord injury Manic depression Spasmodic torticollis Manic depression Intraocular Glaucoma Posttraumatic stress pressure Premenstrual syndrome Diarrhea Crohn 's disease aNot specified.

All rights reserved.24 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE The variety of stories presented left the study team with a clear view of people 's beliefs about how marijuana had helped them. But this collec- tion of anecdotal data, although useful, is limited. We heard many posi-tive stories but no stories from people who had tried marijuana but foundit ineffective. This is a fraction with an unknown denominator. For thenumerator we have a sample of positive responses; for the denominatorwe have no idea of the total number of people who have tried marijuanafor medical purposes. Hence, it is impossible to estimate the clinical valueof marijuana or cannabinoids in the general population based on anec-dotal reports. Marijuana clearly seems to relieve some symptoms for somepeople \u2014even if only as a placebo effect. But what is the balance of harm- ful and beneficial effects? That is the essential medical question that canbe answered only by careful analysis of data collected under controlledconditions. CANNABIS AND THE CANNABINOIDS Marijuana is the common name for Cannabis sativa , a hemp plant that grows throughout temperate and tropical climates. The most recent re-view of the constituents of marijuana lists 66 cannabinoids (Table 1.5). 16 But that does not mean there are 66 different cannabinoid effects or inter-actions. Most of the cannabinoids are closely related; they fall into only 10TABLE 1.4 Primary Symptoms of 43 Individuals Who Reported to IOM Study Team Symptom Frequency Multiple Symptoms No. Who Reported % of Those % of Total (primary) Who Reported Primary No. of Symptoms Additional Primary Symptom Reportsa Reported Symptoms Symptoms Anorexia, nausea, vomiting 21 31 13 62 Diarrhea 4 6 3 75Intraocular pressure 2 3 1 50 Mood disorders 12 18 7 58 Muscle spasticity 12 18 7 58Pain 16 24 13 81 Total 67 44 66 aForty-three persons reporting; 20 reported relief from more than one symptom.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Throughout this report,THC is used to indicate 9-THC. In the few cases where variants of THC are discussed, the full names are used. All the cannabinoids are lipo-philic \u2014they are highly soluble in fatty fluids and tissues but not in water. Indeed, THC is so lipophilic that it is aptly described as \"greasy. \" Throughout this report, marijuana refers to unpurified plant extracts, including leaves and flower tops, regardless of how they are consumed \u2014 whether by ingestion or by smoking. References to the effects of mari-juana should be understood to include the composite effects of its variouscomponents; that is, the effects of THC are included among the effects ofmarijuana, but not all the effects of marijuana are necessarily due to THC.Discussions concerning cannabinoids refer only to those particular com- pounds and not to the plant extract. This distinction is important; it isoften blurred or exaggerated. Cannabinoids are produced in epidermal glands on the leaves (espe- cially the upper ones), stems, and the bracts that support the flowers ofthe marijuana plant. Although the flower itself has no epidermal glands,it has the highest cannabinoid content anywhere on the plant, probablybecause of the accumulation of resin secreted by the supporting bracteoleTABLE 1.5 Cannabinoids Identified in Marijuana Cannabinoid Common No. of Known Group Abbreviation Variants in Group 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol types 11 Total 66Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The amounts of cannabinoids and their relative abundance in a marijuana plant vary with growing con-ditions, including humidity, temperature, and soil nutrients (reviewed inPate, 1994 14). The chemical stability of cannabinoids in harvested plant material is also affected by moisture, temperature, sunlight, and storage.They degrade under any storage condition.

Skin rashes, dry mouth, foul metallic aftertaste, numbness of the face, swelling of the limbs, fever spikes, headaches, dizziness, anemia, clinicaldepression, neuropathy so crippling that I could not type, so painful that the bed sheets felt like sandpaper, nausea so severe that I sometimes had to leave the dinner table to vomit, and diarrhea so unpredictable that I darednot leave the house without diapers. These are some of the horrors that I have endured in the past 10 years during my fight for life against the human immunodeficiency virus. Butthese ravages were not caused by HIV itself, or by any of the opportunistic infections that mark the steady progression of AIDS. Each of these night- mares was a side effect of one of the hundreds of medications I have takento fight one infection after another on my way to a seemingly certain early grave. Had you known me three years ago, you would not recognize me now. After years of final-stage AIDS, I had wasted to 130 lb. The purple Kaposi 's sarcoma lesions were spreading. The dark circles under my eyes told of sleepless nights and half-waking days. I encountered passages of timemarked by medication schedules, nausea, and diarrhea. I knew that I wasdying. Every reflection shimmered with death, my ghost-like pallor in the mirror, the contained terror on the face of a bus passenger beside me, and most of all the resigned sadness in my mother 's eyes. But still I was fortunate because along the way I rediscovered the an- cient understanding of marijuana 's medicinal benefit. So I smoked pot. Every day. The pot calmed my stomach against handfuls of pills. The potmade me hungry so that I could eat without a tube. The pot eased the pain of crippling neural side effects so that I could dial the phone by myself. The pot calmed my soul and allowed me to accept that I would probably diesoon. Because I smoked pot I lived long enough to see the development of the first truly effective HIV therapies. I lived to gain 50 lb., regain my vigor, and celebrate my 35th birthday. I lived to sit on the bus without frighteningthe passenger beside me. Even at this stage of my recovery I take a handful of pills almost every day and will probably continue to do so for the rest of my life. While I amgrateful for the life-saving protease inhibitor therapies, they bring with them a host of adverse reactions and undesirable side effects. Different patients experience different reactions, of course, but almost all patients experiencesome. Smoking marijuana relieves many of these side effects. I am not one of the exceptional eight patients in the United States with ContinuedMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

But I have no choice, you see, just as I have no choice but to endure the side effects of these toxic medications. So, many patients like me are breaking the law to enjoy relief that no othertherapy provides. I sit here, I believe, as living proof that marijuana can have a beneficial effect in staving off wasting. Every pound was a day. I figured that for everypound of body weight I could maintain, that was another day that I could live in hopes that some effective therapy would emerge. * * * B.D. spoke at the IOM workshop in Louisiana. She is one of eight pa- tients who are legally allowed to smoke marijuana under a Compas- sionate Use Protocol. She uses marijuana to relieve nausea, muscle spas- ticity, and pain associated with multiple sclerosis. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1988. Prior to that, I was an active person with ballet and swimming. I now have a swimming pool, so I swim each and every day, and I smoke marijuana. The government has given me the marijuana to smoke. Each month I pick up a can filled withthe marijuana cigarettes rolled by the government. At one time I weighed 85 lb. and I now weigh 105. Twenty pounds is quite a bit to put on. I could not walk. I did not have the appetite. I use ascooter now for distance. I can get around the house. I have a standardpoodle who is kind of like an assistant dog. She is good at it. She helps me. When I found out that there was a program to get marijuana from the government, I decided that was the answer. I was not a marijuana smokerbefore that. In fact, I used to consider the people I knew who smoked the marijuana as undesirables. Now, I myself am an undesirable. But it works. It takes away the backache. With multiple sclerosis, you can get spasms, and your leg will just go straight out and you cannot stop that leg. You may have danced all of your life and put the leg where you wanted it to be, but the MS takes that from you. So I use the swimmingpool, and that helps a lot. The kicks are much less when I have smoked a marijuana cigarette. Since 1991, I 've smoked 10 cigarettes a day. I do not take any other drugs. Marijuana seems to have been my helper. At onetime, I did not think much of the people who smoke it. But when it comes to your health, it makes a big difference. * * * J.H. spoke at the IOM workshop in Washington, D.C. He was seriously injured in an accident, suffers from a form of arthritis associated with abnormal activity of the sympathetic nervous system known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and has hepatitis C. He uses marijuana to re- lieve nausea from liver disease, pain, and muscle spasms. I am 48 years old, married with two children. I am a veteran who served during the Vietnam war. I was exposed to hepatitis C in 1972 by a bloodMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

My hepatitis C was not diagnosed until 1997 \u2014after the disease had destroyed my pancreas* and I had four heart attacks, one angioplasty, and a minor stroke. In 1989, while at work, I was involved in an accident with a large soil survey auger. My pelvis was crushed, and serious nerve damage was the result. I also have reflex sym-pathetic dystrophy, which is a neurological disease that has a tremendous amount of pain and muscle spasms. I have reached what the doctors call end-stage liver disease from the hepatitis C. I have lost 85 lbs. due to the severe bouts of nausea and vom- iting. Every time I come home from a hospital stay, my 7 year old asks if I got the liver transplant. I am on a transplant list, but I am not a candidateuntil I am seven days from death. In October 1997, after trying four different antinausea medications, four of the doctors that I see told me to go to Europe and see a doctor and trymedicinal cannabis. My primary care doctor wrote me a letter to carry with my medical records asking that the doctor help me in any way that he could to alleviate the symptoms of the hepatitis C and the reflex sympa-thetic dystrophy. Those symptoms are severe nausea and pain from the hepatitis C and pain and muscle spasms from the neurological disease. I went to Europe in November 1997, where I saw a doctor of internal medicine. He prescribed me cannabis, 1 -2 g a day. I got the medicine and a pipe and tried it. Within two minutes of taking two puffs from the pipe, the nausea was gone. I don 't think that I felt the high, although I was quite elated. In about 45 min. I was starving. Normally, I have a fear of eatingbecause I vomit almost always after I eat or take a pill. I forgot about that, and I think I ate more that night than I had eaten in months. I did feel a little nauseated after about four hours, but I smoked two more puffs, and inabout two hours I went to bed. The next morning I felt hungry. During my nine-day stay in Europe, I was able to stay free of vomiting and the waves of nausea became less frequent. I had experienced four years of pain control using Tegretol, a drug used by epileptics to control seizures. Now I can 't use that medication because of the damage that it causes my cirrhotic liver. When I smoked about 2 g ofmarijuana a day, the nausea was gone and I was no longer losing weight. The pain was at an acceptable level. Sometimes I still find it necessary to use an opiate painkiller, but only when the pain is at its worst. Surprisingly,I lost an associated high within a few days. I also think the cannabis has an antidepressant effect on me, as I no longer have what I call the \"poor me \" feelings that I experienced after learning about the hepatitis C. *This is an unlikely consequence of hepatitis C; it is more likely that the patient 's liver was damaged.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Those steps include identifying knowl-edge gaps, promising research directions, and potential therapies basedon scientific advances in cannabinoid biology. Chapter 2 reviews basic cannabinoid biology and provides a founda- tion to understand the medical value of marijuana or its constituent can-nabinoids. In consideration of the physician 's first rule, \"first, do no harm, \" the potential harms attributed to the medical use of marijuana are reviewed before the potential medical benefits. Chapter 3 reviews therisks posed by marijuana use, with emphasis on medical use. Chapter 4 analyzes the most credible clinical data relevant to the medi- cal use of marijuana. It reviews what is known about the physiologicalmechanisms underlying particular conditions (for example, chronic pain,vomiting, anorexia, and muscle spasticity), what is known about the cel-lular actions of cannabinoids, and the levels of proof needed to show thatmarijuana is an effective treatment for specific symptoms. It does not ana-lyze the historical literature; history is informative in enumerating uses ofmarijuana, but it does not provide the sort of information needed for ascientifically sound evaluation of the efficacy and safety of marijuana forclinical use. Because marijuana is advocated primarily as affording relieffrom the symptoms of disease rather than as a cure, this chapter is orga-nized largely by symptoms as opposed to disease categories. Finally, chap-ter 4 compares the conclusions of this report with those of other recentreports on the medical use of marijuana. Chapter 5 describes the process of and analyzes the prospects for can- nabinoid drug development. REFERENCES 1. Abel EL. 1980. Marijuana: The First Twelve Thousand Years . New York: Plenum Press. 2.

Too little was known about cannabinoid physiology to offer any scientific in-sights into the harmful or therapeutic effects of marijuana. That is nolonger true. During the past 16 years, there have been major advances inwhat basic science discloses about the potential medical benefits of can-nabinoids, the group of compounds related to THC. Many variants arefound in the marijuana plant, and other cannabinoids not found in theplant have been chemically synthesized. Sixteen years ago it was still amatter of debate as to whether THC acted nonspecifically by affecting thefluidity of cell membranes or whether a specific pathway of action wasmediated by a receptor that responded selectively to THC (Table 2.1). *The field of neuroscience has grown substantially since the publication of the 1982 IOM report. The number of members in the Society for Neuroscience provides a rough measure of the growth in research and knowledge about the brain: as of the middle of 1998, there were over 27,000 members, more than triple the number in 1982.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Even committed advocates of the medical use of marijuana donot claim that all the effects of marijuana are desirable for every medicaluse. But they do claim that the combination of specific effects of mari-juana enhances its medical value. An understanding of those specific ef-fects is what basic science can provide. The multiple effects of marijuanacan be singled out and studied with the goals of evaluating the medicalvalue of marijuana and cannabinoids in specific medical conditions, aswell as minimizing unwanted side effects. An understanding of the basicmechanisms through which cannabinoids affect physiology permits morestrategic development of new drugs and designs for clinical trials that aremost likely to yield conclusive results. Research on cannabinoid biology offers new insights into clinical use, especially given the scarcity of clinical studies that adequately evaluatethe medical value of marijuana. For example, despite the scarcity of sub-TABLE 2.1 Landmark Discoveries Since the 1982 IOM Report Year Discovery Primary Investigators 1986 Potent cannabinoid agonists are M. R. Johnson and L. S.

The cellular machinery that underlies the response of the body and brain to cannabinoids involves an intricate interplay of different systems.This chapter reviews the components of that machinery with enough de-tail to permit the reader to compare what is known about basic biologywith the medical uses proposed for marijuana. For some readers that willbe too much detail. Those readers who do not wish to read the entirechapter should, nonetheless, be mindful of the following key points inthis chapter: The most far reaching of the recent advances in cannabinoid biol- ogy are the identification of two types of cannabinoid receptors(CB 1 and CB2) and of anandamide, a substance naturally produced by the body that acts at the cannabinoid receptor and has effectssimilar to those of THC. The CB 1 receptor is found primarily in the brain and mediates the psychological effects of THC. The CB2 re- ceptor is associated with the immune system; its role remains un-clear. The physiological roles of the brain cannabinoid system in humans are the subject of much active research and are not fully known;however, cannabinoids likely have a natural role in pain modula-tion, control of movement, and memory. Animal research has shown that the potential for cannabinoid de- pendence exists, and cannabinoid withdrawal symptoms can beobserved. However, both appear to be mild compared to depen-dence and withdrawal seen with other drugs. Basic research in cannabinoid biology has revealed a variety of cel- lular pathways through which potentially therapeutic drugs couldact on the cannabinoid system. In addition to the known cannab-inoids, such drugs might include chemical derivatives of plant-derived cannabinoids or of endogenous cannabinoids such asanandamide but would also include noncannabinoid drugs thatact on the cannabinoid system. This chapter summarizes the basics of cannabinoid biology \u2014as known today. It thus provides a scientific basis for interpreting claimsfounded on anecdotes and for evaluating the clinical studies of marijuanapresented in chapter 4.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Many speakers at the public workshops associ-ated with this study argued that animal studies of marijuana are not rel-evant to humans. Animal studies are not a substitute for clinical trials, butthey are a necessary complement. Ultimately, every biologically activesubstance exerts its effects at the cellular and molecular levels, and theevidence has shown that this is remarkably consistent among mammals,even those as different in body and mind as rats and humans. Animalstudies typically provide information about how drugs work that wouldnot be obtainable in clinical studies. At the same time, animal studies cannever inform us completely about the full range of psychological andphysiological effects of marijuana or cannabinoids on humans. The Active Constituents of Marijuana 9-THC and 8-THC are the only compounds in the marijuana plant that produce all the psychoactive effects of marijuana. Because 9-THC is much more abundant than 8-THC, the psychoactivity of marijuana has been attributed largely to the effects of 9-THC. 11-OH- 9-THC is the pri- mary product of 9-THC metabolism by the liver and is about three times as potent as 9-THC.128 There have been considerably fewer experiments with cannabinoids other than 9-THC, although a few studies have been done to examine whether other cannabinoids modulate the effects of THC or mediate thenonpsychological effects of marijuana. Cannabidiol (CBD) does not havethe same psychoactivity as THC, but it was initially reported to attenuatethe psychological response to THC in humans; 81,177 however, later studies reported that CBD did not attenuate the psychological effects of THC.11,69 One double-blind study of eight volunteers reported that CBD can blockthe anxiety induced by high doses of THC (0.5 mg/kg). 177 There are nu- merous anecdotal reports claiming that marijuana with relatively higherratios of THC:CBD is less likely to induce anxiety in the user than mari-juana with low THC:CBD ratios; but, taken together, the results publishedthus far are inconclusive. The most important effect of CBD seems to be its interference with drug metabolism, including 9-THC metabolism in the liver.14,114 It exerts that effect by inactivating cytochrome P450s, which are the most impor-tant class of enzymes that metabolize drugs. Like many P450 inactivators,CBD can also induce P450s after repeated doses. 13 Experiments in which mice were treated with CBD followed by THC showed that CBD treat-ment was associated with a substantial increase in brain concentrations ofMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CANNABINOIDS AND ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY 37 THC and its major metabolites, most likely because it decreased the rate of clearance of THC from the body.15 In mice, THC inhibits the release of luteinizing hormone, the pituitary hormone that triggers the release of testosterone from the testes; this ef-fect is increased when THC is given with cannabinol or CBD. 113 Cannabinol also lowers body temperature and increases sleep dura- tion in mice.175 It is considerably less active than THC in the brain, but studies of immune cells have shown that it can modulate immune func-tion (see \"Cannabinoids and the Immune System \" later in this chapter). The Pharmacological Toolbox A researcher needs certain key tools in order to understand how a drug acts on the brain. To appreciate the importance of these tools, onemust first understand some basic principles of drug action. All recentstudies have indicated that the behavioral effects of THC are receptormediated. 27 Neurons in the brain are activated when a compound binds to its receptor, which is a protein typically located on the cell surface.Thus, THC will exert its effects only after binding to its receptor. In gen-eral, a given receptor will accept only particular classes of compoundsand will be unaffected by other compounds. Compounds that activate receptors are called agonists . Binding to a receptor triggers an event or a series of events in the cell that results in achange in the cell 's activity, its gene regulation, or the signals that it sends to neighboring cells (Figure 2.1). This agonist-induced process is calledsignal transduction. Another set of tools for drug research, which became available only recently for cannabinoid research, are the receptor antagonists , so-called because they selectively bind to a receptor that would have otherwise beenavailable for binding to some other compound or drug. Antagonists blockthe effects of agonists and are tools to identify the functions of a receptorby showing what happens when its normal functions are blocked. Ago-nists and antagonists are both ligands ; that is, they bind to receptors. Hor- mones, neurotransmitters, and drugs can all act as ligands. Morphine andnaloxone provide a good example of how agonists and antagonists inter-act. A large dose of morphine acts as an agonist at opioid receptors in thebrain and interferes with, or even arrests, breathing. Naloxone, a power-ful opioid antagonist, blocks morphine 's effects on opiate receptors, thereby allowing an overdose victim to resume breathing normally.Naloxone itself has no effect on breathing. Another key tool involves identifying the receptor protein and deter- mining how it works. That makes it possible to locate where a drug acti-vates its receptor in the brain \u2014both the general region of the brain andMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

FIGURE 2.1 Diagram of neuron with synapse. Individual nerve cells, or neu- rons, both send and receive cellular signals to and from neighboring neurons, but for the purposes of this diagram only one activity is indicated for each cell. Neu- rotransmitter molecules are released from the neuron terminal and move acrossthe gap between the \"sending \" and \"receiving \" neurons. A signal is transmitted to the receiving neuron when the neurotransmitters have bound to the receptor on its surface. The effects of a transmitted signal include: Changing the cell 's permeability to ions, such as calcium and potassium. Turning a particular gene on or off. Sending a signal to another neuron. Increasing or decreasing the responsiveness of the cell to other cellular sig- nals. Those effects can lead to cognitive, behavioral, or physiological changes, depend- ing on which neuronal system is activated.

The way to find a receptor for a drug in the brain is to make the receptor \"visible \" by attaching a radioac- tive or fluorescent marker to the drug. Such markers show where in thebrain a drug binds to the receptor, although this is not necessarily the partof the brain where the drug ultimately has its greatest effects. Because drugs injected into animals must be dissolved in a water- based solution, it is easier to deliver water-soluble molecules than to de-liver fat-soluble (lipophilic) molecules such as THC. THC is so lipophilicthat it can stick to glass and plastic syringes used for injection. Because itis lipophilic, it readily enters cell membranes and thus can cross the bloodbrain barrier easily. (This barrier insulates the brain from many blood-borne substances.) Early cannabinoid research was hindered by the lackof potent cannabinoid ligands (THC binds to its cannabinoid receptorsrather weakly) and because they were not readily water soluble. The syn-thetic agonist CP 55,940, which is more water soluble than THC, was thefirst useful research tool for studying cannabinoid receptors because of itshigh potency and ability to be labeled with a radioactive molecule, whichenabled researchers to trace its activity. CANNABINOID RECEPTORS The cannabinoid receptor is a typical member of the largest known family of receptors: the G protein-coupled receptors with their distinctivepattern in which the receptor molecule spans the cell membrane seventimes (Figure 2.2). For excellent recent reviews of cannabinoid receptorbiology, Childers ligands bind reversibly (they bind to the receptor briefly and then dissociate) and stereoselectively (when there are molecules that are mirror images of each other, only one The expanded view of the synapse illustrates a variety of ligands , that is, mol- ecules that bind to receptors. Anandamide is a substance produced by the body that binds to and activates cannabinoid receptors; it is an endogenous agonist . THC can also bind to and activate cannabinoid receptors but is not naturally found inthe body; it is an exogenous agonist . SR 141716A binds to but does not activate cannabinoid receptors. In this way it prevents agonists, such as anandamide and THC, from activating cannabinoid receptors by binding to the receptors withoutactivating them; SR 141716A is an antagonist , but it is not normally produced in the body. Endogenous antagonists, that is, those normally produced in the body, might also exist, but none has been identified.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The shaded bar represents the cell membrane, which like all cell membranes in animals is composed largely of phospholipids. Like many receptors, the can-nabinoid receptors span the cell membrane; some sections of the receptor protein are outside the cell membrane (extracellular); some are inside (intracellular). THC, anandamide, and other known cannabinoid receptor agonists bind to the extracel-lular portion of the receptor, thereby activating the signal pathway inside the cell.The CB 1 molecule is larger than CB2. The receptor molecules are most similar in four of the seven regions where they are embedded in the cell membrane (known as the transmembrane regions). The intracellular loops of the two receptor sub-types are quite different, which might affect the cellular response to the ligand because these loops are known to mediate G protein signaling, the next step in the cell signaling pathway after the receptor. Receptor homology between the tworeceptor subtypes is 44% for the full-length protein and 68% within the seven transmembrane regions. The ligand binding sites are typically defined by the ex- tracellular loops and the transmembrane regions. version activates the receptor). Thus far, two cannabinoid receptor sub- types (CB1 and CB2) have been identified, of which only CB1 is found in the brain. The cell responds in a variety of ways when a ligand binds to the cannabinoid receptor (Figure 2.3). The first step is activation of G pro-teins, the first components of the signal transduction pathway. That leadsto changes in several intracellular components \u2014such as cyclic AMP and calcium and potassium ions \u2014which ultimately produce the changes in cell functions. The final result of cannabinoid receptor stimulation de-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Differentagonists vary in binding potency , which determines the effective dose of the drug, and efficacy , which determines the maximal strength of the sig- nal that they transmit to the cell. The potency and efficacy of THC areboth relatively lower than those of some synthetic cannabinoids; in fact,synthetic compounds are generally more potent and efficacious than en-dogenous agonists. CB 1 receptors are extraordinarily abundant in the brain. They are more abundant than most other G protein-coupled receptors and 10 timesmore abundant than mu opioid receptors, the receptors responsible for the effects of morphine. 148FIGURE 2.3 Cannabinoid agonists trigger a series of reactions within cells. Can- nabinoid receptors are embedded in the cell membrane, where they are coupledto G proteins (G) and the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (AC). Receptors are activated when they bind to ligands, such as anandamide or THC in this case. This triggers a variety of reactions, including inhibition ( -) of AC, which decreases the produc- tion of cAMP and cellular activities dependent on cAMP; opening of potassium (K +) channels, which decreases cell firing; and closing of calcium (Ca2+) channels, which decreases the release of neurotransmitters.

The peripheral receptor (outside the nervous system), CB2, is most abun- dant on cells of the immune system and is not generally found in thebrain. 43,124 Although no other receptor subtypes have been identified, there is a genetic variant known as CB1A (such variants are somewhat different proteins that have been produced by the same genes via alterna-tive processing). In some cases, proteins produced via alternative splicinghave different effects on cells. It is not yet known whether there are anyfunctional differences between the two, but the structural differences raisethe possibility. CB 1 and CB2 are similar, but not as similar as members of many other receptor families are to each other. On the basis of a comparison of thesequence of amino acids that make up the receptor protein, the similarityof the CB 1 and CB2 receptors is 44% (Figure 2.2). The differences between the two receptors indicate that it should be possible to design therapeuticdrugs that would act only on one or the other receptor and thus wouldactivate or attenuate (block) the appropriate cannabinoid receptors. Thisoffers a powerful method for producing biologically selective effects. Inspite of the difference between the receptor subtypes, most cannabinoidcompounds bind with similar affinity* to both CB 1 and CB2 receptors. One exception is the plant-derived compound CBD, which appears tohave greater binding affinity for CB 2 than for CB1,112 although another research group has failed to substantiate that observation.129 Other ex- ceptions include the synthetic compound WIN 55,212-2, which showsgreater affinity for CB 2 than CB1, and the endogenous ligands, anan- damide and 2-AG, which show greater affinity for CB1 than CB2.43 The search for compounds that bind to only one or the other of the cannab-inoid receptor types has been under way for several years and has yieldeda number of compounds that are useful research tools and have potentialfor medical use. Cannabinoid receptors have been studied most in vertebrates, such as rats and mice. However, they are also found in invertebrates, such asleeches and mollusks. 156 The evolutionary history of vertebrates and in- vertebrates diverged more than 500 million years ago, so cannabinoid re-ceptors appear to have been conserved throughout evolution at least thislong. This suggests that they serve an important and basic function inanimal physiology. In general, cannabinoid receptor molecules are simi-lar among different species. 124 Thus, cannabinoid receptors likely fill many similar functions in a broad range of animals, including humans. *Affinity is a measure of how avidly a compound binds to a receptor. The higher the affin- ity of a compound, the higher its potency; that is, lower doses are needed to produce its effects.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CANNABINOIDS AND ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY 43 THE ENDOGENOUS CANNABINOID SYSTEM For any drug for which there is a receptor, the logical question is, \"Why does this receptor exist? \" The short answer is that there is probably an endogenous agonist (that is, a compound that is naturally produced inthe brain) that acts on that receptor. The long answer begins with a searchfor such compounds in the area of the body that produces the receptorsand ends with a determination of the natural function of those com-pounds. So far, the search has yielded several endogenous compoundsthat bind selectively to cannabinoid receptors. The best studied of themare anandamide 37 and arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG).108 However, their physiological roles are not yet known. Initially, the search for an endogenous cannabinoid was based on the premise that its chemical structure would be similar to that of THC; thatwas reasonable, in that it was really a search for another \"key\" that would fit into the cannabinoid receptor \"keyhole, \" thereby activating the cellular message system. One of the intriguing discoveries in cannabinoid biologywas how chemically different THC and anandamide are. A similar searchfor endogenous opioids (endorphins) also revealed that their chemicalstructure is very different from the plant-derived opioids, opium andmorphine. Further research has uncovered a variety of compounds with quite different chemical structures that can activate cannabinoid receptors(Table 2.2 and Figure 2.4). It is not yet known exactly how anandamideand THC bind to cannabinoid receptors. Knowing this should permitmore precise design of drugs that selectively activate the endogenous can-nabinoid systems. Anandamide The first endogenous cannabinoid to was arachidonyl- named the Sanskrit word ananda ing \"bliss. \" 37 Compared with THC, anandamide has only moderate affin- ity for CB1 receptor and is rapidly metabolized by amidases (enzymes that remove amide groups). Despite its short duration of action, anand-amideshares most of the pharmacological effects of THC. 37,152 Rapid degrada- tion of active molecules is a feature of neurotransmitter systems that al-lows them control of signal timing by regulating the abundance of signal-ing molecules. It creates problems for interpreting the results of manyexperiments and might explain why in vivo studies with anandamide in- jected into the brain have yielded conflicting results. Anandamide appears to have both central (in the brain) and periph- eral (in the rest of the body) effects.

THC is the primary psychoactive molecule found in marijuana. CP 55,940 is a THC analogue; that is, its related Anandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG ) are endogenous molecules, meaning they are naturally produced in the body. Al- though the chemical structure of WIN 55,212 is very different from either THC or anandamide, it is also a canabinoid agonist. tion of anandamide and the enzymes that synthesize it are not yet known. This information will provide essential clues to the natural role of anan-damide and an understanding of the brain circuits in which it is a neu-rotransmitter. The importance of knowing specific brain circuits that in-volve anandamide (and other endogenous cannabinoid ligands) is thatsuch circuits are the pivotal elements for regulating specific brain func-tions, such as mood, memory, and cognition. Anandamide has beenfound in numerous regions of the human brain: hippocampus (andMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.46 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE parahippocampic cortex), striatum, and cerebellum; but it has not been precisely identified with specific neuronal circuits. CB1 receptors are abun- dant in these regions, and this further implies a physiological role for en-dogenous cannabinoids in the brain functions controlled by these areas.But substantial concentrations of anandamide are also found in the thala-mus, an area of the brain that has relatively few CB 1 receptors.124 Anandamide has also been found outside the brain. It has been found in spleen tissue, which also has high concentrations of CB2 receptors, and small amounts have been detected in heart tissue.44 In general, the affinity of anandamide for cannabinoid receptors is only one-fourth to one-half that of THC (see Table 2.3). The differencesdepend on the cells or tissue that are tested and on the experimental con-ditions, such as the binding assay used (reviewed by Pertwee 124). The molecular structure of anandamide is relatively simple, and it can be formed from arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. Arachidonic acidis a common precursor of a group of biologically active molecules knownas eicosanoids, including prostaglandins.* Although anandamide can besynthesized in a variety of ways, the physiologically relevant pathwayTABLE 2.3 Comparison of Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists Potency can be measured in a variety of ways, from behavioral to physiological to cellular. This table shows potency in terms of receptor binding, which is the most broadlyapplicable to the many possible actions of cannabinoids. For example, anandamide binds to the cannabinoid receptor only about half as avidly as does THC. Measures of potency might include effects on activity (behavior) or hypothermia (physiologic). The apparently low potency of 2-AG may, however, be misleading. A study published late in 1998 reports that 2-AG is found with two other closely related compounds that by themselves are biologically inactive; but in the presence of those two compounds, 2-AG isonly three times less active than THC. 9 Further, 2-AG is much more abundant than anandamide, although the biological significance of this remains to be determined.

Anandamide can be inactivated in the brain via two mechanisms. In one it is enzymatically cleaved to yield arachidonic acid and ethanola-mine \u2014the reverse of what was initially proposed as its primary mode of synthesis. In the other it is inactivated through neuronal uptake \u2014that is, by being transported into the neuron, which prevents its continuing acti-vation of neighboring neurons. Other Endogenous Agonists Several other endogenous compounds that are chemically related to anandamide and that bind to cannabinoid receptors have been discov-ered, one of which is 2-AG. 108 2-AG is closely related to anandamide and is even more abundant in the brain. At the time of this writing, all knownendogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists (including is released via hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids. Other, noneicosanoid, compounds that bind cannabinoid receptors have recently been isolated from brain tissue, but they have not been iden-tified, and their biological effects are under investigation. This is a fast-moving field of research, and no review over six months old will be fullyup to date. The endogenous compounds that bind to cannabinoid receptors prob- ably perform a broad range of natural functions in the brain. This neuralsignaling system is rich and complex and has many subtle variations,many of which await discovery. In the next few years much more willprobably be known about these naturally occurring cannabinoids. Some effects of cannabinoid agonists are receptor independent. For example, both THC and CBD can be neuroprotective through theirantioxidative activity; that is, they can reduce the toxic forms of oxygenthat are released when cells are under stress. 54 Other likely examples of receptor-independent cannabinoid activity are modulation of arachidonic acid perturbation of membrane lipids. An important caution in interpret-ing those reports is that concentrations of THC or CBD used in cellularstudies, such as these, are generally much higher than the concentrationsof THC or CBD in the body that would likely be achieved by smokingmarijuana.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

For example,drugs that selectively inhibit neuronal uptake of anandamide would in-crease the brain 's own natural cannabinoids, thereby mimicking some of the effects of THC. A number of important psychotherapeutic drugs actby For example, antidepressants likefluoxetine inhibit serotonin uptake and are known as selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Another way to alter levels of en-dogenous cannabinoids would be to develop drugs that act on the en-zymes involved in anandamide synthesis. Some antihypertensive drugswork by inhibiting enzymes involved in the synthesis of endogenous hy-pertensive agents. For example, anti-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitorsare used in hypertensive patients to interfere with the conversion of an-giotensin I, which is inactive, to the active hormone, angiotensin II.

The highest receptor density is found in cells ofthe basal ganglia that project locally and to other generally involved in coordinatingbody movements. Patients with Parkinson 's or Huntington 's disease tend to have impaired functions in these regions. CB 1 receptors are also abundant in the putamen, part of the relay sys- tem within the basal ganglia that regulates body movements; the cerebel-lum, which coordinates body movements; the hippocampus, which is in-volved in learning, memory, and response to stress; and the cerebralcortex, which is concerned with the integration of higher cognitive func-tions.

See Table 2.5 for a summary of functions associated with those regions. axon, cell bodies, terminals, and dendrites.57,165 Dendrites are generally the \"receiving \" part of a neuron, and receptors on axons or cell bodies generally modulate other signals. Axon terminals are the \"sending \" part of the neuron. Cannabinoids tend to inhibit neurotransmission, although the results are somewhat variable. In some cases, cannabinoids diminish the effectsof the inhibitory neurotransmitter, g-aminobutyric acid (GABA); 144 in other cases, cannabinoids can augment the effects of GABA.120 The effect of activating a receptor depends on where it is found on the neuron: ifcannabinoid receptors are presynaptic (on the \"sending \" side of the syn- apse) and inhibit the release of GABA, cannabinoids would diminishGABA effects; the net effect would be stimulation. However, if cannab-inoid receptors are postsynaptic (on the \"receiving \" side of the synapse) and on the same cell as GABA receptors, they will probably mimic theeffects of GABA; in that case, the net effect would be inhibition. 120,144,160 CB1 is the predominant brain cannabinoid receptor. CB2 receptors have not generally been found in the brain, but there is one isolated reportsuggesting some in mouse cerebellum. 150 CB2 is found primarily on cellsMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

CB1 receptors are also found in immune cells, but CB2 is considerably more abundant there (Table 2.6) (reviewed by Kaminski80 in 1998). As can be appreciated in the next section, the presence of cannabinoid systems in key brain regions is strongly tied to the functions and pathol-ogy associated with those regions. The clinical value of cannabinoid sys-tems is best understood in the context of the biology of these brain re-gions. CANNABINOID RECEPTORS AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS Motor Effects Marijuana affects psychomotor performance in humans. The effects depend both on the nature of the task and the experience with marijuana.In general, effects are clearest in steadiness (body sway and hand steadi-ness) and in motor tasks that require attention. The results of testing can-nabinoids in rodents are much clearer. Cannabinoids clearly affect movement in rodents, but the effects de- pend on the dose: low doses stimulate and higher doses inhibit locomo-tion. 111,159 Cannabinoids mainly inhibit the transmission of neural signals, and they inhibit movement through their actions on the basal ganglia andcerebellum, where cannabinoid receptors are particularly abundant (Fig-ure 2.6). Cannabinoid receptors are also found in the neurons that projectfrom the striatum and subthalamic nucleus, which inhibit and stimulatemovement, respectively. 58,101 Cannabinoids decrease both the inhibitory and stimulatory inputs to the substantia nigra and therefore might provide dual regulation of move-TABLE 2.6 Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 for CB 2 than for CB1 Cannabidiol Does not bind Does not bind to receptor to receptor Receptor distribution Areas of greatest Brain Immune system, especially B cells and abundance natural killer cellsMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In the substantia nigra, cannabinoids decrease trans- mission from both the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus.141 The glo- bus pallidus has been implicated in mediating the cataleptic effects oflarge doses of cannabinoids in rats. 126 (Catalepsy is a condition of dimin- ished responsiveness usually characterized by trancelike states and waxyrigidity of the muscles.) Several other brain regions \u2014the cortex, the cer- ebellum, and the to striatum \u2014are also in- volved in the control of movement and contain abundant cannabinoidreceptors. 52,59,101 They are therefore possible additional sites that might underlie the effects of cannabinoids on movement. Memory Effects One of the primary effects of marijuana in humans is disruption of short-term memory.68 That is consistent with the abundance of CB1 recep- tors in the hippocampus, the brain region most closely associated withmemory. The effects of THC resemble a temporary hippocampal lesion. 63 Deadwyler and colleagues have demonstrated that cannabinoids decreaseneuronal activity in the hippocampus and its cannabinoids with memory formation. 29,30,116,157,163 Further- more, cannabinoid agonists inhibit release of several neurotransmitters:acetylcholine from the hippocampus, 49-51 norepinephrine from human and guinea pig (but not rat or mouse) hippocampal slices,143 and glutamate in cultured hippocampal cells.144 Cholinergic and noradrener- gic neurons project into the hippocampus, but circuits within the hippo-campus are glutamatergic.* Thus, cannabinoids could block transmissionboth into and within the hippocampus by blocking presynaptic neu-rotransmitter release. Pain After nausea and vomiting, chronic pain was the condition cited most often to the IOM study team as a medical use for marijuana. Recent re-search presented below has shown intriguing parallels with anecdotalreports of the modulating effects of cannabinoids on pain \u2014both the ef- fects of cannabinoids acting alone and the effects of their interaction withopioids. *Neurons are often defined by the primary neurotransmitter released at their terminals. Thus, cholinergic neurons release acetylcholine, noradrenergic neurons release noradrenalin (also known as norepinephrine), and glutamergic neurons release glutamate.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In rodents, cannabinoids reduced the responsiveness to pain in-duced through various stimuli, including thermal, mechanical, and chemi-cal stimuli. 12,19,46,72,96,154,174 Cannabinoids were comparable with opiates in potency and efficacy in these experiments.12,72 Cannabinoids are also effective in rodent models of chronic pain. Herzberg and co-workers found that cannabinoids can block allodyniaand hyperalgesia associated with neuropathic pain in rats. 62 This is an important advance because chronic pain frequently results in a series ofneural changes that increase suffering due to allodynia (pain elicited bystimuli that are normally innocuous), hyperalgesia ( abnormally increasedreactivity to pain), and spontaneous pain; furthermore, some chronic painsyndromes are not amenable to therapy, even with the most powerfulnarcotic analgesics. 10 Pain perception is controlled mainly by neurotransmitter systems within the central nervous system, and cannabinoids clearly play a role inthe control of pain in those systems. 45 However, pain-relieving and pain- preventing mechanisms also occur in peripheral tissues, and endogenouscannabinoids appear to play a role in peripheral tissues. Thus, the differ-ent cannabinoid receptor subtypes might act synergistically. Experimentsin which pain is induced by injecting dilute formalin into a mouse 's paw have shown that anandamide and palmitylethanolamide (PEA) can blockperipheral pain. 22,73 Anandamide acts primarily at the CB1 receptor, whereas PEA has been proposed as a possible CB2 agonist; in short, there might be a biochemical basis for their independent effects. When injectedtogether, the analgesic effect is stronger than that of either alone. Thatsuggests an important strategy for the development of a new class of an-algesic drug: a mixture of CB 1 and CB2 agonists. Because there are few, if any, CB2 receptors in the brain, it might be possible to develop drugs that enhance the peripheral analgesic effect while minimizing the psychologi-cal effects. Neural Sites of Altered Responsiveness to Painful Stimuli The brain and spinal cord mediate cannabinoid analgesia. A number of brain areas participate in and support the role ofdescending pathways (neural pathways that project from the brain to thespinal cord). 103,105 Although more work is needed to produce a compre- hensive map of the sites of cannabinoid analgesia, it is clear that the ef-fects are limited to particular areas, most of which have an establishedrole in pain.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CANNABINOIDS AND ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY 55 Specific sites where cannabinoids act to affect pain processing include spinal cord,64,65 and peripheral sensory nerves.64-66,131 Those nuclei also participate in opiate analgesia. Although similar to opiate act synergistically, have no effect on cannabinoid-induced analgesia. 171 However, a kappa -receptor antagonist has been shown to attenuate spinal, but praspinal, cannabinoid analgesia.153,170,171 (Kappa opioid receptors consti- tute one of the three major types of opioid receptors; the other two typesare mu and delta receptors.) Neurophysiology and Neurochemistry of Cannabinoid Analgesia Because of the marked effects of cannabinoids on motor function, be- havioral studies in animals alone cannot provide sufficient grounds forthe conclusion that cannabinoids depress pain perception. Motor behav-ior is typically used to measure responses to pain, but this behavior isitself affected by cannabinoids. Thus, experimental results include an un-measured combination of cannabinoid effects on motor and pain systems.The effects on specific neural systems, however, can be measured at theneurophysiological and neurochemical levels. Cannabinoids decrease theresponse of immediate-early genes (genes that are activated in the earlyor immediate stage of response to a broad range of cellular stimuli) tonoxious stimuli in the spinal cord, decrease response of pain neurons inthe spinal cord, and decrease the responsiveness of pain neurons in theventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. 67,102 Those changes are me- diated by cannabinoid receptors, are selective for pain neurons, and areunrelated to changes in skin temperature or depth of anesthesia, and theyfollow the time course of the changes in behavioral responses to painfulstimuli but not the time course of motor changes. 67 On-cells and off-cells in the rostral ventral medulla control pain transmission at the level of thespinal cord, and cannabinoids also modulate their responses in a mannerthat is very similar to that of morphine. 110 Endogenous Cannabinoids Modulate Pain Endogenous cannabinoids can modulate pain sensitivity through both central and peripheral mechanisms. For example, animal studies haveshown that pain sensitivity can be increased when endogenous cannab-inoids are blocked from acting at CB 1 receptors.22,62,110,130,158 Administra- tion of cannabinoid antagonists in either the spinal cord130 or paw22 in-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In addition, there is evidence that cannabinoids act at the site of injury to reduce peripheral inflammation.131 Current data suggest that the endogenous cannabinoid analgesic sys- tem might offer protection against the long-lasting central hyperalgesiaand allodynia that sometimes follow skin or nerve injuries. 130,158 These results raise the possibility that therapeutic interventions that alter thelevels of endogenous cannabinoids might be useful for managing pain inhumans. CHRONIC EFFECTS OF THC Most substances of abuse produce tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. Tolerance is the most common response to re- petitive use of a drug and is the condition in which, after repeated expo-sure to a drug, increasing doses are needed to achieve the same effect.Physical dependence develops as a result of a resetting of homeostatic mechanisms in response to repeated drug use. Tolerance, dependence,and withdrawal are not peculiar to drugs of abuse. Many medicines thatare not addicting can produce these types of effects; examples of suchmedications include clonidine, propranolol, and tricyclic antidepressants.The following sections discuss what is known about the biological mecha-nisms that underlie tolerance, reward, and dependence; clinical studiesabout those topics are discussed in chapter 3. Tolerance Chronic administration of cannabinoids to animals results in toler- ance to many of the acute effects of THC, including memory disruption, 34 decreased locomotion,2,119 hypothermia,42,125 neuroendocrine effects,134 and analgesia.4 Tolerance also develops to cardiovascular and psy- chological effects of THC and marijuana in humans (see also discussion inchapter 3). 55,56,76 Tolerance to cannabinoids appears to result from both pharmacokinetic changes (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and ex-creted) and pharmacodynamic changes (how the drug interacts with target cells). Chronic treatment with the cannabinoid agonist, P450 oxidative system, 31 the system through which drugs are metabolized in the liver; this sug-gests pharmacokinetic tolerance. Chronic cannabinoid treatment also pro-duces in brain cannabinoid receptors and cannabinoid receptormRNA concentrations \u2014an indication that pharmacodynamic effects are important as well. Most studies have found that brain cannabinoid receptor concentra-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CANNABINOIDS AND ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY 57 tions usually decrease after prolonged exposure to agonists,42,119,136,138 al- though some studies have reported increases137 or no changes2 in recep- tor binding in brain. Differences among studies could be due to the par-ticular agonist tested, the assay used, the brain region examined, or thetreatment time. For example, the THC analogue, levonantradol, incultured neuroblastoma cells. 40 This might be explained by differences in efficacy between these two agonists.18,147 A time course study revealed differences among brain regins in the rates and magnitudes of receptordown regulation. 16 Those findings suggest that tolerance to different ef- fects of cannabinoids develops at different rates. Chronic treatment with THC also produces variable effects on can- nabinoid-mediated signal transduction systems. It produces substantialdesensitization of cannabinoid-activated G proteins in a number of ratbrain regions. 147 The time course of this desensitization varies across brain regions.16 It is difficult to extend the findings of short-term animal studies to human marijuana use. To simulate long-term use, higher doses are usedin animal studies than are normally achieved by smoking marijuana. Forexample, the average human will feel \"high \" after injection of THC at a level of 0.06 mg/kg, 118 compared with the 10 -20 mg/kg per day used in many chronic rat studies. At the same time, doses of marijuana needed toobserve behavioral changes in rats (usually changes in locomotor behav-ior) are substantially higher than doses at which people feel \"high. \" The pharmacokinetics of THC distribution in the body are also dramaticallydifferent between rats and humans and depend heavily on whether it isinhaled, injected, or swallowed. It is likely that some of the same bio-chemical adaptations to chronic cannabinoid administration occur in labo-ratory animals and humans, but the magnitude of the effects in humansmight be less than that in animals in proportion to the doses used. Reward and Dependence Experimental animals that are given the opportunity to self-adminis- ter cannabinoids generally do not choose to do so, which has led to theconclusion that they are not reinforcing and rewarding. 38 However, be- havioral95 and brain stimulation94 studies have shown that THC can be rewarding to animals. The behavioral study used a \"place preference \" test, in which an animal is given repeated doses of a drug in one place,and is then given a choice between a place where it received the drug anda place where it did not. The animals chose the place where they receivedthe THC. These rewarding effects are highly dose dependent. In all mod-els studied, cannabinoids are only rewarding at midrange; doses that areMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.58 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE too low are not rewarding; doses that are too high can be aversive. Mice will self-administer the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 but only at lowdoses. 106 This effect is specifically mediated by CB1 receptors and indi- cates that stimulation of those receptors is rewarding to the mice. Antago-nism of cannabinoid receptors is also rewarding in rats; in conditionedplace preference tests, animals show a preference for the place they re-ceive the cannabinoid antagonist SR 141716A at both low and highdoses. 140 Cannabinoids increase dopamine concentrations in the mesolimbic dopamine system of rats, a pathway associated with reinforce-ment. 25,39,161 However, the mechanism by which THC increases dopa- mine concentrations appears to be different from that of other abuseddrugs 51 (see chapter 3 for further discussion of reinforcement). THC- induced increases in dopamine are due to increases in the firing rate ofdopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area by 9-THC.47 However, these increases in firing rate in the ventral tegmental area could not be explainedby increases in the firing of the A10 dopamine cell group, where otherabused drugs have been shown to act. 51 Physical dependence on cannabinoids has been observed only under experimental conditions of \"precipitated withdrawal \" in which animals are first treated chronically with cannabinoids and then given the CB1 antagonist SR 141716A.3,166 The addition of the antagonist accentuates any withdrawal effect by competing with the agonist at receptor sites; that is,the antagonist helps to clear agonists off and keep them off receptor sites.This suggests that, under normal cannabis use, the long half-life and slowelimination from the body of THC and the residual bioactivity of its me-tabolite, 11-OH-THC, can prevent substantial abstinence symptoms. Theprecipitated withdrawal produced by SR 141716A has some of the charac-teristics of opiate withdrawal, but it is not affected by opioid antagonists,and it affects motor systems differently. An earlier study with monkeysalso suggested that abrupt cessation of chronic THC is associated withwithdrawal symptoms. 8 Monkeys in that study were trained to work for food after which they were given THC on a daily basis; when the investi-gators stopped administering THC, the animals stopped working for food. A study in rats indicated that the behavioral cannabinoid withdrawal syndrome is consistent with the consequences of withdrawal from otherdrugs of abuse in that it correlates with the effects of stimulation of centralamygdaloid corticotropin-releasing hormone release. 135 However, the withdrawal syndrome for cannabinoids and the corresponding increasein corticotropin-releasing hormone are observed only after administra-tion of the CB 1 antagonist SR 141716A to cannabinoid-tolerant animals.3,166 The implications of data based on precipitated withdrawal in animals forhuman cannabinoid abuse have not been established. 166 Furthermore, acute administration of THC also produces increases in corticotropin-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CANNABINOIDS AND ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY 59 releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropin release; both are stress-related hormones.71 This set of withdrawal studies may explain the generally aversive effects of cannabinoids in animals and could indicate that theincrease in corticotropin-releasing hormone is merely a rebound effect.Thus, cannabinoids appear to be conforming to some of the neurobiologi-cal effects of other drugs abused by humans, but the underlying mecha-nisms of these actions and their value for determining the reinforcementand dependence liability of cannabinoids in humans remain undeter-mined. CANNABINOIDS AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM The human body protects itself from invaders, such as bacteria and viruses through the elaborate and dynamic network of organs and cellsreferred to as the immune system. Cannabinoids, especially THC, canmodulate the function of immune cells in various ways \u2014in some cases enhancing and in others diminishing the immune response 85 (summarized in Table 2.7). However, the natural function of cannabinoids in the im-mune system is not known. Immune cells respond to cannabinoids in avariety of ways, depending on such factors as drug concentration, timingof drug delivery to leukocytes in relation to antigen stimulation, and typeof cell function. Although the chronic effects of cannabinoids on the im-mune system have not been studied, based on acute exposure studies inexperimental animals it appears that THC concentrations that modulateimmunological responses are higher than those required for psycho-activity. The CB 2 receptor gene, which is not expressed in the brain, is particu- larly abundant in immune tissues, with an expression level 10 -100 times higher than that of CB1. In spleen and tonsils the CB2 mRNA* content is equivalent to that of CB1 mRNA in the brain.48 The rank order, from high to low, of CB2 mRNA levels in immune cells is B-cells > natural killer cells >> monocytes > polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells > T8 cells > T4 cells.In tonsils the CB 2 receptors appear to be restricted to B-lymphocyte- enriched areas. In contrast, CB1 receptors are mainly expressed in the cen- tral nervous system and, to a lesser extent, in several peripheral tissuessuch as adrenal gland, heart, thymus, and tonsils. *After a gene is transcribed, it is often spliced and modified into mRNA, or message RNA. The CB-2 mRNA is the gene \"message \" that moves from the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm where it will be translated into the receptor protein.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The molecular Box 2.1 Cells of the Immune System The various organs of the immune system are positioned throughout the body and include bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen. Thecells of the immune system consist of white blood cells, or leukocytes, which are formed in the bone marrow from stem cells\u2014so-called because a great variety of cells descend from them (see below). There are two kindsof leukocytes: lymphocytes and phagocytes. Lymphocytes consist of B cells, T cells (B and T refer to where the cells mature, either in the bone marrow [B] or thymus [T]), and natural impor- tant roles in the immune response; most important is that they initiate the response by engulfing and digesting foreign substances, or antigens (suchas bacteria, viruses, and foreign proteins), that enter the body. Once di- gested, the antigens are exposed to specialized lymphocytes, some of which produce antibodies and effector T cells, which help destroy any antigensremaining in the body. Antibodies are proteins produced by B cells that bind to antigens and promote antigen destruction. Effector T cells include killer T cells, which attack and kill antigen laden cells, and helper T cells,which secrete special proteins called cytokines that promote antigen elimi- nation. NK cells are specialized lymphocytes that are also activated by antigen to either kill infected targets or secrete immunoregulatory cytokines.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Some of thecannabinoid effects observed in immune systems, especially at high drugconcentrations, are likely mediated through nonreceptor mechanisms, butthese have not yet been identified. 4 Ligand binding to either CB1 or CB2 inhibits adenylate cyclase, an enzyme that is responsible for cAMP production and is, thus, an integralaspect of intracellular signal transduction (see Figure 2.3). 53,79,91,122,139,151,167 Increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations lead to immune enhance-ment, and decreases lead to an inhibition of the immune response. 77 Can- nabinoids inhibit the rise in intracellular cAMP that normally results fromleukocyte activation, and this might be the pathway through which can-nabinoids suppress immune cell functions. 28,74,167 In addition, cannab- inoids activate other molecular pathways such as the nuclear factor-kBpathway, and therefore these signals might be modified in drug-treatedimmune cells. 33,74 T and B Cells When stimulated by antigen, lymphocytes (see Box 2.1) first prolifer- ate and then mature or differentiate to become potent effector cells, suchas B cells that release antibodies or T cells that release cytokines. The nor-mal T-cell proliferation that is seen when human lymphocytes and mousesplenocytes (spleen cells) are exposed to antigens can beinhibited by WIN 61,89,93,99,127,155 In contrast, one study testing anandamide revealed little or no effect on T cell proliferation.93 However, these drug effects are variable and depend on experimental conditions, such as the experimental drug dose used, the mitogen used,the percentage of serum in the culture, and the timing of cannabinoiddrug exposure. In general, lower doses of cannabinoids increase prolif-eration and higher doses suppress proliferation. Doses that are effectivein suppressing immune function are typically greater than 10 \u00b5M in cell culture studies and greater than 5 mg/kg in whole-animal studies. 85 By *Mitogens are substances that stimulate cell division (mitosis) and cell transformation.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Thus, the immuneeffects of doses of cannabinoids higher than those ever experienced byhumans should be interpreted with caution. 93 As with T cells, B cell proliferation can be suppressed by various can- nabinoids, such as THC, 11-OH-THC, and 2-AG, but B cell proliferation ismore inhibited at lower drug concentrations than T cell proliferation. 89,93 Conversely, low doses of THC, CP 55,940 and WIN 55,212-2 increase B cell proliferation in cultured human cells exposed to mitogen.35 This effect possibly involves the CB2 receptor, because the effect appears to be the same when the CB1 receptor was blocked by the antagonist SR 141716A (which does not block the CB2 receptor). The reason for the differences in B cell responsiveness to cannabinoids is probably due to differences incell type and source; for example, B cells collected from mouse spleenmight respond to cannabinoids somewhat differently than B cells fromhuman tonsils. Natural Killer Cells Repeated injections of relatively low doses of THC (3 mg/kg/day 121*) or two injections of a high dose (40 mg/kg86) suppress the ability of NK cells to destroy foreign cells in rats and mice. THC can also suppress cy-tolytic activity of the NK cells in cell cultures; 11-OH-THC is even morepotent. 86 In contrast, THC concentrations below 10 \u00b5M had no effect on NK cell activity in mouse cell cultures.98 Macrophages Macrophages perform various functions, including phagocytosis (in- gestion and destruction of foreign substances), cytolysis, antigen presen-tation to lymphocytes, and production of active proteins involved in de-stroying microorganisms, tissue repair, and modulation of immune cells.Those functions can be suppressed by THC doses similar to those capableof modulating lymphocyte functions (see above). 88,109 *While 3 mg/kg would be a high dose for humans (see Table 3.1), in rodents, it is a low dose for immunological effects and a moderate dose for behavioral effects.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.66 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE Cytokines Cytokines are proteins produced by immune cells. When released from the producing cell, they can alter the function of other cells theycome in contact with. In a sense they are like hormones. Thus, cannab-inoids can either increase or decrease cytokine production dependingupon experimental conditions. Some cytokines, such as interferon- and interleukin-2 (IL-2), are pro- duced by T helper-1 (Th1) cells. These cytokines help to activate cell-mediated immunity and the killer cells that eliminate microorganismsfrom the body (see Box 2.1). When injected into mice, THC suppresses theproduction of those cytokines that modulate the host response to infec-tion (see below). 115 Cannabinoids also modulate interferons induced by viral infection,21 as well as other interferon inducers.85 Furthermore, in human cell cultures, interferon production can be increased by low con-centrations but decreased by high concentrations of either THC or CBD. 168 In addition to Th1 cytokines, cannabinoids modulate the production ofcytokines although studies suggest that cannabinoids can induce anincrease in cytokines, other studies suggest that they can also suppresscytokine production. 85 The different results might be due to different cell culture conditions or because different cell lines were studied. Antibody Production Antibody production is an important measure of humoral immune function as contrasted with cellular (cell-mediated) immunity. Antibodyproduction can be suppressed in mice injected with low dosesof THC (>5 mg/kg) or HU-210 (>0.05 mg/kg) and response by cannabinoids was onlyobserved when antibody-forming cells were exposed to T-cell-dependentantigens (the responses require functional T cells and macrophages as ac-cessory cells). Conversely, antibody responses to several T-cell-indepen-dent antigens were not inhibited by THC; this suggests that B cells arerelatively insensitive to inhibition by cannabinoids. 142 Resistance to Infection in Animals Exposed to Cannabinoids Evaluation of bacterial infections in mice that received injections ofMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CANNABINOIDS AND ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY 67 THC can suppress resistance to infection, although the effect depends on the dose and timing of drug administration. Mice pretreated with THC (8mg/kg) one day before infection with a sublethal dose of the pneumonia-causing bacteria Legionella pneumophilia and then treated again one day after the infection with THC developed symptoms of cytokine-mediatedseptic shock and died; control mice that were not pretreated with THCbecame immune to repeated infection and survived the bacterial chal-lenge. 90 If only one injection of THC was given or doses less than 5 mg/kg were used, all the mice survived the initial infection but failed to survivelater challenge with a lethal dose of the bacteria; hence, these mice failedto develop immune memory in response to the initial sublethal infection. 87 Note that these are very high doses and are considerably higher than dosesexperienced by marijuana users (see Figure 3.1). 115 In rats, doses of 4.0 mg/kg THC are aversive.95 Few studies have been done to evaluate the effect of THC on viral infections, and this subject needs further study.20 Compared to healthy animals, THC might have greater immunosuppressive effects in animalswhose immune systems are severely weakened. For example, a very highdose of THC (100 mg/kg) given two days before and after herpes simplexvirus infection was shown to be a cofactor with the virus in advancing theprogression to death in an immunodeficient mouse model infected with aleukemia virus. 85 However, THC given as a single dose (100 mg/kg) two days before herpes simplex virus infection did not promote the progres-sion to death. Hence, whether THC is immunosuppressive probably de-pends on the timing of THC exposure relative to an infection. Antiinflammatory Effects As discussed above, cannabinoid drugs can modulate the production of cytokines, which are central to inflammatory processes in the body. Inaddition, several studies have shown directly that cannabinoids can beantiinflammatory. For example, in rats with autoimmune encephalomy-elitis (an experimental model used to study multiple sclerosis), cannab-inoids were shown to attenuate the signs and the symptoms of centralnervous system damage. 100,172 (Some believe that nerve damage associ- ated with multiple sclerosis is caused by an inflammatory reaction.) Like-wise, the cannabinoid, HU-211, was shown to suppress brain inflamma-tion that resulted from closed-head injury 146 or infectious meningitis7 in studies on rats. HU-211 is a synthetic cannabinoid that does not bind tocannabinoid receptors and is not psychoactive; 7 thus, without direct evi- dence, the effects of marijuana cannot be assumed to include those of HU-211. CT-3, another atypical cannabinoid, suppresses acute and chronicjoint inflammation in animals. 178 It is a nonpsychoactive synthetic deriva-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

It is interesting to note that two reports of cannabinoid-induced anal- gesia are based on the ability of the endogenous cannabinoids, anan-damide and PEA, to reduce pain associated with local inflammation thatwas experimentally induced by subcutaneous injections of dilute forma-lin. 22,73 THC of ACTH and corticosterone in animals.169 Those hormones are involved in regulat- ing many responses in the body, including those to inflammation. Thepossible link between experimental cannabinoid-induced analgesia andreported antiinflammatory effects of cannabinoids is important for poten-tial therapeutic uses of cannabinoid drugs but has not yet been estab-lished. Conclusions Regarding Effects on the Immune System Cell culture and animal studies have established cannabinoids as immunomodulators \u2014that is, they increase some immune responses and decrease others. The variable responses depend on such experimental fac-tors as drug dose, timing of delivery, and type of immune cell examined.Cannabinoids affect multiple cellular targets in the immune system and avariety of effector functions. Many of the effects noted above appear tooccur at concentrations over 5 \u00b5M in vitro and over 5 \u00b5g/kg in vivo .* By comparison, a 5-mg injection of THC into a person (about 0.06 mg/kg) isenough to produce strong psychoactive effects. It should be emphasized,however, that little is known about the immune effects of chronic low-dose exposure to cannabinoids. Another issue in need of further clarification involves the potential usefulness of cannabinoids as therapeutic agents in inflammatory dis-eases. Glucocorticoids have historically been used for these diseases, butnonpsychotropic cannabinoids potentially have fewer side effects andmight thus offer an improvement over glucocorticoids in treating inflam-matory diseases. *In vitro studies are those in which animal cells or tissue are removed and studied outside the animal; in vivo studies are those in which experiments are conducted in the whole ani- mal.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Itis interesting to compare how little we know about cannabinoids withhow much we know about opiates. Table 2.8 suggests good reason foroptimism about the future of cannabinoid drug development. Now thatmany of the basic tools of cannabinoid pharmacology and biology havebeen developed, one can expect to see rapid advances that can begin tomatch what is known of opiate systems in the brain. Despite the tremendous progress in understanding the pharmacol- ogy and neurobiology of brain cannabinoid systems, this field is still in itsearly developmental stages. A key focus for future study is the neurobiol-ogy of endogenous cannabinoids; establishing the precise brain localiza-tion (in which cells and where) of cannabinoids, cellular storage and re-lease mechanisms, and uptake mechanisms will be crucial in determiningthe biological role of this system. Technology needed to establish the bio-logical significance of these systems will be broad based and include suchresearch tools as the transgenic or gene knockout mice, as has alreadybeen accomplished for various opioid-receptor types. 26 In 1997, both CB1 and CB2 knockout mice were generated by a team of scientists at the Na- tional Institutes of Health, and a group in France has developed anotherstrain of CB 1 knockout mice.92TABLE 2.8 Historical Comparisons Between Cannabinoids and Opiates Pharmacological Discoveries Cannabinoids Opiates Discovery of receptor 1988 (Devane et al. 1973 (Pert and existence and Dill and Snyder, Simon, Howlett )36,40and Terenius )123,149,162 Identification (Rinaldi- and endogenous ligand (Devane et al.)37leu-enkephalin(Hughes et al.) 70 First receptor cloned 1990 (Matsuda et al.)107 1992 (Evans et al. and Kieffer et al.)41,82 Natural functions Unknown Pain, reproduction, mood, movement, and othersMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In the area of drug development, future progress should con-tinue to provide more specific agonists and antagonists for CB 1 and CB2 receptors, with varying potential for therapeutic uses. There are certain areas that will provide keys to a better understand- ing of the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoids. For example, basicbiology indicates a role for cannabinoids in pain and control of move-ment, which is consistent with a possible therapeutic role in these areas.The evidence is relatively strong for the treatment of pain and, intriguingalthough less well established, for movement disorders. The neuropro-tective properties of cannabinoids might prove therapeutically useful, al-though it should be noted that this is a new area and other, better studied,neuroprotective drugs have not yet been shown to be therapeutically use-ful. Cannabinoid research is clearly relevant not only to drug abuse butalso to understanding basic human biology. Further, it offers the potentialfor the discovery and development of new therapeutically useful drugs. C ONCLUSION : At this point, our knowledge about the biology of marijuana and cannabinoids allows us to make some general con-clusions: Cannabinoids likely have a natural role in pain modulation, control of movement, and memory. The natural role of cannabinoids in immune systems is likely multi-faceted and remains unclear. The brain develops tolerance to cannabinoids. Animal research has demonstrated the potential for depen- dence, but this potential is observed under a narrower range ofconditions than with benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, ornicotine. Withdrawal symptoms can be observed in animals but appear mild compared with those of withdrawal from opiates or ben-zodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium). C ONCLUSION : The different cannabinoid receptor types found in the body appear to play different roles in normal physiology. Inaddition, some effects of cannabinoids appear to be independentof those receptors. The variety of mechanisms through which can-nabinoids can influence human physiology underlies the varietyMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

RECOMMENDATION : Research should continue into the physiologi- cal effects of synthetic and plant-derived cannabinoids and thenatural function of cannabinoids found in the body. Becausedifferent cannabinoids appear to have different effects, cannab-inoid research should include, but not be restricted to, effectsattributable to THC alone. This chapter has summarized recent progress in understanding the basic biology of cannabinoids and provides a foundation for the next twochapters which review studies on the potential health risks (chapter 3)and benefits of marijuana use (chapter 4).

This is the physician's first rule: whatever treatment a physician prescribes to a pa- tient\u2014first, that treatment must not harm the patient. The most contentious aspect of the medical marijuana de- bate is not whether marijuana can alleviate particularsymptoms but rather the degree of harm associated withits use. This chapter explores the negative health conse-quences of marijuana use, first with respect to drug abuse, then from a psychological perspective, and finally from a physiologicalperspective. THE MARIJUANA \"HIGH\" The most commonly reported effects of smoked marijuana are a sense of well-being or euphoria and increased talkativeness and laughter alter-nating with periods of introspective dreaminess followed by lethargy andsleepiness (see reviews by Adams and Martin, 1996, 1 Hall and Solowij,59 and Hall et al. 60). A characteristic feature of a marijuana \"high\" is a dis- tortion in the sense of time associated with deficits in short-term memoryand learning. A marijuana smoker typically has a sense of enhanced physi-cal and emotional sensitivity, including a feeling of greater interpersonalcloseness. The most obvious behavioral abnormality displayed by some-one under the influence of marijuana is difficulty in carrying on an intelli-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.84 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE gible conversation, perhaps because of an inability to remember what was just said even a few words earlier. The high associated with marijuana is not generally claimed to be integral to its therapeutic value. But mood enhancement, anxiety reduc-tion, and mild sedation can be desirable qualities in medications \u2014par- ticularly for patients suffering pain and anxiety. Thus, although thepsychological effects of marijuana are merely side effects in the treatmentof some symptoms, they might contribute directly to relief of other symp-toms. They also must be monitored in controlled clinical trials to discernwhich effect of cannabinoids is beneficial. These possibilities are discussedlater under the discussions of specific symptoms in chapter 4. The effects of various doses and routes of delivery of THC are shown in Table 3.1. Adverse Mood Reactions Although euphoria is the more common reaction to smoking mari- juana, adverse mood reactions can occur. Such reactions occur mostfrequently in inexperienced users after large doses of smoked or oral mari-juana. They usually disappear within hours and respond well to reassur-ance and a supportive environment. Anxiety and paranoia are the mostcommon acute adverse reactions; 59 others include panic, depression, dys- phoria, depersonalization, delusions, illusions, and hallucinations.1,40,66,69 Of regular marijuana smokers, 17% report that they have experienced atleast one of the symptoms, usually early in their use of marijuana. 145 Those observations are particularly relevant for the use of medical mari-juana in people who have not previously used marijuana. DRUG DYNAMICS There are many misunderstandings about drug abuse and depen- dence (see reviews by O 'Brien 114 and Goldstein54). The terms and con- cepts used in this report are as defined in the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV ),3 the most influential sys- tem in the United States for diagnoses of mental disorders, including sub-stance abuse (see Box 3.1). Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal areoften presumed to imply abuse or addiction, but this is not the case. Toler-ance and dependence are normal physiological adaptations to repeated use of any drug. The correct use of prescribed medications for pain, anxi-ety, and even hypertension commonly produces tolerance and some mea-sure of physiological dependence. Even a patient who takes a medicine for appropriate medical indica- tions and at the correct dosage can develop tolerance, physical depen-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Physiological dependence is diagnosed when there is evidence of either tol- erance or withdrawal; it is sometimes, but not always, manifested in substance dependence. Reinforcement . A drug\u2014or any other stimulus\u2014is referred to as a reinforcer if exposure to it is followed by an increase in frequency of drug-seeking behavior. The taste of chocolate is a reinforcer for biting into a choco-late bar. Likewise, for many people the sensation experienced after drinking alcohol or smoking marijuana is a reinforcer. Substance dependence is a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiologi- cal symptoms indicating that a person continues use of the substance despite significant substance-related problems. Tolerance is the most common response to repetitive use of a drug and can be defined as the reduction in responses to the drug after repeated ad- ministrations. Withdrawal . The collective symptoms that occur when a drug is abruptly withdrawn are known as withdrawal syndrome and are often the onlyevidence of physical dependence. dence, and withdrawal symptoms if the drug is stopped abruptly rather than gradually. For example, a hypertensive patient receiving a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, such as propranolol, might have a good thera-peutic response; but if the drug is stopped abruptly, there can be a with-drawal syndrome that consists of tachycardia and a rebound increase inblood pressure to a point that is temporarily higher than before adminis-tration of the medication began. Because it is an illegal substance, some people consider any use of marijuana as substance abuse. However, this report uses the medical defi-nition; that is, substance abuse is a maladaptive pattern of repeated sub-stance use manifested by recurrent and significant adverse consequences. 3 Substance abuse and dependence are both diagnoses of pathological sub-stance use. Dependence is the more serious diagnosis and implies com-pulsive drug use that is difficult to stop despite significant substance-related problems (see Box 3.2).Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

(b) Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance. (2) Withdrawal, as defined by either of the following: (a) The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance. (b) The same (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. (3) The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. (4) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use. (5) A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance (e.g., visiting multiple doctors or driving long distances),to use the substance (e.g., chain-smoking), or to recover from its effects. (6) Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of substance use. (7) The substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that islikely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance (e.g., current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine-induced depression or continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcerwas made worse by alcohol consumption). Substance abuse with physiological dependence is diagnosed if there is evidence of tolerance or withdrawal. Substance abuse without physiological dependence is diagnosed if there is no evidence of tolerance or withdrawal. Reinforcement Drugs vary in their ability to produce good feelings in users, and the more strongly reinforcing a drug is, the more likely it will be abused (G.Koob, Institute of Medicine (IOM) workshop). Marijuana is indisputablyreinforcing for many people. The reinforcing properties of even so mild aMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Caffeine is reinforcing for many people at low doses (100 -200 mg, the average amount of caffeine in one to two cups of coffee) and is aversive at high doses (600 mg, the average amount ofcaffeine in six cups of coffee). The reinforcing effects of many drugs aredifferent for different people. For example, caffeine was most reinforcingfor test subjects who scored lowest on tests of anxiety but tended not to bereinforcing for the most anxious subjects. As an argument to dispute the abuse potential of marijuana, some have cited the observation that animals do not willingly self-administerTHC, as they will cocaine. Even if that were true, it would not be relevantto human use of marijuana. The value in animal models of drug self-administration is not that they are necessary to show that a drug is rein-forcing but rather that they provide a model in which the effects of a drugcan be studied. Furthermore, THC is indeed rewarding to animals at somedoses but, like many reinforcing drugs, is aversive at high doses (4.0 mg/kg). 93 Similar effects have been found in experiments conducted in animals outfitted with intravenous catheters that allow them to self-administer WIN 55,212, a drug that mimics the effects of THC. 100 A specific set of neural pathways has been proposed to be a \"reward system \" that underlies the reinforcement of drugs of abuse and other plea- surable stimuli.51 Reinforcing properties of drugs are associated with their ability to increase concentrations of particular neurotransmitters in areasthat are part of the proposed brain reward system. The median forebrainbundle and the nucleus accumbens are associated with brain reward path-ways. 88 Cocaine, amphetamine, alcohol, opioids, nicotine, and THC144 all increase extracellular fluid dopamine in the nucleus accumbens region(reviewed by Koob and Le Moal 88 and Nestler and Aghajanian110 in 1997). However, it is important to note that brain reward systems are not strictly\"drug reinforcement centers. \" Rather, their biological role is to respond to a range of positive stimuli, including sweet foods and sexual attraction. Tolerance The rate at which tolerance to the various effects of any drug devel- ops is an important consideration for its safety and efficacy. For medicaluse, tolerance to some effects of cannabinoids might be desirable. Differ-ences in the rates at which tolerance to the multiple effects of a drugdevelops can be dangerous. For example, tolerance to the euphoric effectsof heroin develops faster than tolerance to its respiratory depressanteffects, so heroin users tend to increase their daily doses to reach theirdesired level of euphoria, thereby putting themselves at risk for respira-tory arrest. Because tolerance to the various effects of cannabinoids mightMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 89 develop at different rates, it is important to evaluate independently their effects on mood, motor performance, memory, and attention, as well asany therapeutic use under investigation. Tolerance to most of the effects of marijuana can develop rapidly after only a few doses, and it also disappears rapidly. Tolerance to large doseshas been found to persist in experimental animals for long periods aftercessation of drug use. Performance impairment is less among people whouse marijuana heavily than it is among those who use marijuana onlyoccasionally, 29,104,124 possibly because of tolerance. Heavy users tend to reach higher plasma concentrations of THC than light users after similardoses of THC, arguing against the possibility that heavy users show lessperformance impairment because they somehow absorb less THC (per-haps due to differences in smoking behavior). 95 There appear to be variations in the development of tolerance to the different effects of marijuana and oral THC. For example, daily marijuanasmokers participated in a residential laboratory study to compare thedevelopment of tolerance to THC pills and to smoked marijuana. 61,62 One group was given marijuana cigarettes to smoke four times per day forfour consecutive days; another group was given THC pills on the sameschedule. During the four-day period, both groups became tolerant to feel-ing \"high \" and what they reported as a \"good drug effect. \" In contrast, neither group became tolerant to the stimulatory effects of marijuana orTHC on appetite. \"Tolerance \" does not mean that the drug no longer pro- duced the effects but simply that the effects were less at the end than atthe beginning of the four-day period. The marijuana smoking group re-ported feeling \"mellow \" after smoking and did not show tolerance to this effect; the group that took THC pills did not report feeling \"mellow. \" The difference was also reported by many people who described their experi-ences to the IOM study team. The oral and smoked doses were designed to deliver roughly equiva- lent amounts of THC to a subject. Each smoked marijuana dose consistedof five 10-second puffs of a marijuana cigarette containing 3.1% THC; thepills contained 30 mg of THC. Both groups also received placebo drugsduring other four-day periods. Although the dosing of the two groupswas comparable, different routes of administration resulted in differentpatterns of drug effect. The peak effect of smoked marijuana is usually feltwithin minutes and declines sharply after 30 minutes 68,95; the peak effect of oral THC is usually not felt until about an hour and lasts for severalhours. 118 Withdrawal A distinctive marijuana and THC withdrawal syndrome has beenMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.90 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE identified, but it is mild and subtle compared with the profound physical syndrome of alcohol or heroin withdrawal.31,74 The symptoms of mari- juana withdrawal include restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insom-nia, sleep EEG disturbance, nausea, and cramping (Table 3.2). In additionto those symptoms, two recent studies noted several more. A group ofadolescents under treatment for conduct disorders also reported fatigueand illusions or hallucinations after marijuana abstinence (this study isdiscussed further in the section on \"Prevalence and Predictors of Depen- dence on Marijuana and Other Drugs \"). 31 In a residential study of daily TABLE 3.2 Drug Withdrawal Symptoms Opioids (e.g., heroin Nicotine Depression Anxiety AnxietyDifficulty concentrating Sleep Insomnia Sleepiness, Insomnia disturbance fatigue Sleep EEG disturbance Nausea Nausea Nausea Cramping Cramping Decreased Tachycardia, Bradycardia heart rate hypertension Sweating Muscle aches Seizures Increased sensitivity to pain Alcohol craving Cocaine craving Opioid craving Increased Delirium appetite or tremens a weight gain TremorPerceptual distortion aSevere agitation, confusion, visual hallucinations, fever, profuse sweating, nausea, diarrhea, dilated pupils.

The withdrawal symptoms, how-ever, were short lived. In four days they had abated. The time course con-trasts with that in another study in which lower doses of oral THC wereused (80 -120 mg/day for four days) and withdrawal symptoms were still near maximal after four days. 61,62 In animals, simply discontinuing chronic heavy dosing of THC does not reveal withdrawal symptoms, but the \"removal \" of THC from the brain can be made abrupt by another drug that blocks THC at its receptorif administered when the chronic THC is withdrawn. The withdrawal syn-drome is pronounced, and the behavior of the animals becomes hyper-active and disorganized. 153 The half-life of THC in brain is about an hour.16,24 Although traces of THC can remain in the brain for much longer periods, the amounts are not physiologically significant. Thus, the lack ofa withdrawal syndrome when THC is abruptly withdrawn without ad-ministration of a receptor-blocking drug is probably not due to a pro-longed decline in brain concentrations. Craving Craving, the intense desire for a drug, is the most difficult aspect of addiction to overcome. Research on craving has focused on nicotine, alco- hol, cocaine, and opiates but has not specifically addressed marijuana. 115 Thus, while this section briefly reviews what is known about drug crav-ing, its relevance to marijuana use has not been established. Most people who suffer from addiction relapse within a year of absti- nence, and they often attribute their relapse to craving. 58 As addiction develops, craving increases even as maladaptive consequences accumu-late. Animal studies indicate that the tendency to relapse is based onchanges in brain function that continue for months or years after the lastuse of the drug. 115 Whether neurobiological conditions change during the manifestation of an abstinence syndrome remains an unanswered ques-tion in drug abuse research. 88 The \"liking \" of sweet foods, for example, isMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.92 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE mediated by opioid forebrain systems and by brain stem systems, whereas \"wanting \" seems to be mediated by ascending dopamine neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens.109 Anticraving medications have been developed for nicotine and alco- hol. The antidepressant, bupropion, blocks nicotine craving, whilenaltrexone blocks alcohol craving. 115 Another category of addiction medi- cation includes drugs that block other drugs ' effects. Some of those drugs also block craving. For example, methadone blocks the euphoric effects ofheroin and also reduces craving. MARIJUANA USE AND DEPENDENCE Prevalence of Use Millions of Americans have tried marijuana, but most are not regular users. In 1996, 68.6 million people \u201432% of the U.S. population over 12 years old \u2014had tried marijuana or hashish at least once in their lifetime, but only 5% were current users. 132 Marijuana use is most prevalent among 18- to 25-year-olds and declines sharply after the age of 34 (Figure3.1). 77,132 Whites are more likely than blacks to use marijuana in adoles- cence, although the difference decreases by adulthood.132 Most people who have used marijuana did so first during adolescence. Social influences, such as peer pressure and prevalence of use by peers,are highly predictive of initiation into marijuana use. 9 Initiation is not, of course, synonymous with continued or regular use. A cohort of 456 stu-dents who experimented with marijuana during their high school yearswere surveyed about their reasons for initiating, continuing, and stop-ping their marijuana use. 9 Students who began as heavy users were excluded from the analysis. Those who did not become regular marijuanausers cited two types of reasons for discontinuing. The first was related tohealth and well-being; that is, they felt that marijuana was bad for theirhealth or for their family and work relationships. The second type wasbased on age-related changes in circumstances, including increased re-sponsibility and decreased regular contact with other marijuana users.Among high school students who quit, parental disapproval was a stron-ger influence than peer disapproval in discontinuing marijuana use. Inthe initiation of marijuana use, the reverse was true. The reasons cited bythose who continued to use marijuana were to \"get in a better mood or feel better. \" Social factors were not a significant predictor of continued use. Data on young adults show similar trends. Those who use drugs inresponse to social influences are more likely to stop using them than thosewho also use them for psychological reasons. 80 The age distribution of marijuana users among the general popula-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Marijuana use gener- ally declines sharply after the age of 34 years, whereas medical marijuanausers tend to be over 35. That raises the question of what, if any, relation-ship exists between abuse and medical use of marijuana; however, nostudies reported in the scientific literature have addressed this question. Prevalence and Predictors of Dependence on Marijuana and Other Drugs Many factors influence the likelihood that a particular person will become a drug abuser or an addict; the user, the environment, and thedrug are all important factors (Table 3.3). 114 The first two categories apply to potential abuse of any substance; that is, people who are vulnerable todrug abuse for individual reasons and who find themselves in an envi-ronment that encourages drug abuse are initially likely to abuse the mostreadily available drug \u2014regardless of its unique set of effects on the brain. The third category includes drug-specific effects that influence the abuseMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.94 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE liability of a particular drug. As discussed earlier in this chapter, the more strongly reinforcing a drug is, the more likely that it will be abused. Theabuse liability of a drug is enhanced by how quickly its effects are felt,and this is determined by how the drug is delivered. In general, the effectsof drugs that are inhaled or injected are felt within minutes, and the effectsof drugs that are ingested take a half hour or more. The proportion of people who become addicted varies among drugs. Table 3.4 shows estimates for the proportion of people among the generalpopulation who used or became dependent on different types of drugs.The proportion of users that ever became dependent includes anyone whowas ever dependent \u2014whether it was for a period of weeks or years \u2014and thus includes more than those who are currently dependent. Comparedto most other drugs listed in this table, dependence among marijuana us-ers is relatively rare. This might be due to differences in specific drugeffects, the availability of or penalties associated with the use of the differ-ent drugs, or some combination. Daily use of most illicit drugs is extremely rare in the general popula- tion. In 1989, daily use of marijuana among high school seniors was lessthan that of alcohol (2.9% and 4.2%, respectively). 76 Drug dependence is more prevalent in some sectors of the population than in others. Age, gender, and race or ethnic group are all important.8 Excluding tobacco and alcohol, the following trends of drug dependenceare statistically significant: 8 Men are 1.6 times as likely than women to become drug dependent, non-Hispanic whites are about twice as likely asblacks to become drug dependent (the difference between non-HispanicTABLE 3.3 Factors That Are Correlated with Drug Dependence Individual Factors Pharmacological effects of the drug Gender Age Genetic factors Individual risk-taking propensities Prior drug use Environmental Factors Availability of the drug Acceptance of use of that drug in society Balance of social reinforcements and of punishments for use Balance of social reinforcements and of punishments for abstinence SOURCE: Crowley and Rhine (1985).32Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

More often than not, drug dependence co-occurs with other psychiat- ric disorders. Most people with a diagnosis of drug dependence disorderalso have a diagnosis of a another psychiatric disorder (76% of men and65% of women). 76 The most frequent co-occurring disorder is alcohol abuse; 60% of men and 30% of women with a diagnosis of drug depen-dence also abuse alcohol. In women who are drug dependent, phobic dis-orders and major depression are almost equally common (29% and 28%,respectively). Note that this study distinguished only between alcohol,nicotine and \"other drugs \"; marijuana was grouped among \"other drugs. \" The frequency with which drug dependence and other psychiatric dis-orders co-occur might not be the same for marijuana and other drugs thatwere included in that category. A strong association between drug dependence and antisocial per- sonality or its precursor, conduct disorder, is also widely reported in chil-dren and adults (reviewed in 1998 by Robins 126). Although the causes of the association are uncertain, Robins recently concluded that it is morelikely that conduct disorders generally lead to substance abuse than thereverse. 126 Such a trend might, however, depend on the age at which the conduct disorder is manifested.TABLE 3.4 Prevalence of Drug Use and Dependencea in the General Population Proportion That Have Proportion of Users That Drug Category Ever Used (%) Ever Became Dependent (%) Tobacco 76 32 Alcohol 92 15 Marijuana (including hashish) 46b 9 Anxiolytics (including sedatives 13 9 and hypnotic drugs) Cocaine 16 17 Heroin 2 23 aDiagnosis of drug dependence used in this study based on DSM-III-R criteria.2 bThe percentage of people who ever used marijuana is higher than that reported by the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (32%), probably due to different survey meth- ods (for discussion, see Kandel, 199276).

All rights reserved.96 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE A longitudinal study by Brooks and co-workers noted a significant relationship between adolescent drug use and disruptive disorders inyoung adulthood; except for earlier psychopathology, such as childhoodconduct disorder, the drug use preceded the psychiatric disorders. 18 In contrast with use of other illicit drugs and tobacco, moderate (less thanonce a week and more than once a month) to heavy marijuana use did notpredict anxiety or depressive disorders; but it was similar to those otherdrugs in predicting antisocial personality disorder. The rates of disrup-tive disorders increased with increased drug use. Thus, heavy drug useamong adolescents can be a warning sign for later psychiatric disorders;whether it is an early manifestation of or a cause of those disorders re-mains to be determined. Psychiatric disorders are more prevalent among adolescents who use drugs \u2014including alcohol and nicotine \u2014than among those who do not. 79 Table 3.5 indicates that adolescent boys who smoke cigarettes daily are about 10 times as likely to have a psychiatric disorder diagnosis as thosewho do not smoke. However, the table does not compare intensity of useamong the different drug classes. Thus, although daily cigarette smoking among adolescent boys is more strongly associated with psychiatric dis-orders than is any use of illicit substances, it does not follow that thiscomparison is true for every amount of cigarette smoking. 79 Few marijuana users become dependent on it (Table 3.4), but those who do encounter problems similar to those associated with dependenceon other drugs. 19,143 Dependence appears to be less severe among people TABLE 3.5 Relative Prevalence of Diagnoses of Psychiatric Disorders Associated with Drug Use Among Childrena Relative Prevalence Estimatesb Drug Use Boys Girls Weekly alcohol use 6.1 1.6 (n.s.)

According to data collected in the early 1980s for thatstudy, 4.4% of adults have, at one time, met the criteria for marijuanadependence. In comparison, 13.8% of adults met the criteria for alcoholdependence and 36.0% for tobacco dependence. After alcohol and nico-tine, marijuana was the substance most frequently associated with a diag-nosis of substance dependence. In a 15-year study begun in 1979, 7.3% of 1,201 adolescents and young adults in suburban New Jersey at some time met the criteria for marijuanadependence; this indicates that the rate of marijuana dependence mightbe even higher in some groups of adolescents and young adults than inthe general population. 71 Adolescents meet the criteria for drug depen- dence at lower rates of marijuana use than do adults, and this suggeststhat they are more vulnerable to dependence than adults 25 (see Box 3.2). Youths who are already dependent on other substances are particu- larly vulnerable to marijuana dependence. For example, Crowley and co-workers 31 interviewed a group of 229 adolescent patients in a residential treatment program for delinquent, substance-involved youth and foundthat those patients were dependent on an average of 3.2 substances. Theadolescents had previously been diagnosed as dependent on at least onesubstance (including nicotine and alcohol) and had three or more conductdisorder symptoms during their life. About 83% of those who had usedmarijuana at least six times went on to develop marijuana dependence.About equal numbers of youths in the study had a diagnosis of marijuanadependence and a diagnosis of alcohol dependence; fewer were nicotinedependent. Comparisons of dependence potential between differentdrugs should be made cautiously. The probability that a particular drugwill be abused is influenced by many factors, including the specific drugeffects and availability of the drug. Although parents often state that marijuana caused their children to be rebellious, the troubled adolescents in the study by Crowley and co-workers developed conduct disorders before marijuana abuse. That is con- sistent with reports that the more symptoms of conduct disorders chil-dren have, the younger they begin drug abuse, 127 and that the earlier they begin drug use, the more likely it is to be followed by abuse or depen-dence. 125 Genetic factors are known to play a role in the likelihood of abuse forMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.98 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE drugs other than marijuana,7,129 and it is not unexpected that genetic fac- tors play a role in the marijuana experience, including the likelihood ofabuse. A study of over 8,000 male twins listed in the Vietnam Era TwinRegistry indicated that genes have a statistically significant influence onwhether a person finds the effects of marijuana pleasant. 97 Not surpris- ingly, people who found marijuana to be pleasurable used it more oftenthan those who found it unpleasant. The study suggested that, althoughsocial influences play an important role in the initiation of use, individualdifferences \u2014perhaps associated with the brain 's reward system \u2014influ- ence whether a person will continue using marijuana. Similar results werefound in a study of female twins. 86 Family and social environment strongly influenced the likelihood of ever using marijuana but had littleeffect on the likelihood of heavy use or abuse. The latter were more influ-enced by genetic factors. Those results are consistent with the finding thatthe degree to which rats find THC rewarding is genetically based. 92 In summary, although few marijuana users develop dependence, some do. But they appear to be less likely to do so than users of otherdrugs (including alcohol and nicotine), and marijuana dependenceappears to be less severe than dependence on other drugs. Drug depen-dence is more prevalent in some sectors of the population than others, butno group has been identified as particularly vulnerable to the drug-specific effects of marijuana. Adolescents, especially troubled ones, andpeople with psychiatric disorders (including substance abuse) appear tobe more likely than the general population to become dependent onmarijuana. If marijuana or cannabinoid drugs were approved for therapeutic uses, it would be important to consider the possibility of dependence,particularly for patients at high risk for substance dependence. Some con-trolled substances that are approved medications produce dependenceafter long-term use; this, however, is a normal part of patient manage-ment and does not generally present undue risk to the patient. Progression from Marijuana to Other Drugs The fear that marijuana use might cause, as opposed to merely pre- cede, the use of drugs that are more harmful is of great concern. To judgefrom comments submitted to the IOM study team, it appears to be ofgreater concern than the harms directly related to marijuana itself. Thediscussion that marijuana is a \"gateway \" drug implicitly recognizes that other illicit drugs might inflict greater damage to health or social relationsthan marijuana. Although the scientific literature generally discusses druguse progression between a variety of drug classes, including alcohol andtobacco, the public discussion has focused on marijuana as a \"gateway \"Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 99 drug that leads to abuse of more harmful illicit drugs, such as cocaine and heroin. There are strikingly regular patterns in the progression of drug use from adolescence to adulthood. Because it is the most widely used illicitdrug, marijuana is predictably the first illicit drug that most peopleencounter. Not surprisingly, most users of other illicit drugs used mari-juana first. 81,82 In fact, most drug users do not begin their drug use with marijuana \u2014they begin with alcohol and nicotine, usually when they are too young to do so legally.82,90 The gateway analogy evokes two ideas that are often confused. The first, more often referred to as the \"stepping stone \" hypothesis, is the idea that progression from marijuana to other drugs arises from pharmaco-logical properties of marijuana itself. 82 The second is that marijuana serves as a gateway to the world of illegal drugs in which youths have greateropportunity and are under greater social pressure to try other illegaldrugs. The latter interpretation is most often used in the scientific litera-ture, and it is supported, although not proven, by the available data. The stepping stone hypothesis applies to marijuana only in the broad- est sense. People who enjoy the effects of marijuana are, logically, morelikely to be willing to try other mood-altering drugs than are people whoare not willing to try marijuana or who dislike its effects. In other words,many of the factors associated with a willingness to use marijuana are,presumably, the same as those associated with a willingness to use otherillicit drugs. Those factors include physiological reactions to the drugeffect, which are consistent with the stepping stone hypothesis, but alsopsychosocial factors, which are independent of drug-specific effects. Thereis no evidence that marijuana serves as a stepping stone on the basis of itsparticular physiological effect. One might argue that marijuana is gener-ally used before other illicit mood-altering drugs, in part, because itseffects are milder; in that case, marijuana is a stepping stone only in thesame sense as taking a small dose of a particular drug and then increasingthat dose over time is a stepping stone to increased drug use. Whereas the stepping stone hypothesis presumes a predominantly physiological component of drug progression, the gateway theory is asocial theory. The latter does not suggest that the pharmacological quali-ties of marijuana make it a risk factor for progression to other drug use.Instead, the legal status of marijuana makes it a gateway drug. 82 Psychiatric disorders are associated with substance dependence and are probably risk factors for progression in drug use. For example, thetroubled adolescents studied by Crowley and co-workers 31 were depen- dent on an average of 3.2 substances, and this suggests that their conductdisorders were associated with increased risk of progressing from onedrug to another. Abuse of a single substance is probably also a risk factorMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.100 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE for later multiple drug use. For example, in a longitudinal study that examined drug use and dependence, about 26% of problem drinkersreported that they first used marijuana after the onset of alcohol-relatedproblems (R. Pandina, IOM workshop). The study also found that 11% ofmarijuana users developed chronic marijuana problems; most also hadalcohol problems. Intensity of drug use is an important risk factor in progression. Daily marijuana users are more likely than their peers to be extensive users ofother substances (for review, see Kandel and Davies 78). Of 34- to 35-year- old men who had used marijuana 10 -99 times by the age 24 -25, 75% never used any other illicit drug; 53% of those who had used it more than 100times did progress to using other illicit drugs 10 or more times. 78 Compa- rable proportions for women are 64% and 50%. The factors that best predict use of illicit drugs other than marijuana are probably the following: age of first alcohol or nicotine use, heavy mari-juana use, and psychiatric disorders. However, progression to illicit druguse is not synonymous with heavy or persistent drug use. Indeed, al-though the age of onset of use of licit drugs (alcohol and nicotine) predictslater illicit drug use, it does not appear to predict persistent or heavy use of illicit drugs. 90 Data on the gateway phenomenon are often overinterpreted. For example, one study reports that \"marijuana 's role as a gateway drug appears to have increased. \"55 It was a retrospective study based on inter- views of drug abusers who reported smoking crack or injecting heroindaily. The data from the study provide no indication of what proportionof marijuana users become serious drug abusers; rather, they indicate thatserious drug abusers usually use marijuana before they smoke crack orinject heroin. Only a small percentage of the adult population uses crackor heroin daily; during the five-year period from 1993 to 1997, an averageof three people per 1,000 used crack and about two per 1,000 used heroinin the preceding month. 132 Many of the data on which the gateway theory is based do not mea- sure dependence; instead, they measure use \u2014even once-only use. Thus, they show only that marijuana users are more likely to use other illicitdrugs (even if only once) than are people who never use marijuana, notthat they become dependent or even frequent users. The authors of thesestudies are careful to point out that their data should not be used as evi-dence of an inexorable causal progression; rather they note that identify- ing stage-based user groups makes it possible to identify the specific riskfactors that predict movement from one stage of drug use to the next \u2014the real issue in the gateway discussion. 25 In the sense that marijuana use typically precedes rather than follows initiation into the use of other illicit drugs, it is indeed a gateway drug.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 101 However, it does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse; that is, care must be taken not to attribute cause to association. Themost consistent predictors of serious drug use appear to be the intensityof marijuana use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders or a family his-tory of psychopathology (including alcoholism). 78,83 An important caution is that data on drug use progression pertain to nonmedical drug use. It does not follow from those data that if marijuana were available by prescription for medical use, the pattern of drug use would be the same. Kandel and co-workers also included nonmedical useof prescription psychoactive drugs in their study of drug use progres-sion. 82 In contrast with the use of alcohol, nicotine, and illicit drugs, there was not a clear and consistent sequence of drug use involving the abuseof prescription psychoactive drugs. The current data on drug use progres-sion neither support nor refute the suggestion that medical availabilitywould increase drug abuse among medical marijuana users. Whether themedical use of marijuana might encourage drug abuse among the generalcommunity \u2014not among medical marijuana users themselves but among others simply because of the fact that marijuana would be used for medi-cal purposes \u2014is another question. LINK BETWEEN MEDICAL USE AND DRUG ABUSE Almost everyone who spoke or wrote to the IOM study team about the potential harms posed by the medical use of marijuana felt that itwould send the wrong message to children and teenagers. They statedthat information about the harms caused by marijuana is undermined byclaims that marijuana might have medical value. Yet many of our power-ful medicines are also dangerous medicines. These two facets of medi-cine\u2014effectiveness and risk \u2014are inextricably linked. The question here is not whether marijuana can be both harmful and helpful but whether the perception of its benefits will increase its abuse.For now any answer to the question remains conjecture. Because mari-juana is not an approved medicine, there is little information about theconsequences of its medical use in modern society. Reasonable inferencesmight be drawn from some examples. Opiates, such as morphine andcodeine, are an example of a class of drugs that is both abused to greatharm and used to great medical benefit, and it would be useful to exam-ine the relationship between their medical use and their abuse. In a \"natu- ral experiment \" during 1973 -1978 some states decriminalized marijuana, and others did not. Finally, one can examine the short-term consequencesof the publicity surrounding the 1996 medical marijuana campaign in Cali-fornia and ask whether it had any measurable impact on marijuana con-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.102 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE sumption among youth in California; the consequences of \"message \" that marijuana might have medical use are examined below. Medical Use and Abuse of Opiates Two highly influential papers published in the 1920s and 1950s led to widespread concern among physicians and medical licensing boards thatliberal use of opiates would result in many addicts (reviewed by Moulinand co-workers 106 in 1996). Such fears have proven unfounded; it is now recognized that fear of producing addicts through medical treatmentresulted in needless suffering among patients with pain as physiciansneedlessly limited appropriate doses of medications. 27,44 Few people begin their drug addiction problems with misuse of drugs that have been pre-scribed for medical use. 114 Opiates are carefully regulated in the medical setting, and diversion of medically prescribed opiates to the black marketis not generally considered to be a major problem. No evidence suggests that the use of opiates or cocaine for medical purposes has increased the perception that their illicit use is safe oracceptable. Clearly, there are risks that patients will abuse marijuana forits psychoactive effects and some likelihood of diversion of marijuanafrom legitimate medical channels into the illicit market. But those risks donot differentiate marijuana from many accepted medications that areabused by some patients or diverted from medical channels for non-medical use. Medications with abuse potential are placed in Schedule II ofthe Controlled Substances Act, which brings them under stricter control,including quotas on the amount that can be legally manufactured (seechapter 5 for discussion of the Controlled Substances Act). That schedul-ing also signals to physicians that a drug has abuse potential and that theyshould monitor its use by patients who could be at risk for drug abuse. Marijuana Decriminalization Monitoring the Future, the annual survey of values and lifestyles of high school seniors, revealed that high school seniors in decriminalizedstates reported using no more marijuana than did their counterparts instates where marijuana was not decriminalized. 72 Another study reported somewhat conflicting evidence indicating that decriminalization hadincreased marijuana use. 105 That study used data from the Drug Aware- ness Warning Network (DAWN), which has collected data on drug-related emergency room (ER) cases since 1975. There was a greater in-crease from 1975 to 1978 in the proportion of ER patients who had usedmarijuana in states that had decriminalized marijuana in 1975 -1976 than in states that had not decriminalized it (Table 3.6). Despite the greaterMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 103 increase among decriminalized states, the proportion of marijuana users among ER patients by 1978 was about equal in states that had and statesthat had not decriminalized marijuana. That is because the non-decrimi-nalized states had higher rates of marijuana use before decriminalization. In contrast with marijuana use, rates of other illicit drug use among ERpatients were substantially higher in states that did not decriminalizemarijuana use. Thus, there are different possible reasons for the greaterincrease in marijuana use in the decriminalized states. On the one hand,decriminalization might have led to an increased use of marijuana (at leastamong people who sought health care in hospital ERs). On the other hand,the lack of decriminalization might have encouraged greater use of drugsthat are even more dangerous than marijuana. The differences between the results for high school seniors from the Monitoring the Future study and the DAWN data are unclear, althoughthe author of the latter study suggests that the reasons might lie in limita-tions inherent in how the DAWN data are collected. 105 In 1976, the Netherlands adopted a policy of toleration for possession of up to 30 g of marijuana. There was little change in marijuana use dur-ing the seven years after the policy change, which suggests that the changeitself had little effect; however, in 1984, when Dutch \"coffee shops \" that sold marijuana commercially spread throughout Amsterdam, marijuanaTABLE 3.6 Effect of Decriminalization on Marijuana Use in Emergency Room (ER) Cases Total Reports of Drug Use per ERa States That States That Did Not Decriminalized Decriminalize PeriodbMarijuana Marijuana Marijuana use 1975 0.8 1.5 1978 2.7 2.5 Other drug use 1975 47 55 1978 55 70 aData are based on patient self-reports. bStates that decriminalized marijuana did so after 1975 and before 1978. The 1975 values reflect ER marijuana reports before or in the first months of decriminalization, whereas 1978 values reflect ER reports when decriminalization laws had been in effect at least a year. The 1978 levels are median values for quarters in 1978 and are derived from Figures 1 and 2 inModel (1993). 105 SOURCE: Adapted from Figures 1 and 2 in Model (1993).105Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.104 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE use began to increase.98 During the 1990s, marijuana use has continued to increase in the Netherlands at the same rate as in the United States andNorway \u2014two countries that strictly forbid marijuana sale and posses- sion. Furthermore, during this period, approximately equal percentagesof American and Dutch 18 year olds used marijuana; Norwegian 18 yearolds were about half as likely to have used marijuana. The authors of thisstudy conclude that there is little evidence that the Dutch marijuanadepenalization policy led to increased marijuana use, although they notethat commercialization of marijuana might have contributed to its in-creased use. Thus, there is little evidence that decriminalization of mari-juana use necessarily leads to a substantial increase in marijuana use. The Medical Marijuana Debate The most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that among people 12 -17 years old the perceived risk associated with smoking marijuana once or twice a week had decreased significantly be-tween 1996 and 1997. 132 (Perceived risk is measured as the percentage of survey respondents who report that they \"perceive great risk of harm \" in using a drug at a specified frequency.) At first glance, that might seem tovalidate the fear that the medical marijuana debate of 1996 \u2014before pas- sage of the California medical marijuana referendum in November 1997 \u2014 had sent a message that marijuana use is safe. But a closer analysis of thedata shows that Californian youth were an exception to the national trend.In contrast to the national trend, the perceived risk of marijuana use didnot change among California youth between 1996 and 1997. 132* In sum- mary, there is no evidence that the medical marijuana debate has alteredadolescents ' perceptions of the risks associated with marijuana use. 132 PSYCHOLOGICAL HARMS In assessing the relative risks and benefits related to the medical use of marijuana, the psychological effects of marijuana can be viewed both asunwanted side effects and as potentially desirable end points in medicaltreatment. However, the vast majority of research on the psychologicaleffects of marijuana has been in the context of assessing the drug 's intoxi- cating effects when it is used for nonmedical purposes. Thus, the litera- *Although Arizona also passed a medical marijuana referendum, it was embedded in a broader referendum concerning prison sentencing. Hence, the debate in Arizona did not focus on medical marijuana the way it did in California, and changes in Arizona youths ' attitudes likely reflect factors peripheral to medical marijuana.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 105 ture does not directly address the effects of marijuana taken for medical purposes. There are some important caveats to consider in attempting to extrapolate from the research mentioned above to the medical use ofmarijuana. The circumstances under which psychoactive drugs are takenare an important influence on their psychological effects. Furthermore,research protocols to study marijuana 's psychological effects in most instances were required to use participants who already had experiencewith marijuana. People who might have had adverse reactions to mari-juana either would choose not to participate in this type of study or wouldbe screened out by the investigator. Therefore, the incidence of adversereactions to marijuana that might occur in people with no marijuanaexperience cannot be estimated from such studies. A further complicatingfactor concerns the dose regimen used for laboratory studies. In mostinstances, laboratory research studies have looked at the effects of singledoses of marijuana, which might be different from those observed whenthe drug is taken repeatedly for a chronic medical condition. Nonetheless, laboratory studies are useful in suggesting what psy- chological functions might be studied when marijuana is evaluated formedical purposes. Results of laboratory studies indicate that acute andchronic marijuana use has pronounced effects on mood, psychomotor,and cognitive functions. These psychological domains should thereforebe considered in assessing the relative risks and therapeutic benefits re-lated to marijuana or cannabinoids for any medical condition. Psychiatric Disorders A major question remains as to whether marijuana can produce last- ing mood disorders or psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia.Georgotas and Zeidenberg 52 reported that smoking 10 -22 marijuana ciga- rettes per day was associated with a gradual waning of the positive moodand social facilitating effects of marijuana and an increase in irritability,social isolation, and paranoid thinking. Inasmuch as smoking one ciga- rette is enough to make a person feel \"high \" for about 1 -3 hours, 68,95,118 the subjects in that study were taking very high doses of marijuana. Reports have described the development of apathy, lowered motivation,and impaired educational performance in heavy marijuana users who donot appear to be behaviorally impaired in other ways. 121,122 There are clini- cal reports of marijuana-induced psychosis-like states (schizophrenia-like,depression, and/or mania) lasting for a week or more. 112 Hollister sug- gests that, because of the varied nature of the psychotic states induced bymarijuana, there is no specific \"marijuana psychosis. \" Rather, the mari- juana experience might trigger latent psychopathology of many types. 66Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.106 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE More recently, Hall and colleagues60 concluded that \"there is reasonable evidence that heavy cannabis use, and perhaps acute use in sensitive indi-viduals, can produce an acute psychosis in which confusion, amnesia,delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation and hypomanic symptomspredominate. \" Regardless of which of those interpretations is correct, the two reports agree that there is little evidence that marijuana alone pro-duces a psychosis that persists after the period of intoxication. Schizophrenia The association between marijuana and schizophrenia is not well understood. The scientific literature indicates general agreement thatheavy marijuana use can precipitate schizophrenic episodes but not thatmarijuana use can cause the underlying psychotic disorder. 59,96,151 As noted earlier, drug abuse is common among people with psychiatricdisorders. Estimates of the prevalence of marijuana use among schizo-phrenics vary considerably but are in general agreement that it is at leastas great as that among the general population. 134 Schizophrenics prefer the effects of marijuana to those of alcohol and cocaine,35 which they seem to use less often than does the general population.134 The reasons for this are unknown, but it raises the possibility that schizophrenics might obtainsome symptomatic relief from moderate marijuana use. But overall, com-pared with the general population, people with schizophrenia or with afamily history of schizophrenia are likely to be at greater risk for adversepsychiatric effects from the use of cannabinoids. Cognition As gators to measure the acute effects of marijuana smoking on active brainfunction. Human volunteers who perform auditory attention tasks beforeand after smoking a marijuana cigarette show impaired performancewhile under the influence of marijuana; this is associated with substantialreduction in blood flow to the temporal lobe of the brain, an area that issensitive to such tasks. 116,117 Marijuana smoking increases blood flow in other brain regions, such as the frontal lobes and lateral cerebellum.101,155 Earlier studies purporting to show structural changes in the brains ofheavy marijuana users 22 have not been replicated with more sophisticated techniques.28,89 Nevertheless, recent studies14,122 have found subtle defects in cogni- tive tasks in heavy marijuana users after a brief period (19 -24 hours) of marijuana abstinence. Longer term cognitive deficits in heavy marijuanaMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 107 users have also been reported.140 Although these studies have attempted to match heavy marijuana users with subjects of similar cognitive abilitiesbefore exposure to marijuana use, the adequacy of this matching has beenquestioned. 133 The complex methodological issues facing research in this area are well reviewed in an article by Pope and colleagues.121 Care must be exercised so that studies are designed to differentiate between changesin brain function caused the effects of marijuana and by the illness forwhich marijuana is being given. AIDS dementia is an obvious example ofthis possible confusion. It is also important to determine whether repeateduse of marijuana at therapeutic dosages produces any irreversible cogni-tive effects. Psychomotor Performance Marijuana administration has been reported to affect psychomotor performance on a number of tasks. The review by Chait and Pierri 23 not only details the studies that have been done but also points out the incon-sistencies among studies, the methodological shortcomings of many stud-ies, and the large individual differences among the studies attributable tosubject, situational, and methodological factors. Those factors must beconsidered in studies of psychomotor performance when participants areinvolved in a clinical trial of the efficacy of marijuana. The types of psy-chomotor functions that have been shown to be disrupted by the acuteadministration of marijuana include body sway, hand steadiness, rotarypursuit, driving and flying simulation, divided attention, sustained atten-tion, and the digit-symbol substitution test. A study of experienced air-plane pilots showed that even 24 hours after a single marijuana cigarettetheir performance on flight simulator tests was impaired. 163 Before the tests, however, they told the study investigators that they were sure theirperformance would be unaffected. Cognitive impairments associated with acutely administered mari- juana limit the activities that people would be able to do safely or produc-tively. For example, no one under the influence of marijuana or THCshould drive a vehicle or operate potentially dangerous equipment. Amotivational Syndrome One of the more controversial effects claimed for marijuana is the pro- duction of an \"amotivational syndrome. \" This syndrome is not a medical diagnosis, but it has been used to describe young people who drop out ofsocial activities and show little interest in school, work, or other goal-directed activity. When heavy marijuana use accompanies these symp-toms, the drug is often cited as the cause, but no convincing data demon-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.108 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE strate a causal relationship between marijuana smoking and these behav- ioral characteristics.23 It is not enough to observe that a chronic marijuana user lacks motivation. Instead, relevant personality traits and behavior ofsubjects must be assessed before and after the subject becomes a heavymarijuana user. Because such research can only be done on subjects whobecome heavy marijuana users on their own, a large population study \u2014 such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area study described earlier inthis chapter \u2014would be needed to shed light on the relationship between motivation and marijuana use. Even then, although a causal relationshipbetween the two could, in theory, be dismissed by an epidemiologicalstudy, causality could not be proven. Summary Measures of mood, cognition, and psychomotor performance should be incorporated into clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of marijuana orcannabinoid drugs for a given medical condition. Ideally, participantswould complete mood assessment questionnaires at various intervalsthroughout the day for a period before; every week during; and, whereappropriate, after marijuana therapy. A full psychological screening ofresearch participants should be conducted to determine whether there isan interaction between the mood-altering effects of chronic marijuana useand the psychological characteristics of the subjects. Similarly, the cogni-tive and psychomotor functioning should be assessed before and regu-larly during the course of a chronic regimen of marijuana or cannabinoidtreatment to determine the extent to which tolerance to the impairingeffects of marijuana develops and to monitor whether new problemsdevelop. When compared with changes produced by either placebo or an active control medication, the magnitude of desirable therapeutic effects and thefrequency and magnitude of adverse psychological side effects of mari-juana could be determined. That would allow a more thorough assess-ment of the risk:benefit ratio associated with the use of marijuana for agiven indication. C ONCLUSION : The psychological effects of cannabinoids, such as anxiety reduction, sedation, and euphoria, can influence their po-tential therapeutic value. Those effects are potentially undesir-able in some patients and situations and beneficial in others. Inaddition, psychological effects can complicate the interpretationof other aspects of the drug 's effect.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 109 RECOMMENDATION : Psychological effects of cannabinoids, such as anxiety reduction and sedation, which can influence medicalbenefits, should be evaluated in clinical trials. PHYSIOLOGICAL HARMS: TISSUE AND ORGAN DAMAGE Many people who spoke to the IOM study team in favor of the medi- cal use of marijuana cited the absence of marijuana overdoses as evidencethat it is safe. Indeed, epidemiological data indicate that in the generalpopulation marijuana use is not associated with increased mortality. 138 However, other serious health outcomes should be considered, and theyare discussed below. It is important to keep in mind that most of the studies that report physiological harm resulting from marijuana use are based on the effectsof marijuana smoking. Thus, we emphasize that the effects reported can-not be presumed to be caused by THC alone or even in combination withother cannabinoids found in marijuana. It is likely that smoke is a majorcause of the reported effects. In most studies the methods used make itimpossible to weigh the relative contributions of smoke versus cannab-inoids. Immune System The relationship between marijuana and the immune system presents many facets, including potential benefits and suspected harms. This sec-tion reviews the evidence on suspected harms to the immune systemcaused by marijuana use. Despite the many claims that marijuana suppresses the human im- mune system, the health effects of marijuana-induced immunomodulationare still unclear. Few studies have been done with animals or humans toassess the effects of marijuana exposure on host resistance to bacteria,viruses, or tumors. Human Studies Several approaches have been used to determine the effects of mari- juana on the human immune system. Each has serious limitations, whichare discussed below. Assays of Leukocytes from Marijuana Smokers. One of the more com- mon approaches has been to isolate peripheral blood leukocytes frompeople who have smoked marijuana in order to evaluate the immuneMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.110 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE response of those cells in vitro \u2014most often by measuring mitogen- induced cell proliferation, a normal immune response. Almost withoutexception, this approach has failed to demonstrate any reduction in leu-kocyte function. The major problem with the approach is that after bloodsamples are drawn from the study subjects the leukocytes must be isolatedfrom whole blood before they are tested. That is done by high-speed cen-trifugation followed by extensive washing of the cells, which removes thecannabinoid; perhaps for this reason no adverse effects have been demon-strated in peripheral blood leukocytes from marijuana smokers. 75,91,123,160 Leukocyte Responses to THC. Another approach is to isolate peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy control subjects who do not smoke mari-juana and then to measure the effect of THC on the ability of these cells toproliferate in response to mitogenic stimulation in vitro . One important difference between leukocytes isolated from a marijuana smoker, asdescribed above, and leukocyte cell cultures to which THC has been addeddirectly is in the cannabinoid composition. Marijuana smoke containsmany distinct cannabinoid compounds of which THC is just one. More-over, the immunomodulatory activity of many of the other cannabinoidcompounds has never been tested, and it is now known that at least one ofthose \u2014cannabinol (CBN) \u2014has greater activity on the immune system than on the central nervous system, 64 so it is unclear whether the profile of activity observed with THC accurately represents the effects of mari-juana smoke on immune competence. Likewise, the extent to whichdifferent cannabinoids in combination exhibit additive, synergistic, orantagonistic effects with respect to immunomodulatory activity is unclear.The issue is complicated by the fact that leukocytes express both types ofcannabinoid receptors: CB 1 and CB2. An additional factor that might affect the immunomodulatory activ- ity of cannabinoids in leukocytes is verylow levels of the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, 20 so the metabolism of cannabinoids is probably different between in vivo and in vitro exposure. That last point is pertinent primarily to investigations of chronic, not acute, cannabinoid exposure. Human-Derived Cell Lines. A third approach for investigating the effects of cannabinoids on human leukocytes has been to study human-derivedcell lines.* As described above, the cell lines are treated in vitro with can- nabinoids to test their responses to different stimuli. Although cell lines *Cell lines are created by removing cells from an organism and then treating them so they are \"immortalized, \" meaning they will continue to divide and multiply indefinitely in cul- ture. Cellular processes can then be studied in isolation from their original source.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 111 are a convenient source of human cells, the problems described above apply here as well. In addition, the cell lines might not be the same as theoriginal cells. For example, cell lines do not necessarily have the samenumber of cannabinoid receptors as the original human cells. Rodent Studies The most widely used approach is to evaluate the effects of cannab- inoids in rodents, using rodent-derived cells in vitro . The rationale is that the human and rodent immune systems are remarkably similar, and it isassumed that the effects produced by cannabinoids on the rodent immunesystem will be similar to those produced in humans. Although no sub-stantial species differences in immune system sensitivity to cannabinoidshave been reported, the possibility should be considered. Summary The complete effect of marijuana smoking on immune function remains unknown. More important, it is not known whether smokingleads to increased rates of infections, tumors, allergies, or autoimmuneresponses. The problem is how to duplicate the \"normal \" marijuana smok- ing pattern while removing other potential immunomodulating lifestylefactors, such as alcohol and tobacco use. Epidemiological studies areneeded to determine whether marijuana users have a higher incidence ofsuch diseases, as infections, tumors, allergies, and autoimmune diseases.Studies on resistance to bacterial and viral infection are clearly neededand should involve the collaboration of immunologists, infectious diseasespecialists, oncologists, and pharmacologists. Marijuana Smoke Tobacco is the predominant cause of such lung diseases as cancer and emphysema, and marijuana smoke contains many of the components oftobacco smoke. 69 Thus, it is important to consider the relationship be- tween habitual marijuana smoking and some lung diseases. Given a cigarette of comparable weight, as much as four times the amount of tar can be deposited in the lungs of marijuana smokers as inthe lungs of tobacco smokers. 162 The difference is due primarily to the differences in filtration and smoking technique between tobacco and mari-juana smokers. Marijuana cigarettes usually do not have filters, and mari-juana smokers typically develop a larger puff volume, inhale more deeply,and hold their breath several times longer than tobacco smokers. 119 How- ever, a marijuana cigarette smoked recreationally typically is not packedMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In addition, tobacco smokers generally smokeconsiderably more cigarettes per day than do marijuana smokers. Cellular Damage Lymphocytes: T and B Cells. Human studies of the effect of marijuana smoking on immune cell function are not all consistent with cannabinoidcell culture and animal studies. For example, antibody production wasdecreased in a group of hospitalized patients who smoked marijuana forfour days (12 cigarettes/day), but the decrease was seen in only one sub-type of humoral antibody (IgG), whereas two other subtypes (IgA andIgM) remained normal and one (IgE) was increased. 108 In addition, T cell proliferation was normal in the blood of a group of marijuana smokers,although closer evaluation showed an increase in one subset of T cells 161 and a decrease in a different subset (CD8).157 It appears that marijuana use is associated with intermittent disturbances in T and B cell function,but the magnitude is small and other measures are often normal. 87 Macrophages. Alveolar macrophages are the principal immune-effector cells in the lung and are primarily responsible for protecting the lungagainst infectious microorganisms, inhaled foreign substances, and tumorcells. They are increased during tissue inflammation. In a large sample ofvolunteers, habitual marijuana smokers had twice as many alveolar mac-rophages as nonsmokers, and smokers of both marijuana and tobacco hadtwice as many again. 11 Marijuana smoking also reduced the ability of alveolar macrophages to kill fungi, such as Candida albicans ;* pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus ; and tumor target cells. The reduc- tion in ability to destroy fungal organisms was similar to that seen intobacco smokers. The inability to kill pathogenic bacteria was not seen intobacco smokers. 10 Furthermore, marijuana smoking depressed produc- tion of ofimmunosuppressive cytokines. 10 Cytokines are important regulators of macrophage function, so this marijuana-related decrease in inflammatorycytokine production might be a mechanism whereby marijuana smokersare less able to destroy fungal and bacterial organisms, as well as tumorcells. The inability of alveolar macrophages from habitual marijuana smok- ers without apparent disease to destroy fungi, bacteria, and tumor cells *Candida albicans is a yeast infection that is particularly prevalent among people whose immune systems are suppressed, such as in AIDS patients.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 113 and to release proinflammatory cytokines, suggests that marijuana might be an immunosuppressant with clinically significant effects on host de-fense. Therefore, the risks of smoking marijuana should be seriouslyweighed before recommending its use in any patient with preexistingimmune deficits \u2014including AIDS patients, cancer patients, and those receiving immunosuppressive therapies (for example, transplant or cancerpatients). Bronchial and Pulmonary Damage Animal Studies. A number of animal studies have revealed respiratory tract changes and diseases associated with marijuana smoking, but othershave not. Extensive damage to the smaller airways, which are the majorsite of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),* and acute andchronic pneumonia have been observed in various species exposed to dif-ferent doses of marijuana smoke. 41,42,128 In contrast, rats exposed to increasing doses of marijuana smoke for one year did not show any signsof COPD, whereas rats exposed to tobacco smoke did. 67 Chronic Bronchitis and Respiratory Illness. Results of human studies suggest that there is a greater chance of respiratory illness in people whosmoke marijuana. In a survey of outpatient medical visits at a large healthmaintenance organization (HMO), marijuana users were more likely toseek help for respiratory illnesses than people who smoked neither mari-juana or tobacco. 120 However, the incidence of seeking help for respira- tory illnesses was not higher in those who smoked marijuana for 10 yearsor more than in those who smoked for less than 10 years. One explanationfor this is that people who experience respiratory symptoms are morelikely to quit smoking and that people who continue to smoke constitute aset of survivors who do not develop or are indifferent to such symptoms.One limitation of this study is that no data were available on the use ofcocaine, which when used with marijuana could contribute to the ob-served differences. Another limitation is that the survey relied on self-reporting; tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use might have been under-reported (S. Sidney, IOM workshop). When marijuana smokers were compared with nonsmokers and to- bacco smokers in a group of 446 volunteers, 15 -20% of the marijuana smokers reported symptoms of chronic bronchitis, including chronic *COPD is a slow progressive obstruction of the airways, loss of their elasticity, and loss of lung volume, characterized by chronic shortness of breath, chronic bronchitis, and reduced oxygenation of blood.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.114 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE cough and phlegm production,146 and 20 -25% of the tobacco smokers re- ported symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Despite a marked disparity in theamount of each substance smoked per day (three or four joints of mari-juana versus more than 20 cigarettes of tobacco), the difference in the per-centages of tobacco smokers and marijuana smokers experiencing symp-toms of chronic bronchitis was statistically insignificant. 146 Similar findings were reported by Bloom and co-workers,15 who noted an addi- tive effect of smoking both marijuana and tobacco. Bronchial Tissue Changes. Habitual marijuana smoking is associated with changes in the lining of the human respiratory tract. Many mari-juana or tobacco smokers have increased redness (erythema) and swell-ing (edema) of the airway tissues and increased mucous secretions. 43,56 In marijuana smokers the number and size of small blood vessels in the bron-chial wall are increased, tissue edema is present, and the normal ciliatedcells* lining the inner surface of the bronchial wall are largely replaced bymucous-secreting goblet cells. The damage is greater in people who smokeboth marijuana and tobacco. 130 Overproduction of mucus by the increased numbers of mucous-secreting cells in the presence of decreased numbersof ciliated cells tends to leave coughing as the only major mechanism toremove mucus from the airways; this might explain the relatively highproportion of marijuana smokers who complain of chronic cough andphlegm production. 148 A 1998 study has shown that both marijuana and tobacco smokers have significantly more cellular and molecular abnormalities in bronchialepithelium cells than nonsmokers; these changes are associated with in-creased risk of cancer. 12 The tobacco-only smokers in that study smoked an average of 25 cigarettes per day, whereas the marijuana-only smokerssmoked an average of 21 marijuana cigarettes per week. Although themarijuana smokers smoked far fewer cigarettes, their cellular abnormali-ties were equivalent to or greater than those seen in tobacco smokers. Thisand earlier studies have shown that such abnormalities are greatest inpeople who smoke both marijuana and tobacco; hence, marijuanaand tobacco smoke might have additive effects on airway tissue. 12,43,56 Tenant150 found similar results in U.S. servicemen who suffered from res- piratory symptoms and were heavy hashish smokers.

There is conflicting evidence on whether regular marijuana use harms the small airways of the lungs. Bloom and co-workers found that an aver-age of one joint smoked per day significantly impaired the function ofsmall airways. 15 But Tashkin and co-workers146 did not observe such damage among heavier marijuana users (three to four joints per day for atleast 10 years), although they noted a narrowing of large central airways.Tashkin and co-workers ' long-term study, which adjusted for age-related decline in lung function (associated with an increased risk for developingCOPD), showed an accelerated rate of decline in tobacco smokers but notin marijuana smokers. 147 Thus, the question of whether usual marijuana smoking habits are enough to cause COPD remains open. Conclusion. Chronic marijuana smoking might lead to acute and chronic bronchitis and extensive microscopic abnormalities in the cells lining thebronchial passageways, some of which may be premalignant. These res-piratory symptoms are similar to those of tobacco smokers, and the com-bination of marijuana and tobacco smoking augments these effects. At thetime of this writing, it had not been established whether chronic smokingmarijuana causes COPD, but there is probably an association. HIV/AIDS Patients The relationship between marijuana smoking and the natural course of AIDS is of particular concern because HIV patients are the largest groupwho report using marijuana for medical purposes. Marijuana use has beenlinked both to increased risk of progression to AIDS in HIV-seropositivepatients and to increased mortality in AIDS patients. For unknown reasons, marijuana use is associated with increased mortality among men with AIDS but not among the general population. 138 (The relative risk of AIDS mortality for current marijuana users in this 12-year study was 1.90, indicating that almost twice as many marijuana usersdied of AIDS as did noncurrent marijuana users.) Never-married menused twice as much marijuana as married men and accounted for 83% ofthe AIDS deaths in the study. The authors of the study note that, whilemarital status is insufficient to adjust for lifestyle factors \u2014particularly, homosexual behavior \u2014a substantial proportion of the never-married men with AIDS were probably homosexuals or bisexuals. That raises the pos-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.116 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE sibility that the association of marijuana use with AIDS deaths might be related to indirect factors, such as use of other drugs or high-risk sexualbehavior, both of which increase risks of infection to which AIDS patientsare more susceptible. The higher mortality of AIDS patients who werecurrent marijuana users also raises the question of whether this was be-cause patients increased their use of marijuana at the endstages of thedisease to treat their symptoms. However, the association between mari-juana use and AIDS deaths was similar even when the subjects who diedearliest in the first five years of this 12-year study, and who were presum-ably the most sick, were excluded from the analysis. In summary, it ispremature to conclude what the underlying causes of this associationmight be. For the general population, the mortality associated with marijuana use was lower than that associated with cigarette smoking, and tobaccosmoking was not an independent risk factor in AIDS mortality. Theauthors of the study described above concluded that therapeutic use ofmarijuana did not contribute to the increased mortality among men withAIDS. Marijuana use has been associated with a higher prevalence of HIV seropositivity in cross-sectional studies, 84 but the relationship of mari- juana to the progression to AIDS in HIV-seropositive patients is a reason-able question. It remains unclear whether marijuana smoking is an inde-pendent risk factor in the progression of AIDS in HIV-seropositive men.Marijuana use did not increase the risk of AIDS in HIV-seropositive menin the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, in which 1,795 HIV-seropositivemen were studied for 18 months, 84 or in the San Francisco Men 's Health Study, in which 451 HIV-seropositive men were studied for six years.34 In contrast, the Sydney AIDS Project in Australia, in which 386 HIV-sero-positive men were studied for 12 months, 152 reported that marijuana use was associated with increased risk of progression to AIDS. The results ofthe Sydney study are less reliable than those of the other two studiesnoted; it was the shortest of the studies and, according to the 1993 defini-tion of AIDS, many of the subjects probably already had AIDS at thebeginning of the study.* The most compelling concerns regarding marijuana smoking in HIV/ AIDS patients are the possible effects of marijuana on immunity. 111 Re- ports of opportunistic fungal and bacterial pneumonia in AIDS patientswho used marijuana suggest that marijuana smoking either suppressesthe immune system 33 or exposes patients to an added burden of patho- *In 1993 the diagnosis of AIDS was expanded to include anyone with a CD4 count of less than 200.

All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 117 gens.21 In summary, patients with preexisting immune deficits due to AIDS should be expected to be vulnerable to serious harm caused bysmoking marijuana. The relative contribution of marijuana smoke versusTHC or other cannabinoids is not known. Carcinogenicity The gas and tar phases of marijuana and tobacco smoke contain many of the same compounds. Furthermore, the tar phase of marijuana smokecontains higher concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs), such as the carcinogen benzopyrene. The higher content of carci-nogenic PAHs in marijuana tar and the greater deposition of this tar in thelung might act in conjunction to amplify the exposure of a marijuanasmoker to carcinogens. For those reasons the carcinogenicity of marijuanasmoke is an important concern. It is more difficult to collect the epidemiological data necessary to establish or refute the link between marijuana smoke and cancer than thatbetween tobacco smoke and cancer. Far fewer people smoke only mari-juana than only tobacco, and marijuana smokers are more likely to under-report their smoking. Case Studies. Results of several case series suggest that marijuana might play a role in the development of human respiratory cancer. Reports indi-cate an unexpectedly large proportion of marijuana users among peoplewith lung cancer 141,149 and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract \u2014that is, the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus \u2014that occur before the age of 45.36,39,149 Respiratory tract cancers associated with heavy tobacco and alcohol consumption are not usually seen before the age of 60,154 and the occurrence of such cancers in marijuana users younger than 60 sug-gests that long-term marijuana smoking potentiates the effects of otherrisk factors, such as tobacco smoking, and is a more potent risk factor thantobacco and alcohol use in the early development of respiratory cancers.Most studies lack the necessary comparison groups to calculate the iso-lated effect of marijuana use on cancer risk. Many marijuana smokers alsosmoke tobacco, so when studies lack information regarding cigarettesmoking status, there is no way to separate the effects of marijuana smokeand tobacco smoke. Epidemiological Evidence. As of this writing, Sidney and co-workers 139 had conducted the only epidemiological study to evaluate the association between marijuana use and cancer. The study included a cohort of about65,000 men and women 15 -49 years old. Marijuana users were defined as those who had used marijuana on six or more occasions. Among the 1,421Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.118 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE cases of cancer in this cohort, marijuana use was associated only with an increased risk of prostate cancer in men who did not smoke tobacco. Inthese relatively young HMO clients, no association was found betweenmarijuana use and other cancers, including all tobacco-related cancers,colorectal cancer, and melanoma. The major limitation associated withinterpreting this study is that the development of lung cancer requires along exposure to smoking, and most marijuana users quit before this levelof exposure is achieved. In addition, marijuana use has been widespreadin the United States only since the late 1960s; therefore, despite the largecohort size there might not have been a sufficient number of heavy orlong-term marijuana smokers to reveal an effect. Cellular and Molecular Studies. In contrast with clinical studies, cellular and molecular studies have provided strong evidence that marijuanasmoke is carcinogenic. Cell culture studies implicate marijuana smoke inthe development of cancer. Prolonged exposure of hamster lung cell cul-tures to marijuana smoke led to malignant transformations, 94 and expo- sure of human lung explants to marijuana smoke resulted in chromosomaland DNA alterations. 154 The tar from marijuana smoke also induced mutations similar to those produced by tar from the same quantity oftobacco in a common bacterial assay for mutagenicity. 158 Molecular studies also implicate marijuana smoke as a carcinogen. Proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are a group of genes thataffect cell growth and differentiation. Normally, they code for proteinsthat control cellular proliferation. Once mutated or activated, they pro-duce proteins that cause cells to multiply rapidly and out of control, andthis results in tumors or cancer.* When the production of these proteinswas evaluated in tissue biopsies taken from marijuana, tobacco, and mari-juana plus tobacco smokers, and nonsmokers, two of them (EGFR and Ki-67) were markedly higher in the marijuana smokers than in the non-smokers and the tobacco smokers. Moreover, the effects of marijuana andtobacco were additive. 131 Thus, in relatively young smokers of marijuana, particularly those who smoke both marijuana and tobacco, marijuana isimplicated as a risk factor for lung cancer. DNA alterations are known to be early events in the development of cancer, and have been observed in the lymphocytes of pregnant mari-juana smokers and in those of their newborns. 4 This is an important study *Some of the genes involved in the development of lung cancer include those that encode for Ki-67 (a nuclear proliferation protein responsible for cell division), the p53 tumor sup-pressor (a protein that normally suppresses cell growth), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (a receptor found on a variety of cell types, especially epithelial cells, that promotes cellular growth and proliferation when bound to epidermal growth factor).Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 119 because the investigators were careful to exclude tobacco smokers \u2014a problem in previous studies that cited mutagenic effects of marijuanasmoke. 26,53,63,142 The same investigators found similar effects in previous studies among tobacco smokers,5,6 so the effects cannot be attributed solely to THC or other cannabinoids. Although it can be determined onlyby experiment, it is likely that the smoke contents \u2014other than cannab- inoids \u2014are responsible for a large part of the mutagenic effect. Preliminary findings suggest that marijuana smoke activates cyto- ]pyrene, into active carcinogens. 99 Bronchial epithelial cells in tissue biopsies taken from marijuana smokers show more binding toCYP1A1 antibodies than do comparable cells in biopsies from nonsmok-ers (D. Tashkin, IOM workshop). That suggests that there is more ofCYP1A1 itself in the bronchial cells of marijuana smokers, but differentexperimental methods will be needed to establish that possibility. Conclusions There is no conclusive evidence that marijuana causes cancer in humans, including cancers usually related to tobacco use. However,cellular, genetic, and human studies all suggest that marijuana smoke isan important risk factor for the development of respiratory cancer. Moredefinitive evidence that habitual marijuana smoking leads or does notlead to respiratory cancer awaits the results of well-designed case controlepidemiological studies. It has been 30 years since the initiation of wide-spread marijuana use among young people in our society, and such stud-ies should now be feasible. The following studies or activities would be useful in providing data that could more precisely define the health risks of smoking marijuana. 1. Case control studies to determine whether marijuana use is asso- ciated with an increased risk of respiratory cancer. Despite the lack of compelling epidemiological evidence, findings from the biochemical, cel-lular, immunological, genetic, tissue, and animal studies cited abovestrongly suggest that marijuana is a risk factor for human cancer. What isrequired to address that hypothesis more convincingly is a population-based case control study of sufficiently large numbers of people with lungcancer and upper aerodigestive tumors (cancers of the oral cavity andpharynx, larynx, and esophagus), as well as noncancer controls, to dem-onstrate a statistically significant association, if one exists. Because of thelong period required for induction of human carcinomas and the infre-quent use of marijuana in the general U.S. population before 1966, no epi-demiological studies so far have been extensive enough to measure theMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.120 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE association between marijuana and cancer adequately. However, epide- miological investigation of this association is probably possible now inthat some 30 years have elapsed since the start of widespread marijuanause in the United States among teenagers and young adults. 2. Molecular markers of respiratory cancer progression in marijuana smokers . If an epidemiological association between marijuana use and risk of respiratory cancer is demonstrated, studies would be warranted toexplore the presence of molecular markers \u2014such as TP53, p16, NATZ, and GSTML \u2014that could be predictive of genetically increased risk of car- cinogenesis in marijuana users. 3. Prospective epidemiological studies of populations with HIV se- ropositivity or at high risk for HIV infection.* Because HIV/AIDS pa- tients constitute the largest group that reports smoking marijuana formedical purposes and they are particularly vulnerable to immunosup-pressive effects, there is a pressing need for a better understanding of therelative risk posed by and the rewards of smoking marijuana. Such stud-ies should include history of marijuana use in the analysis of potentialrisk factors for seroconversion and acquisition of opportunistic infectionsor progression to AIDS. The studies could be carried out in the context ofany federally approved clinical trials of medical marijuana in immuno-compromised patients and should provide a follow-up period longenough to capture potential adverse events. 4. Regularized recording of marijuana use by patients . Although marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug, medical providers of-ten do not question patients about marijuana use and rarely document itsuse. 102 Among 452 Kaiser Permanente patients who reported daily or almost daily marijuana use, physicians recorded marijuana use in only3% of their medical records (S. Sidney, IOM workshop). 5. Additional cellular, animal, and human studies to investigate the effects of THC and marijuana on immune function. The effects studied should include effects on proinflammatory versus immunosuppressivecytokines and on the function of leukocytes that present antigen to T cells. The question that needs to be addressed is whether THC or marijuana is a risk factor for HIV infection, for progression to more severe stages of *A prospective study is one in which a group of subjects is identified and then studied over the course of time. Such a study allows an experimenter to balance different factors that maycontribute to the study outcome. For example, age, family history, and smoking are risk factors for lung cancer. In a prospective study, these factors can be balanced to measure how much smoking increases the risk of lung cancer. A retrospective study is one in which people with a particular disease are identified and their histories are studied. Such studies are easier and less expensive to conduct, but they generally lack the explanatory power of prospective studies.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Studies are needed to determine the effects of marijuana use on the function ofalveolar macrophages. It would be important to compare the HIV infec-tivity and replication of alveolar macrophages harvested from habitualmarijuana users with those harvested from nonusers or infrequent mari-juana users. Cell culture studies could be used to compare the susceptibil-ity of HIV-infected alveolar macrophages to additional infection withopportunistic pathogens. Similarly, further studies on cell cultures of pe-ripheral blood mononuclear cells could be used to assess the effects ofexposure to THC on HIV infectivity and replication. Cardiovascular System Marijuana smoke and oral THC can cause tachycardia (rapid heart beat) in humans, 20 -100% above baseline. 57,85 The increase in heart rate is greatest in the first 10 -20 minutes after smoking and decreases sharply and steadily; depending on whether smoked marijuana or oral THC isused, this can last three or five hours, respectively. 68,95 In some cases, blood pressure increases while a person is in a reclining position but de-creases inordinately on standing, resulting in postural hypotension (de-creased blood pressure due to changing posture from a lying or sittingposition to a standing position, which can cause dizziness and faintness).In contrast with acute administration of THC, chronic oral ingestion ofTHC reduces heart rate in humans. 13 In animals, THC decreases heart rate and blood pressure.57,156 How- ever, most of the animal studies have been conducted in anesthetized ani-mals, and anesthesia causes hypertension. Thus, those studies should beinterpreted as reports on the effects of cannabinoids in hypertensive sub-jects. The results of the animal and human studies are consistent with theconclusion that cannabinoids are hypotensive at high doses in animals, aswell as humans. 156 Tolerance can appear after a few days of frequent daily administra- tion (two or three doses per day) of oral THC or marijuana extract, withheart rate decreasing, reclining blood pressure falling, and postural hy-potension disappearing. 73 Thus, the intensity of the effects depends on frequency of use, dose, and even body position. The cardiovascular changes have not posed a health problem for healthy, young users of marijuana or THC. However, such changes inheart rate and blood pressure could present a serious problem for olderpatients, especially those with coronary arterial or cerebrovascular dis-ease. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death in the UnitedStates (coronary heart disease is first; stroke is third), so any effect of mari-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.122 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE juana use on cardiovascular disease could have a substantial impact on public health (S. Sidney, IOM workshop). The magnitude of the impactremains to be determined as chronic marijuana users from the late 1960senter the age when coronary arterial and cerebrovascular diseases becomecommon. Smoking marijuana is also known to decrease maximal exerciseperformance. That, with the increased heart rate, could theoreticallyinduce angina (S. Sidney, IOM workshop), so, this raises the possibilitythat patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease should be advisednot to smoke marijuana, and THC might be contraindicated in patientswith restricted cardiovascular function. Reproductive System Animal Studies. Marijuana and THC can inhibit many reproductive func- tions on a short-term basis. In both male and female animals, THC injec-tions suppress reproductive hormones and behavior. 107,159 Studies have consistently shown that injections of THC result in rapid, dose-dependentsuppression of serum luteinizing hormone (LH). 70 (LH is the stimulates release of the gonadal hormones, testosteroneand estrogen.) Embryo implantation also appears to be inhibited by THC.But it does not necessarily follow that marijuana use will interfere withhuman reproduction. With few exceptions, the animal studies are basedon acute treatments (single injections) or short-term treatments (THCinjections given over a series of days). The results are generally observedfor only several hours or in females sometimes for only one ovulatorycycle. Acute treatments of sea urchin sperm. 135-137 The sea urchin is only a distant relative of humans, but the cellular processes that regulate fertilization are similar enough that onecan expect a similar effect in humans. However, the effect of cannabinoidson the capacity of sperm to fertilize eggs is reversible and is observed atconcentrations of 6 -100 \u00b5M, 136,137 which are higher than those likely to be experienced by marijuana smokers. The presence of cannabinoid recep-tors in sperm suggests the possibility of a natural role for anandamide inmodulating sperm function during fertilization. However, it remains tobe determined whether smoked marijuana or oral THC taken in pre-scribed doses has a clinically significant effect on the fertilizing capacityof human sperm. Exposure to THC in utero can result in long-term changes. Many in utero effects interfere with embryo implantation (see review by Wenger and co-workers 159). Exposure to THC shortly before or after birth can re- sult in impaired reproductive behavior in mice when they reach adult-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Some of theeffects of THC are exerted through its action on stress hormones, such ascortisol. 70 Human Studies. The few human studies are consistent with the acute animal studies: THC inhibits reproductive functions. However, studies ofmen and women who use marijuana regularly have yielded conflictingresults and show either depression of reproductive hormones, no effect,or only a short-term effect. Overall, the results of human studies are con-sistent with the hypothesis that THC inhibits LH on a short-term basis butnot in long-term marijuana users. In other words, long-term users developtolerance to the inhibitory effect of THC on LH. The results in men andwomen are similar, with the added consideration of the menstrual cyclein women; the acute effects of THC appear to vary with cycle stage. THCappears to have little effect during the follicular phase (the phase aftermenses and before ovulation) and to inhibit the LH pulse during the lutealphase (the phase after ovulation and before menses). 103 In brief, although there are no data on fertility itself, marijuana or THC would probablydecrease human fertility \u2014at least in the short term \u2014for both men and women. And it is reasonable to predict that THC can interfere with earlypregnancy, particularly with implantation of the embryo. Like tobaccosmoke, marijuana smoke is highly likely to be harmful to fetal develop-ment and should be avoided by pregnant women and those who mightbecome pregnant in the near future. Nevertheless, although fertility andfetal development are important concerns for many, they are unlikely tobe of much concern to people with seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases. The well-documented inhibition of reproductivefunctions by THC is thus not a serious concern for evaluating the short-term medical use of marijuana or specific cannabinoids. The results of studies of the relationship between prenatal marijuana exposure and birth outcome have been inconsistent (reviewed in 1995 byCornelius and co-workers 30). Except for adolescent mothers, there is little evidence that gestation is shorter in mothers who smoke marijuana.30 Several studies of women who smoked marijuana regularly during preg-nancy show that they tend to give birth to lower weight babies. 46,65 Mothers who smoke tobacco also give birth to lower weight babies, andthe relative contributions of smoking and THC are not known from thesestudies. Babies born to mothers who smoked marijuana during pregnancyMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.124 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE weighed an average of 3.4 ounces less than babies born to a control group of mothers who did not smoke marijuana; there was no statistically sig-nificant difference in either gestational age or frequency of congenitalabnormalities. 164 Those results were based on women whose urine tests indicated recent marijuana exposure. However, when the analysis wasbased only on self-reports of marijuana use (without verification by urinetests), there was no difference in weight between babies born to womenwho reported themselves as marijuana smokers and those born to womenwho reported that they did not smoke marijuana. That raises an impor-tant concern about the methods used to measure the effects of marijuanasmoking in any study, perhaps even more so in studies on the effects ofmarijuana during pregnancy, when subjects might be less likely to admitto smoking marijuana. (The study was conducted in the last trimester ofpregnancy, and there was no information about the extent of marijuanause earlier in pregnancy.) For most of these studies, much of the harm associated with mari- juana use is consistent with that associated with tobacco use, and smok-ing is an important factor, so the contribution of cannabinoids cannot beconfirmed. However, Jamaican women who use marijuana rarely smokeit; but instead prepare it as tea. 37 In a study of neonates born to Jamaican women who did or did not ingest marijuana during pregnancy, there wasno difference in neurobehavioral assessments made at three days afterbirth and at one month. 38 A limitation of the study is that there was no direct measure of marijuana use. Estimates of marijuana use were basedon self-reports, which might be more accurate in Jamaica than in theUnited States because less social stigma is associated with marijuana usein Jamaica but still are less reliable than direct measures. Newborns of mothers who smoke either marijuana or tobacco have statistically significantly higher mutation rates than those of non-smokers. 4,5 Since 1978, the Ottawa Prenatal Prospective Study has measured the cognitive functions of children born to mothers who smoked marijuanaduring pregnancy. 47 Children of mothers who smoked either moderately (one to six marijuana cigarettes per week) or heavily (more than six mari-juana cigarettes per week) have been studied from the age of four days to9-12 years. It is important to keep in mind that studies like this provide important data about the risks associated with marijuana use during preg-nancy, but they do not establish the causes of any such association. The children in the different marijuana exposure groups showed no lasting differences in global measures of intelligence, such as languagedevelopment, reading scores, and visual or perceptual tests. Moderatecognitive deficits were detectable among these children when they wereMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 125 four days old and again at four years, but the deficits were no longer apparent at five years. Prenatal marijuana exposure was not, however, without lasting effect. At ages 5 -6 years and 9 -12 years, children in the same study who were prenatally exposed to tobacco smoke scored lower on tests of languageskills and cognitive functioning. 48 In another study,49,50 9 to 12 year olds who were exposed to marijuana prenatally scored lower than control sub-jects on tasks associated with \"executive function, \" a term used by psy- chologists to describe a person 's ability to plan, anticipate, and suppress behaviors that are incompatible with a current goal. 50 It was reflected in how the mothers described their children. Mothers of the marijuana-exposed children were more likely to describe their offspring as hyper-active or impulsive than were mothers of control children. The alterationin executive function was not seen in children born to tobacco smokers.The underlying causes might be the marijuana exposure or might be moreclosely related to the reasons underlying the mothers ' use of marijuana during pregnancy. Mice born to dams injected with the endogenous cannabinoid, anan- damide, during the last trimester of pregnancy also showed delayed ef-fects. No effect of anandamide treatment during pregnancy was detecteduntil the mice were adults (40 days old), at which time they showed be-havioral changes that are common to the effects of other psychotropicdrugs or prenatal stress. 45 As with the children born to mothers who smoked marijuana, it is not known what aspect of the treatment causedthe effect. The dams might have found the dose (20 mg/kg of bodyweight) of anandamide aversive, in which case the effect could haveresulted from generalized stress, as opposed to a cannabinoid-specificeffect. Either is possible. Despite the uncertainty as to the underlyingcauses of the effects of prenatal exposure to cannabinoid drugs, it is pru-dent to advise against smoking marijuana during pregnancy. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This chapter summarizes the harmful effects of marijuana on indi- vidual users and, to a lesser extent, on society. The harmful effects onindividuals were considered from the perspective of possible medical useof marijuana and can be divided into acute and chronic effects. The vastmajority of evidence on harmful effects of marijuana is based on smoked marijuana, and, except for the psychoactive effects that can be reasonablyattributed to THC, it is not possible to distinguish the drug effects fromthe effects of inhaling smoke from burning plant material. For most people the primary adverse effect of acute marijuana use is diminished psychomotor performance; it is inadvisable for anyone underMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.126 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE the influence of marijuana to operate any equipment that might put the user or others in danger (such as driving or operating complex equip-ment). Most people can be expected to show impaired performance ofcomplex tasks, and a minority experience dysphoria. People with or atrisk of psychiatric disorders (including substance dependence) are par-ticularly vulnerable to developing marijuana dependence, and marijuanause would be generally contraindicated for them. The short-term immuno-suppressive effects are not well established; if they exist at all, they areprobably not great enough to preclude a legitimate medical use. The acuteside effects of marijuana use are within the risks tolerated for many medi-cations. The chronic effects of marijuana are of greater concern for medical use and fall into two categories: the effects of chronic smoking and the effectsof THC. Marijuana smoke is like tobacco smoke in that it is associatedwith increased risk of cancer, lung damage, and poor pregnancy outcome.Smoked marijuana is unlikely to be a safe medication for any chronicmedical condition. The second category is that associated with depen-dence on the psychoactive effects of THC. Despite past skepticism, it hasbeen established that, although it is not common, a vulnerable subpopu-lation of marijuana users can develop dependence. Adolescents, particu-larly those with conduct disorders, and people with psychiatric disorders,or problems with substance abuse appear to be at greater risk for mari-juana dependence than the general population. As a cannabinoid drug delivery system, marijuana cigarettes are not ideal in that they deliver a variable mixture of cannabinoids and a varietyof other biologically active substances, not all of which are desirable oreven known. Unknown substances include possible contaminants, suchas fungi or bacteria. Finally, there is the broad social concern that sanctioning the medical use of marijuana might lead to an increase in its use among the generalpopulation. No convincing data support that concern. The existing dataare consistent with the idea that this would not be a problem if the medi-cal use of marijuana were as closely regulated as the use of other medica-tions that have abuse potential, but we acknowledge a lack of data thatdirectly address the question. Even if there were evidence that the medi-cal use of marijuana would decrease the perception that it can be a harm-ful substance, this is beyond the scope of laws regulating the approval oftherapeutic drugs. Those laws concern scientific data related to the safetyand efficacy of drugs for individual use; they do not address perceptionsor beliefs of the general population. Marijuana is not a completely benign substance. It is a powerful drug with a variety of effects. However, except for the harm associated withsmoking, the adverse effects of marijuana use are within the range toler-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE AND ABUSE 127 ated for other medications. Thus, the safety issues associated with mari- juana do not preclude some medical uses. But the question remains: Is iteffective? That question is covered here in two chapters: chapter 2 sum-marizes what has been learned about the biological activity of cannab-inoids in the past 15 years through research in the basic sciences, andchapter 4 reviews clinical data on the effectiveness of marijuana and can-nabinoids for the treatment of various medical conditions. Three factors influence the safety of marijuana or cannabinoid drugs for medical use: the delivery system, the use of plant material,and the side effects of cannabinoid drugs. (1) Smoking marijuana is clearly harmful, especially in people with chronic conditions, and is notan ideal drug delivery system. (2) Plants are of uncertain composition,which renders their effects equally uncertain, so they constitute an unde-sirable medication. (3) The side effects of cannabinoid drugs are withinthe acceptable risks associated with approved medications. Indeed, someof the side effects, such as anxiety reduction and sedation, might be desir-able for some patients. As with many medications, there are people forwhom they would probably be contraindicated. C ONCLUSION : Present data on drug use progression neither sup- port nor refute the suggestion that medical availability would in-crease drug abuse. However, this question is beyond the issuesnormally considered for medical uses of drugs, and it should notbe a factor in the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of mari-juana or cannabinoids. C ONCLUSION : A distinctive marijuana withdrawal syndrome has been identified, but it is mild and short lived. The syndrome in-cludes restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleepEEG disturbance, nausea, and cramping. C ONCLUSION : Numerous studies suggest that marijuana smoke is an important risk factor in the development of respiratory dis-ease . R ECOMMENDATION : Studies to define the individual health risks of smoking marijuana should be conducted, particularly amongpopulations in which marijuana use is prevalent.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In contrast, marijuana hasbeen widely used in the United States for decades. 162 In 1996, 68.6 million people\u201432% of the U.S. population over12 years old\u2014had tried marijuana or hashish at least once;5% were current users. 162 The data on the adverse effects of marijuana are more extensive than the data on its effectiveness. Clinical studies of marijuanaare difficult to conduct: researchers interested in clinical studies of mari-juana face a series of barriers, research funds are limited, and there is adaunting thicket of regulations to be negotiated at the federal level (thoseof the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, and the Drug EnforcementAgency, DEA) and state levels (see chapter 5). Consequently, the rapidgrowth in basic research on cannabinoids contrasts with the paucity ofsubstantial clinical studies on medical uses. This chapter is devoted to an analysis of the therapeutic value of mari- juana and cannabinoids for specific symptoms associated with variousconditions. The risks associated with the medical use of marijuana arediscussed in chapter 3. It should be noted that THC, the primary activeingredient in marijuana, is an FDA-approved drug referred to asdronabinol and marketed as Marinol. Marijuana is advocated primarilyfor relief from the symptoms of disease rather than as a cure. For the most part, the logical categories for the medical use of mari-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.138 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE juana are not based on particular diseases but on symptoms \u2014such as nausea, appetite loss, or chronic pain \u2014each of which can be caused by various diseases or even by treatments for diseases. This chapter is there-fore organized by symptoms rather than by diseases. There are eightsections. The first section explains clinical trials, the following five dealwith specific symptoms and conditions, and the last two summarize themedical benefits of marijuana and cannabinoids. The five sections onsymptoms and conditions are as follows: pain, nausea and vomiting, wast-ing syndrome and appetite stimulation, neurological symptoms (includ-ing muscle spasticity), and glaucoma. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) study team received reports of more than 30 different medical uses of marijuana, more than could be carefullyreviewed in a report of this length; even more uses are reported else-where. 62,63 For most of the infrequently mentioned medical uses of mari- juana there are only a few anecdotal reports. This report reviews only themost prominent symptoms that are reportedly relieved by marijuana.However, many of those diseases not reviewed here share common symp-toms, such as pain, nausea and vomiting, and muscle spasms, whichmight be relieved by cannabinoid drugs. STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING CLINICAL TRIALS Before evaluating individual clinical trials concerning the efficacy and safety of medical uses of marijuana and cannabinoids, it is useful to reviewthe general qualities of clinical trials. Clinical trials involve groups of indi-viduals in which different treatments are compared among differentgroups. Such trials measure the efficacy of a medication and are requiredby the FDA for approval of any new drug or new use of a drug (discussedfurther in chapter 5). The degree of assurance that the outcome of a clinical trial is due to the treatment being tested depends on how well the trial is designed.Three important factors to consider in evaluating the design of a clinicaltrial are sample selection, subjective effects, and effects that are indepen-dent of the treatment. For sample selection it is important to ensure that patients are allocated to different treatment groups in such a way that thegroups are not biased toward a particular treatment outcome. For ex-ample, the health status, gender, and ages of different treatment groupsshould be equivalent. Subjective effects must be controlled because they influence experimental results in two important ways. First, a patient 's expectation that a treatment will be effective can influence the degree ofits effect (for example, in the control of nausea). Second, the investigator 's expectation can influence his or her interpretation of the treatment effect(for example, when assessing the level of pain experienced by a patient).Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDICAL VALUE OF MARIJUANA AND RELATED SUBSTANCES 139 For these reasons, double blinding, in which neither the subject nor the person who assesses the drug 's effect is aware of the subject 's treatment group, is particularly important in cannabinoid drug studies. Anotherimportant control for subjective effects includes the use of placebo drugs,which are inert substances, or the use of comparison drugs that haveeffects similar to the experimental drug. Finally, the quality of the experi-mental design depends on controlling for factors that are unrelated to thetest drug but that might nonetheless influence the treatment outcome.Sequencing effects are one example of such factors. For example, patients might react differently to the same medication depending on whether themedication was administered after an effective or an ineffective treatment.Likewise, a patient whose symptoms are initially mild might react differ-ently to a drug than would a patient whose symptoms are initially severe.Because psychological effects are associated with cannabinoid drugs, it isimportant to consider how such side effects might influence the therapeu-tic value of the treatment. Conditions such as pain and nausea are espe-cially susceptible to subjective influences. For example, depending on theperson, THC can reduce or increase anxiety; it is important to determineto what extent this \"side effect \" contributes to the therapeutic effect. While double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials offer the highest degree of assurance of drug efficacy, such trials are not alwaysfeasible. Vulnerable populations, such as children, older patients, andwomen of child-bearing age, are often excluded from experimental drugtrials for safety reasons. Nonetheless, such patients are part of everydayclinical practice. The challenge of integrating the ideal of standardizedand rigorous processes for treatment evaluation with everyday clinicalpractice has encouraged interest in single-patient trials. 67 Methods for such trials have been established and tested in a variety of clinical set-tings, usually under everyday conditions. 66,105,159 They are particularly valuable when physicians or patients are uncertain about the efficacy oftreatment for symptomatic diseases. Controls can be incorporated even inthis kind of trial. Such trials can be double blinded and can involve cross-over designs in which the patient is treated with alternating treatments,such as placebo-drug-placebo or one drug followed by another drug. Aswith any other clinical trial, a single-patient trial should be designed topermit objective comparison between treatments. ANALGESIA Pain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical assistance. 5 Pain associated with structural or psychophysiological dis- orders can arise from somatic, visceral, or neural structures. Somatic pain results from activation of receptors outside the brain and is transmitted toMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.140 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE the brain via peripheral nerves. Visceral pain results from activation of specific pain receptors in the intestine (visceral nociceptive receptors); it ischaracterized as a deep aching or cramping sensation, but its source isoften experienced at sites remote from the site of receptor activation, aphenomenon known as referred pain. Neuropathic pain results from injury to peripheral receptors, nerves, or the central nervous system; it is typi-cally burning, the skin feels abnormally unpleasant when gently touched(dysesthesia), and it often occurs in an area of sensory loss, as in the caseof postherpetic neuralgia (shingles). All of the currently available analgesic (pain-relieving) drugs have limited efficacy for some types of pain. Some are limited by dose-relatedside effects and some by the development of tolerance or dependence. Acannabinoid, or other analgesic, could potentially be useful under any ofthe following circumstances: There is a medical condition for which it is more effective than any currently available medication. It has a broad clinical spectrum of efficacy and a unique side effect profile. It has synergistic interactions with other analgesics. It exhibits \"side effects \" that are considered useful in some clinical situations. Its efficacy is enhanced in patients who have developed tolerance to opioids. There have not been extensive clinical studies of the analgesic potency of cannabinoids, but the available data from animal studies indicate thatcannabinoids could be useful analgesics. In general, cannabinoids seem tobe mild to moderate analgesics. Opiates, such as morphine and codeine,are the most widely used drugs for the treatment of acute pain, but theyare not consistently effective in chronic pain; they often induce nauseaand sedation, and tolerance occurs in some patients. Recent research hasmade it clear that CB 1 receptor agonists act on pathways that partially overlap with those activated by opioids but through pharmacologicallydistinct mechanisms (see chapter 2). Therefore, they would probably havea different side effect profile and perhaps additive or synergistic analgesicefficacy. In light of the evidence that cannabinoids can reduce pain in animals, it is important to re-evaluate the evidence of analgesic efficacy in humansand to ask what clinical evidence is needed to decide whether cannab-inoids have any use in the treatment of pain.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDICAL VALUE OF MARIJUANA AND RELATED SUBSTANCES 141 Clinical Studies of Cannabinoids There have been three kinds of studies of the effects of cannabinoids on pain in human volunteers: studies of experimentally induced acutepain, studies of postsurgical acute pain, and studies of chronic pain. Over-all, there have been very few studies \u2014only one since 1981 \u2014and they have been inconclusive. Experimentally Induced Acute Pain Early studies of cannabinoids on volunteers did not demonstrate con- sistent analgesia when experimental pain models were used. In fact, threeearly volunteer studies of THC and experimental pain caused by a varietyof pain modalities \u2014electrical stimulation, tourniquet pain, and thermal pain \u2014resulted in an increase in pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia). 22,84,108 Other studies also failed to show an analgesic effect of THC, but they were not well designed. Raft and co-workers found no evidence of THCeffect on pain thresholds and pain tolerance following electrical stimula-tion and noxious pressure. 150 But their study suffers from two major meth- odological problems. First, they measured only the extremes of painsensation \u2014threshold (the lowest intensity at which a particular stimulus is perceived as painful) and tolerance (the maximum intensity of pain that a subject can withstand). However, most pain is experienced in an interme-diate range, where effects on pain suppression are most detectable. Mod-ern methods of pain assessment in humans typically use ratings of theintensity of the sensation of pain; those methods are superior to assessingthe effects of a drug on the extremes of pain. 192 Second, Raft and co- workers did not include a positive control; that is, they did not demon-strate the adequacy of their method by showing that an establishedanalgesic, such as an opiate or narcotic, was effective under their studyconditions. Clark and co-workers 22 tested the effect of smoked marijuana on ther- mal pain in volunteers and failed to observe an analgesic effect. However,because of the study design, the results are inconclusive. First, there wasno positive control to demonstrate the adequacy of their methods; sec-ond, the study subjects were habitual marijuana users. During the study,they were hospitalized and allowed free access to marijuana cigarettes fora period of four weeks, consuming an average of four to 17 marijuanacigarettes per day. Pain was tested \"approximately every one to two weeks. \" Thus, it is quite likely that the subjects were tolerant to THC at the time of testing.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.142 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE Surgical Acute Pain Raft and co-workers150 found no analgesic effect of THC on surgical pain induced by tooth extraction. However, that study suffered fromseveral serious limitations: the tooth extraction included treatment withthe local anesthetic lidocaine, the pain during the procedure was assessed24 hours later, and there was no positive control. Levonantradol (a syn-thetic THC analogue) was tested in 56 patients who had moderate tosevere postoperative or trauma pain. 89 They were given intramuscular injections of levonantrodol or placebo 24 hours after surgery. To controlfor previous drug exposure, patients with a history of drug abuse oraddiction and those who received an analgesic, antiinflammatory, tran-quilizer, sedative, or anesthetic agent within 24 hours of the test drugwere excluded from the study. On average, pain relief was significantlygreater in the levonantradol-treated patients than in the placebo-treatedpatients. Because the authors did not report the number or percentage ofpeople who responded, it is not clear whether the average represents con-sistent pain relief in all levonantradol-treated patients or whether somepeople experienced great relief and a few experienced none. Chronic Pain The most encouraging clinical data on the effects of cannabinoids on chronic pain are from three studies of cancer pain. Cancer pain can be dueto inflammation, mechanical invasion of bone or other pain-sensitivestructure, or nerve injury. It is severe, persistent, and often resistant totreatment with opioids. In one study, Noyes and co-workers found thatoral doses of THC in the range of 5 -20 mg produced analgesia in patients with cancer pain. 139,140 The first experiment was a double-blind, placebo- controlled study of 10 subjects and measured both pain intensity and painrelief. 140 Each subject received all drug treatments: placebo and 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg of THC in pill form; each pill was identical in appearance andgiven on successive days. The 15- and 20-mg doses of THC produced sig-nificant analgesia. There were no reports of nausea or vomiting. In fact, atleast half the patients reported increased appetite. With a 20-mg dose ofTHC, patients were heavily sedated and exhibited \"depersonalization, \" characterized by a state of dreamy immobility, a sense of unreality, anddisconnected thoughts. Five of 36 patients exhibited adverse reactions (ex-treme anxiety) and were eliminated from the study. Only one patient ex-perienced this effect at the 10-mg dose of THC. The mean age of the pa-tients was 51 years, and they were probably not experienced marijuanasmokers. A limitation of this study is that there were no positive con-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDICAL VALUE OF MARIJUANA AND RELATED SUBSTANCES 143 trols \u2014that is, other analgesics that could provide a better measure of the degree of analgesia produced by THC. In a later larger single-dose study, the same investigators reported that the analgesic effect of 10 mg of THC was equivalent to that of 60 mgof codeine; the effect of 20 mg of THC was equivalent to that of 120 mg ofcodeine. 139 (Note that codeine is a relatively weak analgesic.) The side effect profiles were similar, though THC was more sedating than codeine.In a separate publication the same authors published data indicating thatpatients had improved mood, a sense of well-being, and less anxiety. 139 The results of the studies mentioned above on cancer pain are consis- tent with the results of using a nitrogen analogue of THC. Two trials werereported: one compared this analogue with codeine in 30 patients, and asecond compared it with placebo or secobarbital, a short-acting barbitu-rate. 175 For mild, moderate, and severe pain, the THC analogue was equivalent to 50 mg of codeine and superior to placebo and to 50 mg ofsecobarbital. Case Reports and Surveys The few case reports of clinical analgesia trials of cannabinoids are not convincing. 85,120 There are, however, anecdotal surveys that raise the possibility of a role for cannabinoids in some patients who have chronicpain with prominent spasticity. A recent survey of over 100 patients withmultiple sclerosis reported that a large number obtained relief fromspasticity and limb pain (discussed further under the section on multiplesclerosis). 28 Several said that it relieved their phantom pain and headache.41 Migraine Headaches There is clearly a need for improved migraine medications. Sumatriptan (Imitrex) is the best available medication for migraine head-aches, but it fails to abolish migraine symptoms in about 30% of migrainepatients. 118,147 Marijuana has been proposed numerous times as a treat- ment for migraine headaches, but there are almost no clinical data on theuse of marijuana or cannabinoids for migraine. Our search of the litera-ture since 1975 yielded only one scientific publication on the subject. Itpresents three cases of cessation of daily marijuana smoking followed bymigraine attacks \u2014not convincing evidence that marijuana relieves migraine headaches. 43 The same result could have been found if migraine headaches were a consequence of marijuana withdrawal. While there isno evidence that marijuana withdrawal is followed by migraines, whenanalyzing the strength of reports such as these it is important to considerMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.144 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE all logical possibilities. Various people have claimed that marijuana relieves their migraine headaches, but at this stage there are no conclusiveclinical data or published surveys about the effect of cannabinoids onmigraine. However, a possible link between cannabinoids and migraine is sug- gested by the abundance of cannabinoid receptors in the periaqueductalgray (PAG) region of the brain. The PAG region is part of the neuralsystem that suppresses pain and is thought to be involved in the genera-tion of migraine headaches. 52 The link or lack thereof between cannab- inoids and migraine might be elucidated by examining the effects ofcannabinoids on the PAG region. 110 Recent results indicating that both cannabinoid receptor subtypes are involved in controlling peripheralpain 15 suggest that the link is possible. Further research is warranted. Conclusions: Analgesia A key question to address is whether there is any receptor selectivity for the analgesic efficacy of cannabinoids. Are the unwanted side effects(amnesia and sedation) caused by the same receptors in the same brainregions as those producing the analgesia? If the answer is yes, enhancing efficacy will not solve the problem of sedation. Similarly, are the pleasantside effects due to an action at the same receptor? Can the feelings of well-being and appetite stimulation be separated by molecular design? Recentresults indicating that both cannabinoid receptor subtypes are indepen-dently involved in controlling peripheral pain 15 (discussed in chapter 2) strongly suggest that this is possible and that further research iswarranted. Further research into the basic circuitry underlying cannabinoid anal- gesia should be valuable. The variety of neural pathways that underliethe control of pain suggests that a synergistic analgesia \"cocktail \" would be effective. For example, Lichtman and Martin have shown the involve-ment of an 2 adrenoreceptor in cannabinoid analgesia. 111 Perhaps a com- bination of a CB1 agonist and an 2 agonist (such as clonidine) would provide enhanced analgesia with less severe side effects. Clinical studies should be directed at pain patients for whom there is a demonstrated need for improved management and where the particularside effect profile of cannabinoids promises a clear benefit over currentapproaches. The following patient groups should be targeted for clinicalstudies of cannabinoids in the treatment of pain: Chemotherapy patients, especially those being treated for the mucositis, nausea, and anorexia.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDICAL VALUE OF MARIJUANA AND RELATED SUBSTANCES 145 Postoperative pain patients (using cannabinoids as an opioid adjunct to determine whether nausea and vomiting from opioidsare reduced). Patients with spinal cord injury, peripheral neuropathic pain, or central poststroke pain. Patients with chronic pain and insomnia. AIDS patients with cachexia, AIDS neuropathy, or any significant pain problem. In any patient group an essential question to be addressed is whether the analgesic efficacy of opioids can be augmented. The strategy would beto find the ceiling analgesic effect with an opioid (as determined by painintensity and tolerability of side effects) and then add a cannabinoid todetermine whether additional pain relief can be obtained. That wouldbegin the investigation of potential drug combinations. As with any clini-cal study on analgesic drugs, it will be important to investigate the devel-opment of tolerance and physical dependence; these are not themselvesreasons to exclude the use of cannabinoids as analgesics, but such infor-mation is essential to the management of many drugs that are associatedwith tolerance or physical dependence. A secondary question would be whether THC is the only or the best component of marijuana for analgesia. How does the analgesic effect ofthe plant extract compare with that of THC alone? If there is a difference,it will be important to identify the combinations of cannabinoids that arethe most effective analgesics. In conclusion, the available evidence from animal and human studies indicates that cannabinoids can have a substantial analgesic effect. Oneexception is the lack of analgesic effect in studies on experimentallyinduced acute pain, but because of limitations in the design of those stud-ies they were inconclusive. Further clinical work is warranted to establishthe magnitude of the effect in different clinical conditions and to deter-mine whether the effect is sustained. Although the usefulness of cannab-inoids appears to be limited by side effects, notably sedation, other effectssuch as anxiolysis, appetite stimulation, and perhaps antinausea andantispasticity effects should be studied in randomized, controlled clinicaltrials. These very \"special \" effects might warrant development of cannab- inoid drugs for particular clinical populations. NAUSEA AND VOMITING Nausea and vomiting (emesis) occur under a variety of conditions, such as acute viral illness, cancer, radiation exposure, cancer chemo-therapy, postoperative recovery, pregnancy, motion, and poisoning. BothMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Much more is known about the neural mechanisms thatproduce vomiting than about those that produce nausea, in large partbecause vomiting is a complex behavior involving coordinated changesin the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory muscles, and posture, whereasnausea is a sensation involving primarily higher brain centers and lacks adiscrete observable action. 104,128 Most reports on the antiemetic effects of marijuana or cannabinoids are based on chemotherapy-induced emesis;they are the subject of the following section.

Nausea ranks behind only hair loss as a concern of patients on chemotherapy, and many pa-tients experience it as the worst side effect of chemotherapy. The sideeffects can be so devastating that patients abandon therapy or sufferdiminished quality of life. As a result, the development of effective strate-gies to control the emesis induced by many chemotherapeutic agents is amajor goal in the supportive care of patients with malignancies. The mechanism by which chemotherapy induces vomiting is not com- pletely understood. Studies suggest that emesis is caused by stimulationof receptors in the central nervous system or the gastrointestinal tract.This stimulation appears to be caused by the drug itself, a metabolite ofthe drug, or a neurotransmitter. 6,12,35 In contrast with an emetic like apomorphine, there is a delay between the administration of chemo-therapy and the onset of emesis. This delay depends on the chemothera-peutic agent; emesis can begin anywhere from a few minutes after theadministration of an agent like mustine to an hour for cisplatin. 12 The most desirable effect of an antiemetic is to control emesis com- pletely, which is currently the primary standard in testing new antiemeticagents (R. Gralla, IOM workshop). Patients recall the number of emeticepisodes accurately, even if their antiemetics are sedating or affectmemory; 101 thus, the desired end point of complete control is also a highly reliable method of evaluation. The degree of nausea can be estimatedthrough the use of established visual analogue scales.* 21,55,101 Another consideration in using antiemetic drugs is that the frequency of emesis varies from one chemotherapeutic agent to another. For ex-ample, cisplatin causes vomiting in more than 99% of patients who arenot taking an antiemetic (with about 10 vomiting episodes per dose),whereas methotrexate causes emesis in less than 10% of patients. 55,82,83 Among chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin is the most consistent emeticknown and has become the benchmark for judging antiemetic efficacy.Antiemetics that are effective with cisplatin are at least as effective withother chemotherapeutic agents. Controlling for the influence of prior che-motherapy and balancing predisposing factors such as, sex, age, and priorheavy alcohol use among study groups are vital for reliability. Reliablerandomization of patients and blinding techniques (easier when there areno psychoactive effects) are also necessary to evaluate the control of vom-iting and nausea. *The visual analogue scale is a continuous line representing all possible levels of a particu- lar sensation. It is an estimation of a patient 's subjective evaluation and not a true measure- ment. Patients select a point anywhere on the line to demonstrate the level of sensation they are experiencing, with one end representing one extreme, such as no sensations, and theother end representing the opposite extreme, such as a maximum level of that sensation.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Several cannabinoids havebeen tested as antiemetics, including THC (both the synthetic cannabinoids nabilone and levonantradol. Smoked mari-juana has also been examined. Antiemetic Properties of THC The quality and usefulness of antiemetic studies depend on adher- ence to the methodological considerations outlined above. Many of thereported clinical experiences with cannabinoids are not based on defini-tive experimental methods. In studies that compared THC with a placebo, THC was usually found to possess antiemetic properties. However, the chemotherapeutic drug varied in most trials, and some studies includedsmall numbers of patients. In one study THC was found to be superior toa placebo in patients receiving methotrexate, an agent that is not a strongemetic. 18 When the same investigators studied THC in a small number of patients who were receiving a chemotherapeutic drug that is more likelyto cause emesis than anthracycline, the antiemetic effect was poor. 19 Other trials were designed to compare THC with that of Compazine (prochlorperazine).143,160 In the 1980s, prochlorperazine was one of the more effective antiemetics available, but it was not completely satisfac-tory, and the search for better agents continued. THC and prochlor-perazine given orally showed similar degrees of efficacy, but the studiesoften used various chemotherapeutic agents. Even when administered incombination, THC and prochlorperazine failed to stop vomiting in two-thirds of patients. 50 In a carefully controlled double-blind study comparing THC with the antiemetic drug metoclopramide, in which no patient had previouslyreceived chemotherapy and in which anticipatory emesis was thereforenot a factor, all patients received the same dose of cisplatin and wererandomly assigned to the THC group or the metoclopramide group.Complete control of emesis occurred in 47% of those treated withmetoclopramide and 13% of those treated with THC. 58 Major control (two or fewer episodes) occurred in 73% of the patients given metoclopramidecompared to 27% of those given THC. There were many flaws in experi-mental methods, but those results suggest that THC has some, but notgreat, efficacy in reducing chemotherapy-induced emesis. 18,19,50,161 The studies also indicate that the degree of efficacy is not high. In 1985, theMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDICAL VALUE OF MARIJUANA AND RELATED SUBSTANCES 149 FDA approved THC in the form of dronabinol for this treatment (dis- cussed in chapter 5). The THC metabolite, 11-OH-THC, is more psychoactive than THC but is a weaker antiemetic.121 Thus, it might be possible to design anti- emetic cannabinoids without the psychological effects associated withmarijuana or THC. 8-THC is less psychoactive than THC151 but was found to completely block both acute and delayed chemotherapy-inducedemesis in a study of eight children, ages 3 -13 years.* Two hours before the start of each cancer treatment and every six hours thereafter for 24 hours,the children were given 8-THC as oil drops on the tongue or in a bite of bread (18 mg/m2 body surface area). The children received a total of 480 treatments. The only side effects reported were slight irritability in two ofthe youngest children (3.5 and 4 years old). Based on the prediction thatthe THC-induced anxiety effects would be less in children than in adults,the authors used doses that were higher than those recommended foradults (5 -10 mg/m 2 body surface area). Antiemetic Properties of Synthetic THC Analogues Nabilone (Cesamet) and levonantradol were tested in various settings; the results were similar to those with THC. Efficacy was observed in sev-eral trials, but no advantage emerged for these agents. 176,185 As in the THC trials, nabilone and levonantradol reduced emesis but not as well as otheravailable agents in moderately to highly emetogenic settings. Neither iscommercially available in the United States. Antiemetic Properties of Marijuana Among the efforts to study marijuana was a preliminary study con- ducted in New York state on 56 cancer patients who were unresponsive toconventional antiemetic agents. 188 The patients were asked to rate the effectiveness of marijuana compared with results during prior chemo-therapy cycles. In this survey, 34% of patients rated marijuana as moder-ately or highly effective. The authors concluded that marijuana had anti-emetic efficacy, but its relative value was difficult to determine becauseno control group was used and the patients varied with respect to previ-ous experiences, such as marijuana use and THC therapy. *Note that the authors of this study chose to use 8-THC because it is more stable and easier to produce than 9-THC; it does not follow from this particular study that marijuana, with its mixture of cannabinoids, should be a more powerful antiemetic than 9-THC.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Patients withsevere vomiting would have been unlikely to be able to swallow or keepthe pills down long enough for them to take effect. The onset of drugeffect is much faster with inhaled or injected THC than it is for oral deliv-ery. 87,112,141 Although many marijuana users have claimed that smoked marijuana is a more effective antiemetic than oral THC, no controlled stud-ies have yet been published that analyze this in sufficient detail to esti-mate the extent to which this is the case. Side Effects Associated with THC and Marijuana in Antiemetic Therapy Frequent side effects associated with THC or marijuana are dizziness, dry mouth, hypotension, moderate sedation, and euphoria or dyspho-ria. 18,19,50,107,143,160,176,185 To patients, dry mouth and sedation are the least troubling side effects. Perhaps the most troubling side effects areorthostatic hypotension and dizziness, which could increase the patient 's distress. There is disagreement as to whether the psychoactive effects of THC correlate with its antiemetic activity. In the prospective double-blind trialcomparing THC with metoclopramide, the authors reported no relation-ship between the occurrence of complete antiemetic control and euphoriaor dysphoria. 58 Other investigators believe that the occurrence of eupho- ria or dysphoria is often associated with improved antiemetic control.160 Nevertheless, there is a consensus among investigators that dysphoriceffects are more common among patients who have had no prior experi-ence with cannabinoids. An important and unexpected problem encoun-tered in the New York state open trial with marijuana was the inability ofnearly one-fourth of the patients to tolerate the administration of mari-juana by smoking. 188 The intolerance could have been due to inexperience with smoking marijuana and is an important consideration.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The new antiemetics \u2014including selective serotonin antagonists, substituted benzamides, corticosteroids, butyro-phenones, and phenothiazines \u2014have few side effects when given over a short term and are convenient in various clinical settings. The most effective commonly used antiemetics are serotonin receptor antagonists (ondansetron and granisetron) with or without cortico-steroids. 37,56,88,145,155 In a combination trial of dexamethasone (a cortico- steroid) and a serotonin antagonist, complete control of acute cisplatin-induced emesis was observed in about 75% of patients. If thechemotherapy was only moderately emetogenic, up to 90% of the patientswho received the combination achieved complete control of emesis. Sideeffects of those antiemetic agents include headache, constipation, andalterations in liver function, but they are generally well tolerated by mostpatients. 13 Other commonly used effective than the serotonin antagonists and hasmore side effects, including acute dystonic reactions, drowsiness, diar-rhea, and depression. 13,37 Side effects associated with phenothiazines are severe or acute dystonic reactions, hypotension, blurred vision, drowsi-ness, dry mouth, urinary retention, allergic reactions, and occasionaljaundice. 13 The cost of effective antiemetic regimens can vary markedly, depend- ing on the agent, dose, schedule, and route of administration. Overall,oral regimens cost less than intravenous regimens because of lower phar-macy and administration costs, as well as lower acquisition costs in manycountries. Regimens with a cost to the pharmacy as low as about $30 to$35 per treatment session have been shown to be effective; 57 these costs are for treatment of acute emesis and delayed emesis with generic agentswhere available. Although it is generally not well known by the public, major progress in controlling chemotherapy-induced acute nausea and vomiting has beenmade since the 1970s. Patients receiving the most difficult to control emeticagents now have no more than about a 20 -30% likelihood of experiencing acute emesis, 155 whereas in the 1970s the likelihood was nearly 100% despite antiemetics.55,86 As has been seen, most antiemetic studies withMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.152 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE BOX 4.1 Attitudes of Oncologists Toward Prescribing Marijuana In the 1990s, two groups of investigators conducted three surveys on the attitudes of clinical oncologists toward prescribing marijuana as an antiemetic. These studies are arguably out of date in that the antiemetics available now are much more effective than those available when the stud-ies were conducted. Nonetheless, the studies merit attention because they are still often cited as evidence for or against the use of marijuana as an antiemetic. The two groups' results were contradictory. In 1994, by which time serotonin receptor antagonists (5-HT receptors) had become available, Schwartz and Beveridge 171 concluded that oncologists had little interest in prescribing marijuana to control emesis, whereas Doblin and Kleiman39 had concluded in 1991 that interest was great. Since 1994, the two groupshave debated in the literature as to which study represents the true senti-ment among oncologists. 38,172,177 In fact, numerous methodological differ- ences between the two studies might explain the different results.38,172 Ultimately, these studies are irrelevant. Both deal with perceptions rather than pharmacological realities based on well-designed outcome studies.177 cannabinoids had methodological difficulties and are inconclusive. The evidence from the well-conducted trials indicate that cannabinoids reduceemesis in about one-fourth of patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.Cannabinoids are not as effective as several other classes of agents, suchas substituted benzamides, serotonin receptor antagonists, and cortico-steroids. The side effects associated with cannabinoid use are generallytolerable. Like cannabinoids, smoked marijuana, was apparently effective,but the efficacy was no greater than that of available antiemetic agentsnow considered to be marginally satisfactory. At present, the most effec-tive antiemetic regimens are combinations of nor intravenous anti-emetics provide better control, and both add unnecessary costs. 59,81 Future Therapy Advances in therapy for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomit- ing will require discovery of agents that work through mechanisms dif-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDICAL VALUE OF MARIJUANA AND RELATED SUBSTANCES 153 ferent from those of existing antiemetics, including the serotonin Among the proposed new pathways, neurokinin-1 (NK-1) appear to be the most promising. Neurokinin receptors arefound in brain and intestine and are thought to be involved in motoractivity, mood, pain and reinforcement. They might well be involved inmediating intestinal sensations, including nausea. In animal models,agents that block the NK-1 receptor prevent cisplatin-induced emesis. Atthe time of this writing, clinical trials with NK-1 receptor antagonists wereunder way (phase II or small phase III comparison studies). Preliminaryresults indicated that these agents have useful activity in both acute anddelayed chemotherapy-induced emesis (that is, beginning or persisting24 or more hours after chemotherapy) and are safe to administerorally. 102,135 It is theoretically possible, considering that the mechanism of cannab- inoid action appears to differ from that of the serotonin receptor antago-nists and of corticosteroids, that THC added to more effective regimensmight enhance control of emesis. Such combinations should aim to be asconvenient as possible and have few additional side effects. The criticalissue is not whether marijuana or cannabinoid drugs might be superior tothe new drugs, but whether some group of patients might obtain addedor better relief from marijuana or cannabinoid drugs. Even with the best antiemetic drugs, the control of nausea and vomit- ing that begins or persists 24 hours after chemotherapy remains imper-fect. The pathophysiology of delayed emesis appears different from thatof acute emesis, and it is more likely to occur with a strong emetic agent,but it varies from patient to patient. Treatment to prevent this emesis re-quires dosing both before and after chemotherapy. 103 Conclusions: Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea Most chemotherapy patients are unlikely to want to use marijuana or THC as an antiemetic. In 1999, there are more effective antiemetic agentsavailable than were available earlier. By comparison, cannabinoids areonly modest antiemetics. However, because modern antiemetics probablyact through different mechanisms, cannabinoids might be effective inpeople who respond poorly to currently used antiemetic drugs, or can-nabinoids might be more effective in combination with a new drug than iseither alone. For both reasons, studies of the effects of adjunctive cannab-inoids on chemotherapy-induced emesis are worth pursuing for patientswhose emesis is not optimally controlled with other agents. While some people who spoke to the IOM study team described the mood-enhancing and anxiety-reducing effects of marijuana as a positivecontribution to antiemetic effects of marijuana, one-fourth of theMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.154 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE patients in the New York state study described earlier were unable to tolerate smoked marijuana. Overall, the effects of oral THC and smokedmarijuana are similar, but there are differences. For example, in the resi-dential studies of experienced marijuana users by Haney and co-workers,subjects reported that marijuana made them feel \"mellow, \" 71 whereas comparable doses of oral THC did not.70 Such differences might be due to the different routes of delivery of THC, as well as the different mixture ofcannabinoids found in the marijuana plant. As of this writing, no studieshad been published that weighed the relative contributions of those dif-ferent factors. The goal of antiemetic medications is to prevent nausea and vomit- ing. Hence, antiemetics are typically given before chemotherapy, in whichcase a pill is an effective from of drug delivery. However, in patientsalready experiencing severe nausea or vomiting, pills are generally inef-fective because of the difficulty in swallowing or keeping a pill down andslow onset of the drug effect. Thus, an inhalation (but preferably not smok-ing) cannabinoid drug delivery system would be advantageous for treat-ing chemotherapy-induced nausea. Until the development of rapid-onset antiemetic drug delivery sys- tems, there will likely remain a subpopulation of patients for whom stan-dard antiemetic therapy is ineffective and who suffer from debilitatingemesis. It is possible that the harmful effects of smoking marijuana for alimited period of time might be outweighed by the antiemetic benefits ofmarijuana, at least for patients for whom standard antiemetic therapy isineffective and who suffer from debilitating emesis. Such patients shouldbe evaluated on a case-by-case basis and treated under close medicalsupervision. WASTING SYNDROME AND APPETITE STIMULATION Wasting syndrome in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asthe involuntary loss of more than 10% of baseline average body weight inthe presence of diarrhea or fever of more than 30 days that is not attribut-able to other disease processes. 17 Anorexia (loss of appetite) can acceler- ate wasting by limiting the intake of nutrients. Wasting (cachexia) andanorexia are common end-stage features of some fatal diseases, such asAIDS, and of some types of metastatic cancers. In AIDS, weight loss of aslittle as 5% is associated with decreased survival, and a body weight aboutone-third below ideal body weight results in death. 99,158 There are two forms of malnutrition: starvation and cachexia. Starva- tion, the deprivation of essential nutrients, results from famine or poverty,malabsorption, eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, and so on.

Cachexia results from tissue injury, infection, or tumor andis characterized by a disproportionate loss of lean body mass, such asskeletal muscle. The effects of starvation regardless of the cause can usu-ally be reversed by providing food, whereas the effects of cachexia can bereversed only through control of the underlying disease and \u2014at least for some patients \u2014drugs that stimulate metabolism, such as growth hormone or androgenic-anabolic hormones. Malnutrition in HIV-Infected Patients By 1997 more than 30 million people worldwide were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the number is predicted toincrease to almost 40 million by the year 2000. 126,186 Malnutrition is com- mon among AIDS patients and plays an independent and important rolein their prognosis. 95,100,158 Because treatment for malnutrition depends on whether it is caused by starvation or cachexia, one needs to know theeffects of HIV infection on metabolic processes. The answer depends onthe clinical situation and can be either or both. 94 The development of malnutrition in HIV infection has many facets. Malnutrition in HIV-infected patients results in a disproportionate deple-tion of body cell mass,* total body nitrogen, and skeletal muscle mass; allare consistent with cachexia. 97,194 Body composition studies show that the depletion of body cell mass precedes the progression to AIDS (falling CD4lymphocyte counts); this suggests that malnutrition is a consequence ofthe inflammatory response to the underlying viral infection, rather than ageneral complication of AIDS. 144 In contrast, weight loss is often episodic and related to acute complications, such as febrile opportunistic infec-tions. 113 Mechanisms underlying wasting in HIV-infected patients depend on the stage of HIV infection and on specific associated complications. The many reasons for decreased food intake among AIDS patients include mouth, throat, or esophageal infections or ulcers (oropharyngealand esophageal pathology); adverse effects often the result of microorganismovergrowth or infection in the intestine, especially in the later stages ofAIDS. 95,157 *Body cell mass is the fat-free cellular mass. It is composed of the cells of the muscle and organs, plus circulating hematopoietic cells and the aqueous compartment of adipocytes. It is not fat, extracellular water, or extracellular solids (such as tendons).Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The only can-nabinoid evaluated in controlled clinical studies is THC, or dronabinol.Short-term (six-week) and long-term (one-year) therapy with dronabinolwas associated with an increase in appetite and stable weight, and in aprevious short-term (five-week) clinical trial in five patients, dronabinolwas shown to increase body fat by 1%. 8,9,179 In 1992, the FDA approved THC, under the trade name Marinol (dronabinol), as an appetite stimu-lant for the treatment of AIDS-related weight loss. Megestrol acetate(Megace) is a synthetic derivative of progesterone that can stimulateappetite and cause substantial weight gain when given in high doses (320 - 640 mg/day) to AIDS patients. Megestrol acetate is more effective thandronabinol in stimulating weight gain, and dronabinol has no additiveeffect when used in combination with megestrol acetate. 183 HIV/AIDS patients are the largest group of patients who use dronabinol. However,some reject it because of the intensity of neuropsychological effects, aninability to titrate the oral dose easily, and the delayed onset and pro-longed duration of its action. 3 There is evidence that cannabinoids modu- late the immune system (see chapter 2, \"Cannabinoids and the Immune System \"), and this could be a problem in immunologically compromised patients. No published studies have formally evaluated use of any of theother cannabinoids for appetite stimulation in wasting. Anecdotes abound that smoked marijuana is useful for the treatment of HIV-associated anorexia and weight loss. 23,62 Some people report a pref- erence for smoked marijuana over oral THC because it gives them theability to titrate the effects, which depend on how much they inhale. Incontrolled laboratory studies of healthy adults, smoked marijuana wasshown to increase body weight, appetite, and food intake. 47,119 Unfortu- nately, there have been no controlled studies of the effect of smoked mari-juana on appetite, weight gain, and body composition in AIDS patients.At the time of this writing, Donald Abrams, of the University of California,San Francisco, was conducting the first clinical trial to test the safety ofsmoked marijuana in AIDS patients, and the results were not yet available. A major concern with marijuana smoking in HIV-infected patients is that they might be more vulnerable than other marijuana users toimmunosuppressive effects of marijuana or to the exposure of infectiousorganisms associated marijuana plant material (see chapter 3, \"Marijuana Smoke \").Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Few therapies have proved successful in treatmentof the AIDS wasting syndrome. The stimulant studied most is megestrolacetate, which has been shown to increase food intake by about 30% overbaseline for reasons that remain unknown. Its effect in producing sub-stantial weight gain is dose dependent, but most of the weight gained is infat tissue, not lean body mass. Although the findings are still preliminary,anabolic compounds, such as testosterone or growth hormone, might beuseful in preventing the loss of or in restoring lean body mass in AIDSpatients. 10,44,64,170 Enteral and parenteral nutrition have also been evalu- ated and shown to increase weight, but again the increase is due more tobody fat than to lean body mass. 96,98 Encouraging advances in the antiviral treatment of HIV infection and developments in the prophylaxis of and therapy for opportunistic infec-tions have recently changed the outlook for the long-term health of HIV-infected people. Death rates have been halved, and the frequency ofserious complications, including malnutrition, has fallen markedly. 94,133 Future Therapy The primary focus of future therapies for wasting in HIV-infected patients is to increase lean body mass as well as appetite. Active systemicinfections are associated with profound anorexia, which is believed to bemediated by cytokines that stimulate inflammation through their actionsin and outside the brain. 132 Cytokine inhibitors, such as thalidomide, have been under investigation as potential treatments to increase lean bodymass and reduce malnutrition. Even though cannabinoids do not appearto restore lean body mass, they might be useful as adjunctive therapy. Forexample, cannabinoids could be used as appetite stimulants, in patientswith diminished appetite who are undergoing resistance exercises or ana-bolic therapy to increase lean body mass. They could also be beneficial fora variety of effects, such as increased appetite, while reducing the nauseaand vomiting caused by protease inhibitors and the pain and anxietyassociated with AIDS. Considering current knowledge about malnutrition in HIV infection, cannabinoids, by themselves, will probably not constitute primarytherapy for this condition but might be useful in combination with othertherapies, such as anabolic agents.

Malnutrition in Cancer Patients Malnutrition compromises the quality of life of many cancer patients and contributes to the progression of their disease. About 30% of Ameri-cans will develop cancer in their lifetimes, and two-thirds of those whoget cancer will die as a result of it. 5 Depending on the type of cancer, 50 - 80% of patients will develop cachexia and up to 50% of them will die, inpart, as a result of cachexia. 11,40 The cachexia appears to result from the tumor itself, and cytokines (proteins secreted by the host during an im-mune response to tumor) are probably important factors in this develop-ment. Cachexia does not occur in all cancer patients, but generally occursin the late stages of advanced cancer of the pancreas, lung, and prostate. The only cannabinoid evaluated for treating cachexia in cancer patients is dronabinol, which has been shown to improve appetite andpromote weight gain. 54 Present treatments for cancer cachexia are similar to that for cachexia in AIDS patients. These treatments are usually indi-cated in late stages of advanced disease and include megestrol acetateand enteral and parenteral nutrition. Megestrol acetate stimulates appe-tite and promotes weight gain in cancer patients, although the gain ismostly in fat mass (reviewed by Bruera 1998 14). Both megestrol acetate and dronabinol have dose-related side effects that can be troublesome forpatients: megestrol acetate can cause hyperglycemia and hypertension,and dronabinol can cause dizziness and lethargy. Cannabinoids have alsobeen shown to modulate the immune system (see chapter 2, \"Cannab- inoids and the Immune System \"), and this could be contraindicated in some cancer patients (both the chemotherapy and the cancer can beimmunosuppressive). Future treatments will probably depend on the development of meth- ods that block cytokine actions and the use of selective 2-adrenergic receptor agonists to increase muscle mass. 14,73 Treatments for cancer cachexia will also most likely need to identify individual patients ' needs. Some patients might need only a cytokine inhibitor, whereas others couldbenefit from combined approaches, such as an appetite stimulant and 2- adrenergic receptor agonists. In this respect, such cannabinoids as THCmight prove useful as part of a combination therapy as an appetite stimu-lant, antiemetic, analgesic, and anxiolytic, especially for patients in latestages of the disease.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

THC appears to be ineffective in treating this disease. In one study it caused severe dysphoric reactions in three of 11 patients.65 One possible explanation of the dysphoria is that THC increases appetite and thusintensifies the mental conflict between hunger and food refusal. 13 Fur- thermore, such patients might have underlying psychiatric disorders, suchas schizophrenia and depression, in which cannabinoids might be haz-ardous (see chapter 3, \"Psychological Harms \"). Current treatments include psychological techniques to overcome emotional or behavioral problems and dietary intervention to reverse themalnutrition. 195 Pharmacological treatments, such as antidepressants, have been used in addition to psychotherapy but tend to lack the desiredlevel of efficacy. 33 Recently, alterations in a gene for one of the serotonin receptors have been identified in some patients with anorexia nervosa.45 The possibility of a genetic component suggests a pathway for the devel-opment of new drugs to treat this disease. Conclusions: Wasting Syndrome and Appetite Stimulation The profile of cannabinoid drug effects suggests that they are promis- ing for treating wasting syndrome in AIDS patients. Nausea, appetite loss,pain, and anxiety are all afflictions of wasting, and all can be mitigated bymarijuana. Although some medications are more effective than marijuanafor these problems, they are not equally effective in all patients. A rapid-onset (that is, acting within minutes) delivery system should be devel-oped and tested in such patients. Smoking marijuana is not recommended.The long-term harm caused by smoking marijuana makes it a poor drugdelivery system, particularly for patients with chronic illnesses. Terminal cancer patients pose different issues. For those patients the medical harm associated with smoking is of little consequence. For termi-nal patients suffering debilitating pain or nausea and for whom all indi-cated medications have failed to provide relief, the medical benefits ofsmoked marijuana might outweigh the harm. NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS Neurological disorders affect the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves and muscles in the body. Marijuana has been proposed most oftenMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.160 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE as a source of relief for three general types of neurological disorders: muscle spasticity, particularly in multiple sclerosis patients and spinalcord injury victims; movement disorders, such as Parkinson 's disease, Huntington 's disease, and Tourette 's syndrome; and epilepsy. Marijuana is not proposed as a cure for such disorders, but it might relieve someassociated symptoms. Muscle Spasticity Spasticity is the increased resistance to passive stretch of muscles and increased deep tendon reflexes. Muscles may also contract involuntarily(flexor and extensor spasms). In some cases these contractions are debili-tating and painful and require therapy to relieve the spasms and associ-ated pain. There are numerous anecdotal reports that marijuana can relieve the spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, and ani-mal studies have shown that cannabinoids affect motor areas in thebrain \u2014areas that might influence spasticity. 51,78,130,168 Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition in which multiple areas of the central nervous system (CNS) are affected. Many nerve fibers becomedemyelinated, some are destroyed, and scars (sclerosis) form, resulting inplaques scattered throughout the white matter of the CNS. (Myelin is thelipid covering that surrounds nerve cell fibers and facilitates the conduc-tion of signals along nerve cells and ultimately between the brain, thespinal cord, and the rest of the body.) MS exacerbations appear to becaused by abnormal immune activity that causes inflammation and my-elin destruction in the brain (primarily in the periventricular area), brainstem, or spinal cord. Demyelination slows or blocks transmission of nerveimpulses and results in an array of symptoms such as fatigue, depression,spasticity, ataxia (inability to control voluntary muscular movements),vertigo, blindness, and incontinence. About 90% of MS patients eventu-ally develop spasticity. There are an estimated 2.5 million MS patientsworldwide, and spasticity is a major concern of many patients and physi-cians. 134 Spasticity is variably experienced as muscle stiffness, muscle spasms, flexor spasms or cramps, muscle pain or ache. The tendency forthe legs to spasm at night (flexor spasms) can interfere with sleep. Marijuana is often reported to reduce the muscle spasticity associated with MS. 62,123 In a mail survey of 112 MS patients who regularly use mari- juana, patients reported that spasticity was improved and the associatedpain and clonus decreased. 287 However, a double-blind placebo-controlledMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDICAL VALUE OF MARIJUANA AND RELATED SUBSTANCES 161 study of postural responses in 10 MS patients and 10 healthy volunteers indicated that marijuana smoking impaired posture and balance in bothMS patients and the volunteers. 61 Nevertheless, the 10 MS patients felt that they were clinically improved. The subjective improvement, whileintriguing, does not constitute unequivocal evidence that marijuana re-lieves spasticity. Survey data do not measure the degree of placebo effect,estimated to be as great as 30 percent in pain treatments. 122,131 Further- more, surveys do not separate the effects of marijuana or cannabinoids onmood and anxiety from the effects on spasticity. The effects of THC on spasticity were evaluated in a series of three clinical trials testing a total of 30 patients. 24,148,187 They were \"open trials, \" meaning that the patients were informed before treatment that they wouldbe receiving THC. Based on patient report or clinical exam by the investi-gator, spasticity was less severe after the THC treatment. However, THCwas not effective in all patients and frequently caused unpleasant sideeffects. Spasticity was also reported to be less severe in a single case studyafter nabilone treatment (Figure 4.2). 117 In general, the abundant anecdotal reports are not well supported by the clinical data summarized in Table 4.1. But this is due more to the limi-tation of the studies than to negative results. There are no supportinganimal data to encourage clinical research in this area, but there also areno good animal models of the spasticity of MS. Without an appropriatemodel, studies to determine the physiological basis for how marijuana orTHC might relieve spasticity cannot be conducted. Nonetheless, the sur-vey results suggest that it would be useful to investigate the potentialtherapeutic value of cannabinoids in relieving symptoms associated withMS. Such research would require the use of objective measures of spastic-ity, such as the pendulum test.* Since THC is mildly sedating, it is alsoimportant to distinguish this effect from antispasticity effects in any suchinvestigations. Mild sedatives, such as Benadryl or benzodiazepines,would be useful controls for studies on the ability of cannabinoids torelieve muscle spasticity. The regular use of smoked marijuana, however,would be contraindicated in a chronic condition like MS. Spinal Cord Injury In 1990, there were about 15 million patients worldwide with spinal cord injury, and an estimated 10,000 new cases are reported each year in *The pendulum test is an objective and accurate measure of MS-induced spasticity. It is done by videotaping a patient who lies supine on a table with his or her leg extending off the edge. The leg is dropped and the resulting motion is mathematically analyzed by computerto provide a quantitative measure of spasticity.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

This figure shows the results of a trial in which a 45-year-old man with MS was given four-week treatments alternately with placebo and nabilone. The patient served as both experimental subject and control; his treatment sequence was nabilone-placebo- nabilone-placebo. That pattern of alternating treatments reduces the possibilitythat the observed changes are unrelated to the drug and are not simply due to other factors that changed with time. The results of the trial are consistent with the possibility that THC might relieve spasticity, but although more rigorous thanmany self-report studies of psychoactive substances, it has problems. First, the patient could not distinguish the treatments at the time of taking them, but after the nabilone treatment he felt sedated. Thus, it is not possible to know how muchthe expectation of relief contributed to his perception of relief. Second, the study measured his perception of pain, in which spasticity is an important factor but not the only factor. It is not possible to know the extent to which the perception ofpain was affected by nabilone and how much by the stimulus that generated the pain \u2014in this case, involuntary muscle contractions. Because it is unaffected by conscious control, the frequency of nocturia is clearer evidence of the effect ofTHC, although it might also represent how well the patient slept. This trial with a single person is intriguing but not definitive proof that THC can reliably relieve spasticity. SOURCE: Martyn et al. (1995). 117 Reprinted with permission.

Thecaveats described for surveys of spasticity relief in MS patients also applyhere. Therapy for Muscle Spasticity Present Therapy. Present therapy for spasticity includes the various medi- cations listed in Table 4.2. Baclofen and tizanidine, the most commonlyprescribed antispasticity drugs, relieve spasticity and spasms with variousdegrees of success. The benefit of these agents is generally only partial.Their use is complicated by the side effects of drowsiness, dry mouth, andincreased weakness. Future Therapy. The discovery of agents that work through mechanisms different from those of existing antispasticity drugs will be an importantadvance in the treatment of spasticity. The aim of new treatments will beto relieve muscle spasticity and pain without substantially increasingmuscle weakness in conditions that result in spasticity. The treatment forMS itself will likely be directed at immunomodulation. Variousimmunomodulating agents, such as beta-interferon and glatiramer ac-etate, have been shown to reduce the frequency of symptomatic attacks,the progression of disability, and the rate of appearance of demyelinatedlesions as detected by magnetic resonance imaging. 5 Conclusion: Muscle Spasticity Basic animal studies described in chapter 2 have shown that cannab- inoid receptors are particularly abundant in areas of the brain that control TABLE 4.2 Classes of Antispasticity Drugs Drug Class in skeletal muscle DantroleneMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The observations are consistent with the possibilitythat cannabinoids have antispastic effects, but they do not offer any directevidence that cannabinoids affect spasticity, even in animals. The avail-able clinical data are too meager to either accept or dismiss the suggestionthat marijuana or cannabinoids relieve muscle spasticity. But the fewpositive reports of the ability of THC and related compounds to reducespasticity, together with the prevalence of anecdotal reports of the reliefprovided by marijuana, suggest that carefully designed clinical trials test-ing the effects of cannabinoids on muscle spasticity should be considered(see chapter 1). 25,62 Such trials should be designed to assess the degree to which the anxiolytic effects of cannabinoids contribute to any observedantispastic effects. Spasticity occurring at night can be very disruptive to sleep. Thus, a long-lasting medication would be especially useful for MS patients at bed-time \u2014when drowsiness would be a beneficial rather than an unwanted side effect and mood-altering effects would be less of a problem. One cau-tion is related to the effects of THC on the stages of sleep, which should beevaluated in MS patients who have sleep disturbances. If THC is provento relieve spasticity, a pill might be the preferred route of delivery fornighttime use because of its long duration of action. Compared to thecurrently available therapies, the long half-life of THC might allow for asmoother drug effect throughout the day. The intensity of the symptomsresulting from spasticity, particularly in MS, can rapidly increase in anunpredictable fashion such that the patient develops an \"attack \" of in- tense muscle spasms lasting minutes to hours. An inhaled form of THC (ifit were shown to be efficacious) might be appropriate for those patients. Movement Disorders Movement disorders are a group of neurological conditions caused by abnormalities in the basal ganglia and their subcortical connectionsthrough the thalamus with cortical motor areas. The brain dysfunctionsultimately result in abnormal skeletal muscle movements in the face,limbs, and trunk. The movement disorders most often considered formarijuana or cannabinoid therapy are dystonia, Huntington 's disease, Parkinson 's disease, and Tourette 's syndrome. Movement disorders are often transiently exacerbated by stress and activity and improved by fac-tors that reduce stress. This is of particular interest because for manypeople marijuana reduces anxiety.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.166 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE Dystonia Dystonia can be a sign of other basal ganglion disorders, such as Huntington 's disease and tardive dyskinesia (irreversible development of involuntary dyskinetic movements) and can be a primary basal gangliondisorder. Primary dystonias are a heterogeneous group of chronic slowlyprogressive neurological disorders characterized by dystonic move-ments \u2014slow sustained involuntary muscle contractions that often result in abnormal postures of limbs, trunk, and neck. Dystonias can be con-fined to one part of the body, such as spasmodic torticollis (neck) orMeige 's syndrome (facial muscles), or can affect many parts of the body, such as dystonia musculorum deformans. 5 Dystonia can cause mild to severe disability and sometimes pain secondary to muscle aching orarthritis. Some dystonias are genetic; others are caused by drugs. Thespecific neuropathological changes in these diseases have not beendetermined. No controlled study of marijuana in dystonic patients has been pub- lished, and the only study of cannabinoids was a preliminary open trial ofcannabidiol (CBD) that suggested modest dose-related improvements inthe five dystonic patients studied. 30 In mutant hamsters, ever, the cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2, can produceantidystonic effects. 153 Huntington's Disease Huntington 's disease is an inherited degenerative disease that usu- ally appears in middle age and results in atrophy or loss of neurons in thecaudate nucleus, putamen, and cerebral cortex. It is characterized byarrhythmic, rapid muscular contractions (chorea), emotional disturbance,and dementia (impairment in intellectual and social ability). Animal stud-ies suggest that cannabinoids have antichoreic activity, presumablybecause of stimulation of CB 1 receptors in the basal ganglia.129,168 On the basis of positive results in one of four Huntington 's disease patients, CBD and a placebo were tested in a double-blind crossover studyof 15 Huntington 's disease patients who were not taking any antipsychotic drugs. Their symptoms neither improved nor worsened with CBD treat-ment. 27,164 The effects of other cannabinoids on patients with Huntington 's dis- ease are largely unknown. THC and other CB1 agonists are more likely candidates than CBD, which does not bind to the CB1 receptor. Those receptors are densely distributed on the very neurons that perish inHuntington 's disease. 152 Thus far there is little evidence to encourage clinical studies of cannabinoids in Huntington 's disease.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Theoretically, cannabinoids could be useful for treating Parkinson 's disease patients because cannabinoid agonists specifically inhibit the path-ways between the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra and prob-ably also the pathways between the subthalamic nucleus and globuspallidus (these structures shown in Figure 2.6). 165,169 The latter effect was not directly tested but is consistent with what is known about these neu-ral pathways. Hyperactivity of the subthalamic neurons, observed in bothParkinson 's patients and animal models of Parkinson 's disease, is hypothesized to be a major factor in the debilitating bradykinesia associ-ated with the disease. 36 Furthermore, although cannabinoids oppose the actions of dopamine in intact rats, they augment dopamine activation ofmovement in an animal model of Parkinson 's disease. This suggests the potential for adjunctive therapy with cannabinoid agonists. 165-167,169 At the time of this writing, we could find only one published clinical trial of marijuana involving five cases of idiopathic Parkinson 's disease.48 That trial was prompted by a patient 's report that smoking marijuana reduced tremor, but the investigators found no improvement in tremorafter the five patients smoked marijuana \u2014whereas all subjects benefited from the administration of standard medications for Parkinson 's disease (levodopa and apomorphine). 48 Although new animal data might some- day indicate a use for cannabinoids in treating Parkinson 's disease, cur- rent data do not recommend clinical trials of cannabinoids in patients withParkinson 's disease. Tourette 's Syndrome Tourette 's syndrome usually begins in childhood and is characterized by motor and vocal tics (involuntary rapid repetitive movements orvocalizations). It has been suggested that the symptoms might be medi-ated by a reduction in the activity of limbic-basal ganglia-thalamocorticalcircuits (shown in Figure 2.4). 42 These circuits, while not well understood, appear to be responsible for translating a person 's intentions to move into actual movements. Damage to these structures leads to either involuntaryincreases in movement (as in Huntington 's disease) or the inability to make voluntary movements (as in Parkinson 's disease). The nature of the deficit in Tourette 's syndrome is unknown. No clear link has been established between symptoms of Tourette 'sMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.168 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE syndrome and cannabinoid sites or mechanism of action. Pimozide and haloperidol, two widely used treatments for Tourette 's syndrome, inhibit effects mediated by the neurotransmitter dopamine, whereas cannab-inoids can increase dopamine release. 154,181 The physiological relevance, if any, of these two observations has not been established. Clinical reports consist of four case histories indicating that marijuana use can reduce tics in Tourette 's patients.75,163 In three of the four cases the investigators suggest that beneficial effects of marijuana might have beendue to anxiety-reducing properties of marijuana rather than to a specificantitic effect. 163 Therapy for Movement Disorders Various drugs are available (Table 4.3) to treat the different move- ment disorders. Common side effects of many of these drugs are sedation,lethargy, school and work avoidance, social phobia, and increased risk ofparkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. With some of the medications, likethose used for dystonia, efficacy is lacking in up to 50% of the patients. Inaddition to medications, surgical interventions, such as pallidotomy andneurosurgical transplantation of embryonic substantia nigra tissue intothe patient 's striatum, have been tried in Parkinson 's disease patients. Surgery is generally palliative and is still considered to be in the develop-mental phase.

Marijuana or CB 1 receptor agonists might provide symptomatic relief of chorea, dystonia, some aspects of parkin-sonism, and tics. However, clinical evidence is largely anecdotal; therehave been no well-controlled studies of adequate numbers of patients.Furthermore, nonspecific effects might confound interpretation of resultsof studies. For example, the anxiolytic effects of cannabinoids might makepatients feel that their condition is improved, despite the absence of mea-surable change in their condition. Compared to the abundance of anecdotal reports concerning the ben- eficial effects of marijuana on muscle spasticity, there are relatively fewclaims that marijuana is useful for treating movement disorders. Thismight reflect a lack of effect or a lack of individuals with movement dis-orders who have tried marijuana. In any case, while there are a fewisolated reports of individuals with movement disorders who report abenefit from marijuana, there are no published surveys indicating that asubstantial percentage of patients with movement disorders find relieffrom marijuana. Existing studies involve too few patients from which todraw conclusions. The most promising reports involve symptomatic treat-ment of spasticity. If the reported neuroprotective effects of cannabinoidsdiscussed in chapter 2 prove to be therapeutically useful, this could ben-efit patients with movement disorders, but without further data such abenefit is highly speculative. Since stress often transiently exacerbatesmovement disorders, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the anxiolyticeffects of marijuana or cannabinoids might be beneficial to some patientswith movement disorders. However, chronic marijuana smoking is ahealth risk that could increase the burden of chronic conditions, such asmovement disorders. Cannabinoids inhibit both major excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the basal ganglia. This suggests that a cannabinoid agonist could produceopposite effects on movement, depending on the type of transmission(excitatory or inhibitory) that is most active at the time of drug adminis-tration. This property could be used to design treatments in basal gangliamovement disorders, such as Parkinson 's disease where either the excita- tory subthalamic input becomes hyperactive or the inhibitory striatalinput becomes hypoactive. The dose employed would be a major factor inthe therapeutic uses of cannabinoids in movement disorders; low dosesshould be desirable, while higher doses could be expected to aggravatepathological conditions. Thus, there is a clear reason to recommend pre-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

With the possible exception of multiple sclerosis, the evidence to recommend clinical trials of cannabinoids in movement disorders is rela-tively weak. Ideally, clinical studies would follow animal research thatprovided stronger evidence than is currently available on the potentialtherapeutic value of cannabinoids in the treatment of movementdisorders. Unfortunately, there are no good animal models for these dis-orders. Thus, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of isolatedcannabinoids that include controls for relevant side effects should be con-ducted. Such effects include anxiolytic and sedative effects, which mighteither mask or contribute to the potential therapeutic effects ofcannabinoids. Epilepsy Epilepsy is a chronic seizure disorder that affects about 2 million Americans and 30 million people worldwide. 156 It is characterized by re- current sudden attacks of altered consciousness, convulsions, or othermotor activity. A seizure is the synchronized excitation of large groups ofbrain cells. These abnormal electrical events have a wide array of possiblecauses, including injury to the brain and chemical changes derived frommetabolic faults of exposure to toxins. 156 Seizures are classified as partial (focal) or generalized. Partial seizures are associated with specific sensory, motor, or psychic aberrations thatreflect the function of the part of the cerebral cortex from which the sei-zures arise. Generalized seizures are usually the result of pathological con-ditions of brain sites that project to widespread regions of the brain. Suchpathology can produce petit mal seizures or major grand mal convulsions. Cannabinoids in Epilepsy There are anecdotal and individual case reports that marijuana con- trols seizures in epileptics (reviewed in a 1997 British Medical Associationreport 13), but there is no solid evidence. While there are no studies indi- cating that either marijuana or THC worsen seizures, there is no scientificbasis to justify such studies. In the only known case-controlled study that was designed to evalu- ate illicit drug use and the risk of first seizure, Ng and co-workers 137 con- cluded that marijuana is a protective factor for first-time seizures in menbut not women. Men who used marijuana reportedly had fewer first-timeseizures than men who did not use marijuana. That report was based on a comparison of 308 patients who had been admitted to a hospital afterMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The control group was made up of patients who had not had seizures and were admitted foremergency surgery, such as surgery for appendicitis, intestinal obstruc-tion, or acute cholecystitis. Compared to men who did not use marijuana,the odds ratio of first seizure for men who had used marijuana within 90days of hospital admission was 0.36 (95% confidence interval = 0.18 -0.74). An odds ratio of less than one is consistent with the suggestion that mari-juana users are less likely to have seizures. The results for women werenot statistically significant. However, this was a weak study. It did notinclude measures of health status prior to hospital admissions for thepatients ' serious conditions, and differences in their health status might have influenced their drug use rather than \u2014as suggested by the authors \u2014 that differences in their drug use influenced their health. The potential antiepileptic activity of CBD has been investigated but is not promising. Three controlled trials were conducted in which CBDwas given orally to patients who had had generalized grand mal seizuresor focal seizures (Table 4.4). Two of these studies were never published,but information about one was published in a letter to the South African Medical Journal , and the other was presented at the 1990 Marijuana Inter- national Conference on Cannabis and Cannabinoids. 184 TABLE 4.4 Clinical Trials of Cannabidiol (CBD) in Epileptics Study Design Results Reference Double-blind placebo-controlled trial 4 of 8 remained almost free Cunha and 8 epileptic patients were given CBD of convulsions.

Proving efficacy of anticonvulsants gen-erally requires large numbers of patients followed for months because thefrequency of seizures is highly variable and the response to therapy variesdepending on seizure type. 4,49 Therapy for Epilepsy Present Therapy. Standard pharmacotherapy for partial and generalized seizures, listed in Table 4.5, involves a variety of anticonvulsant drugs.These drugs suppress seizures completely in approximately 60% ofpatients who have chronic epilepsy and improve seizures in another 15%of patients. All of the anticonvulsants listed in Table 4.5 have side effects,some of the more common of which are drowsiness, mental slowing,ataxia, tremor, hair loss, increased appetite, headache, insomnia, and rash.Nevertheless, recurrent seizures are physically dangerous and emotion-ally devastating, and preventing them outweighs many undesirable sideeffects of anticonvulsant drugs. Future Therapy. The goal of epilepsy treatment is to halt the seizures with minimal or no side effects and then to eradicate the cause. Most ofthe anticonvulsant research on cannabinoids was conducted before 1986.Since then, many new anticonvulsants have been introduced and cannab-inoid receptors have been discovered. At present, the only biological evi-dence of antiepileptic properties of cannabinoids is that CB 1 receptors are abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala. Both regions are involvedin partial seizures but are better known for their role in functions unre-lated to seizures. 26 Basic research might reveal stronger links between cannabinoids and seizure activity, but this is not likely to be as fruitful aMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

ElevenAlzheimer 's patients were treated for 12 weeks on an alternating schedule of dronabinol and placebo (six weeks of each treatment). The dronabinoltreatment resulted in substantial weight gains and declines in disturbedbehavior. 190 No serious side effects were observed. One patient had a sei- zure and was removed from the study, but the seizure was not necessarilycaused by dronabinol. Recurrent seizures without any precipitating eventsoccur in 20% of patients who have advanced dementia of Alzheimer 's type. 189 Nevertheless, these results are encouraging enough to recom- mend further clinical research with cannabinoids. The patients in the study discussed above were in long-term institu- tional care, and most were severely demented with impaired memory.Although short-term memory loss is a common side effect of THC inhealthy patients, it was not a concern in this study. However, the effect ofdronabinol on memory in Alzheimer 's patients who are not as severely disturbed as those in the above study would be an important consider-ation. GLAUCOMA After cataracts, glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness in the world; almost 67 million people are expected to be affected world-wide by the year 2000 149 (for an excellent review, see Alward, 19982). The most common form of glaucoma, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG),is a slowly progressive disorder that results in loss of retinal ganglioncells and degeneration of the optic nerve, causing deterioration of thevisual fields and ultimately blindness. The mechanisms behind the dis-ease are not understood, but three major risk factors are known: age, race,and high intraocular pressure (IOP). POAG is most prevalent among theelderly, with 1% affected in those over 60 years old and more than 9% inthose over 80. In African Americans over 80, there is more than a 10%chance of having the disease, and older African Caribbeans (who are lessracially mixed than African Americans) have a 20 -25% chance of having the disease. 106 The eye 's rigid shape is normally maintained in part by IOP, which isMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.174 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE regulated by the circulation of a clear fluid, the aqueous humor,* between the front of the lens and the back of the cornea. Because of impaired out-flow of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye, a high IOPis a risk factor for glaucoma, but the mechanism by which it damages theoptic nerve and retinal ganglion cells remains unclear. 174 The two leading possibilities are that high IOP interferes with nutrient blood flow to theregion of the optic nerve or that it interferes with transport of nutrients,growth factors, and other compounds within the optic nerve axon (P.Kaufman, IOM workshop). If the interference continues, the retinal gan-glion cells and optic nerve will permanently atrophy; the result is blind-ness. 68 Because high IOP is the only known major risk factor that can be controlled, most treatments have been designed to reduce it. However,reducing it does not always arrest or slow the progression of visualloss. 20,109 Marijuana and Cannabinoids in Glaucoma Marijuana and THC have been shown to reduce IOP by an average of 24% in people with normal IOP who have visual-field changes. In a num-ber of studies of healthy adults and glaucoma patients, IOP was reducedby an average of 25% a marijuana cigarette that containedapproximately 2% THC \u2014a reduction as good as that observed with most other medications available today. 1,16,32,76,77,125,193 Similar responses have been observed when marijuana was eaten or THC was given in pill form(10-40 mg) to healthy adults or glaucoma patients. 76,91 But the effect lasts only about three to four hours. Elevated IOP is a chronic condition andmust be controlled continuously. Intravenous administration of 9-THC, 8-THC, or 11-OH-THC to healthy adults substantially decreased IOP, whereas cannabinol, CBD,and -OH-THC had little effect. 31,146 The cause for the reduction in IOP remains unknown, but the effect appears to be independent of the fre-quently observed drop in arterial systolic blood pressure (Keith Green,Medical College of Georgia, personal communication). Three synthetic cannabinoids were investigated; BW29Y, BW146Y, and nabilone. They were given orally to patients who had high IOP.BW146Y and nabilone were as effective as ingesting THC or smoking *The cornea and lens must be optically clear, which means that there cannot be blood circulation in these tissues.

When 9-THC was applied topically as eye drops, whether once or four times a day, there was no decrease in IOP.60,90 Suspensions of lipo- philic THC tended to be irritating to the eye. In summary, cannabinoids and marijuana can reduce IOP when ad- ministered orally, intravenously, or by inhalation but not when adminis-tered topically. Even though a reduction in IOP by standard medicationsor surgery clearly slows the rate of glaucoma symptom progression, thereis no direct evidence of benefits of cannabinoids or marijuana in the natu-ral progression of glaucoma, visual acuity, or optic nerve atrophy. 92,115 In addition to lowering IOP, marijuana reduces blood pressure and has many psychological effects. Merritt and co-workers reported hypoten-sion, palpitations, and psychotropic effects in glaucoma patients after in-halation of marijuana. 125 Cooler and Gregg31 also reported increased anxi- ety and tachycardia after intravenous infusion of THC (1.5 -3 mg). All those side effects are problematic, particularly for elderly glaucoma pa-tients who have cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease . The reduction in blood pressure can be substantial and might adversely affect blood flowto the optic nerve. 124 Many people with systemic hypertension have their blood pressure reduced to manageable and acceptable levels throughmedication, but this does not seem to affect their IOP. In contrast, there isevidence that reduction in blood pressure to considerably below-normallevels influences IOP and ocular blood flow. 46,74,142 Hence, in the case of an eye with high IOP or an optic nerve in poor condition and susceptibil-ity to high IOP, reduced blood flow to the optic nerve could compromisea functional retina and be a factor in the progression of glaucoma. Because it is not known how these compounds work, it is also not known how they might interact with other drugs used to treat glaucoma.If the mechanism involves a final common pathway, the effects of cannab-inoids might not be additive and might even interfere with effective drugs. Therapy for Glaucoma Present Therapy Six classes of drugs are used to treat glaucoma; all reduce IOP (Table 4.6). 93 In the late 1970s, when early reports of the effects of marijuana on IOP surfaced, only cholinomimetics, epinephrine, and oral carbonic an-hydrase inhibitors were available. They are not popular today because oftheir side effects, such as pupil constriction or dilation, brow ache, tachy-cardia, and diuresis; all of them have been superseded by the other classesMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.176 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE of drugs.93 Surgical options are also available today to lower IOP, includ- ing laser trabeculoplasty, trabeculectomy/sclerostomy, drainage implan-tation, and cyclodestruction of fluid-forming tissues. 173 Thus, there are now many effective options to slow the progression of glaucoma by re-ducing IOP. One important factor in slowing the progression of glaucoma via medications that reduce IOP is patient compliance with dosing regimens.With respect to compliance, the ideal glaucoma drug is one that is appliedat most twice a day (P. Kaufman, IOM workshop). If the dose must berepeated every three to four hours, patient compliance becomes a prob-lem; for this reason, marijuana and the cannabinoids studied thus farwould not be highly satisfactory treatments for glaucoma. Present thera-pies, especially combinations of approved topical drugs, can control IOPwhen administered once or twice a day, at a cost of about $60 per month. Future Therapy In all likelihood the next generation of glaucoma therapies will deal with neural protection, neural rescue, neural regeneration, or blood flow,and the optic nerve and neural retina will be treated directly rather thanjust by lowering IOP (P. Kaufman, IOM workshop). There is some evi-dence that a synthetic cannabinoid, HU-211, might have neuroprotectiveeffects in vitro; this presents a potential approach that has nothing to do with IOP. 197 HU-211 is commonly referred to as a cannabinoid because its chemical structure is similar to THC; however, it does not bind to cannab-inoid receptor. It is known that cannabinoids lower IOP fairly substantially but not how. No one has tested whether the effect is receptor mediated (B. Martin,IOM workshop). To do so, one could test whether a receptor antagonistTABLE 4.6 Classes of Drugs Used Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.MEDICAL VALUE OF MARIJUANA AND RELATED SUBSTANCES 177 blocked the effects of THC or other cannabinoids. If the decrease were shown to be receptor mediated, it would be important to know whether itwas through CB 1, which mediates central nervous system effects, or CB2, which is not involved in CNS effects. If it were CB2, it might be possible to reduce IOP without the CNS side effects. Finally, it is not known whetherthe endogenous cannabinoid system is a natural regulator of IOP. Conclusion: Glaucoma Although glaucoma is one of the most frequently cited medical indi- cations for marijuana, the data do not support this indication. High intra-ocular pressure (IOP) is a known risk factor for glaucoma and can, indeed,be reduced by cannabinoids and marijuana. However, the effect is tooand short lived and requires too high doses, and there are too many sideeffects to recommend lifelong use in the treatment of glaucoma. The po-tential harmful effects of chronic marijuana smoking outweigh its modestbenefits in the treatment of glaucoma. Clinical studies on the effects ofsmoked marijuana are unlikely to result in improved treatment for glau-coma. Future research might reveal a therapeutic effect of isolated cannab- inoids. For example, it might be possible to design a cannabinoid drugwith longer-lasting effects on IOP and with less psychoactivity than THC. SUMMARY Advances in cannabinoid science of the past 16 years have given rise to a wealth of new opportunities for the development of medically usefulcannabinoid-based drugs. The accumulated data suggest a variety of in-dications, particularly for pain relief, antiemesis, and appetite stimula-tion. For patients such as those with AIDS or who are undergoing chemo-therapy, and who suffer simultaneously from severe pain, nausea, andappetite loss, cannabinoid drugs might offer broad-spectrum relief notfound in any other single medication. The data are weaker for musclespasticity but moderately promising. The least promising categories aremovement disorders, epilepsy, and glaucoma. Animal data are moder-ately supportive of a potential for cannabinoids in the treatment of move-ment disorders and might eventually yield stronger encouragement. Thetherapeutic effects of cannabinoids are most well established for THC,which is the primary psychoactive ingredient of marijuana. But it doesnot follow from this that smoking marijuana is good medicine. Although marijuana smoke delivers THC and other cannabinoids to the body, it also delivers harmful substances, including most of thosefound in tobacco smoke. In addition, plants contain a variable mixture ofMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.178 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE biologically active compounds and cannot be expected to provide a pre- cisely defined drug effect. For those reasons there is little future in smokedmarijuana as a medically approved medication. If there is any future incannabinoid drugs, it lies with agents of more certain, not less certain,composition. While clinical trials are the route to developing approvedmedications, they are also valuable for other reasons. For example, thepersonal medical use of smoked marijuana \u2014regardless of whether or not it is approved \u2014to treat certain symptoms is reason enough to advocate clinical trials to assess the degree to which the symptoms or course ofdiseases are affected. Trials testing the safety and efficacy of marijuanause are an important component to understanding the course of a disease,particularly diseases such as AIDS for which marijuana use is prevalent.The argument against the future of smoked marijuana for treating anycondition is not that there is no reason to predict efficacy but that there isrisk. That risk could be overcome by the development of a nonsmokedrapid-onset delivery system for cannabinoid drugs. There are two caveats to following the traditional path of drug devel- opment for cannabinoids. The first is timing. Patients who are currentlysuffering from debilitating conditions unrelieved by legally availabledrugs, and who might find relief with smoked marijuana, will find littlecomfort in a promise of a better drug 10 years from now. In terms of goodmedicine, marijuana should rarely be recommended unless all reasonableoptions have been eliminated. But then what? It is conceivable that themedical and scientific opinion might find itself in conflict with drug regu-lations. This presents a policy issue that must weigh \u2014at least tempo- rarily \u2014the needs of individual patients against broader social issues. Our assessment of the scientific data on the medical value of marijuana and itsconstituent cannabinoids is but one component of attaining that balance. The second caveat is a practical one. Although most scientists who study cannabinoids would agree that the scientific pathways to cannab-inoid drug development are clearly marked, there is no guarantee that thefruits of scientific research will be made available to the public. Cannab-inoid-based drugs will become available only if there is either enoughincentive for private enterprise to develop and market such drugs or sus-tained public investment in cannabinoid drug research and development.The perils along this pathway are discussed in chapter 5. Although mari-juana is an abused drug, the logical focus of research on the therapeuticvalue of cannabinoid-based drugs is the treatment of specific symptomsor diseases, not substance abuse. Thus, the most logical research sponsorswould be the several institutes within the National Institutes of Health ororganizations whose primary expertise lies in the relevant symptoms ordiseases.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

R ECOMMENDATION : Clinical trials of cannabinoid drugs for symp- tom management should be conducted with the goal of devel-oping rapid-onset, reliable, and safe delivery systems. R ECOMMENDATION : Clinical trials of marijuana use for medical purposes should be conducted under the following limited cir-cumstances: trials should involve only short-term marijuana use(less than six months), should be conducted in patients withconditions for which there is reasonable expectation of efficacy,should be approved by institutional review boards, and shouldcollect data about efficacy. R ECOMMENDATION : Short-term use of smoked marijuana (less than six months) for patients with debilitating symptoms (suchas intractable pain or vomiting) must meet the following condi-tions: failure of all approved medications to provide relief has been documented, the symptoms can reasonably be expected to be relieved by rapid-onset cannabinoid drugs, such treatment is administered under medical supervision in a manner that allows for assessment of treatment effec-tiveness, and involves an oversight strategy comparable to an institu- tional review board process that could provide guidancewithin 24 hours of a submission by a physician to providemarijuana to a patient for a specified use. Until a nonsmoked rapid-onset cannabinoid drug delivery system be- comes available, we acknowledge that there is no clear alternative forpeople suffering from chronic conditions that might be relieved by smok- ing marijuana, such as pain or AIDS wasting. One possible approach is totreat patients as n-of-1 clinical trials, in which patients are fully informed of their status as experimental subjects using a harmful drug delivery sys-tem and in which their condition is closely monitored and documentedunder medical supervision, thereby increasing the knowledge base of therisks and benefits of marijuana use under such conditions. We recom-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

OTHER REPORTS ON MARIJUANA AS MEDICINE Since 1996, five important reports pertaining to the medical uses of marijuana have been published, each prepared by deliberative groups ofmedical and scientific experts (Appendix E). They were written to ad-dress different facets of the medical marijuana debate, and each offers asomewhat different perspective. With the exception of the report by theHealth Council of the Netherlands, each concluded that marijuana can bemoderately effective in treating a variety of symptoms. They also agreethat current scientific understanding is rudimentary; indeed, the senti-ment most often stated is that more research is needed. And these reportsrecord the same problem with herbal medications as noted here: the un-certain composition of plant material makes for an uncertain, and henceoften undesirable, medicine. The 1996 report by the Health Council of the Netherlands concluded that there is insufficient evidence to justify the medical use of marijuanaor THC, despite the fact that the latter is an approved medication in the United States and Britain. However, that committee addressed onlywhether there was sufficient evidence to warrant the prescription of mari-juana or cannabinoids, not whether the data are sufficient to justify clini-cal trials. Conclusions of the Health Council of the Netherlands contrastwith that country 's tolerance of marijuana use. The health council 's report noted that marijuana use by patients in the terminal stages of illness istolerated in hospitals. It also said that the council did \"not wish to judge patients who consume marihuana (in whatever form) because it makesthem feel better. . . . \" In contrast, the American Medical Association House of Delegates, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the British Medical Associationrecommend clinical trials of smoked marijuana for a variety of symptoms.The NIH report, however, was alone in recommending clinical studies ofmarijuana for the treatment of glaucoma \u2014and even then there was dis- agreement among the panel members (William T. Beaver, chair, NIH AdHoc Expert Panel on the Medical Use of Marijuana, personal communica-tion, 1998). Recent reviews that have received extensive attention from those who follow the medical marijuana debate have been written by strong advo-cates for (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1993 62; Zimmer and Morgan, 1997198) or against (Voth and Schwartz, 1997191) the medical use of marijuana. Those reports represent the individual views of their authors, and they are notreviewed here but have been reviewed in major scientific journals. 7,69,178,180Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Even in cases where marijuana can providerelief of symptoms, the crude plant mixture does not meet this modern expectation. The future of medical marijuana lies in classical pharmacological drug development, andindeed there has been a resurgence of scientific, as well aspublic, interest in the therapeutic applications of cannab-inoids. After an initial burst of scientific activity in the1970s, today's renewed interest has been fueled by major scientific discoveries discussed in previous chapters: the identification andcloning of endogenous cannabinoid receptors, the discovery of endog-enous substances that bind to these receptors, and the emergence of syn-thetic cannabinoids that also bind to cannabinoid receptors. These scien-tific accomplishments have propelled interest in developing new drugsthat can treat more effectively or more safely the constellation of symp-toms for which cannabinoids might have therapeutic benefit (see chap-ter 4). Through the process of what is referred to as \"rational drug design,\"scientists manipulate the chemical structures of known cannabinoids todesign better therapeutic agents. Several new cannabinoids are beingdeveloped for human use, but none has reached the stage of human test-ing in the United States. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the process of and analyze the prospects for development of cannabinoid drugs. It first discusses theregulatory hurdles that every new drug encounters en route to market. Itthen proceeds to describe the regulatory and market experiences ofMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.194 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE dronabinol (tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, in sesame oil), the only ap- proved cannabinoid in the United States. These sections serve as a roadmap to determine whether the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids islikely to be exploited commercially to meet patient needs. Finally, thechapter describes what would be needed to bring marijuana to market asa medicinal plant. The term cannabinoids is used in this chapter to refer to a group of substances that are structurally related to THC\u2014by virtue of a tricyclicchemical structure\u2014or that bind to cannabinoid receptors, such as thenatural ligand anandamide. From a chemist's point of view, this defini-tion encompasses a variety of distinct chemical classes. But because thepurpose of this chapter is to explore prospects for drug development, bothchemical structure and pharmacological activity are important; therefore,the broader definition of cannabinoids is used. FEDERAL DRUG DEVELOPMENT POLICY Like controlled substances, cannabinoids developed for medical use encounter a gauntlet of public health regulatory controls administered bytwo federal agencies: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of theU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the DrugEnforcement Administration (DEA) of the U.S. Department of Justice. TheFDA regulates human testing and the introduction of new drugs into themarketplace, whereas the DEA determines the schedule of and establishesproduction quotas for drugs with potential for abuse to prevent theirdiversion to illicit channels. The DEA also authorizes registered physi-cians to prescribe controlled substances. Some drugs, such as marijuana,are labeled Schedule I in the Controlled Substance Act, and this adds con-siderable complexity and expense to their clinical evaluation. It is impor-tant to point out that Schedule I status does not necessarily apply to allcannabinoids. Food and Drug Administration Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, the FDA approves new drugs for entry into the marketplace after their safety andefficacy are established through controlled clinical trials conducted by thedrugs' sponsors. 23 FDA approval of a drug is the culmination of a long, research intensive process of drug development, which often takes wellover a decade. 19,44 Drug development is performed largely by pharma- ceutical companies, but some targeted drug development programs aresponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to stimulate furtherdevelopment and marketing by the private sector. The NIH's drug devel-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Drug development begins with discovery, that is, the synthesis and purification of a new compound with expected biological activity andtherapeutic value. The next major step is the testing of the compound inanimals to learn more about its safety and efficacy and to predict its utilityfor humans. Those early activities are collectively referred to as the pre-clinical phase. When evidence from the preclinical phase suggests a prom-ising role in humans, the manufacturer submits an Investigational NewDrug (IND) application to the FDA. The IND submission contains a planfor human clinical trials and includes the results of preclinical testing andother information. 20 Absent FDA objection, the IND becomes effective after 30 days, allowing the manufacturer to conduct clinical testing (test-ing in humans), which generally involves three phases (see Figure 5.1).The three stages of clinical testing are usually the most time-consumingphases of drug development, lasting five years on average. 22 The actual time depends on the complexity of the drug, availability of patients, dura-tion of use, difficulty of measuring clinical end points, therapeutic class,and indication (the disease or condition for which the drug has purportedbenefits). 31 Drug development is a long and financially risky process. For every drug that ultimately reaches clinical testing through an IND, thousands ofdrugs are synthesized and tested in the laboratory. And only about one infive drugs initially tested in humans successfully secures FDA approvalfor marketing through a new drug application (NDA). 19 The manufacturer submits an NDA to the FDA to gain approval for marketing when clinical testing is complete. An NDA is a massive docu-ment, the largest portion of which contains the clinical data from Phase I-III testing. The other technical sections of an NDA include chemistry,manufacturing, and controls; nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology;and human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. 23 In the case of a new cannabinoid, an abuse liability assessment would also probably be part ofan NDA submission. In 1996 the median time for FDA review of an NDA,from submission to approval, was 15.1 months, a review period consider-ably shorter than that in 1990, when the figure was 24.3 months. 22 The shortening of approval time is an outgrowth of the Prescription Drug UserFee Act of 1992, which authorized the FDA to hire additional review staffwith so-called user fees paid by industry and imposed clear deadlines forFDA action on an NDA. With respect to the cost of a single drug's devel-opment, a number of recent studies have provided a range of estimates ofMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

At that point, although any physician is at liberty to prescribe the approved drug for another indica-tion (an \"off-label use\"), the manufacturer cannot promote it for that indi-cation unless the new indication is granted separate marketing approvalby the FDA.* To obtain such approval, the manufacturer is required tocompile another application to the FDA for what is known variously as an\"efficacy supplement,\" a \"supplemental application,\" or a \"supplementalnew drug application.\" Those terms connote that the application is supple-mental to the NDA. In general, collecting new data for FDA approval ofan efficacy supplement is not as intensive a process as that for an NDA; itgenerally requires the firm to conduct two additional Phase III studies,although under some circumstances only one additional study of thedrug's efficacy is needed. 24 The preclinical studies, for example, ordi- narily need not be replicated. The average cost to the manufacturer forobtaining approval for the new indication is typically about $10-$40 mil-lion. 33 The review time to obtain FDA approval for the new indication can be considerable; a recent study of supplemental indications approvedby the FDA in 1989-1994 found the approval time to exceed that for theoriginal NDA, 18 a reflection, in part, of the lower priority that the FDA accords to the review of efficacy supplements as opposed to new drugs.23 The manufacturer also must apply to the FDA to receive marketing approval for a new formulation of a previously approved drug. A newformulation is a new dosage form, including a new route of administra-tion. An example of such a new formulation is an inhaled version ofMarinol, which is currently approved only in capsule form. The manufac-turer is required to establish bioequivalence, safety, and efficacy of thenew formulation. The amount of evidence required for approval is highlyvariable, depending on the similarities between the new formulation andthe approved formulation. New formulations are evaluated case by caseby the FDA. In the case of Marinol, for example, an inhaled version islikely to require not only new studies of efficacy but also new studies ofabuse liability. There appear to be no published peer-reviewed studies ofthe average cost and time for approval of a new formulation. Two other FDA programs might be relevant to the potential availabil- *FDA policies for off-label use are being transformed as a result of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. The FDA recently promulgated new rules togive manufacturers greater flexibility to disseminate information about off-label uses (FDA, 1998b 24a). As of this writing, however, court decisions have left the status of the new rules somewhat unclear.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

One program is authorized under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which provides incentives to manufacturers to developdrugs to treat \"orphan diseases.\" An orphan disease, as defined in anamendment to the act, is one that affects 200,000 or fewer people in theUnited States.* The act's most important incentive is a period of exclusivemarketing protection of seven years, during which time the FDA is pro-hibited from approving the same drug for the same indication. 5,6 Some of the medical conditions for which cannabinoids have been advocated\u2014Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury (see chap-ter 4)\u2014might meet the definition of an orphan disease and thus enablemanufacturers to take advantage of the act's financial incentives to bringproducts to market. If a disease affects more than 200,000 people, themanufacturer sometimes subdivides the patient population into smallerunits to qualify. For example, a drug for the treatment of Parkinson's dis-ease is not likely to receive an orphan designation because its prevalenceexceeds 200,000, but orphan designation has been accorded to drugs forsubsets of Parkinson's patients, such as those suffering from early-morn-ing motor dysfunction in the late stages of the disease. 25 The other program is the Treatment-IND program, which was estab- lished by regulation in 1987 (and codified into law in 1997) to allowpatients with serious and life-threatening diseases to obtain experimentalmedications, such as marijuana, before their general marketing. Treat- ment INDs may be issued during Phase III studies to patients who are notenrolled in clinical trials, provided among other requirements that nocomparable alternative drug is available. 22,32,33 Thus, the treatment IND program can provide a mechanism for some patients to obtain a promis-ing new cannabinoid before its widespread commercial availability if itreached the late stages of clinical testing for a serious or life-threateningdisease. Drug Enforcement Administration The DEA is responsible for scheduling controlled substances, that is, drugs and other agents that possess a potential for abuse. Abuse is gener- ally defined as nonmedical use that leads to health and safety hazards,diversion from legitimate channels, self-administration, and other unto-ward results. 15,21 The legislation that gives DEA the authority to regulate *The FDA can grant orphan designation to a drug intended for a condition that affects a larger population if the manufacturer's estimated expenses are unlikely to be recovered by sales in the United States (Public Law 98-551). Marijuana cigarettes were available under a special FDA-sponsored Compassionate Investigational New Drug Program for desperately ill patients until March 1992, when the program was closed to new participants.48Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.DEVELOPMENT OF CANNABINOID DRUGS 199 drugs of abuse is the Controlled Substances Act, which was passed in 1970 and amended several times. The overall purpose of the CSA is torestrict or control the availability of drugs to prevent their abuse. Under the CSA, the DEA places each drug that has abuse potential into one of five categories. The five categories, referred to as Schedules I-V, carry different degrees of restriction. Schedule I is the most restrictive,covering drugs that have \"no accepted medical use\" in the United Statesand that have high abuse potential. The definitions of the categories andexamples of drugs in each are listed in Appendix C. Each schedule is asso-ciated with a distinct set of controls that affect manufacturers, investiga-tors, pharmacists, practitioners, patients, and recreational users. Thecontrols include registration with the DEA, labeling and packaging, pro-duction quotas, security, recordkeeping, and dispensing. 15 For instance, patients with a legitimate medical need for drugs in Schedule II, the mostrestrictive schedule for drugs \"currently with accepted medical use,\" canneither refill their prescriptions nor have them telephoned to a pharmacy(except in an emergency). The scheduling of substances under the CSA is handled case by case. It may be initiated by DEA, by DHHS, or by petition from an interestedparty, including the drug's manufacturer or a public-interest group. 15 The final decision for scheduling rests with the DEA, but for this purpose thesecretary of DHHS is mandated to provide a recommendation. Thesecretary's recommendation* to DEA is based in part on results fromabuse liability testing that the FDA requires of the manufacturer seekingapproval of a new drug. Abuse liability testing is not a single test; it is acompilation of several in vitro human and animal studies, of which some of the best known are drug self-administration and drug discriminationstudies. 21,34 The secretary's recommendation for scheduling is formally guided by eight legal criteria, including the drug's actual or relative po-tential for abuse, scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, risk topublic health, and its psychic or physiological dependence liability (21U.S.C. \u00a7 811 (b), (c)). Once the DEA receives a scheduling recommenda-tion, its scheduling decision, including the requirement for obtaining pub-lic comment, usually takes weeks to months. 33 In practice, the DEA usu- ally adheres to the recommendation of the secretary. Beyond the DEA, *The FDA and the National Institute of Drug Abuse, two agencies of DHHS, work jointly to develop the medical and scientific analysis that is forwarded to the secretary, who makes a recommendation to the administrator of the DEA (DEA, 199815). Under the CSA, \"the recommendations of the Secretary to the Attorney General shall be binding on the Attorney General as to such scientific and medical matters, and if the Secre- tary recommends that a drug or other substance not be controlled, the Attorney General shall not control the drug or other substance\" (21 U.S.C.\u00a7 811 (b)).Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.200 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE various state scheduling laws also affect the manufacture and distribu- tion of controlled substances.33,50 Under the CSA, marijuana and THC* are in Schedule I, the most restrictive schedule. The scheduling of any other cannabinoid under thisact first hinges on whether it is found in the plant . All cannabinoids in the plant are automatically in Schedule I because they fall under the act'sdefinition of marijuana (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802 (16)). In addition, under DEA'sregulations, synthetic equivalents of the substances contained in the plantand \"synthetic substances, derivatives, and their isomers\" whose \"chemi-cal pharmacological activity\" are \"similar\" in (21 CFR \u00a7 1308.11(d)(27). Based on the ex-amples listed in the regulations, the word similar probably limits the applicability of the regulation to isomers of THC, but DEA's interpreta-tion of its own regulations would carry significant weight in any specificsituation. Prompted by a 1995 petition from Jon Gettman, a former president of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML),to remove marijuana and THC from Schedule I, DEA gathered informa-tion which was then submitted to DHHS for a medical and scientific rec-ommendation and scheduling recommendation, as required by the CSA.For the reasons noted above, any changes in scheduling of marijuana andTHC would also affect other plant cannabinoids. For the present, how-ever, any cannabinoid found in the plant is automatically controlled inSchedule I. Investigators are affected by Schedule I requirements even if their re- search is being conducted in vitro or on animals. For example, researchers studying cannabinoids found in the plant are required under the CSA tosubmit their research protocol to DEA, which issues a registration that iscontingent on FDA's evaluation and approval of the protocol (21 CFR \u00a71301.18). DEA also inspects the researcher's security arrangements. How-ever, the regulatory implications are quite different for cannabinoids not found in the plant . Such cannabinoids appear to be unscheduled unless the FDA or DEA decides that they are sufficiently similar to THC to be placedautomatically into Schedule I under the regulatory definition outlinedabove or the FDA or the manufacturer deems them to have potential forabuse, thereby triggering de novo the scheduling process noted above. Thus far, the cannabinoids most commonly used in preclinical research(Table 5.1) appear to be sufficiently distinct from THC that they are notcurrently considered controlled substances by definition (F. Sapienza,DEA, personal communication, 1998). No new cannabinoids other than *Technically, the CSA and the regulations use the term \"tetrahydrocannabinols.\"Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The unscheduled status of some cannabinoids mightchange as research progresses. Results of early clinical research could leada manufacturer to proceed with or lead the FDA to require abuse liabilitytesting. Depending on the results of such studies, DHHS might or mightnot recommend scheduling de novo to DEA, which makes the final deci- sion case by case. Will newly discovered cannabinoids be subject to scheduling? That is a complex question that has no simple answer. The answer depends en-tirely on each new cannabinoid\u2014whether it is found in the plant, itschemical and pharmacological relationship to THC, and its potential forabuse. Novel cannabinoids with strong similarity to THC are likely to bescheduled at some point before marketing, whereas those with weak simi-larity might not be. The manufacturer's submission to FDA, which con-tains its own studies and its request for a particular schedule, can alsoshape the outcome. Cannabinoids found in the plant are automatically inSchedule I until the manufacturer requests and provides justification forrescheduling. The CSA does permit DEA to reschedule a substance (moveit to a different schedule) and to deschedule a substance (remove it fromcontrol under the CSA) according to the scheduling criteria (see Appen-dix F) and the process outlined above. The possibility of scheduling is a major determinant of whether a manufacturer proceeds with drug development. 33 In general, pharma- ceutical firms perceive scheduling to be a deterrent because it limits theirability to achieve market share for the following reasons: restricted access,TABLE 5.1 Cannabinoids and Related Compounds Commonly Used 55,212-2 and Mechoulam et al. (1998).36Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.202 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE physician disinclination to prescribe scheduled substances, stigma, the ad- ditional expense for abuse liability studies, and expensive delays in reach-ing the market due to federal and state scheduling processes. 33 Empirical evidence to support that widely held perception is difficult to find, but atleast one large survey of physicians found them to have moderate con-cerns about prescribing opioids because of actual or perceived pressurefrom regulatory agencies, such as DEA. 57 On the basis of a legal analysis and widespread complaints from researchers and pharmaceutical execu-tives, the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 1995) 33 recommended changes in the CSA to eliminate the act's barriers to undertaking clinical researchand development of controlled substances; this position was supported ina later report on marijuana. 40 DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF MARINOL The following material is based on the published literature (where cited), workshops sponsored by the IOM, and an interview with Robert Dudley,senior vice president of Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the manufac-turer of Marinol and the holder of the NDA. Unimed markets Marinoljointly with Roxane Laboratories, Inc. Marinol (dronabinol) is the only cannabinoid with approval for marketing in the United States.* The following description covers itsdevelopment, regulatory history, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, abuseliability, and market growth. The experience with Marinol can serve as apossible bellwether for the regulatory and commercial fate of new can-nabinoids being considered for development. Development and Regulatory History Marinol is manufactured as a capsule containing THC in sesame oil; it is taken orally. It was approved by the FDA in 1985 for the treatment ofnausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. In 1992, theFDA approved marketing of dronabinol for the treatment of anorexia as-sociated with weight loss in patients with AIDS. 45 The preclinical and clinical research on THC that culminated in the FDA's 1985 approval wassupported primarily by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), whose re-search support goes back to the 1970s. NCI's contribution appears piv-otal, considering that Unimed, the pharmaceutical company that holds *The only cannabinoid licensed outside the United States is nabilone (Cesamet), which is an analogue of THC available in the United Kingdom for the management of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy (Pertwee, 1997).46Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.DEVELOPMENT OF CANNABINOID DRUGS 203 the NDA, estimates its contribution to have been only about 25% of the total research effort. The FDA's review and approval of Marinol tookabout two years after submission of the NDA, according to Unimed. Toobtain approval for Marinol's second indication (through an efficacysupplement), the FDA required two more relatively small Phase III stud-ies. The studies lasted three years and cost $5 million to complete. Physical Properties, Pharmacokinetics, and Adverse Events Marinol is synthesized in the laboratory rather than extracted from the plant. Its manufacture is complex and expensive because of the nu-merous steps needed for purification. The poor solubility of Marinol inaqueous solutions and its high first-pass metabolism in the liver accountfor its poor bioavailability; only 10-20% of an oral dose reaches the sys-temic circulation. 45,60 The onset of action is slow; peak plasma concentra- tions are not attained until two to four hours after dosing.45,56 In contrast, inhaled marijuana is rapidly absorbed. In a study comparing THC admin-istered orally, by inhalation, and intravenously, both inhalation and intravenous ad-ministration; most participants' peak plasma concentrations after oral ad-ministration occurred at 60 or 90 minutes. Variation in individual re-sponses is highest for oral THC and bioavailability is lowest. 42 Marinol's most common adverse events are associated with the central nervous system (CNS): anxiety, confusion, depersonalization, dizziness,euphoria, dysphoria, somnolence, and thinking abnormality. 8,9,45,59 In two recent clinical trials, CNS adverse events occurred in about one-third ofpatients, but only a small percentage discontinued the drug because ofadverse effects. 8,9 Lowering the dose of dronabinol can minimize side effects, especially dysphoria (disquiet or malaise).47 Abuse Potential and Scheduling On commercial introduction in 1985, Marinol was placed in Schedule II. This schedule, the second most restrictive, is reserved for medicallyapproved substances that have \"high potential for abuse\" (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b) (2)). Unimed did not encounter any delays in marketing as a result ofthe scheduling process because the scheduling decision was made by theDEA before FDA's approval for marketing. Nor did Unimed encounterany marketing delays as a result of state scheduling laws. Unimed wasnot specifically asked by the FDA to perform abuse liability studies forthe first approval, presumably because such studies had been conductedearlier. Unimed later petitioned the DEA to reschedule Marinol from Sched-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.204 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE ule II to Schedule III, which is reserved for medically approved substances that have some potential for abuse (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (b) (3)). To buttress itsrequest for rescheduling, Unimed supported an analysis of Marinol'sabuse liability by researchers at the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic of SanFrancisco, which treats many cannabis-dependent patients and peoplewho have HIV/AIDS. The analysis found no evidence of abuse or diver-sion of Marinol after a literature review and surveys and interviews ofmedical specialists in addiction, oncology, cancer research, and treatmentof HIV, and people in law enforcement. The authors attribute Marinol'slow abuse potential to its slow onset of action, its dysphoric effects, andother factors. 12 On November 5, 1998, the DEA announced a proposal to reschedule Marinol to Schedule III.17 As of this writing, no formal action on that proposal had been taken. The rescheduling of a drug from Schedule II to Schedule III is consid- ered important because it lifts some of the restrictions on availability. Forexample, Unimed expects a sales increase of about 15-20% as a result ofrescheduling. In its judgment and that of many other pharmaceutical com-panies, 33 scheduling limits market penetration; the more restrictive the schedules, the greater the limitation. The reasons are that physicians andother providers are reluctant to prescribe Schedule II drugs; patients aredeterred from seeking prescriptions because of Schedule II prohibition ofrefills, as opposed to other commercially available scheduled substances;additional restrictions are imposed by several states, such as quantity re-strictions (for example, 30-day supply limits) and triplicate prescriptions; 50 and some Schedule II drugs are excluded from hospital formularies be-cause of onerous security and paperwork requirements under federal andstate controlled substances laws. Market Growth and Transformation Annual sales of Marinol are estimated at $20 million, according to Unimed. Of Marinol's patient population 80% use it for HIV, 10% for can-cer chemotherapy, and about 5-10% for other reasons. The latter group isthought to consist of Alzheimer's patients drawn to the drug by a recentlypublished clinical study indicating Marinol's promise for the treatment oftheir anorexia and disturbed behavior. 58 As noted earlier, Unimed cannot promote Marinol for this unlabeled indication, but physicians are free toprescribe it for such an indication. Unimed is conducting additional re-search in pursuit of FDA approval of a new indication for Marinol in thetreatment of Alzheimer disease. The 1992 approval of Marinol for the treatment of anorexia in AIDS patients marked a major transformation in the composition of the patientpopulation. Marinol's use had been restricted to oncology patients. TheMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.DEVELOPMENT OF CANNABINOID DRUGS 205 oncology market for Marinol gradually receded as a result of the intro- duction of newer medications, including such serotonin antagonists asondansetron, which are more effective (see chapter 4, \"Nausea and Vom-iting) and are not scheduled. Much of the recent growth of the market forMarinol (which is about 10% per year) is attributed to its increasing useby HIV patients being treated with combination antiretroviral therapy.Marinol appears to have a dual effect, not only stimulating appetite butalso combating the nausea and vomiting associated with combinationtherapy. Unimed is supporting a Phase II study to examine this combinedeffect and, with promising results, plans to seek FDA approval for thisnew indication. Unimed has two forms of market protection for Marinol. In Decem- ber 1992, the FDA granted Marinol seven years of exclusive marketingunder the Orphan Drug Act. The market exclusivity is related to Marinol'suse in anorexia associated with AIDS. Because of the designated orphanindication, the active ingredient, THC, cannot be marketed by anothermanufacturer for the same indication until December 1999. Other phar-maceutical manufacturers are not constrained from manufacturing andmarketing THC for its other indication, antiemesis for cancer chemo- therapy, but none appears to be interested in what is, by pharmaceuticalcompany standards, a small market. In addition to market exclusivity,Unimed secured in June 1998 a \"use patent\" for dronabinol for the treat-ment of disturbed patients with dementia; this confers patent protectionto Unimed for this use for 20 years from the date of filing of the applica-tion,* assuming that this indication eventually gains FDA approval. The rate-limiting factors in the growth of the market for Marinol, ac- cording to Unimed are the lack of physician awareness of the drug's effi-cacy, its adverse effects, and its restricted availability as a result of place-ment in Schedule II. Unimed perceives only a small percentage of itsmarket to be lost to \"competition\" from marijuana itself, but there are,admittedly, no reliable statistics on the number of people who have chosento treat their symptoms with illegally obtained marijuana, despite theirability to obtain Marinol. New Routes of Administration It is well recognized that Marinol's oral route of administration ham- pers its effectiveness because of slow absorption and patients' desire for *A use patent\u2014also known as a process patent\u2014accords protection for a method of using a composition or compound. A use patent is not considered as strong as a product patent, which prohibits others from manufacturing, using, or selling the product for all uses, rather than for the specific use defined in a use patent.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.206 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE more control over dosing. A drug delivered orally is first absorbed from the stomach or small intestine and then passed through the liver, where itundergoes some metabolism before being introduced into the circulation.To overcome the deficiencies of oral administration, Unimed activated anIND in 1998 as a step toward developing new formulations for Marinol.Four new formulations\u2014deep lung aerosol, nasal spray, nasal gel, andsublingual preparation\u2014are under study in Phase I clinical studies beingconducted in conjunction with Roxane Laboratories. These formulationsseek to deliver Marinol to the circulation more rapidly and directly. Thefirst two fall under inhalation as a route of administration. Inhalation isconsidered the most promising method, owing to the rapidity of onset ofits effects and potential for better titration of the dose by the patient, but itmight also carry an increased potential for abuse. The abuse of a drugcorrelates with its rapidity of onset (G. Koob, IOM workshop). Sublingualroute (under the tongue) administration also affords rapid absorption intothe circulation, in this case from the oral mucosa. Other researchers arepursuing the delivery of THC through rectal suppositories, but this slowerroute might not be acceptable to many patients. Transdermal (skinpatches) administration, which is best suited to hydrophilic drugs, is pre-cluded by the lipophilicity of THC. Thus, the choice of routes of adminis-tration depends heavily on the physicochemical characteristics of the drugand on its safety, abuse liability, and tolerability. Unimed expects the FDA to require it to conduct studies of the bio- availability, efficacy, and possibly abuse liability of any new formulationit seeks to market. Any formulation that expedites Marinol's onset of ac-tion, as suggested above, is thought to carry greater possibility of abuse.The cost of developing each new formulation is estimated by Unimed at$7-$10 million. Unimed and Roxane are developing, or considering development of, five new indications for Marinol: disturbed behavior in Alzheimer's dis-ease, nausea and vomiting in HIV patients who are receiving combinationtherapy, spasticity in multiple sclerosis, intractable pain, and anorexia incancer and renal disease. Costs of Marinol and Marijuana During the IOM public workshops held during the course of this study, many people commented that an important advantage of usingmarijuana for medical purposes is that it is much less expensive thanMarinol. But this comparison is deceptive. While the direct costs of mari-juana are relatively low, the indirect costs can be prohibitive. Individualswho violate federal or state marijuana laws risk a variety of costs associ-ated with engaging in criminal activity, ranging from increased vulner-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.DEVELOPMENT OF CANNABINOID DRUGS 207 ability to theft and personal injury legal fees to long prison terms. In addi- tion, when purchasing illicit drugs there is no guarantee that the productpurchased is what the seller claims it is or that it is not contaminated. The price of Marinol for its most commonly used indication, anorexia in AIDS, is estimated at $200 per month. The less common indication\u2014nausea and vomiting with cancer chemotherapy\u2014is not as expensive be-cause it is not chronic. Regardless of indication, patients' out-of-pocketexpenses tend to be much less\u2014often minimal\u2014because of reimburse-ment through public or private health insurance. For indigent patientswho are uninsured, Roxane sponsors a patient assistance program to de-fray the cost. The street value of marijuana, according to the DEA's most recent figures, is about $5-$10 per bag of loose plant. 16* At the California buyers' clubs, the price is $2-$16 per gram, depending on the grade of marijuana.The cost to a patient using marijuana depends on the number of cigarettessmoked each day, their THC content, and the duration of use. Insurancedoes not cover the cost of marijuana. In addition, it is possible for a personto cultivate marijuana privately with little financial investment. Thus, Marinol appears to be less expensive than marijuana for pa- tients with health insurance or with financial assistance from Roxane. Butif the full cost of Marinol is borne out of pocket by the patient, the costcomparison is not so unambiguous. In this case the daily cost in relationto marijuana varies according to the number of cigarettes smoked: If thepatient smokes two or more marijuana cigarettes per day, Marinol mightbe less expensive than marijuana; if the patient smokes only one mari-juana cigarette per day, Marinol might be more expensive than marijuana,according to an analysis submitted to the DEA by Unimed. The cost com-parisons will depend on fluctuations in the retail price and street value ofMarinol and marijuana, respectively, and will vary if marijuana becomescommercially available. In summary, Marinol has been on the U.S. market since 1985. Its com- mercial development depended heavily on research supported by theNIH. Marinol's market has grown to $20 million in annual sales. Furthermarket growth is expected but is still constrained by lack of awareness,adverse effects, the oral route of administration, and restrictions imposedby drug scheduling. The manufacturer is proceeding with research onnew forms of delivery to overcome the problems associated with oral ad-ministration. The manufacturer also is proceeding with research on anarray of new indications for Marinol. *The DEA did not provide an estimate of the weight of marijuana per bag.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

It extends well beyond antiemesis for chemotherapy and appetite stimula-tion for AIDS, the two indications for which the FDA has approveddronabinol (Marinol). Chapter 4 of this report assesses the possible widertherapeutic potential of marijuana and THC in neurological disorders,glaucoma, and analgesia\u2014all conditions for which clinical research hasbeen under way to fulfill unmet patient needs. New therapeutic uses arebeing explored in preclinical research. For any of these therapeutic indica-tions, will novel cannabinoids reach the market to satisfy the medicalneeds of patients? Economic Factors in Development The outcomes of preclinical and clinical research determine whether a drug is sufficiently safe and effective to warrant FDA approval formarketing. But the decisions to launch preclinical research and to proceedto clinical trials if early results are promising are dictated largely by eco-nomic factors. A pharmaceutical company must decide whether to investin what is universally regarded as a long and risky research path. For anygiven drug the question is, Will there be an adequate return on invest-ment? The investment in this case is the high cost of developing a drug.The expectation of high financial returns on investment is what drivesdrug development. 44,53 Market analyses are undertaken to forecast whether a drug will reap a substantial return on investment. The market analysis for a cannabinoidis likely to be shaped by various factors. The average cost of developing acannabinoid is likely to be higher than that of developing other drugs ifits clinical indication is in the therapeutic categories of neuropharma-ceutical or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, the two therapeutic cat-egories associated with the highest research and development costs. 19 One reason for higher costs is the need to satisfy the DEA's regulatory require-ments related to drug scheduling. On the \"market return\" side are multiple factors. A market analysis examines the expected returns from the possible markets for which a can-nabinoid could be clinically pursued. The financial size of each market iscalculated mostly on the basis of the current and projected patient preva-lence (for a given clinical indication), sales data (if available), and compe-tition from other products. The duration of use is also factored in\u2014a drugneeded for long-term use in a condition with an early age of onset is desir-able from a marketing perspective. Factors that can augment or diminishmarket return include patentability and other forms of market protection,Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.DEVELOPMENT OF CANNABINOID DRUGS 209 reimbursement climate, restrictions in access due to drug scheduling, social attitudes, adverse effect profile, and drug interactions.33,53 New cannabinoids generally can receive product patents, giving the patentholder 20 years of protection from others seeking to manufacture or sellthe same product. According to U.S. patent law, the product must be noveland \"nonobvious\" in relation to prior patents. 28 Cannabinoids under Development From publicly available sources, the IOM was able to learn of several cannabinoids being developed for human use (Table 5.2). With the excep-tion of Marinol and marijuana, all are in the preclinical phase of testingin the United States. This list might not be comprehensive, inasmuch asother compounds could be under development, but that information isTABLE 5.2 Cannabinoids Under Development for Human Use Name of Stage of U.S. FDA Possible Drug Investigator Development Pharmacology Status Indication(s) HU-211 Pharmos Corp.

All rights reserved.210 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE proprietary.* The table does not list the full complement of cannabinoids, both agonists and antagonists, being used in research as tools to under-stand the pharmacology of cannabinoids (for more comprehensive lists ofcannabinoids, see Felder it list cannabinoids once con- sidered for development but later discontinued. An 18-year survey of an-algesics in development in 1980-1998 found that six of the nine cannab-inoids under development for analgesia were discontinued orundeveloped, 49, but work on most of these was halted before 1988, when the first endogenous cannabinoid receptor was discovered (chapter 3). Three points can be made on the basis of Table 5.2. First, virtually all of the listed cannabinoids are being developed by small pharmaceuticalcompanies or by individuals. In general, that implies that their develop-ment is considered especially risky from a commercial standpoint in thatsmall companies are often willing to assume greater development risksthan larger more established firms (W. Schmidt, personal communication,1998). Without the benefit of sales revenues, small companies are able tofund their research through financing from venture capital, stock offer-ings, and relationships with established pharmaceutical companies. 43 Second, with the exception of THC, no constituents of the marijuana plant appear to be undergoing development by pharmaceutical compa-nies. A number of plant compounds have been tested in experimentalmodels and humans. For example, the antiemetic properties and negli-gible side effects of 8-THC were demonstrated in a clinical trial in children who were undergoing cancer chemotherapy,1 but no sponsor was interested in developing 8-THC for commercial purposes (R. Mechoulam, Hebrew University, personal communication, 1998). The ab-sence of plant cannabinoids under development implies that the specterof automatic placement in Schedule I under the CSA is an important de-terrent, even though rescheduling would occur before marketing. The point from the earlier discussion is that automatic, as opposed to de novo , scheduling appears to cast a pall over development of a cannabinoidfound in the plant. Another impediment is that a cannabinoid extracted *Information about the existence of an IND is proprietary; it can be confirmed only by the manufacturer, not the FDA. Discontinued: a result of the FDA's approval of an NDA, the drug would be, at a minimum, re- scheduled in Schedule II.

All rights reserved.DEVELOPMENT OF CANNABINOID DRUGS 211 from the plant is not likely to fulfill the criteria for a product patent, al- though other forms of market protection are possible. Marinol, for ex-ample, was accorded orphan drug status and its manufacturer obtained ause patent. Third, cannabinoids are being developed for therapeutic applications beyond those discussed earlier in this chapter and in chapter 4. One of themost prominent new applications of cannabinoids is for \"neuro-protection,\" the rescue of neurons from cell death associated with trauma,ischemia, and neurological diseases. 29,36 Cannabinoids are thought to be neuroprotective\u2014through receptor-dependent51 as well as receptor- independent pathways; both THC, which binds to CB1 receptors, and CBD, which does not, are potent antioxidants, effective neuroprotectantsbecause of their ability to reduce the toxic forms of oxygen (free radicals)that are formed during cellular stress. 29 The synthetic cannabinoid HU-211 (dexanabinol) is an antioxidant and an antagonist of the NMDAreceptor, rather than an agonist at the cannabinoid receptor. 52 Earlier research demonstrated that HU-211 protects neurons from neurotoxicityinduced by excess concentrations of the excitatory neurotransmitterglutamate. Excess release of glutamate, which acts by binding to theNMDA receptor, is associated with trauma and disease. 54 As an NMDA antagonist, HU-211 blocks the damaging action of glutamate and otherendogenous neurotoxic agents. 52,55 After having been studied in the United Kingdom in Phase I clinical trials, HU-211 progressed to Phase IIclinical trials in Israel for treatment of severe closed-head trauma (Knolleret al., 1998). 35 Market Prospects It is difficult to gauge the market prospects for new cannabinoids. There certainly appears to be scientific interest, particularly for the dis-covery of new cannabinoids, but whether this interest can be sustainedcommercially through the arduous course of drug development is an openquestion. Research and development experience is limited; only one can-nabinoid, dronabinol, is commercially available, and most of its researchand development costs were shouldered by the federal government. Fur-thermore, the size of dronabinol's market (at about $20 million) is modestby pharmaceutical company standards. None of the other cannabinoidsin development has reached clinical testing in the United States. Theirscientific, regulatory, and commercial fates are likely to be very importantin shaping future investment patterns. Experience with the drug schedul-ing process also is likely to be watched very carefully. If the early prod-ucts are heavily regulated in the absence of strong abuse liability, futuredevelopment might be deterred. For the present, what seems to be clearMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.212 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE from the dearth of products in development and the small size of the com- panies sponsoring them is that cannabinoid development is seen as espe-cially risky. One scenario is that cannabinoids will be pursued for lucrative mar- kets that reflect large unmet medical needs. Of the therapeutic needs forwhich cannabinoid receptor agonists have been tested, analgesia is by farthe largest. The annual U.S. prescription and over-the-counter analgesicmarket in 1997 was $4.4 billion. 49 Given the long-standing need for less addictive, safer, easier to use, and more effective drugs for acute andchronic pain, it would not be surprising to see cannabinoids developed totreat some segments of the current analgesic market, if their safety andeffectiveness were clearly established in clinical trials. In addition to cannabinoid receptor agonists, two classes of cannab- inoid-related drugs might prove therapeutically useful: cannabinoidantagonists and inverse agonists, compounds that bind to receptors butproduce effects opposite those of agonists. Neither would be subject tothe same scheduling concerns as cannabinoid agonists because they arenot found in marijuana and would be highly unlikely to have any abusepotential. Another set of cannabinoid-related drugs, such as those thataffect the synthesis, uptake, or inactivation of endogenous cannabinoidsmight, however, have abuse potential because they would influence thesignal strength of endogenous cannabinoids. The development of specific cannabinoid antagonists, like SR141716A for CB 1 receptors and SR144528 for CB2 receptors, has provided a sub- stantial impetus to understand cannabinoid actions. Those compoundsblock many of the effects of THC in animals, and their testing in humanshas just begun. Cannabinoid antagonists have physiological effects ontheir own, in the absence of THC. They might have important therapeuticpotential in a variety of clinical situations. For example, THC reducesshort-term memory, so it is possible that a CB 1 antagonist like SR141716A could act as a memory-enhancing agent. Similarly, for conditions in whichcannabinoids decrease immune function (presumably by binding to CB 2 receptors in immune cells), a CB2 antagonist might be useful as an immune stimulant. Cannabinoid inverse agonists would exert effects opposite those of THC and might thus cause appetite loss, short-term memory enhance-ment, nausea, or anxiety. Those effects could possibly be separated bymolecular design, in which case inverse agonists might have some thera-peutic value. One report has been published suggesting that the CB 1 receptor antagonist, SR141617A,11 is an inverse agonist, and there will likely be others.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

One sponsor has an IND for a clinical safety study on HIVanorexia (D. Abrams, University of California at San Francisco, personalcommunication, 1998). Another has an IND pending for the treatment ofmigraine headaches (E. Russo, Western Montana Clinic, personal com-munication, 1998). Since 1970, marijuana's manufacture and distributionhave been tightly restricted under the CSA, which places marijuana inSchedule I, which is reserved for drugs or other substances with \"a highpotential for abuse,\" \"no currently accepted U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1)). Marijuana has remained in Schedule I despite persistent efforts at re- scheduling since the 1970s by advocacy groups, such as NORML. Throughpetitions to the DEA, advocacy groups contend that marijuana does notfit the legal criteria for a Schedule I substance, owing to its purportedmedical uses and lack of high abuse liability. 3,4,48 Another rescheduling petition, which was filed in 1995, is being evaluated by the FDA and DEA. Availability for Research To use marijuana for research purposes, researchers must register with the DEA, as well as adhere to other relevant requirements of the CSAand other federal statutes, such as the FD&C act. The National Instituteon Drug Abuse (NIDA), one of the institutes of NIH, is the only organiza-tion in the United States licensed by the DEA to manufacture and distrib-ute marijuana for research purposes. NIDA performs this function underits Drug Supply Program. Through this program, NIDA arranges for marijuana, to be grown and processed through contracts with two organi-zations: the University of Mississippi and the Research Triangle Institute.The University of Mississippi grows, harvests, and dries marijuana; andthe institute processes it into cigarettes. A researcher can obtain marijuanafree of charge from NIDA through an NIH-approved research grant toinvestigate marijuana, or through a separate protocol review. 39 Research grant approvals are handled through the conventional NIH peer review *Under the CSA, its only legal use is in research under strictly defined conditions. This is also the program through which several patients receive marijuana under a com- passionate use program monitored by the FDA. For history and information on this effort, see Randall (1993).48Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.214 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE process for extramural research, a highly competitive process with a suc- cess rate in 1997 of 32% of approved NIDA grants.41 Through the sepa- rate protocol review, in which a researcher funds research independentlyof an NIH grant, NIDA submits the researcher's protocol to several exter-nal reviewers who evaluate the protocol on the basis of scientific meritand relevance to the mission of NIDA and NIH. Through those two avenues marijuana has been supplied to several research groups\u2014most of those that apply. While there has been muchdiscussion of NIDA's alleged failure to supply marijuana for research pur-poses, we are unaware of recent cases in which they failed to supply mari-juana to an investigator with an NIH-approved grant for research on mari-juana. Donald Abrams's difficulty in obtaining research funding andmarijuana from NIDA has been much discussed, 2 but the case of a single individual should not be presumed to be representative of the commu-nity of marijuana researchers. Failure of investigators who apply to NIHfor marijuana research grants to receive funding is hardly exceptional: in1998 less than 25% of all first-time investigator-initiated grant applica- tions (known as RO1s) to the NIH were funded. 38 To import marijuana under the CSA for research purposes, the proce- dures are more complex. Under DEA regulations, marijuana can be im-ported, provided that the researcher is registered with the DEA, hasapproval for marijuana research (21 CFR \u00a7 1301.11, .13, and .18), and has aDEA-approved permit for importation (21 CFR \u00a7 1312.11, .12, and .13),and that the exporter in the foreign country has appropriate authorizationby the country of exportation. Importation would enable U.S. researchersto conduct research on marijuana grown by HortaPharm, a company thathas developed unique strains of marijuana. However, no U.S. researcherhas imported HortaPharm's marijuana because Dutch authorities haverefused to issue an export permit, despite the issuance of an import per-mit by the DEA (D. Pate, HortaPharm, personal communication, 1998).* HortaPharm, which is in the Netherlands, grows marijuana as a raw material for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. Through selective breed-ing and controlled production, HortaPharm has developed marijuanastrains that feature single cannabinoids, such as THC or cannabidiol. Theplants contain a consistently \"clean\" phytochemical profile and a higher *It might eventually be possible to import HortaPharm's marijuana from England, where HortaPharm is growing its marijuana strains for research use in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis (Boseley, 1998).10 England, as the country of origin, would have to provide appro- priate authorization for export of the strains to the United States. Permission to export forresearch purposes is part of the basis for HortaPharm's participation in this project with GW Pharmaceuticals through a special set of licenses with the British Home Office (David Pate, HortaPharm, personal communication, 1998).Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Marijuana seized in the United States in 1996 had a THC con-tent averaging about 5%. 16 Consistency of THC content is desirable because it overcomes the natural variability due to latitude, weather, andsoil conditions. Product consistency is a basic tenet of pharmacologybecause it enables standardized dosing for regulatory and treatmentpurposes. The difficulties of conducting research on marijuana were noted in the 1997 NIH report 40 that recommended that NIH facilitate clinical research by developing a centralized mechanism to promote design,approval, and conduct of clinical trials. Regulatory Hurdles to Market For marijuana to be marketed legally in the United States, a sponsor with sufficient resources would be obliged to satisfy the regulatory re-quirements of both the FD&C act and the CSA. Under the FD&C act, a botanical product like marijuana theoretically might be marketed in oral form as a dietary supplement;* however, as apractical matter, only a new drug approval is likely to satisfy the provi-sions of the CSA, which require prescribing and distribution controls ondrugs of abuse that also have an \"accepted medical use.\" (The final para-graphs of this section clarify the criteria for \"accepted medical use.\") Bringing marijuana to market as a new drug is uncharted terrain. The route is fraught with uncertainty for at least three pharmacological rea-sons: marijuana is a botanical product, it is smoked, and it is a drug withabuse potential. In general, botanical products are inherently more diffi-cult to bring to market than are single chemical entities because they arecomplex mixtures of active and inactive ingredients. Concerns arise aboutproduct consistency, potency of the active ingredients, contamination, andstability of both active and inactive ingredients over time. These areamong the concerns that a sponsor would have to overcome to meet therequirements for an NDA, especially those related to safety and to chem-istry, manufacturing, and control. A handful of botanical preparations are on the market, but none received formal approval as a new drug by today's standards of safetyand efficacy (FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, personalcommunication, 1998). The three marketed botanical preparations areolder drugs that came to market years before safety and efficacy studieswere required by legislative amendments in 1938 and 1962, respectively. *Inhaled products may not lawfully be marketed as dietary supplements.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.216 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE One of the botanical preparations is the prescription product digitalis. Because it came to market before 1938, it is available today, having been\"grandfathered\" under the law; but it does not necessarily meet contem-porary standards for safety and effectiveness. 20 Two other botanical preparations, psyllium and senna, came to market between 1938 and 1962.Drugs entering the market during that period were later required to beevaluated by the FDA in what is known as the over-the-counter drug re-view process, 20 through which psyllium and senna were found to be gen- erally recognized as safe and effective and so were allowed to remain onthe market as over-the-counter drugs.* Although no botanical prepara-tions have been approved as new drugs, it is important to point out that anumber of individual plant constituents, either extracted or synthesizedde novo , have been approved (for example, taxol and morphine). But these drug approvals were for single constituents rather than botanical prepa-rations themselves . The FDA is developing guidance for industry to ex- plain how botanicals are reviewed as new drugs, but the final documentmight not be available before 1999. That marijuana is smoked might pose an even greater regulatory chal- lenge. The risks associated with smoking marijuana are described in chap-ter 2. The FDA would have to weigh those risks with marijuana's thera-peutic benefits to arrive at a judgment about whether a sponsor's NDAfor marijuana met the requirements for safety and efficacy under theFD&C act. Marijuana delivered in a novel way that avoids smoking wouldovercome some, but not all, of the regulatory concerns. Vaporization de-vices that permit inhalation of plant cannabinoids without the carcino-genic combustion products found in smoke are under development byseveral groups; such devices would also require regulatory review by theFDA. The regulatory hurdles to market posed by the CSA are formidable but not insurmountable. If marijuana received market approval as a drugby the FDA, it would most likely be rescheduled under the CSA, as wasthe case for dronabinol. That is because a new drug approval satisfies the\"accepted medical use\" requirement under the CSA for manufacture anddistribution in commerce. 13 But a new drug approval is not the only means to reschedule marijuana under the CSA.14 For years advocates for re- scheduling have argued that marijuana does enjoy \"accepted medicaluse,\" even in the absence of a new drug approval. Although advocateshave been unsuccessful in rescheduling efforts, their actions prompted *Over-the-counter monographs for these products have been issued as tentative final monographs (proposed rules) but have not yet been issued in final form as final rules (FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, personal communication, 1998).Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.DEVELOPMENT OF CANNABINOID DRUGS 217 the DEA to specify the criteria by which it would determine whether a substance had \"accepted medical use.\" In the DEA's 1992 denial of a re-scheduling petition, it listed these elements as constituting \"acceptedmedical use\": the drug's chemistry must be known and reproducible,there must be adequate safety studies, there must be adequate and well-controlled studies proving efficacy, the drug must be accepted by quali-fied experts, and the scientific evidence must be widely available. 14 Assuming that all of those criteria were satisfied, marijuana could be rescheduled\u2014but into which schedule? The level of scheduling would bedictated primarily by a medical and scientific recommendation to the DEAmade by the secretary of DHHS.* As noted earlier, this recommendationis determined by the five scheduling criteria listed in the CSA. However,scheduling in a category less restrictive than Schedule II might be prohib-ited by international treaty obligations. The Single Convention on Nar-cotic Drugs, a treaty ratified by the United States in 1967, restricts sched-uling of the plant and its resin to at least Schedule II (the more restrictiveSchedule I is another option). 13 Market Outlook The market outlook for the development of marijuana as a new drug, on the basis of the foregoing analysis, is not favorable, for a host of scien-tific, regulatory, and commercial reasons. From a scientific point of view,research is difficult because of the rigors of obtaining an adequate supplyof legal, standardized marijuana for study. Further scientific hurdles arerelated to satisfying the exacting requirements for FDA approval of a newdrug. The hurdles are even more exacting for a botanical product becauseof the inherent problems with, for example, purity and consistency. Fi-nally, the health risks associated with smoking pose another barrier toFDA approval unless a new smoke-free route of administration is demon-strated to be safe. Depending on the route of administration, an addi-tional overlay of regulatory requirements might have to be satisfied. From a commercial point of view, uncertainties abound. The often- cited cost of new drug development, about $200-$300 million, might notapply, but there are probably additional costs needed to satisfy the FDA'srequirements for a botanical product. As noted above, no botanical prod-ucts have ever been approved as new drugs by the FDA under today'sstringent standards for safety and efficacy. Satisfying the legal require- *At present, there is no practical mechanism for generating such a recommendation out- side the new drug approval process, although such a mechanism could, theoretically, be developed.33Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.218 MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE ments of the CSA also will add substantially to the cost of development. On the positive side, so much research already has been done that somedevelopment costs will be lower. The cost of bringing dronabinol to mar-ket, for example, was reduced dramatically as a result of clinical trialssupported with government funding. Nevertheless, it is impossible to es-timate the cost of developing marijuana as a new drug. Estimating returnon investment is similarly difficult. A full-fledged market analysis wouldbe required for the indication being sought. Such an analysis would takeinto account the market limitations resulting from drug scheduling re-strictions, stigma, and patentability. The plant does not constitute patentable subject matter under U.S. patent law because it is unaltered from what is found in nature. So-calledproducts of nature are not generally patentable. 28 New marijuana strains, however, could be patentable in the United States under a product patentor a plant patent because they are altered from what is found in nature. (A product patent prohibits others from manufacturing, using, or selling eachstrain for 20 years; a plant patent carries somewhat less protection.)HortaPharm has not yet sought any type of patent for its marijuana strainsin the United States, but it has received approval for a plant registration inEurope (David Watson, HortaPharm, personal communication, 1998). In short, development of the marijuana plant is beset by substantial scientific, regulatory, and commercial obstacles and uncertainties. Theprospects for its development as a new drug are unfavorable unless returnon investment is not a driving force. It is noteworthy that no pharmaceu-tical firm has sought to bring it to market in the United States. The onlyinterest in its development appears to be in England in a small pharma-ceutical firm (see Boseley, 1998 10) and in the United States among physi- cians without formal ties to pharmaceutical firms (D. Abrams, Universityof California at San Francisco, and E. Russo, Western Montana Clinic, per-sonal communications, 1998). CONCLUSIONS Cannabinoids are an interesting group of compounds with potentially far-reaching therapeutic applications. There is a surge of scientific interestin their development as new drugs, but the road to market for any newdrug is expensive, long, risky, and studded with scientific, regulatory,and commercial obstacles. Experience with the only approved cannab-inoid, dronabinol, might not illuminate the pathway because of thegovernment's heavy contribution to research and development, drona-binol's scheduling history, and its small market. There appear to be only two novel cannabinoids actively being devel- oped for human use, but they have yet to be tested in humans in theMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.DEVELOPMENT OF CANNABINOID DRUGS 219 United States. Their experience is likely to be more predictive of the marketing prospects for other cannabinoids. It is too early to forecast theprospects for cannabinoids, other than to note that their development atthis point is considered to be especially risky, to judge by the paucity ofproducts in development and the small size of the pharmaceutical firmssponsoring them. The market outlook in the United States is distinctly unfavorable for the marijuana plant and for cannabinoids found in the plant. Commercialinterest in bringing them to market appears nonexistent. Cannabinoids inthe plant are automatically placed in the most restrictive schedule of theControlled Substances Act, and this is a substantial deterrent to develop-ment. Not only is the plant itself subject to the same scheduling stricturesas are individual plant cannabinoids, but development of marijuana alsois encumbered by a constellation of scientific, regulatory, and commercialimpediments to availability.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS Health Council of the Netherlands In order to assess the efficacy of marijuana and cannabinoids, the com- mittee studied literature published during the past 25 years. Based onthose findings, the committee concluded that there was insufficient evi-dence to justify the medical use of marijuana. AMA House of Delegates Adequate and well-controlled studies of smoked marijuana should be conducted in patients who have serious conditions for which preclini-cal, anecdotal, or controlled evidence suggests possible efficacy, includ-ing AIDS wasting syndrome, severe acute or delayed emesis induced bychemotherapy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, dystonia, and neu-ropathic pain. British Medical Association Research on the clinical indications for medical prescription of can- nabinoids should be undertaken. For all indications listed below (anti-emetics, pain, epilepsy, glaucoma, asthma, immunological effects, mul-tiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and other spastic disorders) furtherresearch is required to establish suitable methods of administration, opti-mal dosage regimens, and routes of administration. A central registryshould be kept of patients prescribed cannabinoids so that the effects canbe followed up over the long term. National Institutes of Health For at least some potential indications, marijuana looks promising enough to recommend that new controlled studies be done. The indica-tions in which varying levels of interest were expressed are the following:appetite stimulation and wasting, chemotherapy-induced nausea andvomiting, neurological and movement disorders, analgesia, [and] glau-coma. Until studies are done using scientifically acceptable clinical trialdesign and subjected to appropriate statistical analysis, the question con-cerning the therapeutic utility of marijuana will likely remain largely un-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

World Health Organization Therapeutic uses of cannabinoids warrant further basic pharmaco- logical and experimental investigation and clinical research into theireffectiveness. More research is needed on the basic neuropharmacologyof THC and other cannabinoids so that better therapeutic agents can befound. ANALGESIA Health Council of the Netherlands No recommendations made. AMA House of Delegates Controlled evidence does not support the view that THC or smoked marijuana offers clinically effective analgesia without causing significantadverse events when used alone. Preclinical evidence suggests that can-nabinoids can potentiate opioid analgesia and that cannabinoids may beeffective in animal models of neuropathic pain. Further research into theuse of cannabinoids in neuropathic pain is warranted. British Medical Association The prescription of nabilone, THC, and other cannabinoids should be permitted for patients with intractable pain. Further research is neededinto the potential of cannabidiol as an analgesic in chronic, terminal, andpostoperative pain. National Institutes of Health Evaluation of cannabinoids in the management of neuropathic pain, including HIV-associated neuropathy, should be undertaken. World Health Organization No recommendations made, although the report notes that some newly synthesized cannabinoids are extremely potent analgesics; how-Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

AMA House of Delegates THC and smoked marijuana are considerably less effective than cur- rently available therapies to treat acute nausea and vomiting caused bychemotherapy, although certain patients still do not respond adequatelyto conventional therapy. Research involving THC and smoked marijuanashould focus on their possible use in treating delayed nausea and vomit-ing and their adjunctive use in patients who respond inadequately to 5-HT 3 antagonists. The use of an inhaled substance has the potential to ben- efit ambulatory patients who are experiencing the onset of nausea and arethus unable to take oral medications. British Medical Association Further research is needed on the use of 8-THC as an antiemetic, the use of cannabidiol in combination with THC, and the relative effective-ness of cannabinoids compared with 5-HT 3 antagonists. Further research is needed in other cases, such as postoperative nausea and vomiting. National Institutes of Health Inhaled marijuana merits testing in controlled, double-blind, random- ized trials for nausea and vomiting. World Health Organization More basic research on the central and peripheral mechanisms of the effects of cannabinoids on gastrointestinal function may improve the abil-ity to alleviate nausea and emesis.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.248 APPENDIX E WASTING SYNDROME AND APPETITE STIMULATION Health Council of the Netherlands No recommendations made. AMA House of Delegates THC is moderately effective in the treatment of AIDS wasting, but its long duration of action and intensity of side effects preclude routine use.The ability of patients who smoke marijuana to titrate their dosage accord-ing to need and the lack of highly effective, inexpensive options to treatthis debilitating disease create the conditions warranting formal clinicaltrials of smoked marijuana as an appetite stimulant in patients with AIDSwasting syndrome. British Medical Association Allowing the prescription of nabilone and THC for cancer chemo- therapy and HIV/AIDS seems justified for preventing weight loss andtreating anorexia in HIV/AIDS irrespective of whether the patient isexperiencing nausea and/or vomiting. National Institutes of Health Areas of study for the potential appetite-stimulating properties of marijuana include the cachexia of cancer, HIV/AIDS symptomatology,and other wasting syndromes. Investigations should be designed to assesslong-term effects on immunology status, the rate of viral replication, andclinical outcomes in participants as well as weight gain. In therapeutictrials of cachexia, research should attempt to separate out the effect ofmarijuana on mood versus appetite. Some questions need to be answeredin the studies: (1) Does smoking marijuana increase total energy intake inpatients with catabolic illness? (2) Does marijuana use alter energy expen-diture? (3) Does marijuana use alter body weight and to what extent?(4) Does marijuana use alter body composition and to what extent? World Health Organization No specific recommendations are made, although the report notes that dronabinol is an effective appetite stimulant for patients with AIDS wast-ing syndrome.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.APPENDIX E 249 MUSCLE SPASTICITY Health Council of the Netherlands No recommendations made. AMA House of Delegates Considerably more research is required to identify patients who may benefit from THC or smoked marijuana and to establish whether re-sponses are primarily subjective in nature. A therapeutic trial of smokedmarijuana or THC may be warranted in patients with spasticity who donot derive adequate benefit from available oral medications, prior to theirconsidering intrathecal baclofen therapy or neuroablative procedures. British Medical Association A high priority should be given to carefully controlled trials of can- nabinoids in patients with chronic spastic disorders that have notresponded to other drugs are indicated. In the meantime, there is a casefor the extension of the indications for nabilone and THC for use in chronicspastic disorders unresponsive to standard drugs. National Institutes of Health No recommendations are made, although the report notes that mari- juana or the use of other cannabinoids as human therapies might be con-sidered for treating spasticity and nocturnal spasms complicating mul-tiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. World Health Organization The report notes that cannabinoids have not yet been proven useful in treating multiple sclerosis, but therapeutic uses of cannabinoids are beingdemonstrated by controlled studies as an antispasmodic. Research in thisarea should continue. MOVEMENT DISORDERS Health Council of the Netherlands No recommendations made.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.250 APPENDIX E AMA House of Delegates Considerably more research is required to identify dystonic patients who may benefit from THC or smoked marijuana and to establish whetherresponses are primarily subjective in nature. British Medical Association The potential of (+)-HU-210 for neruodegenerative disorders should be explored through further research. National Institutes of Health No recommendations made, although the report notes that marijuana or the use of other cannabinoids as human therapies might be consideredfor treating for some forms of dystonia. World Health Organization No recommendations made, although the report notes that cannab- inoids have not yet been proven useful in the treatment of movementdisorders. EPILEPSY Health Council of the Netherlands No recommendations made. AMA House of Delegates No recommendations made. British Medical Association Trials with cannabidiol (which is nonpsychoactive), used to enhance the activity of other drugs in cases not well controlled by other anti-convulants, are needed. National Institutes of Health No recommendations made, although the report notes that marijuanaMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.APPENDIX E 251 or the use of other cannabinoids as human therapies might be considered for treating various active epilepsy states. World Health Organization No recommendations made, although the report notes that cannab- inoids have not yet been proven useful in the treatment of convulsantdisorders, but therapeutic uses of cannabinoids are being demonstratedby controlled studies as an anticonvulsant. GLAUCOMA Health Council of the Netherlands No recommendations made. AMA House of Delegates Neither smoked marijuana nor THC is a viable approach in the treat- ment of glaucoma, but research on their mechanism of action may be im-portant in developing new agents that act in an additive or synergisticmanner with currently available therapies. British Medical Association Cannabinoids do not at present look promising for this indication, but much further basic and clinical research is needed to develop andinvestigate cannabinoids that lower intraocular pressure, preferably bytopical application (e.g., eye drops, inhalant aerosols), without producingunacceptable systemic and central nervous system effects. National Institutes of Health Further studies to define the mechanism of action and to determine the efficacy of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol and marijuana in the treatment of glaucoma are justified. There does not appear to be any obvious reason touse smoked marijuana as a primary \"stand-alone \" investigational therapy, as there are many available agents for treatment, and these topical prepa-rations seem to be potentially ideal. An approach that may be useful is tostudy smoked marijuana in incomplete responders to standard therapies.The suggested design for clinical studies is to add marijuana, oral THC, orplacebo to standard therapy under double-blind conditions: Establishdose-response and dose-duration relationships for intraocular pressureMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

(2) Relate IOP and blood pres- sure measurements longitudinally to evaluate potential tolerance devel-opment to cardiovascular effects. (3) Evaluate central nervous system ef-fects longitudinally for tolerance development. World Health Organization No recommendations made, although the report notes that, while THC has long been known to reduce the increased intraocular pressure ofglaucoma, it has not been fully studied therapeutically. The report alsonotes that therapeutic uses of cannabinoids are being demonstrated bycontrolled studies in the treatment of glaucoma. PHYSIOLOGICAL HARMS Health Council of the Netherlands No recommendations made. AMA House of Delegates No recommendations made. British Medical Association Further research is needed to establish the suitability of cannabinoids for immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing cancer che-motherapy or those with HIV/AIDS. National Institutes of Health Risks associated with smoked marijuana must be considered not only in terms of immediate adverse effects but also long-term effects in patientswith chronic diseases. The possibility that frequent and prolonged mari-juana use might lead to clinically significant impairments of immunesystem function is great enough that relevant studies should be part ofany marijuana medication development research. Additional studies of long-term marijuana use are needed to deter- mine if there are or are not important adverse pulmonary, central nervoussystem, or immune system problems.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.APPENDIX E 253 World Health Organization Further studies are needed on the fertility effects in cannabis users in view of the high rate of use during the early reproductive years. Furtherclinical and experimental research is required on the effects of cannabison respiratory function and respiratory diseases. More studies are neededto show whether cannabis affects the risk of lung malignancies and atwhat level of use that may occur. In addition, more studies are needed toclarify the rather different results of pulmonary histopathological studiesin animals and man. More clinical and experimental research is needed on the effects of cannabis on immunological function. More clarity should be sought con-cerning the molecular mechanisms responsible for immune effects, includ-ing both cannabinoid receptor and nonreceptor events. The possibility that chronic cannabis use has adverse effects on the cardiovascular system should have a priority in epidemiological research. Research on chronic and residual cannabis effects is also needed. The pharmacokinetics of chronic cannabis use in humans are poorly described,and this lack of knowledge restricts the ability of researchers to relatedrug concentrations in blood or other fluids and observed effects. PSYCHOLOGICAL HARMS Health Council of the Netherlands No recommendations made. AMA House of Delegates No recommendations made. British Medical Association No recommendations made. National Institutes of Health No recommendations made. World Health Organization There is a need for controlled studies investigating the relationships between cannabis use, schizophrenia, and other serious mental disorders.Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.254 APPENDIX E There is also a need for case-controlled studies comparing those expe- riencing cannabis problems with people who have, and do not have,alcohol and other psychoactive substance use problems. There is a need for better delineation of the clinical features of can- nabis dependence and for studies of its responsiveness to interventionsaimed at assisting users to stop. Insufficient research has been undertaken on the \"amotivational \" syn- drome which may or may not result from heavy cannabis use. It is notclear that the syndrome exists, even though heavy cannabis use is some-times associated with reduced motivation to succeed in school and work.New research is needed to show whether the reduced motivation seen insome cannabis users is due to other psychoactive substance use andwhether it precedes cannabis use. Further development of cognitive and psychomotor tests for con- trolled studies that are sensitive to the performance effects of cannabisuse and that reflect the complexity of specific daily functions (e.g., driv-ing, learning, reasoning) also need additional research. More research is needed to examine the relationship between THC concentrations in blood and other fluids and the degree of behavioral im-pairment produced. SMOKED MARIJUANA AND USE OF PLANTS AS MEDICINE Health Council of the Netherlands The committee believes that physicians cannot accept responsibility for a product of unknown composition that has not been subjected to qual-ity control. AMA House of Delegates No specific recommendations made, but related issues are discussed in the general recommendation and drug development sections. British Medical Association Prescription formulations of cannabinoids or substances acting on the cannabinoid receptors should not include either cigarettes or herbalpreparations with unknown concentrations of cannabinoids or otherchemicals. National Institutes of Health Smoked marijuana should be held to standards equivalent to otherMarijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.APPENDIX E 255 medications for efficacy and safety considerations. There might be some patient populations for whom the inhalation route might offer advantagesover the currently available capsule formulation. Smoking plant materialposes difficulties in standardizing testing paradigms, and components ofthe smoke are hazardous, especially in the immunocompromised patient.Therefore, the experts generally favored the development of alternativedosage forms, including an inhaler dosage form into which a controlledunit dose of THC could be placed and volatilized. World Health Organization Not discussed in the context of medical use, although many health hazards associated with chronic marijuana smoking are noted. DRUG DEVELOPMENT Health Council of the Netherlands Not discussed. AMA House of Delegates The National Institutes of Health should use its resources to support the development of a smoke-free inhaled delivery system for marijuanaor THC to reduce the health hazards associated with the combustion andinhalation of marijuana. British Medical Association Pharmaceutical companies should undertake basic laboratory inves- tigations and develop novel cannabinoid analogs that may lead to newclinical uses. National Institutes of Health NIH should use its resources and influence to rapidly develop a smoke-free inhaled delivery system for marijuana or THC. A recommen-dation was made for the development of insufflation/inhalation devicesor dosage forms capable of delivering purer THC or cannabinoids to thelungs free of dangerous combustion byproducts.

Distribution of extracted cannabis products in liquid or oil form to qualified, enrolled patients began July 1, 2015. Minnesota's medical cannabis program is distinct from those in nearly all other states as the Minnesota Depart ment of Health's Office of Medical Cannabis is required to study and learn from the experience of participants. This report draws on data from enrollment, purchasing and related health information, and survey results to describe the experience of patients who enrolled during the first year of the program's operation: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016. The Office of Medical Cannabis anticipates performing additional analyses of data for the first year cohort of enrolled patients, as well as initiating anal yses of data from patients who enrolled in the program later. Of particular interest are patients who enrolled after intractable pain became a qualifying condition on August 1, 2016. A report is planned for the end of 2017 that will give a preliminary lo ok at the experience of the first several hundred patients certified for intractable pain. It is possible that focused projects will be developed in the future that will draw on medical record information to answer specific questions raised by analyses of the kinds of program data described in this report. Participation Between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016 a total of 1660 patients enrolled in the program and 577 health care practitioners registered themselves in order to certify that patients have a medical condition that qualifies them for the program. The most common qualifying conditions were severe and persistent muscle spasms (43%), cancer (28%), and seizures (20%). Each of the remaining six qualifying conditions during the first year - Crohn's Disease, Terminal illness, HIV/AIDS, Tourette Syndrome, glaucoma, and ALS - accounted for less than 10% of patients. Ten percent (1 67 patients) were certified for more than one qualifying condition. Most patients were middle -aged (56% between ages 36 -64), 11% were <18, and 11% were 65. Distribution by race/ethnicity generally matched the state's demographics, with 90% of patients describing themselves as white. The legislation that established the program specified there would be one location for purchasing medical cannabis (called Cannabis Patient Centers; CPCs) in each of the state's eight congressional districts. Patients who enrolled in the program during the first year came from throughout the state, with the average distance from the patient's h ome to the nearest CPC 29 miles (median distance=16 miles). Some patients were a considerable distance from the nearest CPC, however, with 13% over 60 miles from the nearest one. The program allows patients to have one or more parents or non -parent careg ivers who register with the program, who are then are allowed to transport and administer a patient's medical cannabis. Only 11% M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 10 of patients had a registered caregiver, 17% had a registered parent or guardian, and 26% had either a registered parent/legal guardian or a registered caregiver. Among the 577 health care practitioners who registered with the program 82% were physicians, 13% were advanced practice registered nurses, and 5% were physician assistants. Medical Cannabis Purchasing Patterns Most pat ients make their first medical cannabis purchase within 14 days of program approval. Subsequent purchases typically follow a roughly monthly periodicity. However, intervals between purchases are sometimes less than a month, especially during the first mont hs of program participation as the patient experiments with small amounts of different products. And intervals between purchases are sometimes much longer than a month. Using a cutoff of six months without any medical cannabis purchases as a surrogate for program discontinuation, 51% of patients who enrolled and made a purchase within the first six months of the program discontinued participation in the program as of December 31, 2016. Medical Cannabis Use Patterns Each patient's medical cannabis purchasing transactions during their first enrollment year (or through early March if still within their first enrollment year) were analyzed. A total of 16,238 products were purchased during 10,898 transactions, with 38% of all transactions consisting of two or mor e products. For analytic purposes, products were classified according to the ratio of delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to cannabidiol (CBD) as to 99:1), and Very High CBD:THC (100:1 or higher). Products for enteral administration (swallowed - includes capsules and oral solutions) and products for inhalation (vaporized oil) each accounted for 45% of product purchases. Produc ts for oromucosal administration (absorption through cheek) accounted for 9%. Nearly 50% of all purchases were Very High THC:CBD products, followed by Balanced THC:CBD (30%) and High CBD-THC (15%). Very High THC:CBD products were most commonly oil for vapo rization or for oromucosal absorption, while Balanced THC:CBD and High CBD:THC products were most often for enteral administration. Examining purchasing history across all patients is very complex for reasons that include experimentation with different pro ducts over time. As a first approach to assessing routine use of products, most frequently purchased products were examined for each patient. For 28% of patients, two or more products were purchased the same number of times. The product types that emerge d as most frequently purchased were Very High THC vaporization oil (25%), High CBD:THC enteral preparations (14%), and Balanced enteral preparations (13%). Most frequently purchased product types varied considerably across medical conditions.

Results of analysis of PSE and survey data indicate perceptions of a high degree of benefit for most patients. Patients responded to a survey question asking them how much benefit they believe they received from using medical cannabis on a scale from 1 (no benefit) to 7 (great deal of benefit). Across all patients 64% indicated a benefit rating of 6 or 7 and this degree of benefit was indicated by at least half of the patients with each medical condition. A small but important proportion of patients indicated little or no benefit: 9% gave a rating of 1, 2, or 3. Benefi t ratings varied somewhat by qualifying medical condition. When patients were asked what the most important benefit was for them, two -thirds indicated a reduction in symptoms directly related to their qualifying medical condition and most of the remainder indicated more general quality of life benefits. An important part of this report is the verbatim comments written by patients, and the reader is encouraged to review these comments , presented in an Appendix. Examples of these comments include: \"Almost a ll muscle spasm and pain associated with spasms are gone. I used to have constant nerve triggered pain that is minimal now. Results were almost immediate. I am sleeping way better now also.\" \"[NAME] has passed away. I am her daughter and was her care giver . She was open to trying medical cannabis and we got the liquid form. It was a saving grace. She was in a lot of pain and when prescribed medications did NOT work - we started this and it kept her calm and relaxed. I am very thankful that we were able to h ave this option available. It helped to make her last months more bearable and truly it would have been miserable without it.\" \"I am getting enough sleep for the first time since about 2011. My absence seizures have gone from 3 -4 a day to almost 0. It also has lessened the severity of grand mal seizures. The recovery time after has gone from around 12 hours to around 4.\" \"At first it helped a lot but my seizures have returned.\" \"Spasms - only a little better.\" Health care practitioners were somewhat more co nservative in assessment of benefit to their patients. Across all the benefit ratings by health care practitioners, 38% indicated a rating of 6 or 7 and 23% indicated little or no benefit (rating of 1, 2, or 3). Similarity in benefit assessment between hea lth care practitioners and patients appears to vary by medical condition, with highest discrepancy among seizure patients. Descriptive comments suggest at least part of the difference is driven by perspectiv e of what constitutes benefit. The patients cite quality of life M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 12 benefits more often than the health care practitioners, who appear to focus more on objective measures such as seizure counts. The symptom scores provided in the Patient Self -Evaluation data have the advantage of completeness, since they ar e required prior to each medical cannabis purchase. In this report a reduction of 30% was applied to most symptoms to indicate clinically meaningful symptom reduction. Results show patterns similar to those in the survey benefits rating, but usually somew hat smaller in size. For most symptoms between half and two -thirds of patients who achieve clinically meaningful improvement retained that degree of improvement over the next four months. Examples of proportion of patients achieving and retaining 30% sym ptom reduction include: Among seizure patients, 68% reported 30% reduction in seizure frequency and 49% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Among patients with Tourette syndrome, 61% reported 30% re duction in tic frequency and 46% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Among patients with Crohn's disease, 51% reported 30% reduction in number of liquid stools per day and 29% both achieved that leve l of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Among patients with severe, persistent muscle spasms, 48% reported 30% reduction in spasm frequency and 28% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Among cancer patients with at least moderate levels of nausea when they started using medical cannabis, 38% reported 30% reduction of nausea and 23% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four mon ths Among cancer patients with at least moderate levels of pain when they started using medical cannabis, 29% reported 30% reduction of pain and 12% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Moderate to se vere levels of non -disease -specific symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety, and sleep difficulties were common acr oss all the medical conditions. And the reductions in these symptoms was often quite large. These findings support the understanding that some of t he benefit perceived by patients is expressed as improved quality of life. The type(s) of medical cannabis used at the time patients achieved clinically significant improvement was analyzed for each symptom assessed within each category of medical conditio n. Full results of these analyses are presented in an Appendix and summaries are in the Benefits chapter.

Approximately 20 -25% of enrolled patients report negative physical or mental side effects of some kind, with the majority - around 60% - reporting only one and 90% reporting three or fewer. The vast majority of adverse side effects, around 90%, are mild t o moderate in severity. An assessment of the 30 patients reporting severe side effects, meaning \"interrupts usual daily activities,\" found no apparent pattern of patient age, medical condition, or type of medical cannabis used. The most common adverse side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, and fatigue. Fortunately, up to the present no serious adverse events (life threatening or requiring hospitalization) have been reported. Affordability and Suggestions for Improving the Program Unlike traditional pharma ceuticals whose costs are often covered through insurance reimbursement, medical cannabis purchased through the Minnesota program is currently not covered by insurance and must be purchased out of pocket. The patient survey asked for a rating of product a ffordability on a scale of 1 (very affordable) to 7 (very prohibitive). More than half (51%) responded with a 6 or a 7 and 86% responded with a score of 4 or higher. \"Bring the costs down\" was a frequent response when patients and certifying health care practitioners were asked how the program could be improved. Some patients indicated on surveys they used less medical cannabis than they knew was helpful to them because they could not afford it. 14 1. Introduction In May 2014, Minnesota became the 22nd state to create a medical cannabis program. Distribution of cannabis products to qualified, enrolled patients began July 1, 2015. Minnesota's medical cannabis program is distinct from those in nearly all other states due to the fact that the Minnesota Department of Health 's Office of Medical Cannabis is required to study and learn from t he experience of participants. Minnesota's online registry, which integrates information from patients, certifying health care practitioners and manufacturers, continuousl y capture s program data. Data elements from the Registry have been selected to create a de - identified research data s et for reporting and research. This report draws on aspec ts of that research data set to describe the experience of patients who enrolled d uring the first year of the program's operation: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016. Data in this report come from several aspects of the program's operations : Information from registration or enrollment of patients, health care practitioners, and caregive rs; Information patients provide each time they visit a cannabis patient center for purchase of cannabis products, including information on symptom severity and side effects ; Details about each cannabis product purchased ; and Information is derived from re sponses to periodic surveys of patients and their certifying health care practitioners. Though there is certainly imprecision in some of the data collected by the program, this report provide s important details that can be found in few other states . A notable part of the report is a set of statements regarding benefits, negative effects , and comments about the program made by patients and health care practitioners . These are redacted to protect privacy, but otherwise presented as was written on the surveys. The comments have been coded by type but the verbatim comments have a power of their own, reminding us that each enrollee is a unique individual , not just a number. A few comments are included elsewhere , but the reader is encouraged to spend time reviewing the full listing of responses in the appendices. The Office of Medical Cannabis anticipates performing additional analyses of data for the first year cohort of enrolled patients, as well as initiating analyses of data from patients who enrolled i n the program later. Of particular interest are patients who enrolled after intractable pain became a qualifying condition on August 1, 2016. A report is planned for the end of 2017 that will give a preliminary look at the experience of the first several h undred patients c ertified for intractable pain. It is possible that focused projects will be developed in the future that will M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 15 draw on medical record information to answer specific questions raised by analyses of data derived from the program registry. 16 2. Patients and Caregivers Registered in the First Program Year DESCRIPTION OF PATIE NTS ENROLLED IN THE FIRST PROGRAM YEAR Qualifying Condition During the first year of the Minnesota Medical Cannabis program (July 2015 -June 2016), 1,660 patients were certified by registered healthcare practitioners and subsequently enrolled in the program (Figure 2.1). The healthcare practitioners certified the patients as having one or more of the following qualifying conditions: severe and persistent muscl e spasms (n=713), cancer (n=468), seizures, including those characteristic of epilepsy (n=328), Crohn's disease glaucoma (n=24), and amyotrophic sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease (n=22) (Table 2.1, Figure 2.2). Of the 1660 patients from the first program year, 167 (10.1%) were certified as having more than one qualifying condition; these patients are represented more than once in Table 2.1 and Figure 2.2. Figure 2.1. Patient enrollment in the first program year.

Additionally, during registration, patients are asked to report gender and ra ce/ethnicity but are not required to do so. Table 2.2 shows the breakdown of patients by age category and gender at the time of initial program enrollment. The gender breakdown of patients in the first program year was 57% male and 43% female, with <1% of patients declining to report gender. Patients tended to be middle -aged, with 56.3% of the cohort falling between ages 36 -64. However, the cohort also included a notable proportion of pediatric patients (10.7%) and patients over 65 years (11.0%). Table 2.2 .

Age and gender breakdown of first year cohort. Age by Qualifying Condition Breakdown of age category within each qualifying condition is shown in Table 2.3. Among the first year cohort, average age was 44.3 \u00b1 18.9 years. Age distribution varied substantially across qualifying medical condition groups; patients certified for glaucoma or ALS tended to be older in general (average age of 60.4 \u00b1 14.0 and 61.5 \u00b1 9.6, respectively); patients certified for seizure disorders or To urette syndrome generally were younger ( 23.4 \u00b1 16.0 and 25.3 \u00b1 11.7, respectively).

Patients were given the option to select multiple race and ethnicity categories, so the counts reflect some patients more than once. Ninety -one patients selected more than one race/ethnicity and 95 patie nts declined the question. Compared to 2014 Census Bureau estimates of race/ethnicity in Minnesota, the distribution of responding members of the first program year cohort is generally similar, with a slightly higher proportion of American Indians (2.7% ve rsus 1.9%) and lower proportion of Hispanics (2.4% versus 4.9%) and Asians (1.7% versus 5.0%). Table 2.4. One -year cohort patient race and ethnicity compared to overall state demographics.

This allows the enrolled patient to have a caregiver who then undergoes a background che ck and registers with the program. Registered caregivers can then legally obtain and possess the patient's medical cannabis on their behalf. Additionally, parents or legal guardians of patients can register with the program to act as caregiver and pick up or possess medication on behalf of the patient. Table 2.5 shows the proportion within each M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 22 qualifying condition group of patients who have registered caregivers or parents or legal guardians registered to pick up medication on behalf of the patient. Patien ts certified for ALS, cancer, or terminal illness have the highest proportions of patients with registered caregivers (32%, 15% and 15%, respectively). Patient certified for seizure disorders or Tourette syndrome, who are also generally younger than the co hort at large, have the highest proportion of patients with registered parents or legal guardians in the program (65% and 53%, respectively). Patients with seizures or Tourette syndrome also have the highest proportion of either registered caregivers or re gistered parents/legal guardians. Table 2.6 shows the absolute number of registered caregivers associated with a patient in the first year cohort, reported by condition. Most patients with registered caregivers have only one caregiver able to pick up medic ation on their behalf (n=157); 21 patients have two caregivers and one patient has three caregivers. Table 2.5.

Home addresses are retained in the patient's online registry account but are not retained in the research database; in lieu of home address, patient ZIP codes and calculated dista nces from each address to the nearest cannabis patient center are accessible for research purposes. The general geographic distribution of patients was examined using patient -reported ZIP codes; the first three digits of ZIP codes compose a prefix which co rresponds to an approximate geographic region1. The U.S. Postal Service assigns to each prefix labels that match 1 http://pe.usps.com/Archive/HTML/DMMArchive20050106/print/L002.htm M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 24 the major city within the region and approximate surrounding cities; these region labels are shown in Table 2.7, along with the count of patien ts living in the corresponding ZIP codes.

Patients living in this region reside in Minnesota. Two me dical cannabis manufacturers each operate four cannabis patient centers where patients can purchase medical cannabis following consultation with pharmacy staff at the center. Minnesota law required that one cannabis patient center be open in each of Minnes ota's eight legislative districts by July 1, 2016 (one year after the program start date). Figure 2.4 shows the distribution of calculated one -way distance from each patient's home address to the nearest cannabis patient center location as of July 1, 2016, when all eight centers were operational. Average one -way distance is 28.9 \u00b1 36.9 miles; median one -way distance is 15.5 miles. The majority of patients (n=1441; 86.8%) live within 60 miles of the nearest cannabis patient center.

A sequential series of steps are followed in order to move patients from certification by a healthcare practitioner to their enrollment in Minnesota's Medical Cannabis program. First, patients must have at least one medical condition that qualifies for the program and must have that condition certified by a registered health care practitioner (HC P). After their medical condition is certified, patients have 90 days to submit a complete application to enroll in the program. Patients must also submit payment to cover the annual enrollment fee along with their application materials. Once the applic ation and enrollment fee are submitted, Office of Medical Cannabis (OMC) staff reviews and verifies all submitted materials and can approve the patient for the program. Figure 2.5 depicts the process flow from certification to program approval: Figure 2.5 . Flow chart of enrollment events. To give current and prospective patients some idea of the time it takes to go from certification to program approval, records from patients in the first program year cohort (n = 1660) were analyzed at different time p oints: 1) time between certification to program approval, 2) time between certification to enrollment payment, and 3) time between enrollment payment and program approval. M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 28 Time from Certification to Program Approval Just over half of all patients (54.7%) in the cohort (n = 1660) were approved/enrolled in the program within 3 days of having their condition(s) certified. Close to 90% (1484 out of 1660 patients) were enrolled in the program within a month of being certified. Time from Certification to Ann ual Enrollment Fee Payment Records of enrollment fee payments were unavailable for patients who did not make an electronic payment; therefore, calculations of time between certification and enrollment fee payment was restricted to 1579 patients (95.1% of p atients in the cohort represented) who paid the enrollment fee electronically. Of these patients, 57.2% of them (n = 903) submitted payment within 1 day of getting their qualifying condition(s) certified by their HCP. More than 90% of patients (n = 1452) submitted payment within one month of certification. Time from Annual Enrollment Fee Payment and Program Approval Records of enrollment fee payments were not available for all patients in the cohort; therefore, calculations of time between enrollment fee payment and program approval was restricted to 1579 patients (95.1% of patients in the cohort represented). Of these patients, 72.7% of them (n = 1148) were approved for the program (officially enrolled in the program) within a day of submitting their ann ual enrollment fees. Close to all patients (99.3%) were enrolled in the program within a month of submitting their annual enrollment fees. The small proportion of patients who do not get approved within a month of their fee submission generally reflects patients who submitted inadequate or incomplete information during the enrollment submission process (meaning that the Office of Medical Cannabis is waiting for additional information to approve them for the program). From Certification to Program Approval: Conclusions Just over half of all patients in the cohort were officially enrolled in the program within three days of being certified. Within a week of certification, 70% of patients were enrolled in the program. This suggests that the majority of patients move relatively quickly from certification to enrollment in the program. When breaking down the process flow between certification and program approval, it typically took longer for patients to move from certification to paying the enrollmen t fee than it did from their paying the enrollment fee to getting approved. This generally reflects the nature of the process flow going from certification to paying the enrollment fee: after patients are certified, the patient must self -initiate and comp lete the submission of all application materials along with payment (involves variable amounts of time to gather all materials and to ensure sufficient funds to make fee payment). This is in contrast to the step between enrollment fee payment and getting approved for the program: patient has submitted all materials and payment by this M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 29 point and - unless they are directed otherwise by OMC staff - will get approved for the program in the order their materials were received in the queue. Re-Enrollment The Min nesota medical cannabis program requires by statute that once a patient becomes certified as having a qualifying condition and enrolled in the program, the patient's enrollment lasts for one year; therefore each year a patient must be re -certified as havin g at least one qualifying condition and must re -enroll in the program and pay an annual enrollment fee. If a patient is not re -certified as having a qualifying condition and does not re -enroll in the program by the anniversary date of the most recent enrol lment, their account is deactivated and they are no longer able to purchase medical cannabis from a cannabis patient center or retain the protections of the program. To investigate the rate at which enrolled patients who approach their expiration dates re -enroll in the program, patients who enrolled in the program during the first program month (including those who were approved early, prior to the program start in July 2015) were examined. A total of 253 patients were enrolled in the first program month; these patients' enrollments expired in July 2016. Re -enrollment activity for these patients was examined six months following expiration of the first enrollment year. Within six months following the expiration of the first year of enrollment, 115 (45%) amon g these patients re - enrolled in the program. Of the remaining 138 patients who did not re -enroll during this period, 24 patients (17%) died within 18 months of initial enrollment. Additionally, patients can re - enroll at any time following expiration, and s ome patients who did not re -enroll immediately may do so at a later time. Most patients who re -enrolled within six months of expiration did so prior to expiration (44%) or within the first month after enrollment expiration (40%). Only 3% of these patients re- enrolled beyond three months post expiration. Timing of re -enrollment for patients who initially enrolled during the first program month are shown in Table 2.8. M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 30 Table 2.8.

Percentages are based on a total number of re -enrollments within this period (n=115). At the time of enrollment expiration, a pat ient can allow their enrollment to lapse without any action or communication with the Office of Medical Cannabis. Currently OMC does not collect information systematically on why patients chose to either re -enroll or let their current enrollment expire. Ho wever, some insight into program discontinuation is available from a Continued Use survey, which asks patients who have not purchased medical cannabis for 60 days whether they have decided to stop the treatment, whether they received any benefits from the treatment, and what their reasons are for either stopping or pausing the treatment. Early results looking at patients who purchased medical cannabis within the first three program months but discontinued purchasing for 60 days showed that 62% (n=10) of pat ients who indicated they planned to stop using medical cannabis (n=16) found little or no benefit from the treatment. Among 59 patients who indicated they were unsure of whether they would continue or that they intended to continue the treatment, 35 (73%) cited cost as a barrier to continuing. These results do not directly answer the question of why some patients do not re -enroll but give some indication of potential reasons for doing so. (For methodology and preliminary results from the Continued Use surve y, see \"Early Results of Office of Medical Cannabis Surveys: May 2016\" on the Office of Medic al Cannabis website). 31 3. Health Care Practitioners Registered in the First Program Year The Minnesota Medical Cannabis program outlines a set of qualifying medical conditions which make a patient eligible for enrollment in the program. By Minnesota statute, a patient must be certified by a Minnesota -licensed physician, physician assistant (PA), or advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) as having one or more of the qualifying conditions. A Minnesota practitioner with appropriate credentia ls must first register with the Minnesota Medical Cannabis program before they can certify patients for the program: practitioners complete a short online form with their name and clinic information to register. Office of Medical Cannabis staff verify the provider's entered information and their Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) license prior to approving the practitioner to certify patients. This chapter will describe the certifying healthcare practitioners who registered in the first program year. Healthcare Practitioner Count, Age and Gender From July 2015 - June 2016, 577 healthcare practitioners licensed in Minnesota registered in the medical cannabis program, including 473 physicians (82%), 77 APRNs (13%) and 27 PAs (5%). Table 3.1 shows the breakdown of h ealthcare practitioner (HCP) type, gender and average age, based on publicly available data from the Boards of Medical Practice and Nursing. Physicians registered in the program were predominantly male (72%) and were generally older than registered APRNs a nd PAs, who were predominantly female (88% and 78%, respectively).

Figure 3.2 shows the age distribution in 5 year increments of physicians enrolled in the first program year; most physicians fall between ages 36-65 years (81%) with relatively even distribution of numbers across this range. Figure 3.3 shows the age distribution for APRNs; 51% of APRNs are 50 years or under. Figure 3.4 shows the age distribution for PAs registered in the program; most PAs fall be tween ages 31 -45 (78%).

Included is self -reported \"Area of Specialty\" inf ormation indicating a physician's (or physician assistant's) certifications from the American Board of Medical Specialties or American Osteopathic Specialty Boards. While physician assistant specialty information is infrequently provided, physicians often list certifications in more than one area of specialty. For example, physicians practicing as oncologists may list certifications in the areas of Internal Medicine, Hematology, and Medical Oncology. A variety of specialties were represented among physician s registered in the first program year, including subspecialties of neurology (neurology with special qualifications in child neurology, clinical neurophysiology, and epilepsy), pediatrics (pediatric hematology -oncology) and internal medicine or family med icine (gastroenterology, geriatric medicine, hospice and palliative medicine, sports and infectious disease). Specialties including ophthalmology, dermatology, radiology and surgery were also represented. In cases where a physician l isted an area of specialty and subspecialty, such as Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, the subspecialty was chosen to represent the physician's practice (in this case, Gastroenterology). Table 3.2 shows the distribution of physician specialties; each physician is represented only once. Two physicians who are licensed in Minnesota and registered in the program do not have any listed specialties with the Board of Medical Practice; they are therefore excluded from Table 3.2. The most common specialty ca tegory for physicians registered in the first program year was primary care (38%), which included internal medicine (13%), family medicine (23%) and pediatrics (2%). Physicians with specialization in oncology (17%) and neurology (14%) were also common.

Among the 77 APRNs who registered in the first program year, 75 held CNP certification, 1 held CNS certification, and 1 held both CNP and CNS certifications. Summary In the first year of the Minnesota Medical Cannabis program, 577 licensed healthcare practitioners registered as certifying providers with the program, predominantly physicians (82%). There were age and gender differences across the HCP types; physicians tended to be older and male; PAs and APRNs tended to be younger and female. Physician licensure information showed that physicians from a di versity of clinical practices are involved in certifying patients for the medical cannabis program, but the majority of these providers are primary care providers or specialties that typically manage patients with the Minnesota program's qualifying conditi ons (i.e. severe muscle spasms, seizure disorders, Tourette syndrome and ALS are typically managed by neurologists; cancer is often managed by oncologists).

Frequency and Duration of Medical Cannabis Purchases Time from Program Approval to First Medic al Cannabis Purchase Once a patient is approved for the medical cannabis program, the patient and/or their registered caregiver(s) or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) can visit any of the eight cannabis patient centers and purchase medical cannabis. Figure 4.1 shows the distribution of time from program approval to first medical cannabis purchase for patients enrolled during the first program year who purchased medical cannabis before December 31, 2016 (n=1528). Many patients (n=196; 13%) made a first purchase w ithin one day of program approval; over half (n=864; 57%) made a first purchase within seven days and most patients (n=1137; 74%) made a first purchase within 14 days of program approval. Figure 4.1. Time from patient approval to first medical cannabis purchase . M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 39 Time Between Purchases According to Minnesota statute, patients can purchase up to a 30 -day supply of medicine at a cannabis patient center. However, visits to a cannabis patient center vary from 30 -day intervals for several reasons. Figure 4.2 shows the intervals between purchases for patients from the one-year cohort with at least two purchases (n=1256). Patients must purchase medical cannabis with cash and many patients report that the medicine's cost is prohibitive; for these reasons, patien ts may purchase smaller quantities than a month's supply and visit cannabis patient centers more frequently than once a month. On the other hand, many patient responses to the Continued Use Survey (see \"Early Results of Office of Medical Cannabis Surveys: May 2016\" on the Office of Medical Cannabis website) indicated a quantity of medicine intende d to be a 30 -day supply lasted longer than 30 days, or the patient chose to use the medicine sparingly as a cost -saving measure and therefore the supply lasted longer than anticipated. However, the median times between visits for the first consecutive six visits were close to the expected interval of one month (median time since last visit: 25, 28, 28, 28, and 28 days for the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth visits, respectively). M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 40 Figure 4.2. Time between visits for patients with two or more visits from July 2015 -December 2016 . Note on boxplots: upper and lower hinges for each boxplot correspond to the 75th and 25th percentiles of each distribution, respectively. The upper and lower whiskers extend to the highest and lowest values that a re within 1.5 x the interquartile range from the upper and lower hinges, respectively. Data beyond the whiskers, plotted as individual points, are outliers. Purchasing Activity in First Four Months of Program Participation Patients beginning medical canna bis treatment often try different types of products with varying ratios of THC:CBD and routes of administration to achieve optimal symptom management; therefore patients may be more likely to make more visits to cannabis patient centers at the beginning of treatment and fewer visits in later times once the patient's regimen had been established. As seen in Figure 4.2, frequency of visits (represented as time between consecutive visits) varies widely across patients. To compare purchasing activity in the fir st two months versus the second two months of program activity, the number of visits for each patient with continuous enrollment was examined in the first and second 60 days of program activity (day 0 defined as the date of first medical cannabis purchase) . Patients who made no M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 41 purchases between days 61 and 120 or beyond day 120 were excluded to eliminate patients who had atypical purchasing activity or quit the program during this time window. Figure 4.3 shows the distribution of number of visits per patie nt which occurred in the first and second 60 days of program activity (n=752). During the first 60 days of program activity, median number of visits was 3 and 543 of 752 patients in this group (72%) made three or fewer purchases. During days 61 -120 of prog ram activity, median number of visits was 2 and 662 of 752 patients (88%) made three purchases or less. While the distributions of purchasing activity in the first 60 days and second 60 days is roughly similar, they indicate that purchasing activity is sli ghtly greater during the first 60 days of program activity. Figure 4.3. Number of visits in first 60 days and second 60 days of program activity, for patients with one or more purchases in both 60 day intervals. Patients Who Stopped Purchasing Medical Cannabis Since patients make an annual payment to be enrolled in the medical cannabis program, if they decide at some point during the following year to discontinue medical cannabis treatment, it is unlikely they will request to be withdrawn from the prog ram, as there is no financial incentive to do so. Therefore, to understand discontinuation in the program, a functional definition was created based on purchasing patterns. For each patient in the one year cohort enrolled with a first purchase prior to Dec ember 31, 2015 and making at least two purchases before December 31, 2016 (n=669), the longest gap between consecutive purchases from July 2015 -December 2016 is shown in Figure 4.4; median longest gap in this group was 47 days. Among these M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 42 patients, 546 (8 2%) had a longest gap between purchases of 120 days or less; 616 (92%) had a longest gap between purchases of 180 days or less. Median longest gap for each patient is significantly longer than median time between visits for patient's first six visits; this suggests that there may be a great deal of variability within a patient's inter -visit times. Early patient responses to the Continued Use survey point to factors which may impact purchasing frequency: unexpectedly low rate of product usage, cost -motivate d reduction or temporary cessation of product usage, unrelated medical treatment changes which interfered with cannabis usage, or out -of-state travel. Figure 4.4. Distribution of longest gap between visits per patient , July 2015 -December 2016. Since most patients (92%) enrolled and purchasing within the first six program months who made two or more purchases by December 31, 2016 had no inter -visit gaps longer than 180 days, program discontinuation was defined for this analysis as ceasing purchas ing activity for six months or longer during the period included in this analysis (July 2015 -December 2016). This definition was applied to all patients enrolled in the first six program months who made at least one purchase (n=774) to find the proportion of patients (regardless of duration enrolled in the program) who did not make any purchases for at least six months, through the end of 2016. Of these 774 patients making at least one medical cannabis purchase, 398 patients (51%) made no purchases for at l east six months, as of December 2016. Based on the distribution of longest gaps between purchases in this subset of the one -year cohort, it is likely that this proportion is M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 43 a rough estimate of the proportion of patients who quit the program within 18 mont hs after trying medical cannabis. Using a six month window with no purchases as a surrogate for program discontinuation has limitations. For example, our analysis did not account for duration of enrollment and any effect it may have on purchasing patterns . However, it gives an approximation of patients who abandon medical cannabis treatment and roughly aligns with the re -enrollment rate of 45% in patients enrolled in the first program month (see \"Re -Enrollment\" in Chapter 2: Description of Patients and Des ignated Caregivers) . Frequency and Duration of Medical Cannabis Purchases: Conclusions Most patients make their first medical cannabis purchase within 14 days of program approval. Subsequent purchases often follow a roughly monthly periodicity, with media n inter -visit gap at 25 days for the gap between the first and second visit and 28 days for the next four inter -visit gaps. Additionally, patients tend to make purchases slightly more frequently in the first 60 days of program activity compared to the seco nd 60 days of program activity (median number of visits is 3 from 0 -60 days and 2 from 61 -120 days). Finally, most patients (92%) do not have an inter -visit gap longer than 180 days; using 6 months or more of no purchasing activity as a surrogate for progr am discontinuation, 51% of patients who enrolled and made a purchase within the first six months of the program ceased purchasing medical cannabis as of December 31, 2016. 44 5. Medical Cannabis Use Patterns Medical cannabis purchasing records were extracted from the registry in early March 2017 for patients enrolled in the 1st program year. From this data, all transactions that occurred within a patient's first enrollment year were retained. For those patients whose first enrollment year had n ot yet ended at the time of data extraction, all purchasing transactions were retained. This resulted in a dataset with the following: 10,898 purchasing transactions consisting of: 16,238 products within these transactions (37.9% of all purchasing transac tions consisted of two or more products), which Represented 1529 patients (92.1% of the first program year cohort). For analytical purposes, all 16,238 product transactions were classified according to the ratio of delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to cannabidiol (CBD) found in the medical cannabis products. Products ranged from containing very high THC to CBD content to those with very high CBD to THC, as well as everything in between (products with relatively balanced amounts of THC and CBD). For definitions on THC:CBD ratio classifications, see Box 5.1. Products purchased for enteral administration (swallowed - inclu des capsules and oral solutions) and inhalation (vaporized oil) represented the majority of the products purchased (90.6% of all product transactions) with significantly fewer products purchased for oromucosal absorption (oil absorbed through cheek; 9.4% o f all product transactions). In fact, products for enteral administration and inhalation were roughly equally purchased by patients, respectively representing 45.2% (n = 7333) and 45.4% (n = 7376) of all products dispensed. See Figure 5.1. Product Classifications Based on THC to CBD content : Very High THC to CBD = 100:1 or higher High THC to CBD = >4:1 up to 99:1 Balanced = up to 4:1 High CBD to THC = 1:1 to 99:1 Very High CBD to THC = 100:1 or higher Box 5. 1.

P urchasing transactions categorized by the product's intended route of administration (out of 16,238 products dispensed). When products were classified by the ratio of THC to CBD present in the product, the following patterns emerged. Firstly, 48.2% of all product transactions were for products with very high THC amounts compared to CBD (hundreds to one). Balanced products (roughly equal amounts of THC to CBD) represented the next biggest group of products purchased, representing 31.3% of products di spensed. This was followed by high CBD to THC products which represented 15.9% of all product transactions. See Figure 5.2. 05101520253035404550 Enteral Inhalation Oromucosal% of Product Transactions Route of AdministrationPercentage of Product Transactions (n = 16,238) by Route of Administration M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 46 Figure 5.2. Product transactions represented by the THC to CBD ratio available in the product. Product transactions were also examined by the products' THC:CBD ratios as a function of their routes of administration (see Figure 5.3). Of all product transactions intended for enteral administration, close to 39% of them were for products with relatively balanced THC:CBD ra tios followed by products with high CBD:THC (29.9%) and very high THC:CBD products (24.8%). Product transactions for inhalation predominately had very high THC to CBD (71.4%). Lastly, close to half (48.4%) of all oromucosal product transactions were for ve ry high THC:CBD products, with roughly a quarter each constituting balanced and high CBD to THC products (respectively 26.0% and CBD CBD% of Product Transactions Product's THC:CBD RatioPercentage of Product Transactions (n = 16,238) by THC:CBD RatioM I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 47 Figure 5.3. A percentage breakdown of product transactions by the THC:CBD product ratio types as a function of route of administration. Most Frequently Purchased Product(s) Examining purchasing history across all patients is very complex. For example, patients may experiment with different products as they explore what works best for them, and some may establish a pattern of using more than one product. Additionally, those using more than one product do not always purchase all of those products at each purchasing transaction. As a first approach to assessing routine use of products, we report here the pr oduct(s) most frequently purchased by each patient. Table 5.1 shows the product(s) that were identified as the most frequently purchased by patients (indicated by \"X\"), as well as the percentage of patients it represents from the 1529 patients included in this analysis. Additionally, the table displays the average daily THC and CBD dose across patients for the product(s) purchased most frequently based on THC/CBD content information (provided by the medical cannabis manufacturers) as well as pharmacist -ente red information regarding the length of time the product supply should last. Omitted from display in Table 5.1 are cases where two or less people had the same combination of most frequently purchased product(s) \u2014this was done for ease of interpretation, as some of those cases seemed to be indicative of a wider range of experimentation across multiple products and/or indicative of patients with a shorter purchasing history. 01020304050607080 Enteral (n = 7333) Inhalation (n = 7376) Oromucosal (n = 1529)% of Product Transactions Route of AdministrationBreakdown of Product's THC:CBD Ratio by Route of Administration Very High THC to CBD High THC to CBD Balanced High CBD to THC Very High CBD to THCM I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 48 Table 5.1 shows that roughly 72% of all patients most frequently purchased a single pr oduct that falls under 1) a specific THC:CBD ratio and 2) is intended for a particular route of administration (note the rows that have a single \"X\" in Table 5.1). Roughly a quarter of all patients most frequently purchased a very high THC to CBD product i ntended for vaporization followed by relatively similar numbers of patients most frequently purchasing a single, balanced -enteral product or a single, high CBD:THC -enteral product (respectively 12.6% and 13.7%). For patients most frequently purchasing two or more products an equal number of times, the most common combination was for an enteral -balanced product and an inhaled -very high THC:CBD product, accounting for 3% of all patients. While the subsequent portions of this section will be devoted to stratifying routine product use by qualifying condition, the following statement should be made: the method for determining routine product use in this report (most frequently purchased) is relatively simple and, therefore, poses limitations for understanding the complexities in medication usage. Future endeavors will include a further discussion and potential refinement in methodolog y to better capture medical canna bis use in program participants 49 Table 5.1.

When product transa ctions were examined by each product's intended route of administration and THC:CBD content, the following patterns emerged. Firstly, roughly 90% of all products were purchased for enteral administration (through mouth via capsules or oral solutions) and i nhalation (vaporized oil). Secondly, approximately 50% of all product transactions were for products very high in THC relative to CBD followed by balanced THC:CBD products (~30%) and high CBD:THC products (~15%). Very high THC:CBD products were most common ly purchased for inhalation or oromucosal absorption, while balanced and high CBD:THC products were most commonly used for enteral administration. For this report, the most frequently purchased product(s) were identified for each patient as one method for understanding routine purchasing patterns. 72.5% of all patients most frequently purchased one type of product, with the most frequently purchased single product being a very high THC:CBD -inhaled product followed by a high CBD:THC -enteral and balanced - enteral product. For specific differences in the most frequently purchased products among qualifying conditions, the reader is encouraged to refer back to those specific sections. 73 6. Benefits Summary Information on patient benefits comes from the Patient Self -Evaluation (PSE) completed by patients prior to each medical cannabis purchase and from patient and health care practitioner surve ys. Results of analysis of PSE and survey data indicate perceptions of a high degree of benefit for most patients. Patients responded to a survey question asking them how much benefit they believe they received from using medical cannabis on a scale from 1 (no benefit) to 7 (great deal of benefit). Across all patients 64% indicated a benefit rating of 6 or 7 and this degree of benefit was indicated by at least half of the patients with each medical condition (see Table 6.1). A small but important proporti on of patients indicated little or no benefit: 9% gave a rating of 1, 2, or 3. When patients were asked what the most important benefit was for them, two -thirds indicated a reduction in symptoms directly related to their qualifying medical condition and mo st of the remainder indicated more general quality of life benefits. An important part of this report is the verbatim comments written by patients, and the reader is encouraged to review these comments in Appendix A : Patient -Reported Benefits from Surveys . Examples of these comments include: \"Almost all muscle spasm and pain associated with spasms are gone. I used to have constant nerve triggered pain that is minimal now. Results were almost immediate. I am sleeping way better now also.\" \"[NAME] has passe d away. I am her daughter and was her care giver. She was open to trying medical cannabis and we got the liquid form. It was a saving grace. She was in a lot of pain and when prescribed medications did NOT work - we started this and it kept her calm and re laxed. I am very thankful that we were able to have this option available. It helped to make her last months more bearable and truly it would have been miserable without it.\" \"I am getting enough sleep for the first time since about 2011. My absence seizur es have gone from 3 -4 a day to almost 0. It also has lessened the severity of grand mal seizures. The recovery time after has gone from around 12 hours to around 4.\" \"At first it helped a lot but my seizures have returned.\" \"Spasms - only a little better.\" 74 Table 6.1 . Patient -perceived benefit (n=792). No Response 1 2 or 3 4 or 5 6 or 7 All Patients 4% experienced: 1=no benefit; 7=great deal of benefit. Health care practitioners were somewhat more conservative in assessment of benefit to their patients. Across all the benefit ratings by health care practitioners, 38% indicated a rating of 6 or 7 and 23% indicated little or no benefit (rating of 1, 2, or 3). Similarity in benefit assessment between health care practitioners and patients appears to vary by medical condition, with highest discrepancy among seizure patients. Descriptive comments suggest at l east part of the difference is driven by perspective of what constitutes benefit. The patients cite quality of life benefits more often than the health care practitioners, who appear to focus more on objective measures such as seizure counts. The symptom scores provided in the Patient Self -Evaluation data have the advantage of completeness, since they are required prior to each medical cannabis purchase. In this report a reduction of 30% was applied to most symptoms to indicate clinically meaningful sympt om reduction. In the text of the report, we present results for the more conservative of the two methods used to calculate 30% symptom reduction. However, Appendix D : Symptom Results 75 from the Patient Self -Evaluation shows results for both methods (details can be found in this chapter). Results show patterns similar to those in the survey benefits rating, but usually somewhat smaller in size. For example, among patients with muscle spasms, weekly muscle spasm frequenc y was reduced 30% within the first four months of medical cannabis use in 48% of patients (see Table 6.2). Importantly, in the four months after first achieving this degree of spasm reduction, more than half the patients retained this degree of improvemen t. That is, of all patients with muscle spasms, 48% achieved 30% reduction in spasm frequency and 28% both achieved that degree of improvement and retained it over the next four months. Full results for symptom improvement analyses and for persistence of improvements are in Appendix D: Symptom Results from the Patient Self -Evaluation . Results for selected symptoms are presented in Table 6.2. For most symptoms, between half and two -thirds of patients who achieve clinically meaningful improvement retained th at degree of improvement over the next four months. Examples of proportion of patients achieving and retaining 30% symptom reduction include: Among seizure patients, 68% reported 30% reduction in seizure frequency and 49% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Among patients with Tourette syndrome, 61% reported 30% reduction in tic frequency and 46% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Among pa tients with Crohn's disease, 51% reported 30% reduction in number of liquid stools per day and 29% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Among patients with severe, persistent muscle spasms, 48% report ed 30% reduction in spasm frequency and 28% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Among cancer patients with at least moderate levels of nausea when they started using medical cannabis, 38% reported 3 0% reduction of nausea and 23% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Among cancer patients with at least moderate levels of pain when they started using medical cannabis, 29% reported 30% reduction of pain and 12% both achieved that level of reduction and retained it, on average, for at least four months Moderate to severe levels of non -disease -specific symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety, and sleep difficulties were common across all the medical conditio ns. And the reductions in these symptoms was often quite large. These findings support the understanding that some of the benefit perceived by patients is expressed as improved quality of life. The type(s) of medical cannabis used at the time pa tients achieved clinically meaningful improvement was analyzed for each symptom assessed within each category of medical condition. Full results of those analyses are in Appendix D: Symptom Results from the Patient Self-Evaluation and summaries are presen ted in this chapter. In most cases, a few combinations 76 of product types were purchased more frequently than others when analy zing data by patient condition 77 Table 6.2 Symptom improvement for selected symptoms .

Utilizing expertise within the Minnesota Department of Health, the Office of Medical Cannabis developed a Patient Experience survey, which captures information on benefits and harms of program participation. A paralle l survey was developed for each patient's certifying health care practitioner, which captures similar information from the clinician's perspective. The surveys include scaled response and open -response questions; health care practitioners were also asked t o provide any clinical observations they noted about the patient's experience with medical cannabis. Healthcare providers familiar with the program provided feedback as part of the development process. Survey Methodology and Data Preparation The surveys ar e provided through an online platform with a hard copy alternative. The Patient Experience survey is sent three months after the patient's first medical cannabis purchase, six months after the first purchase and every six months thereafter. Healthcare prac titioner surveys are sent six months after the patient's first purchase and every six months thereafter. Surveys are accessible through the patient or healthcare practitioner's registry page and through introductory emails containing unique links. To maxim ize survey submission rates, the survey can be submitted with incomplete responses to any of the questions. Each of the surveys is available online to the recipient for 45 days. Patient recipients receive reminder emails after one week; after two weeks wit h no response, paper copies of surveys are mailed to the recipient. For patients without online access the full process is accomplished by mail. Initially, patient and healthcare practitioners (HCPs) were sent one survey three months after the patient's f irst purchase, without recurrence. This schedule was revised to include recurring surveys roughly every six months to provide patients and their HCPs an opportunity to report ongoing progress or changes to the patient's condition; however the HCP survey se nt three months after the first purchase was eliminated based on feedback that three months may not allow enough time for the provider to see their patient following initial certification. These changes were implemented in April 2016; as a result, HCP surv ey data collected three months after the first purchase is only available for the first six months of the program (this includes patients who enrolled and made a first purchase between July 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015). All survey data presented in this chapter are from the patient and health care practitioner surveys sent three months after the patient's first medical cannabis purchase. Patients and their certifying HCPs were asked to report the \"most important benefit\" and \"most important negative effect\" related to medical cannabis treatment. Survey responses from patients and health care practitioners on perceived benefits and perceive d negative effects 79 were reported in free -text format; each response was individually reviewed and classified into a category of benefit or negative effects. Reported benefits typically included either direct improvement of symptoms related to the patient's qualifying condition or more general improvements in health or quality of life, referred to in this report as global health benefits. Additionally, many responses included more than one type of benefit; in these cases, the first reported benefit was pres umed to be the most important benefit. In this report, we examine both overall perceptions of benefit, as well as type of reported benefit. Patient Experience Survey Results Patient Experience Survey Response Rate Of 1491 patients who were approved and ma de their first medical cannabis purchase in the first year of the program (July 1, 2015 - June 30, 2016), 792 patients (53%) submitted a survey three months after making the first purchase. As of December 31, 2016, 90 patients (5%) were known to be deceased since enrolling in the program. These patients were included in this report, as in some cases caregivers or relatives and HCPs completed surveys, reflecting on the patient's experience for the period of time the patient did use medical cannabis.

Elderly patients (ages 65 and over) had the lowest response rate (41%); patients certified for cancer and terminal illness also had low response r ates relative to other certified condition groups (41% and 48%, respectively). In general, racial and ethnic minorities were under -represented in survey responses. Patient Perceptions of Benefits from Medical Cannabis The Patient Experience and HCP survey s both ask respondents to report how much benefit they believe the patient received from using medical cannabis, on a scale from 1 (no benefit) to 7 (a great deal of benefit). Figures 6.1 -6.10 show the distribution of benefit scores on this scale, as repor ted by patients, for all patients and by patients with each qualifying condition. The percentages in Figures 6.1 -6.10 are based on the total number of patient responses in each condition group and not the number of complete benefit scores for each group ( 33 patients submitted surveys without completing the benefit score question, but were included in the denominators). ALL QUALIFYING CONDI TIONS Figure 6.1 below shows all patient responses about degree of benefit experienced. Among patient respondents, 43% report the highest degree of benefit from medical cannabis: \"a great deal of benefit\" or a score of 7 on a scale from 1 -7. Figure 6.1.

Patient -Perceived Benefit: ALS (N=11) Patient Perceptions of Types of Benefits from Medical Cannabis Treatment In both the Patient Experience and HCP surveys, patients and their certifying HCPs had an opportunity to describe the most significant benefit to the patient that was associated with medical cannabis treatment. Each response was reviewed and classified as sym ptom improvement (based on qualifying condition), or global health benefit, which included all health benefits not specifically related to the relief of symptoms directly associated with the patient's qualifying medical condition(s). Note that not all comp leted surveys had a response for this question; 86% of the Patient Experience surveys did and 66% of the HCP surveys did. Among the 681 completed Patient Experience survey responses that indicated a most significant benefit, 64 % classified the benefit as symptom improvement and 25% classified it as a global health benefit; the remaining comments regarding benefit were improvement of symptoms other than those related to the qualifying condition or global health benefits. Tabulation of those responses is re ported below, but the reader is also encouraged to read the verbatim responses in Appendix A: Patient -Reported Benefits from Surveys . Reading the words written by the patient gives a more nuanced understanding of the benefits and provides a reminder that each of the respondent s is an individual person. The following is a selection of the comments, chosen to reflect the full range of benefits perceived: 91 \"Almost all muscle spasms and pain associated with spasms are gone. I used to have constant nerve trigge red pain that is minimal now. Results were almost immediate. I am sleeping way better now also.\" \"A large reduction in symptoms, allowing me to participate in my daily life without a large number of limits my symptoms would place on me - stools decreased from over 8 a day to about 2 with much less blood and mucous in stools. Pain has reduced to a tolerable amount\" \"[NAME] has passed away. I am her daughter and was her care giver. She was open to trying medical cannabis and we got the liquid form. It was a saving grace. She was in a lot of pain and when prescribed medications did NOT work - we started this and it kept her calm and relaxed. I am very thankful that we were able to have this option available. It helped to make her last months more bearable and truly it would have been miserable without it.\" \"Has eased my muscle spasms and cramping. Has helped my visual issues. Has helped me to maintain healthy weight. Have been able to sleep much better and have cut other pain prescriptions way back. Seems to take pain away enough that I have been more active and am able to function on household tasks to a somewhat normal level. My brain seems to be working better as well ie. concentration/focusing and remembering.\" \"I am getting enough sleep for the first tim e since about 2011. My absence seizures have gone from 3 -4 a day to almost 0. It also has lessened the severity of grand mal seizures. The recovery time after has gone from around 12 hours to around 4.\" \"Within 1 week of use, my tics disappeared and ha ve stayed gone even with occasional use. This has never happened previously in my life, so it is very effective.\" \"At first it helped a lot but my seizures have returned.\" \"Spasms - only a little better.\" Symptom Improvement from Medical Cannabis Treat ment Table 6.6 summarizes the reported \"most important benefits\" which could be considered improvement of a symptom related to the patient's qualifying condition from reports of patients, categorized by the benefit score reported by the patient. For patien ts with severe muscle spasms, reports of spasm reduction or pain reduction were considered symptom improvement. For patients with cancer (regardless of whether their condition was associated with severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, cachexia or severe wasting, or a combination), pain reduction, nausea and/or vomiting reduction, and weight gain and/or appetite improvement were considered symptom improvement. For patients with seizures, reports of fewer seizures, less severe seizures, or both, were considered symptom improvement. For patients with Crohn's disease, pain reduction, weight gain and/or appetite improvement, and reduction in related symptoms including stool frequency were considered symptom improvement. For patients with terminal illness es (regardless of whether their condition was associated with severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, cachexia or 92 severe wasting, or a combination), reduction in pain, nausea and/or vomiting and weight gain and/or appetite improvement were consider ed symptom improvement. For patients certified for HIV/AIDS, reduction in pain, nausea and/or vomiting, and weight gain and/or appetite improvement were considered symptom improvement. In patients with Tourette syndrome, reduced tics or specific mention of reduced Tourette symptoms were considered symptom improvement. In patients certified for glaucoma, reduction in intraocular pressure or reference to treatment of glaucoma \"symptoms\" was considered symptom improvement. Finally, for patients with ALS, reduc tion in pain or spasms were considered symptom improvement. Among patients with severe and persistent muscle spasms, 26% reported pain reduction and another 25% reported spasm reduction as the most important benefit. Among seizure patients, 51% reported se izure reduction (either in frequency or severity). Among cancer patients, 26% reported pain reduction as the primary benefit; 25% reported weight gain, appetite improvement, or reduced nausea or vomiting. Among Crohn's disease respondents, 25% reported red uced pain, 16% reported reduced severity or frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and 4% reported weight gain or appetite improvement as the primary benefit. Among patients with terminal illness, 21% reported reduced nausea or vomiting, 18% reported pain reduction and 8% reported weight gain or appetite improvement as the most important benefit. Thirty -one percent of glaucoma patient respondents reported reduction of glaucoma - related symptoms. Among ALS patients, 27% reported pain reduction and 9% reported spasm reduction as the most important benefit. Among HIV/AIDS patients, 25% reported reduced pain, 17% reported reduced nausea and/or vomiting and 12% reported weight gain or appetite improvement as the most important benefit. Finally, among patients with Tourette syndrome, 63% reported a reduction in tics or other symptoms of Tourette syndrome. Table 6.6.

These responses were reviewed and classified into categories of \"global health benefi ts\"- broader benefits which impact the patient's overall health. Global health benefits reported by patients included improvement in quality of life, improvement in sleep (whether or not explicitly tied to reduction in symptoms related to qualifying condit ion), improved mobility and/or ability to function or perform regular tasks, reduced anxiety or increased calmness, improved alertness and/or cognitive functioning, and reduced usage of other medications (often reported as reduction in dosage and/or side e ffects related to use of other medications). Clearly, global health benefits may be due to improvements in symptoms specifically related to the qualifying condition, so the dividing line between these categories is a bit blurry. Table 6.7 shows the numbe r of responses by type of global health benefit, along with the associated benefit score reported by the patient. Overall, 6% of patient respondents reported 95 improved sleep as the most important benefit from medical cannabis; 4% reported improved quality of life, 4% reported reduced usage of other medication, 3% reported reduced anxiety, and 2% reported improved alertness or cognitive function.

The subset of Patient Experience survey responses that corresponds to this group of HCP responses is included below for comparison. Of 774 patients in this group, 437 patients (57%) submitted a survey three months after making the first purchase. Of the 262 health care practitioners (HCP) who certified these patients, 114 (43.5%) completed s urveys for 251 (32%) patients. Table 6.8.

Patient response rate was lowest among the oldest age group (65+; 51%) and HCP response rate was genera lly lower for older age groups. Among HCP responses, certifiers of patients with HIV/AIDS and Crohn's disease had the highest response rates (46% and 43%, respectively). Among patient responses, patients certified for severe and persistent muscle spasms, s eizures and Crohn's disease had the highest response rates (60%, 63%, and 59%, respectively). Finally, racial and ethnic minorities were generally under -represented among patient responses. Healthcare Practitioner Perceptions of Benefit The Patient Experi ence and HCP surveys both ask respondents to report how much benefit they believe the patient received from using medical cannabis, on a scale from 1 (no benefit) to 7 (a great deal of benefit). Figures 6.11 -6.20 show the distribution of benefit scores on this scale, as reported by HCPs, for all patients and by patients with each qualifying condition. A note on how proportions were calculated: the total number of HCP responses is reflected in Figures 6.11 -6.20; this includes 45 HCP responses with either no response or a \"0\" option selected for the benefit scale, which indicates that the HCP did not have enough information about the patient to answer the question of benefit.) Note that results from patient surveys (Figures 6.1 -6.10) and health care practiti oner surveys (Figures 6.11 -6.20) do not pertain to identical groups of patients. That is, some patients have 101 only a patient survey completed, some have only a HCP survey completed, some have neither completed, and some (n=126) have a completed survey from both the patient and their certifying HCP. For this reason, comparison of results from patient and HCP surveys must be approached with caution, except for the last group, where there is a completed survey from both the patient and the HCP. Further on in this section (Table 6.13 and Figures 6.21 -6.28) comparisons for that last group are presented. In general, responses from HCPs report a lower degree of benefit than the patient responses. ALL QUALIFYING CONDI TIONS Figure 6.11 shows all HCP responses abo ut degree of benefit experienced. Benefit ratings were provided on 206 of the 251 submitted surveys. Among the 251 surveys, 32 (13%) reported no benefit and 51 (20%) reported the highest degree of benefit (score of 7); 150 (60%) reported a benefit score 4 on the seven -point scale. Figure 6.11.

HCP -Perceived Benefit: ALS (N=5) 111 HCP Perceptions of Symptom Improvement from Medical Cannabis Treatment Similar to the format in the Patient Experience survey, the HCP surveys asks certifying HCPs to describe the most significant benefit to the patient that is associated with medical cannabis treatment. Each response was reviewed and classified into broad ca tegories of symptom improvement or global health benefits, as described in an earlier section. A full report of all benefit comments from HCPs can be found in Appendix B: Healthcare Practitioner -Reported Benefits from Surveys . Table 6 summarizes the report ed \"most important benefits\" which could be considered improvement of a symptom related to the patient's qualifying condition from reports of both patients and HCPs, again using a subset of patient responses from the same time window as HCP responses (surv eys for patients making a first purchase between July 2015 and December 2015).

However, it is worth noting that relatively high levels of symptom improvement benefit (most scores are above 4) are seen in both patient and HCP survey results. Among patient respondents certified for muscle spasms, 22% report spasm reduction at a high degree of benefi t (scores of 6 or 7) and 18% of HCP responses for patients with muscle spasms report spasm reduction at a high degree of benefit. Among responses of patients certified for seizures, 40% reported reduction in seizure number or severity at a high degree of b enefit; among HCP responses for patients with seizures, 14% reported seizure reduction (severity or frequency) at a high degree of benefit. Among patient responders certified for cancer, 15% reported pain reduction at a high degree of benefit; 13% reported reduced nausea or vomiting at a high degree of benefit and 12% reported weight gain or appetite improvement at a high degree of benefit. Among HCP responses for patients certified for cancer, 8% reported pain reduction at a high degree of benefit, 14% rep orted reduced nausea or vomiting and 2% reported weight gain or appetite improvement at a high degree of benefit. 115 HCP Perceptions of Global Health Benefits from Medical Cannabis Treatment Table 6.12 summarizes responses to the Patient Experience and HCP surveys about the most significant benefit to the patient that were not classified as improvement of symptoms related to the qualifying medical condition. As with Table 6.11, the proportion of patients reporting a type of global health benefit cannot be directly compared to the proportion of HCPs reporting a type of global health benefit to the patient because each group of responders is different. However, in general a higher proportion of the patient responses report a global health benefit as the primary benefit from medical cannabis than HCP responses and generally global health benefits are reported at a relatively high degree of perceived benefit (scores of 4 or greater). Overall, 1% o f HCP respondents and 6% of patient respondents reported improved sleep as the most important benefit from medical cannabis; 3% of HCP respondents and 4% of patients reported improved quality of life; 2% of HCP reports and 3% of patient reports cited reduc ed usage of other medications or related side effects as the most important benefit. A full report of all benefit comments from HCPs can be found in Appendix B: Healthcare Practitioner -Reported Benefits from Surveys .

A third of the 114 observations describe a decrease in the patients' other medications - mainly opioids and benzodiazepines. The survey healthcare practitioners will complete for patients certified for intractable pain will ask specifically about this issue. There were a few comments about drug interactions with anti - epileptic drugs, including in some cases the anticipated ability to decrease dose of Clobazam. A full report of these observations can be found in Appendix C: Healthcare Practitioner -Reported Clinical Observations from Surveys . 119 Patient Versus HCP Perceptions of Benefit from Medical Cannabis Among survey respondents, there were 126 patients who submitted a survey for whom their certifying health care practitioner also completed a survey. Comparison of be nefit scores reported by the patient to benefit scores reported by the healthcare practitioner are shown in Table 6.13, grouping scores of 1 or 2 in a category representing no or little benefit; scores of 3, 4, or 5 were grouped into a category representin g mild or moderate benefit and scores of 6 or 7 were placed in a category representing strong benefit. Among these 126 patients and their HCPs, 81 (64%) of patient -HCP pairs were in general agreement regarding degree of benefits experienced: 46% reported s trong benefit from medical cannabis; 15% reported mild or moderate benefit and 3% reported no or little benefit (Table 6.13). When interpreting the meaning of these comparisons, it must be kept in mind that the 126 patients for whom both Patient Experienc e and HCP survey results are available are not necessarily representative of all patients who enrolled in the program during its first year of operation.

Figure 6.28. ALS (N=3): Perceived Benefit Benefits Reported on Surveys: Conclusions Of 1491 patients making a purchase in the first program year, 53% completed a survey three mon ths after the first purchase. Among respondents, 43% reported experiencing the highest degree of benefit from medical cannabis and 87% reported at least a moderate degree of benefit (score of 4 or greater on a 1 to 7 scale). Patients reported the types of benefits experienced, which were predominantly (64%) various types of symptom improvement; many patients (25%) also reported global health benefits as the most important benefits from medical cannabis. For patients making a purchase in the first six months of the program (n=774), 32% of HCP surveys were submitted. Overall, HCP reports of benefit were more conservative than those of patients, but 20% reported that the patient experienced the highest degree of benefit from medical cannabis and 60% reported at least a moderate degree of benefit. Among patients purchasing in the first six program months, 126 patients had both patient and HCP surveys completed and comparison of benefit scores indicated general agreement between the two scores for most patients.

Patients are required to complete a PSE prio r to each medical cannabis purchase (including before their first medical cannabis purchase). This allows for capture of the patients' symptoms at baseline - prior to taking any medical cannabis, as well as prior to each subsequent medical cannabis purchas e. Hence, symptom change over time can be analyzed during the patients' participation in the program. All patients received a standard set of 8 symptom measures on the PSE. In addition, some patients received additional symptom questions depending on thei r qualifying medical condition(s). These two sets of symptom measures will be subsequently discussed below. Data from the PSE were extracted from patients who enrolled during the first program year (enrolled between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016 ; 1660 pat ients enrolled during this time period). Standard 8 Symptom Measures The standard 8 symptom measures that all patients received are answered on a 0 -10 numerical rating scale (NRS), with 0 indicating absence of the symptom to 10 indicating that the symptom is as bad as the patient can imagine (see Box 6.1). Therefore, higher scores on these measures indicate poorer management of these symptoms. Patients are asked to rate symptom severity over the past 24 hours. Box 6.1 . Listing of the Standard 8 symptom meas ures that all patients answer, including the responses options available to patients.

The threshold o f 30% reduction on a 0 -10 point scale was chosen because this threshold has been documented in clinical trials to represent clinically meaningful change - especially for pain reduction and spasticity reduction. Examples of 30% change include moving from a score of 10 to a score of 7, from 9 to 6, from 8 to 5, from 7 to 4, etc. QUESTION 2 If a patient achieved at least a 30% improvement on symptoms within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase (determined in Question 1) , what percentage of them will, on average, still maintain that level of improvement in the four months following that initial 30% symptom improvement? [Four -month follow -up period] QUESTION 3 What medical cannabis products were purchased just prior to the patient's initial report of symptom improvement (first time patient indicated 30% improvement on the PSE)? What was the average daily intake of delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) for these product types? To address Question 1 the following procedure was ad opted for each standard 8 measure: all patients who scored 4 or higher at baseline were identified as those experiencing moderate to severe symptoms, and all standard 8 responses that were submitted within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase were retained. From this dataset, each patient's standard 8 responses were compared to their baseline response over time. The first instance a patient achieved at least a 30% symptom improvement was recorded, effectively demonstrating when - during the fi rst 4 months following their first medical cannabis purchase - the patient achieved symptom improvement, if at all. Calculating the percentage of patients who achieved 30% symptom improvement within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase (Quest ion 1) was done in two ways. In one method, the number of patients who achieved 30% symptom improvement within 4 months was divided by the total number of patients that ever made a first purchase (patients with baseline PSE data). In the other method, the number of patients achieving 30% symptom improvement within 4 months was divided by patients who had submitted additional PSE data (beyond their baseline response) within 4 months of their first purchase. The denominator in M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 130 the former method includes all patients who made a first purchase (all patients with a baseline PSE submission), while the latter method effectively restricts the dominator to those patients who submitted additional PSE symptom data following their baseline submission and within 4 mont hs of their first purchase. Therefore, the former method allows for a more conservative estimation of symptom benefit. In the text of this report, we present results using the former, more conservative estimate of benefit. Those who made no additional purc hases after their first purchase may have discontinued use because of lack of effectiveness, though they may have discontinued use for other reasons as well (i.e., medical cannabis cost, side effects, etc.). Since Question 1 examines symptom improvement w ithin 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase, patients who had not been enrolled in the program for at least 4 months since their first medical cannabis purchase were not included in the analysis. When PSE data were extracted in late December 20 16, 1512 patients from the first year cohort (91.1% of the 1st year cohort) had been enrolled for at least 4 months since their first medical cannabis purchase \u2014results on the standard 8 symptom measures are reported on this cohort subset. Question 2 was addressed by observing all symptom responses in the four months following the time point when the patient first achieved 30% symptom improvement. For each patient, all symptom responses identified during those follow -up four months were ave raged together. Patients who, on average, still maintained at least a 30% symptom improvement from baseline were identified as those showing persistence in their symptom benefits. For Question 3, products that were purchased just prior to each patient's in itial 30% symptom improvement were identified and categorized by their THC/CBD ratio and intended route of administration (ROA). See Box 6.2 for definitions of these categories.

Categories to describe medical cannabis products purchased by patients . Overall Results on Standard 8 Symptom Measures Data on the Standard 8 symptom measures were first analyzed across all patients regardless of their qualifying condition(s) and are displayed in Table 6.14 (n = 1512). The third and fourth column respectively display the number and percentage of patients (out of 1512 patients) experiencing moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (baseline response 4) on a given Standard 8 measure. With the exception of vomiting, the responses from patients indicated a high degree of burden on all symptom measures at baseline (~60 -90% patients indicated moderate to severe symptoms). The fifth column in Table 6.14 shows the percentage and number of patients (out of those reporting at moderate to severe levels at baseline) who had achieved at least a 30% symptom improvement at any time within 4 m onths of their first medical cannabis purchase. Anywhere from 36% to 60% of patients reported achieving at least a 30% improvement in symptoms within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase. Improvements in pain and fatigue were the least likely to reach 30% improvement in patients (respectively at 36.3% and 40.2%), with the greatest proportion of patients reaching 30% improvement in nausea (55.6%), depression (56.8%), and vomiting (60.2%). The number of patients who had symptom data in the 4 -month period following their initial 30% symptom improvement are listed in the sixth column in Table 6.14. All symptom responses during this time period were averaged together within each patient. The seventh column shows the percentage and number of patients who had achieved 30% symptom improvement that had - on average - maintained at least that level of improvement in the 4 -Medical Cannabis Product s Categorized by THC:CBD Content Ratio : Very High THC to CBD = 100:1 or higher High THC to CBD = >4:1 up to 99:1 Balanced = up to 4:1 High CBD to THC = 1:1 to 99:1 Very High CBD to THC = 100:1 or higher Product Routes of Administration (ROA): Enteral: for absorption through the gastroi ntestinal tract (includes capsules and oral solutions to swallow).

Roughly a half to two -thirds of the patients who achieved at least 30% symptom improvement had maintained it in the following 4 months. Lastly, the right -most column shows the percentage of all patients who both achieved and maintained at least a 30% symptom improvement in the 4 -month follow -up period. For the majority of all symptoms, roughly a third of all patients experiencing m oderate to severe symptoms will both achieve and maintain at least a 30% improvement in symptoms for at least 4 months.

Results are presented in Table 6.15 below. The first column indicates the qualifying condition and the total number of patients who had been enrolled in the program for at least 4 months since their first medical cannabis purchase. For some conditions, results are further broken down by condition s ubcategories (i.e., breakdown cancer patients based on whether their certifying condition was accompanied by pain, nausea/vomiting, etc.); condition subcategories are preceded by a star (*)). The third and fourth columns in Table 6.15 indicate the number a nd percentage of patients who experienced moderate to severe symptoms (score 4) at baseline for each symptom. The fifth column in Table 6.15 indicates the percentage and number of patients (out of those reporting at moderate t o severe levels at baseline) that had achieved at least a 30% symptom improvement at any time within 4 months of their first medical cannabis purchase. The number of patients who had symptom data in the 4 -month period following their initial 30% symptom improvement are liste d in the sixth column in Table 6.15 . All symptom responses submitted during this time period were averaged together within each patient. The seventh column shows the percentage and number of patients that had achieved at least a 30% symptom improvement that had su bsequently maintained it, on average, for at least 4 months. Lastly, the right -most column shows the percentage of all patients that had both achieved and maintained at least a 30% symptom improvement for at least 4 months. Results generally show a high degree of burden for these eight symptoms at baseline. The instances where symptom severity is noticeably lower tend to be as expected; for example, nausea and vomiting in patients with Tourette syndrome and in patients with g laucoma. Among baseline responses to the eight symptom measures, those with the highest proportion rated as moderate to severe (score 4) include fatigue, disturbed sleep, pain, and anxiety. For each of the medical conditions, a substantial proportion of p atients achieved 30% reduction in most of the eight symptoms. Improvement was generally a bit higher in patients with seizures and with Tourette Syndrome and a bit lower in patients with cancer. Overall, a smaller proportion of patients achieved 30% redu ction of pain and fatigue and a higher proportion of patients achieved 30% improvement in appetite and reduction in vomiting. For each medical condition, roughly half to three -quarters of the patients who experienced a 30% reduction in a particular sympt om within the first four months maintained that level of improvement over the following four months.

Medical cannabis products that were purchased just prior to the initial 30% symptom improvement are discussed only briefly in this section (Question 3), and the reader is encouraged to see Appendix D: Symptom Results from the Patient Self -Evaluation for the full table of results. Here, only a few results regarding medical cannabis purchases are discussed as examples \u2014some in relation to improvements on a particular Standard 8 measure, and others in relation to a particular condition -specific symptom measure. Table 6.16 below shows the most common medical cannabis products that were purchased by cancer patients just prior to achieving the initial 30% reduction in nausea sympto ms. The second column from the right indicates the number of patients who purchased specific products just prior to that initial symptom reduction (products purchased indicated by \"X\"s). The table also shows the average daily amount of THC and CBD (mg) pat ients consumed (right - most column), which was d erived from manufacturer -supplied product information and pharmacist -entered calculations of how long the purchased supply wo uld last. Very High THC:CBD vaporization products were purchased most frequently (n = 20), followed by a combination of Very High THC:CBD enteral products and Very High THC:CBD vaporization products (n = 12).

Condition -Specific Symptom Measures In addition to the Standard 8 measures, some patients received additional symptom questions on the PSE to more adequately address condition -specific symptoms. These include, among others, questions on seizure frequency for seizure patients, questions on sp asm frequency for muscle spasm and ALS patients, and Crohn's activity in Crohn's patients.

All condition -specific measures were investigated within the same framework as the Standard 8 measures: 1) what percentage of patients achieved symptom improvement within the four months since their f irst medical cannabis purchase compared to their baseline responses, 2) what percentage of those achieving symptom improvement showed general persistence in the 4 -month follow -up period, and 3) what medical cannabis products were purchased just prior to th e patient reporting initial symptom improvements. A summary of results are similarly presented in a table like those presented for the Standard 8 measures (see Table 6.19 below). The first column in Table 6.19 lists each condition that receiv ed additional symptom questions beyond the Standard 8. The second column briefly indicates the nature of these additional condition -specific symptom measures, with the number of patients included in the analysis at baseline indicated in the third column (b aseline, meaning patients who provided data and met criteria on these measures at the beginning of the program - prior to purchasing any medical cannabis). The fourth column indicates the percentage and number of patients achieving a specified threshold of symptom improvement within four months of purchasing their first medical cannabis (denominator is patients included in the analysis at baseline). The threshold to determine symptom improvement for these analyses are subsequently described below, found in the descriptive section for each condition. The number of patients who had symptom data in the 4 -month period following their initial symptom improvement are listed in the fifth column in Table 6.19. All symptom responses during this time period were avera ged together within each patient. The sixth column indicates the percentage and number of patients who had achieved symptom improvement that subsequently still maintained that improvement for at least 4 months. Lastly, the right -most column shows the perce ntage of all patients who both achieved and maintained symptom improvements for at least 4 months. A more detailed discussion of these condition -specific results will follow Table 6.19.M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E AR 141 Table 6.19.

First, patients were given the option to respond to the number of muscle spasms they experienced the day before or the number of muscle spasms they experienced within the last week. These allowed for the calculation of weekly spasm frequency. Secondly, patients were asked to rate the severity of their muscle spasms on a 0 -10 numerical rating scale (NRS), with 0 indicating absenc e of spasms to 10 indicating spasticity being as bad as the patient could imagin e. For the analysis in Table 6.19 above , responses to the 0 -10 spasticity measure were restricted to patients experiencing moderate to severe spasticity at baseline (score of 4 or higher), while all patients responding to the weekly spasms frequency question were included in the analysis. In the analysis of both measures, symptom improvement was defined as achieving at least a 30% reduction in symptoms (30% decrease in weekly sp asm frequency; 30% decrease on the 0 -10 NRS spasticity measure) compared to baseline. Weekly spasm frequency was reduced by 30% in nearly half (48.0%) of the muscle spasm patients. Among patients who ac hieved 30% reduction, 58 % (27.6% of patients include d in analysis at baseline) retained that level of improvement over the next four months. Severity of muscle spasticity was reduced by 30% for 36.4% of the patients with moderate to severe muscle spasticity at baseline. Among patients who achieved 30% red uction, 47% (17.2% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that level of improvement over the next four months. Table 6.20 below shows the top 5 medical cannabis product types that were purchased by muscle spasm patients just prior to achieving 30% weekly spasm reduction for the first time, including the number of patients who purchased those specific product types (second column from right). It also shows the average daily amount of THC and CBD (mg) patients consumed (right -most column), which was derived from manufacturer -derived product information and pharmacist -entered calculations of how long the purchased supply would last. Full purchasing details are in Appendix D: Symptom Results from the Patient Self -Evaluation . The most frequently purchased product types preceding the initial symptom improvement were a combination of Balanced THC:CBD products for oral administration and Balanced THC:CBD products for vaporization (n = 34), followed by Very High THC:CBD products for va porization (n = 30).M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E AR 143 Table 6.20.

Patients who experienced chemotherapy -induced nausea and v omiting at moderate to severe levels at baseline (score of 4 or higher) were included in the analysis in Table 6.19, with symptom improvement being defined as achieving at least a 30% improvement in symptoms (30% decrease on the 0 -10 nausea/vomiting NRS) c ompared to baseline. Severity of chemotherapy -induced nausea was reduced by 30% for 37.4% of the patients with moderate to severe chemotherapy -induced nausea at baseline. Among the patients who achieved 30% reduction, 35% (12.9% of patients included in a nalysis at baseline) retained that level of improvement over the next four months. Severity of chemotherapy -induced vomiting was reduced by 30% for 41.6% of the patients with moderate to severe chemotherapy -induced vomiting at baseline. Among the patients who achieved 30% reduction, 56% (23.4% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that level of improvement over the next four months. Cancer: Cachexia and Severe Wasting Body weights were analyzed for patients certified for cancer accompani ed by cachexia and/or severe wasting. Symptom improvement was defined as achieving at least a 3% increase in body weight compared to baseline weight. An increase of at least 3% in body weight was reported by 13.6% of patients. Among the patients who achiev ed 3% increase in body weight, 45% (6.1% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that increase over the next four months. Seizures Patients with seizures were given two questions to assess the severity of their seizures. First, patients were given the option to respond to the number of seizures they experienced the day before or the number of seizures they experienced within the last week. These allowed for the calculation of weekly spasm frequency. Table 6.19 shows results from the weekly seizure frequency measure, with symptom improvement defined as achieving at least a 30% improvement in symptoms (30% decrease in weekly seizure freq uency) compared to baseline. Weekly seizure frequency was reduced by 30% in 68.3% of the seizure patients. Among patients who achieved 30% reduction, 71% (48.5% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that level of improvement over the nex t four months.

These three questions addressed the following: 1) the number of liquid or soft stools experienced yesterday, 2) general well -being yesterday \"None\", \"Mild\", \"Moderate\", \"Severe\"). Responses to these three questions were summed into a combined score for each patient (combined according to HBI scoring guidelines) as well as analyzed separately in Tabl e 6.19. The three questions were selected from the HBI because they were patient -reported measures (versus clinician assessments). The HBI has been validated, but since only three questions from the HBI were used, the clinical significance of these aggrega te and individual scores is unclear. Lastly, body weight data submitted through the PSE were analyzed and included in Table 6.19. Patients who indicated they experienced five or more liquid/soft stools at baseline were included in the analysis, with sympto m improvement defined as achieving at least a 30% reduction in liquid/soft stools. Patients who indicated their general well -being was \"Very Poor\" or \"Terrible\" at baseline were included in the well -being analysis, with symptom improvement defined as feeli ng \"Slightly Below Par\" or \"Very Well\". Patients who indicated they experienced \"Moderate\" or \"Severe\" abdominal pains were included in the abdominal pain analysis, with symptom improvement defined as experiencing \"Mild\" to \"No\" abdominal pain. For the com bined Crohn's activity measure (combined score on the three HBI measures), symptom improvement was defined as those achieving at least a 30% symptom improvement (30% decrease in the combined score compared to baseline). Lastly, body weight improvement was defined as a 3% increase in body weight. Number of liquid/soft stools per day decreased by 30% for 51.2% of patients with at least five liquid/soft stools per day at baseline. Among patients who achieved 30% reduction, 57% (29.3% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that level of improvement over the next four months. Severity of abdominal pain improved for 53.4% of patients with moderate or severe abdominal pain at baseline. Among patients who reported an improvement in abdominal pain, 36% (19.2% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that improvement over the next four months. General well -being improved for 46.7% of patients who described their baseline well -being as \"Very Poor\" or \"Terrible\" at baseline. Among patient s who reported an improvement in general well-being, 29% (13.3% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that improvement over the next four months. On the combined Crohn's activity measure (number of liquid/soft stools, abdominal pain, gener al well -being), 51.0% of Crohn's Disease patients achieved 30% improvement. Among M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 148 patients who achieved 30% reduction, 42% (21.6% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that level of improvement over the next four months. An increase of a t least 3% in body weight was reported by 20.6% of patients. Among the patients who achieved 3% increase in body weight, 57% (11.8% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that increase over the next four months. Terminal Illness Body weig ht measures on the PSE were analyzed in patients certified for terminal illness: accompanied by cachexia or severe wasting. Symptom improvement was defined as a 3% increase in body weight from their baseline body weight. An increase of at least 3% in body weight was reported by 20.7% of patients. Among the patients who achieved 3% increase in body weight, 50% (10.3% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that increase over the next four months. HIV/AIDS Body weight measures on the PSE were analyzed in HIV/AIDS patients. Similar to all body weight measures of improvement discussed previously, symptom improvement was defined as a 3% increase in body weight compared to their baseline body weight. An increase of at least 3% in body weight was r eported by 14.6% of patients. Among the patients who achieved 3% increase in body weight, 43% (6.3% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that increase over the next four months. Tourette Syndrome Patients with Tourette Syndrome were giv en two questions to assess the severity of their tics. First, patients were given the option to respond to the number of tics they experienced the day before or the number of tics they experienced within the last week. These allowed for the calculation of weekly tic frequency. For Table 6.19, weekly tic frequency was analyzed in all patients, with symptom improvement defined as a 30% improvement in symptoms (30% decrease in weekly tics compared to baseline). Weekly tic frequency was reduced by 30% in 60.7% of the Tourette Syndrome patients. Among patients who achieved 30% reduction, 76% (46.4% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that level of improvement over the next four months.

Glaucoma Intraocular pressure results were collected on the PSE from Glaucoma patients and are presented in Table 6.23 for each of the 21 patients i ncluded in this analysis. At the first PSE (prior to first medical cannabis purchase) patients were asked to provide the date and results of the most recent intraocular pressure test. On subsequent PSEs patients were asked to provide the date and results of any intraocular pressure test done since submission of the last PSE. Results for seven of the 21 patients (33%) suggest a decrease in intraocular pressure after initiation of medical cannabis: patients #4, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17, and 19. One of those seven did not show a decrease at 5 months, but did show a decrease at 9 months. Four of them had measurement results after the date of the result that indicated a decrease: patients #4, 16, 17, and 19. Of those four, three have results indicating persistence o f reduction over several months. The fourth (#19) had a reduction in month 2 but returned toward pre -medical cannabis levels at month 4. More detailed study, including accessing medical record data, would be needed to confirm measurement results and to a ssess whether observed improvements could have been due to changes in glaucoma therapy other than medical cannabis use.

First, patients were given the option to respond to the number of spasms they experienced the day before or the number of spasms they experienced within the last week. These allowed for the calculation of weekly spasm frequency. Table 6.19 presents results on weekly spasm frequency and spasm severity (0 -10 NRS). For the spasticity scale measure, patients who experienced moderate to severe spasms at baseline (scored 4 or higher) were included in the analysis, with symptom improvement defined as achieving at least a 30% symptom improvement (30% decrease on the 0 -10 NRS compared to baseline). Weekly spasm frequency was reduced by 30% in 33.3% of the ALS patients. Among patients who achieved 30% reduction, 67% (22.2% of patients included in analysis at baseline) retained that level of impro vement over the next four months. Severity of muscle spasticity was reduced by 30% for 20.0% of the ALS patients with moderate to severe muscle spasticity at baseline. Among the three patients who achieved 30% reduction, all three retained that level of improvement over the next four months (20.0% of patients included in analysis at baseline). Table 6.24 below shows the top 5 medical cannabis product types that were purchased by ALS patients just prior to achieving 30% weekly spasm reducti on for the first time, including the number of patients who purchased those specific product types (second column from right). It also shows the average daily amount of THC and CBD (mg) patients consumed (right -most column), which was derived from manufacture r-derived product information and pharmacist - entered calculations of how long the purchased supply would last. Full purchasing details are in Appendix D: Symptom Results from the Patient Self -Evaluation . The most frequently purchased product types precedi ng the initial symptom improvement were skewed towards balanced THC:CBD products and relatively high THC:CBD products.M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 152 Table 6.24.

Last column shows the average daily THC/CBD dose that was used by patients purchasing those product types (second column from right). Benefits Reported on the Patient Self -Evaluation: Conclusions Similar to survey results, the PSE also demonstrated improveme nts on symptoms in medical cannabis patients. Patients enrolling in the program initially report a high degree of symptom burden with anywhere from roughly 40 -60% of patients reporting symptom improvements within the 4 month period following their first me dical cannabis purchase. If patients experienced improvements in symptoms, roughly half to three -quarters of them maintained those levels of improvement in the 4 -month period following their initial report of improvement. There are some limitations on the PSE to consider when interpreting results. Firstly, there is no symptom data on patients who decide over time not to purchase medical cannabis any longer (or for extended periods of time). As discussed earlier, patients must complete a PSE prior to each me dical cannabis purchase. If a patient stops purchasing medical cannabis, there will be a parallel pause in symptom data to understand whether there may have been a lack of symptom improvements to halt purchases. This is the reason for presenting many analy ses on symptom improvements in the context of the initial baseline patient pool - regardless of whether they provided any subsequent symptom data or not. This allows for more of a conservative estimate of symptom benefit over time. A second limitation on t he PSE has to do with the patient's approach and conscientiousness in completing the PSE \u2014all symptom measures are self - reported which involves cognitive resources and motivation for the patient to complete the surveys as accurately as possible.

Adverse Side Effects Summary This chapter provides insight into the frequency and severity of adverse (negative) side effects through three sources of information: the Patient Self -Evaluation completed by the patient prior to each medical cannabis purchase, patient and health care practitioner surveys, and adverse event reports to the two medical cannabis manufacturers. The three information sources tell a similar story. Around 20 -25% of enrolled patients report negative physical or mental side effects of some kind, with the majority - around 60% - reporting only one and 90% reporting 3 or fewer unique side effects. The vast majority of adverse side effects, around 90%, are mild to moderate in severity. An assessment of the 30 patie nts reporting severe side effects, meaning \"interrupts usual daily activities,\" found no apparent pattern in patient age, medical condition, or type of medical cannabis product used. Results reported in this chapter are generally similar to those reported in published clinical trials of cannabis and cannabinoids, though with a somewhat lower frequency of occurrence reported in the program. Fortunately, up to the present no serious adverse events (life threatening or requiring hospitalization) have been rep orted. Some limitations of the data should be mentioned. For example, when the patient completes a Patient Self -Evaluation and has it reviewed in consultation with pharmacist staff, the completeness and accuracy of reported side effects (on the Patient Sel f-Evaluation) ultimately depend on the attention and good communication of the patient. Perhaps a more significant risk for under -reporting through Patient Self -Evaluation data is the situation when a patient has an intolerable side effect and decides to m ake no more purchases of medical cannabis. If the patient doesn't go to a cannabis patient center for another purchase, the patient doesn't fill out another Patient Self -Evaluation, so the side effect is not documented through this mechanism. From anecdo tal report and survey responses, we know this does occur. However, inquiries made of patients who have discontinued medical cannabis purchasing suggests this does not happen often. Finally, a weakness of the survey data is that many responders did not comp lete the question on most significant negative effect and a substantial proportion who did indicated cost or access issues, rather than physical or mental side effects. Though physical or mental side effects were probably minor or not present if the respon dent indicated cost or access issues as the most significant negative effect, we don't know that for sure. We are unable to characterize most significant negative effect for those who did not submit a response a response. Though the limitations mentioned in the paragraph above no doubt undercount the frequency of physical and mental side effects to some degree, their impact does not seem likely to M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 154 significantly change the main conclusions of the analyses reported in this section: at this point, the safety profile of the medical cannabis products available through the Minnesota program seems quite favorable. Adverse Side Effects Reported on the Patient Self -Evaluation Patients have the opportunity to report adverse side effects they attribute to medical cannabis on the Patient Self -Evaluation (PSE). Patients must complete a PSE prior to each medical cannabis purchasing transaction. Therefore, the administration of the PSE is timed so that patients can reflect on their experience with the medication they purchased previously and report those experiences on the following patient self -evaluation. A pharmacist at one of the eight medical cannabis dispensaries can then revi ew PSE -reported information, which includes an opportunity to discuss side effects with the patient prior to approving that patient for another medical cannabis purchase. When reporting side effects on the PSE, patients are able to choose side effects from a pre -made list of options or write in side effects that do not fit one of the listed options. In addition, patients also indicate the severity with which each side effect is experienced (see Box 7.1). Adverse side effects were examined within the 1st program year cohort (n = 1660). Patients who had made at least their first medical cannabis purchase were identified, and from these patients, all PSEs that were submitted within the four months following their first medical cannabis purchase were included in a dataset . This led to a total of 1502 patients (9 0.5% of the cohort) being represented. For the following analyses, each side effect was counted once for a given patient if it was reported multiple times. If a side effect was reported multiple times, the observation that was categorized at the highest se verity level was included in the analyses for this report. In cases where a patient opted to write in their side effects (rather than choosing from the pre -made list of options), their responses were assessed carefully for adjudication for coding purposes . Therefore - while not affecting a substantial number of side effect responses - it should be noted that one limitation for accurate coding is the patient's ability to adequately articulate their experiences. Of the 1502 patients, 18.1% (n = 272) reported any adverse side effects within the four month period following their first medical cannabis purchase. Of those 272 patients reporting any adverse side effects, the majority reported only one (n = 164, 60.3%), with approximately 90% of them reporting three or fewer different, adve rse side effects (Figure 7.1).

Patients experiencing severe side effects represent a wide range of ages, including children and elderl y patients; 14 patients were ma le and 16 patients were female. Their age, gender, and certifying conditions generally matched the whole first year cohort. Half of patients reporting severe side effects were taking a form of balanced THC:CBD product (n=15); 10 patients were using a high CBD product, 9 patients were using a very high THC product and 4 patients were using a high THC product. Seven of 30 patients (23%) were using a combination of products with varying THC:CBD ratios (the most common combination was very high THC products and 1:1 THC:CBD products); 9 patients used a combination of products with different routes of administration (the most common combination was enteral and inhaled). Refer to Table 7.3 for details on the patients reporting severe side effects, along with the product types that were purchased just prior to experiencing the severe side effect. PSE-Reported Adverse Side Effects: Conclusions Less than a quarter of patients from the cohort (~18%) reported adverse side eff ects within the first 4 months since purchasing their first medical cannabis products. Roughly 90% of those that do report any side effects report 3 or fewer unique side effects during that time period. Results also suggest that relatively few patients exp erience severe, adverse side effects, with less than 10% of all responses (attributed to 30 patients) being categorized as severe.M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E AR 162 Table 7.3.

The Patient Experience survey asks respondents to report the degree, or severity, of any negative effects they believe the patient received from using medical cannabis, on a scale from 1 (no negative effects) to 7 (a great deal of negative effects). The survey then asked the respondent to describe, in their own words, the most significant negative effect. Table 7.4 shows the distribution of negative effects by severity score within three broad categor ies: physical side effects (including dry mouth, fatigue, headache, dizziness, blurred vision); mental side effects (including mental clouding, paranoia, sedation or symptoms related to \"high\"); and issues related to accessing the medications (distance to distribution center, inconvenient operating hours for distribution centers, etc.). Based on anticipated reports on the high cost of medication, patients were asked to report on the affordability of the medication separately. However, 53 (7%) patients inclu ded cost in their estimation of the most significant negative effects related to medical cannabis; these reports are excluded from Table 7.4 but included in Appendix E: Patient -Reported Negative Effects from Surveys . Finally, please see the chapter titled, \"Affordability and Suggestions for Improvement\" for patient perceptions of medication affordability. Of 792 completed patient surveys, 744 responses (94%) included a negative effects score and 441 (56%) included a response regarding most important negative effect, including comments stating \"no negative effect.\" Of 744 negative effect scale responses, 452 (61%) reported a score of 1, or \"no negative effect.\" This includes 13 patients who, though they entered a score of 1, entered a narrative descrip tion of physical or mental side effects. A total of 195 responses (25% of all patient responses) reported physical or mental negative effects. These reports generally mirrored side effects reported in clinical trials of medical cannabis (see \" A Review of Medical Cannabis Studies relating to Chemical Compositions and Dosages for Qualifying Medical Conditions \" on the Office of Medical Cannabis website ). Reports of the most severe negative effects were as follows: scores of 7 (great deal of negative effects) were associated with reports of allergic r eaction (n=1), pain (n=1), severe diarrhea (n=1), change in mood/behavior (n=1) and decreased awareness of surroundings (n=1). Scores of 6 were associated with reported physical side effects of dizziness or related symptoms (n=3), severe diarrhea (n=1), st omach pain (n=1), burning sensation with sublingual product (n=1), sleeping problems (n=1) and worsening seizures (n=2), and mental side effects of crying and irritability (n=1). Scores of 5 which reported physical negative effects included drug interactio ns, increased seizure activity, allergic reaction, lightheadedness, fatigue, headaches, visual impairment, dry mouth, a report that the M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 166 product \"made me sick\" and pain related to vaping (n=1 each). Scores of 5 which reported mental negative effects include d reports of paranoia (n=2), inability to concentrate (n=1), and increased anxiety (n=1). Apart from physical or mental negative effects, some patients reported issues related to program access, including distance to the nearest cannabis patient center ( n=13). Other negative effects (not included in Table 7 .4) were reported including issues related to the program design (n=9), negative attitudes of others toward the patient's use of medical cannabis (n=17) and fear of legal or employment -related consequen ces related to program participation (n=5). Finally, 16 reports of negative effects were related to lack of efficacy of the medicine in treating the patient's condition.

Percentages are calculated based on the total number of patient survey responses received (n=792). HCP-Reported Negative Effects from Medical Cannabis Like the Patient Experience survey, the HCP su rvey asks respondents to report the degree, or severity, of any negative effects they believe the patient received from using medical cannabis, on a scale from 1 (no negative effects) to 7 (a great deal of negative effects). Table 7 .5 shows the distributio n of negative effects by severity score within three broad categories: physical side effects (including dry mouth, fatigue, headache, dizziness, blurred vision); mental side effects (including mental clouding, paranoia, sedation or symptoms related to \"hig h\"); and issues related to accessing the medications (long distance to distribution center, inconvenient operating hours for distribution centers, etc.). Of 251 total HCP survey responses, 200 responses (80%) included a negative effects score and 107 resp onses (43%) included a description of any negative effect(s). Of 200 negative effect scale responses, 128 (64%) reported a score of 1, or \"no negative effect.\" This includes 6 HCP M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 167 reports which entered a narrative description of physical or mental side eff ects. There were 33 HCP reports (13% of all HCP survey responses) of physical or mental negative effects resulting from medical cannabis treatment. As seen in the patient survey results, these generally mirrored side effects described in clinical trials (s ee \"A Review of Medical Cannabis Studies relating to Chemical Compositions and Dosages for Qualifying Medical Conditions \" on the Office of Medical Cannabis website ). Healthcare providers describing negative effects with high scores reported the following: a score of 7 was associated with a report of \"abdominal discomfort\"; dizziness (n=1) and sedation (n=1) were reported with scores of 6; finally, constipation, lethargy and worsened seizure activity (n=1) and a report of \"too strong per patient\" (n=1) were associated with a score of 5. Four HCP responses reported access -related issues as a neg ative effect. Additionally, 25 HCP reports (10% of all HCP survey responses) described cost as a negative effect related to medical cannabis (these reports are not included in Table 7 .5).

Adverse Side Effects Reported on Surveys: Conclusions Based on data from surveys completed by patients and their certifying healthcare practitioners three months after the patient's first medical cannabis purchase, 25% of patient respondents report physical or mental side effects related to medical cannabis u se. A minority of healthcare provider responders (13%) report physical or mental side effects. Both groups describe negative effects related to medical cannabis use including the cost of products and issues related to M I N N E S O T A M E D I C A L C A N N A B I S P R O G R A M : P A T I E N T E X P E R I E N C E S F R O M T H E F I R S T P R O G R A M Y E A R 168 accessing medicine. Most patients and HCPs reporting physical or mental side effects report low degrees of severity (negative effect scale scores of 1 -3). Adverse Event Reporting to Manufacturers There is potential for enrolled patients, their family and caregivers, and health care practition ers to be concerned about an adverse event potentially caused by medical cannabis and to want to register their concern quickly. Both manufacturers have processes in place to receive these messages by telephone and by email. They collect and document infor mation related to the incident and report it to the Office of Medical Cannabis. In nature and severity these reports have been similar to the adverse events reported in Patient Self -Evaluations and surveys. Patients, their registered caregivers, and certif ying health care practitioners have a duty as program participants to report serious adverse events. Called \"serious adverse incidents\" in the program's rules (4770.4002), these are essentially occurrences that lead to hospitalization or are life -threaten ing events. As of the date of this report, no reported adverse events have met the definition of \"serious adverse incident.\" 169 8. Affordability and Suggestions for Improving the Program Patient Perceptions of Affordability Unlike traditional pharmaceuticals whose costs are often covered through insurance reimbursement, medical cannabis must be purchased solely out of pocket. The Patient Experience survey asked patients to rate the cost of the medication on a scale from 1, or very affordable, to 7, or very prohibitive. Responses to this question are displayed in Figure 8.1. Of 792 respondents, 683 (86%) reported that they found medical cannabis to be at least somewhat unaffordable (score of 4 or greater).

Patients were asked to rate usability on a scale from 1, or very difficult to use, to 7, or very easy or intuitive to use. Responses were generally positive (Figure 2), with 51% of patients reporting high scores of usability (6 or 7). Figure 8.2.

The Patient Experience survey asked patients to rate the helpfulness of the call center on a scale from 1, or not very helpful, to 7, or very helpful.

The burden created by GAD has been compared to that of major depression. As recently as March of 2018, the New Jersey Department of Health determined that GAD and anxiety as a broader set of conditions are so debilitating, and evidence of medical marijuana 's effectiveness so persuasive, that they add anxiety to the state 's qualifying conditions list. GAD has also been shown to have a significant impact on society at large. The social routines of patients suffering from GAD and those around them can be severely interrupted . Additionally, work productivity has been shown to decrease in those with GAD creating an economic consequence for society when treatment isn 't adequate. The attached documents seek to explain New Jersey 's reasoning for adding anxiety as a qualifying condition and explain the burden of GAD. Research Article GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER: PREVALENCE, BURDEN, AND COST TO SOCIETY Hans-Ulrich Wittchen, Ph.D.n Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder characterized by persistent worrying, anxiety symptoms, and tension. It is the most frequent anxiety disorder in primary care, being present in 22% of primary care patients who complain of anxiety problems. The high prevalence rate of GAD in primary care (8%) compared to that reported in the general population (12-month prevalence 1.9-5.1%) suggests that GAD patients are high users of primary care resources. GAD affects women more frequently than men and prevalence rates are high in midlife (prevalence in females over age 35: 10%) and older subjects but relatively low in adolescents. The natural course of GAD can be characterized as chronic with few complete remissions, a waxing and waning course of GAD symptoms, and the occurrence of substantial comorbidity particularly with depression. Patients with GAD demonstrate a considerable degree of impairment and disability, even in its pure form, uncomplicated by depression or other mental disorders. The degree of impairment is similar to that of cases with major depression. GAD comorbid with depression usually reveals considerably higher numbers of disability days in the past month than either condition in its pure form. As a result, GAD is associated with a significant economic burden owing to decreased work productivity and increased use of health care services, particularly primary health care. The appropriate use of psychological treatments and antidepressants may improve both anxiety and depression symptoms and may also play a role in preventing comorbid major depression in GAD thus reducing the burden on both the individual and society. Depression and Anxiety 16:162-171, 2002. &2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: generalized anxiety disorder; prevalence; health care utilization; comorbidity INTRODUCTION Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a persistent and often severe mental disorder of the anxiety spectrum, characterized by persistent (6 months or more), excessive worrying, anxiety, tension associated with symptoms of hypervigilance, and other somatic symptoms of anxiety. The symptomology is associated with substantial and enduring subjective suffering, and the feeling of loss of control over the worrying and symptoms as another criterion. Clinical reports suggest that fewer than 20% of sufferers experience complete remission of their symptoms, and typically patients will have had their symptoms for between 5 and 10 years before they are diagnosed and effectively treated [Ballenger et al., 2001; Kessler et al., 2001a; Rogers et al., 1999]. Patients with GAD have been found to be frequent utilizers of primary care resources rather thanmental health specialist settings and have been associated with over-utilization of general health care resources [Maier et al., and 2000; Wittchen et al., 2002]. Further primary care studies conducted in the earlyDEPRESSION AND ANXIETY 16:162-171 (2002) Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Technical University of Dresden, Germany and Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany nCorrespondence to: Professor Dr. Hans-Ulrich Wittchen, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Clinical Psychology and Epidemiol- ogy Unit, Kraepelinstrasse 2, Munich D-80804, Germany. E-mail: wittchen@pipsykl.mpg.de Received for publication 1 October 2001; Accepted 24 February 2002 Published online in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley. com). DOI 10.1002/da.10065 & &2002 WILEY-LISS, INC.1990s have suggested that GAD is rarely recognized and diagnos ed, and if it is diagnosed it is usually not, or only inappropriately, treated [U \u00a8stu\u00a8n and Sartorius, 1995]. This is particularly significant as GAD is associated with a substantial degree of social disability [Wittchen et al., 2000]. Yet, there has been some debate concerning the nosological status of GAD because of past reports of its low diagnostic reliability using standard criteria [Di- Nardo et al., 1993] and the fact that clinical studies have found that GAD is usually seen in comorbid presentations with major depression. Furthermore, there have been reports that pure GAD is both an extremely rare phenomenon with few indications of disorder-specific impairments (for examples, see dis- cussions in Kessler et al., 2001a; Noyes et al., 2001]. However, one needs to take into account that these reservations against GAD, being an independent clinical disorder of critical significance, are based on studies that have mostly used older diagnostic criteria for GAD and/or stem from highly selective clinical samples that might suffer considerable selection bias. Since the current diagnostic definition of GAD is a relatively recent addition to diagnostic classification systems, few studies have up to now reconsidered the nature and true burden of GAD, as defined by the current DSM-IV criteria, on the individual and society. This paper aims to address the question ''what is the prevalence, level of disability and burden to society associated with GAD, as defined by DSM-IV criteria?'' PREVALENCE The concept and diagnostic criteria of GAD have changed significantly since it was first codified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [American Psychiatric Association, 1994] in 1980 and to date there are still small differences in the criteria used in the USA and Europe. In the USA and in research, the DSM-III-R/DSM-IV criteria prevail, whereas in Europe the use of the 10th International Classification of Diseases [ICD-10; World Health Organization (WHO) 1992], which has broader criteria, is preferred at least in routine clinical settings. However, it is remarkable that despite the many changes in diagnostic criteria and the differences between these two diagnostic classification systems, the reported lifetime prevalence rates for GAD are remarkably consistent. This is in contrast to the considerable variance observed with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression and phobias. COMMUNITY STUDIES The US National Comorbidity Survey [NCS: Kessler et al., 1994] and the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey, Mental Health Supplement [GHS; Carter et al., 2001; Jacobi et al., 2002] are the largest community epidemiological studies of GAD to date. and, together, include over69,400 patients. The 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of GAD (DSM-III-R) in the NCS were estimated to be 3.1% and 5.1%, respectively. The lowest lifetime prevalence rate was found in the 15-24 year age group (2.0%), while the highest rate was reported for the 45- 55 year age group (6.9%) [T able 1; Wittchen et al., 1994]. This survey also demonstrated that women were twice as likely to have GAD than their male counter- parts, with total lifetime prevalence rates of 6.6% and 3.6%, respectively [Wittchen et al., 1994]. The prevalence rate increased to 10.3% for women aged Z45 years, but was unchanged for men aged Z45 years (3.6%). These findings are relatively consistent with findings from a previous GAD community survey that used earlier diagnostic criteria and different instruments [see review by Carter et al., 2001]. The most recent epidemiological study using DSM-IV criteria [GHS; Carter et al., 2001] has reported slightly lower 12- month prevalence rates for GAD than the NCS (12- month prevalence 1.5% vs. 3.1%). However, this finding was found to be entirely due to methodology because the inclusion of subjects with lifetime GAD and partially remitted subthreshold GAD accounts for this difference. The highest rates were again found in women and older subjects [Carter et al., 2001]. Although in the past there was some speculation about GAD being a characteriological disorder [Akis- kal, 2001] being best grouped under DSM axis II personality disorders, there has been little supporting evidence to date. Reports concerning the prevalence of GAD as defined by the DSM-III-R and the more stringent DSM-IV criteria in children and adolescents have generally found low rates of GAD in this age group [Mu \u00a8ller, 2001, doctoral dissertation; Wittchen et al., 5-year Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP) study in adolescents and young adults [Wittchen et al., 1998], which to our knowledge is the only DSM- IV-based study of this sort, examined the prevalence of GAD and patterns of age of onset among subjects agedTABLE 1. Twelve-month and lifetime prevalence in the NCS of GAD in males and females by age group [Wittchen et al., 1994] Age (yr) Male (%) Female (%) T otal (%) 12-month prevalence 15-24 1.3 1.5 1.4 25-34 3.2 5.0 4.1 35-44 2.3 4.5 3.4 Z45 0.9 6.3 3.5 T otal 2.0 4.3 3.1 Lifetime prevalence 15-24 1.5 2.5 2.0 25-34 4.7 7.1 6.0 35-44 4.6 7.2 5.9 Z45 3.6 10.3 6.9 T otal 3.6 6.6 5.1Research Article: Economic Burden of GAD 16314-24 years at intake. This study found that GAD is rare in children and adolescents and that unlike most anxiety disorders, onset of GAD before the age of 25 years was uncommon. These findings are in agreement with those of most of the previous adult studies that report age of first onset data as well as surveys in children. PRIMARY CARE There is consistent evidence that patients with GAD are highly prevalent in primary care settings [Ormel et al., 1994; Schonfeld et al., 1997]. The international WHO multi-center study on Psychological Problems in General Health Care (PPGHC) assessed GAD using ICD-10 criteria with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview [CIDI; WHO, 1991] and esti- mated the current prevalence of GAD across centers to be approximately 8% of all primary care attenders [U\u00a8stu\u00a8n and Sartorius, 1995]. This was confirmed in a more recent reanalysis [Maier et al., 2000]. Of those patients visiting primary care physicians for a psycho- logical problem, 25% presented with pure GAD in the absence of any comorbid psychiatric disorder [Maier et al., 2000]. In a subset of almost 2,000 individuals attending five of the European centers in this study [Weiller et al., 1998], 22% of all primary care patients who complained of any anxiety problems were found to have GAD. In this analysis, the overall current prevalence of GAD among primary care attenders was 8.5% with a further 4.1% of individuals having sufficient clinical problems to justify a diagnosis of subthreshold GAD. The most recent primary care study of over 500 primary care centers and over 20,000 primary care attenders (Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depres- sion in Primary Care [GAD-P] study) has confirmed these findings on the basis of DSM-IV criteria for GAD [Hoyer et al., 2001; Wittchen et al., 2001; Wittchen et al., 2002]. The point prevalence of threshold GAD was estimated to be 5.3%, with highest estimates in those primary care attenders aged 35-60 years. The study also confirmed, even more impress- ively than the report by Weiller et al., [1998], that GAD is a) the most frequent anxiety disorder seen in primary care (more than 50% of all anxiety disorders), b) rarely correctly diagnosed (only 28% were correctly diag- nosed as having GAD by their GP), and c) rarely appropriately managed in terms of type and duration of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments [Wittchen et al., 2001]. These findings of increased prevalence of GAD in primary care compared to the general population are in contrast to most other anxiety disorders where the prevalence rate in the general population is much higher than in primary care. This suggests, in line with previous speculations [Schonfeld et al., 1997] that GAD patients are high utilizers of primary care resources (Fig. 1).COMORBIDITY A consistent finding in clinical and epidemiological studies of GAD is the high proportion of comorbidity (T able 2), with common comorbid diagnoses including major depression, panic disorder, social and specific phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, there is no remarkable association with substance use disorders. As many as 66% of patients with current GAD have an additional concurrent psychiatric diagnosis and they almost invariably (90%) have a lifetime history of another psychiatric diagnosis [Wittchen et al., 1994]. The GHS confirmed these findings and reported that comorbidity of DSM- IV GAD includes other anxiety disorders in 55% of cases and depression in 59% of cases [Carter et al., 2001]. Brawman-Mintzer and colleagues [1993] pointed out in this respect that 42% of patients with GAD had experienced at least one major depressive episode during their lifetime. Data from the GHS showed a similar pattern; 40.5% of GAD patients had comorbid current major depression, 59% had comor- bid 12-month major depression, and 60% had comor- bid lifetime major depression [Carter et al., 2001].0246810121416 Specialist Primar y careControls (no GAD/no depression) GAD GAD + depression Mean ratio (95%) CI* Primar y care: GAD vs controls : 1.95 (1.58-2.40) GAD + depression : 2.05 (1.63-2.44) Specialist: GAD vs controls : 1.80 (1.40-2.30) GAD + depression : 1.91 (1.38-2.42) *controlled for age, gender, and somatic illnesses7.2 1.83.44.213.814.6Mean number of visits in past 12 months Figure 1.

Although these high rates of anxiety- mood disorder comorbidity have stimulated some controversy over whether GAD should be regarded as a distinct disorder or should more appropriately be conceptualized as a prodromal, residual stage or as a severity marker of depression, there has been little supporting evidence for the latter. Kessler et al. [2001a] have reviewed the available evidence for this contro- versy and come to the conclusion that GAD and depression are distinct disorders based on the following findings: 1) twin studies do not support the lumping of both conditions, 2) exceedingly high comorbidity rates are confined to selected clinical studies with potential patients' self-selection bias that have used early defini- tion of GAD and not DSM-IV position, 3) conditional rates of comorbidity among GAD cases are not higherthan those observed for other disorders, and 4) there is an abundance of studies revealing that pure and comorbid presentations differ considerably with regard to their clinical and other correlates (T able 3). For example, 50% of all adult GAD cases were found to be temporally primary to mood disorders [Fava et al., 2000; Wittchen et al., 2000]. Comorbidity, especially with depression, significantly lowers the probability of GAD being successfully diagnosed and treated and patients experience more severe symptoms. Comorbid, as opposed to pure, GAD is associated with increased disability and dysfunction, and has a worse prognosis and impairment [Bakish, 1999; Wittchen et al., 2000]. Thus, there is considerable evidence that GAD is a distinct disorder that deserves special research and clinical attention. There is also a need for further studies that provide a better and fuller understanding of the pathogenic and clinical management implications of these patterns of comorbidity. INDIVIDUAL BURDEN OF DISABILITY Another key finding that provides further evidence for GAD being a particularly clinically significant mental disorder in itself was the recent demonstration that GAD is associated with a significant burden of disability for individuals, even if they do not have a comorbid condition. This is most notable in terms of diminished functioning both socially and at work. General population studies have considered the degree of impairment caused by pure GAD. The NCS and Midlife Development in the United States Survey both reported that the level of impairment associated with DSM-III-R GAD is substantial and comparable to that of pure major depression [T able 4; Kessler et al., 2001a, 1994, 1997]. A combined analysis of data from these two studies confirmed their findings and showed that even ''pure'' GAD was associated with marked impairment in role functioning and social life [Kessler et al., 1999]. Moreover, this impairment was equivalent to that caused by major depression (Fig. 2). The highest levels of impairment were seen when GAD was comorbid with major depression (Figure 3).TABLE 3.

In the PPGHC study, patients with GAD (and subthreshold GAD) showed greater severity of symp- toms and had a greater degree of disability than primary care subjects with no current psychiatric symptoms [Weiller et al., 1998]. T wenty-seven percent of all GAD sufferers reported moderate or severe social disability (assessed by the Brief Disability Question- naire) and this proportion rose to 59% when GAD was comorbid with major depression. COST TO SOCIETY While the level of social disability associated with GAD is as severe as that seen with chronic somatic diseases [Kessler et al., 2001a; Maier et al., 2000], GADalso has a major impact on society in terms of decreased work productivity and increased health care utilization. Impact on work productivity. GAD is associated with a significant economic burden owing to particu- larly decreased work productivity [Kessler et al., 1999; Greenberg et al., 1999; Soue tre et al., 1994; Judd et al., 1998]. A recent analysis using data from the GHS study (see above) considered disability in terms of reduced work productivity in individuals with pure GAD and GAD comorbid with major depression [Wittchen et al., 2000]. Approximately 34% of patients with 12-month pure GAD, 21% of those with depression, and 48% of those with comorbid GAD and depression showed a reduction in work productivity of 10% or more and a reduction of at least 50% in activity during the past month was reported by approximately 11% of respon- dents with pure GAD and 8% of those with pure major depression (Fig. 4). Thus, GAD is associated with considerable impairment even when no comorbid depression is present. Of those individuals with comorbid GAD and depression, 23% had experienced reductions of at least 50% in the activities of the previous month. In the PPGHC study, the mean number of workdays lost to disability was 4.6 for pure GAD and rose to 8.0 when GAD was comorbid with major depression [Weiller et al., 1998]. Further evidence has been presented by an Austra- lian study, which reported that the burden of mental disorders was third after the burden of heart disease and cancer and, of these mental disorders, the two most relevant were GAD and depression [Andrews et al., 2000]. This was confirmed by Kessler et al. [2001b; T able 5]. This indicates that the presence of GAD is a significant factor that leads to complete disability, diminished productivity at work and that the burden of GAD on society is at least equivalent to, if not greater than, the burden caused by depression. Health care utilization. The high prevalence of GAD in the primary care setting, compared with the general population, suggests that patients with the disorder are likely to be high users of health care05101520253035 Depression GAD Depression GADWor k impairment Social impairment% Patients National Comorbidity Study Midlife development in the US Survey Figure 2.

According to the most recent primary care study [Wittchen et al., 2002], patients with pure GAD reported a two-fold higher than average number of visits to primary care doctors compared with depressed patients and sig- nificantly more visits to non-mental health specialists in the previous 12 months, even when controlling for the presence of physical illnesses. Similarly, GAD ranks third among anxiety disorders (after PTSD and panic disorder) in the rate of use of primary care physicians' time [Kessler et al., 1999]. Approximately one third of patients with GAD seek medical help for their somatic GAD symptoms [ Judd et al., 1998], most commonly from primary care physicians. Comorbidity with GAD is reported to increase the rate of help-seeking behavior by more than 50% [Bland et al., 1997]. It has been reported that the specialists seen most often by GAD patients are gastroenterologists [23%; Kennedy and Schwab, 1997]. This was significantly greater than for patients with other anxiety disorders (16% panic disorder, 3% obsessive compulsive dis- order; Po.05). Only 10% of patients with GAD had seen a psychiatric specialist. These observations were attributed to the considerable overlap between the anxiety symptoms of GAD and the symptoms asso- ciated with other conditions, for example, irritable bowel syndrome [Kennedy and Schwab, 1997]. Fifty percent of patients with GAD had seen 1-2 medical specialists (other than primary care physicians) in the preceding year, while 10% had visited 3-5 specialists [Kennedy and Schwab, 1997]. These results show that many patients with GAD visit a number of physicians before they are definitively diagnosed and treated. It is noteworthy that, despite the high primary care utilization rates of GAD, sufferers are rarely specifi-cally diagnosed and treated for their disorder either directly by the primary care doctor or after referral to mental health specialists. In the NCS conducted in the early 1990s, only 48% of all pure GAD subjects had received health care intervention at some point in their life, and only 25% had at some point taken medication for their GAD symptoms. The recent GAD-P study (conducted during the year 2000) confirmed this finding and revealed that despite high utilization rates in primary care, less than 10% of GAD patients receive adequate non-pharmacological or pharmacological treatments for their disorder [Wittchen et al., 2001]. Economic burden. The economic cost of anxiety disorders has been examined [DuPont et al., 1996; Greenberg et al., 1999; Rice and Miller, 1998] in elaborate and complex secondary data analyses. These studies indicated that the annual cost of anxiety disorders was $42-47 billion in the USA in 1990. The three largest components of the total cost comprised $23 billion (54%) in non-psychiatric med- ical treatment, treat- ment, and over $4 billion (10%) in indirect workplace costs. Prescription pharmaceutical costs were a minor factor, accounting for less than $1 billion (2%) of the total cost of anxiety disorders [Greenberg et al., 1999]. The $4 billion indirect workplace costs reflect an average annual (1990) cost in the workplace of $256 per affected worker [Greenberg et al., 1999]. A total of 88% of this cost per individual was attributed to lost productivity while at work, as opposed to actual absence from work. Therefore, work productivity may provide a more accurate assessment of the economic cost of GAD than absence from work [Greenberg et al., 1999]. Primary care patients with DSM-III-R anxiety or depressive disorders have been reported to haveTABLE 5.

These cost differences reflected greater utilization of general medical services rather than higher treatment costs. It is to be expected that the high prevalence of GAD comorbid with depression would lead to increased economic costs. An evaluation of the direct and indirect health care costs in GAD patients found that over 60% were experiencing one or more symptoms of comor- bidity that resulted in a high rate of health care utilization that was affected by both the level of comorbidity and symptom severity [Soue tre et al., 1994]. In GAD patients, hospitalizations were signifi- cantly more prevalent in those with comorbidity than in those without (11.8% vs. 5.1%, respectively; Po.001), with internal medicine and emergency admission being the most frequently used services [Soue tre et al., 1994]. Hospitalization costs accounted for 35% of total costs and over 53% of direct health care costs in patients with comorbidities. The econom- ic cost was also increased in GAD patients with comorbidity in terms of increased absenteeism from work (33.6% with comorbidity vs. 26.6% without; Po.05). Absenteeism from work accounted for 34.4% and 33.1% of total costs for patients with and without comorbidity, respectively. REDUCING THE BURDEN The debate that existed concerning the status of GAD as a discrete anxiety disorder has meant that less attention has been focused on identification of adequate treatment for the disorder than for other anxiety disorders. Improving the recognition and treatment of GAD is key to reducing the burden of the disorder on the individual and society. The challenges of GAD as a chronic, and after several years, usually complex disorder with a substantial degree of impairment, disability, and comorbid com- plications are a) its early recognition before substantial complications develop and b) appropriate combined acute and long-term management strategies to reduce the suffering caused by the GAD symptoms and comorbid presentations as well as reducing the associated disability as a major source of relapse. Thus therapeutic interventions should aim at reducing the core symptoms of GAD, the prevalence of comorbidity, and the associated disabilities. In addition to several well-established, effective non- pharmacological, mostly cognitive-behavioral treat- ments, there are various traditional drug treatments, most of which have significant limitations, as well as several new drug therapies of first choice. Benzodiazepines have traditionally been used to treat acute anxiety disorders but they are not ideal for the treatment of chronic GAD. Following long-term therapy, benzodiazepines have the potential to producedependency and withdrawal symptoms [Lydiard et al., 1997]. Initial findings in patients with GAD generally showed that buspirone was as efficacious as the benzodiazepines in treating anxiety disorders [Petracca et al., 1990; Strand et al., 1990] but appeared to lack the side effects and withdrawal symptoms [Laakman et al., 1998]. Although buspirone is effective in most (but not all) studies of GAD [Davidson et al., 1999; Lydiard, 2000], its lack of efficacy against comorbid conditions is the main reason for it not being recommended as a first-line treatment for GAD [Ballenger et al., 2001]. The use of buspirone for the treatment of anxiety disorders is limited to short-term treatment only and therefore is inadequate for the treatment of GAD. In a placebo-controlled study to investigate the use of both buspirone and hydroxyzine in patients with GAD, a significant difference was shown only between hydro- xyzine and placebo with respect to improvement of the primary efficacy measurement (improvement on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale). However, both buspirone and hydroxyzine were shown to be more effective than placebo for the secondary efficacy measurement (improvement in CGI and HAD scale ratings) [Lader and Scotto, 1998]. T reatment with benzodiazepines or buspirone ineffective when depression is present [Bakish, 1999; Lydiard et al., 1987]. There is evidence that the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are at least as effective as benzodiazepines in the treatment of GAD and may be superior in long- term therapy [Kahn et al., 1986; Hoehn-Saric et al., 1988; Rickels et al., 1993]. The tertiary TCAs, which have dual serotonergic-noradrenergic effects (e.g., imipramine and amitriptyline), appear to be consis- tently effective in the treatment of anxiety [Feighner, 1999]. However, side effects, such as anticholinergic events, preclude the use of TCAs in many patients, namely, the elderly or those with cardiovascular disease. Clinical studies have shown that the selective serotonin are as effective in the treatment of GAD as they are for most other anxiety disorders studied so far [Bellew et al., 2001; Davidson et al., Rocca et al., 1997], resulting in a reduction of the symptoms of anxiety and depression. An important advantage of these drugs is that it is useful in the treatment of the depression and anxiety disorders frequently comorbid with GAD, such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or OCD [Ballenger et al., 2001]. Paroxetine, which has proven efficacy across the spectrum of depression and anxiety disorders (panic disorder [Lecrubier et al., 1997], OCD [Zohar and Judge, 2000], and PTSD [Beebe et al., 2000]), has also been shown to be effective in patients with GAD [Bellew et al., 2000; Pollack et al., 2001; Rocca et al., 1997] and has been the first SSRI to beWittchen 168specifically licensed for the treatment of GAD. A large clin ical program involving 1,264 patients in three 8- week studies has shown that paroxetine significantly reduces HAM-A total scores compared with placebo and reduces the core GAD symptoms (worry, anxiety, and tension). Paroxetine treatment results in a significant improvement in quality of life in GAD [Pollack et al., 2001]. The EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-5D VAS) provides a measure of quality of life by assessing general well-being and the mean change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS scores was significantly greater with paroxetine than with placebo [Bellew et al., 2000]. Controlled studies have also demonstrated that the SNRI, venlafaxine extended release (XR) (which is also licensed for GAD) are effective in both the short- and long-term treatment of GAD [Allgulander et al., 2001; Davidson et al., 1999; Gelenberg et 2000; Rickels et al., 2000; Silverstone and Salinas, 2001]. In the first of these studies, the mean adjusted HAM- A anxious mood and tension scores were significantly lower for both doses of venlafaxine XR at week 8 compared with placebo [ Po.05; Davidson et al., 1999]. However, the adjusted mean total HAM-A scores for all the treatment groups compared to placebo were not significantly different. In the study by Rickels et al. [2000], venlafaxine XR 75, 150, and 225 mg/day over 8 weeks were significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of GAD in 377 outpatients without major depressive disorder. The study by Gelenberg et al. [2000] evaluated flexible doses of venlafaxine XR over 6 months. The results showed that the efficacy of venlafaxine XR 75- 225 mg/day could be sustained in 238 patients with GAD over a 28-week maintenance period. Similarly, in the 24-week placebo-controlled study by Allgulander et al. [2001], venlafaxine XR 37.5, 75, and 150 mg/day were significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of GAD in 541 outpatients. The placebo-controlled study by Silverstone and Salinas [2001] compared the efficacy of venlafaxine XR (75-225 mg) over 12 weeks in patients with major depression and patients with comorbid GAD. In the comorbid patients, venlafaxine significantly decreased both HAM-D and HAM-A scores compared with placebo. The rapidly increasing evidence that SSRIs and SNRIs are highly effective treatments for GAD and are also equally effective in the treatment of major depression and the other anxiety disorders (which frequently comorbid with GAD) suggests that these strategies are the drug treatments of first choice for current practice. They also have the potential greatly to reduce the individual and economic burden of GAD. CONCLUSIONS GAD is a recognizable and distinct anxiety disorder that is associated with a significant burden of disability on the individual, the magnitude of which is at leastequivalent to that of major depression [Kessler et al., 1999; Wittchen et al., 2001]. However, a comprehen- sive and sound estimation of the burden of GAD on the individual and society is complicated by the high prevalence of comorbid disorders. Patients with comorbid GAD and depression are particularly likely to demonstrate disability and dysfunction. The pre- sence of GAD in other somatic and mental disorders seems to magnify the disability found for the other condition per se. Further investigations into the associated burden of GAD as well as a change in the current approach to the recognition and treatment of the disorder are necessary. GAD reduces work productivity and increases the utilization of health care services [Greenberg et al., 1999; Soue tre et al., 1994], and comorbidity, particu- larly with depression, further increases levels of impairment and cost [Bakish, 1999; Greenberg et al., 1999; Soue tre et al., 1994; Weiller et al., 1998]. In addition, patients with GAD who present to medical practitioners with somatic symptoms may not be diagnosed as suffering from a psychiatric condition, leading to increased medical utilization until the true condition is revealed [Lydiard, 2000]. Although there is growing emphasis on the identi- fication of new agents for the treatment of GAD, further research on the response of comorbidity to management is crucial. Of the current drug treatment options, the SSRI paroxetine and the SNRI venlafaxine are the most convenient treatment to use in the primary care setting and is specifically licensed for the treatment of GAD (DSM-IV definition). Both agents have proven efficacy across the spectrum of depressive and anxiety disorders that are frequently comorbid with GAD (panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and PTSD; Brawman-Mintzer et al., 1993; Ballenger et al., 2001; Davidson, 2000]. Prompt recognition and effective treatment of GAD are central to reducing the burden of this chronic, prevalent, and disabling condition. Greater availability of effective outpatient treatment for GAD will improve symptoms and functionality, reduce disability and health care utilization, and could substantially reduce the economic and social burden of this common and disabling disorder.

They may include: Persistent worrying or anxiety about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren't Difficulty handling uncertainty Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision Inability to set aside or let go of a worry Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind \"goes blank\" Physical signs and symptoms may include: Fatigue Trouble sleeping Muscle tension or muscle aches Trembling, feeling twitchy Nervousness or being easily startled Sweating Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome Irritability Treatments include: Psychotherapy including cognitive behavioral therapy Medication GAD is a debilitating disease that is difficult to treat, and it is vital for a patient 's quality of life that they 're physician have access to all credible treatments, including medical marijuan a. GAD develops slowly. It often starts during the te en years or young adulthood. People with GAD may: nWorry very much about everyday things nHave trouble controlling their worries or fe elings of nervousness nKnow that they worry much more than the y should nFeel restless and have trouble relaxing nHave a hard time concentrating nBe easily startled nHave trouble falling asleep or staying asleep nFeel easily tired or tired all the time nHave headaches, muscle aches, stomach aches, or unexplained pains nHave a hard time swallowing nTremble or twitch nBe irritable or feel \"on edge\" nSweat a lot, feel light-headed or out of breath nHave to go to the bathroom a lot Ch ildren and teens with GAD often worry excessively about: nTheir performance, such as in school or in spo rts nCatastrophes, such as earthquakes or warWhat are the signs and sym ptoms of GAD?What causes GAD? GAD sometimes runs in families, but no one kn ows for sure why some family members have it while others don't. Researchers have found that several parts of the brain, as well as biological processes, play a key role in fear and anxiety. By learning more about how the brain and body function in people with anxiety disorders, researchers may be able to create better treatments. Researchers are also looking for ways in which stress and environmental factors play a role. How is GAD treated? First, talk to your doctor about your symptoms. Yo ur doctor should do an exam and ask you about your health history to make sure that an unrelated physical problem is not causing your symptoms. Your doctor may refer to you a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. GAD is generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both. Talk with your doctor about the best treatment for you. Psychotherapy A type of psychotherapy called cognitive be havioral therapy (CBT) is especially useful for treating GAD. CBT teaches a person different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations that help him or her feel less anxious and worried. For more information on psychotherapy, visit http://www.nimh.nih.gov/ health/topics/psychotherapies.Medication Doctors may also prescribe medication to help tr eat GAD. Your doctor will work with you to find the best medication and dose for you. Different types of medication can be effective in GAD: nSelective use SSRIs and SNRIs to treat depression, but they are also helpful for the symptoms of GAD. They may take several weeks to start working. These medications may also cause side effects, such as headaches, nausea, or difficulty sleeping. These side effects are usually not severe for most people, especially if the dose starts off low and is increased slowly over time. Talk to y our doctor about any side effects that you have. Buspirone is another serotonergic medication th at can be helpful in GAD. Buspirone needs to be taken continuously for several weeks for it to be fully effective. Benzodiazepines, which are sedative medications, can also be used to manage severe forms of GAD. These medications are powerfully effective in rapidly decreasing anxiety, but they can cause tolerance and dependence if you use them continuously. Therefore, your doctor will only prescribe them for brief periods of time if you need them. Question 5 Letters of support provided by physicians with knowledge of the disease or condition.

For many patients, chronic GAD can be debilitating, and at its worst leave a patient unable to go about their daily life. Treating GAD is complicated by the fact that it is often associated with other conditions and suffer ers regularly go years without seeking treatment. Nonetheless, when patients do seek treatment, they're results vary based on a range of factors with only 50-60% responding clinically to therapy and even less entering remission. Attached are two publications detailing both the difficulties in treating GAD and the success rates of current treatment options: 1. Generalised Anxiety Disorder in Adults: Management in Primary, Secondary and Community Care - \"Most clinical studies suggest that GAD is typically a chronic condition with low rates of remission over the short and medium-term. Evaluation of prognosis is complicated by the frequent comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and depression, which worsen the long-term outcome and accompanying burden of disability (Tyrer & Baldwin, 2006).\" 2. Achieving Remission in Generalized Anxiety Disorder - \"Between 50% and 60% of patien ts respond clinically to therapy, but only one-third to one-half attain remission or realize full recovery during the acute phase of treatment.\" domains. Ormel and associates found that the mean numbers of disability days in the past month were much higher among primary care patients with pure GAD than among patients with none of the psychiatric disorders assessed in their survey. The 272 patients with pure GAD had more self-reported dysfunction in occupational role fulfillment and physical disability scores. Remission/treatment goals Traditionally, the goal of therapy has been to treat patients with GAD until a response is achieved. The response is either a clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms or a specific magnitude of change in a rating scale score from baseline. Given the extensive use of health care resources, the residual subsyndromal symptoms, and the substantial relapse rate of anxious patients, the goal of therapy has evolved to that of achieving remission. Remission is a dichotomous concept in that it is an absence or near absence of symptoms in addition to a return to premorbid functionality. Between 50% and 60% of patients respond clinically to therapy, but only one-third to one-half attain remission or realize full recovery during the acute phase of treatment.13 Some patients may achieve \"durable remission\" within the first 4 to 8 weeks of therapy, which may indicate an eventual sustained remission (lasting 4 to 9 months after acute treatment). Patients who achieve a sustained re mission are less likely to experience relapse. Response to treatment and attainment of remission is comprehensively quantified both globally and specifically. The magnitude of treatment outcome is primarily measured by changes in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) scale, and the total Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). This multi dimensional approach assesses disease-specific anxiety symptoms, quality of life, functioning, and nonspecific symptoms (avoidance). Response generally is defined as at least a 50% reduction in HAM-A score from7-10 7 11 11,12 12 14 12 Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWDbaseline, and a \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" rating on the CGI-I. Remission is defined as a HAM-A score of 7 or less, with global recovery achieved at a CGI-I score of 1 (\"not ill at all\" or \"borderline mentally ill\"), and functional recovery at an SDS score of 5 or less. For this designation of remission to be clinically meaningful, it must incorporate a time component. Remission is not static but rather should be sustainable over a considerable time\u2014 at least 8 consecutive weeks. Treatment options The treatment of GAD involves a sequential process of first resolving the acute, symptomatic anxiety and then maintaining a longer-term constant suppression of chronic anxiety . Historically, benzodiazepines were the mainstay of GAD treatment, although the appropriateness of their use for long-term therapy is now under scrutiny. Benzodiazepines indirectly affect the release and reuptake of monoamines via enhancement of the inhibitory effects of g-aminobutyric acid, thereby modulating fear, stress, and anxiety responses. Benzodiazepines are indicated for the short-term management of the acute phase of anxiety (2 to 4 weeks) as well as any subsequent exacerbations of anxiety during stable treatment. Their rapid onset and tolerability make them conducive to alleviating anxious symptoms when immediate anxiolytic effects are desired. A randomized, double-blind study compared response rates among patients treated with imipramine, trazodone, and diazepam. Patients in the diazepam arm had the most significant improvement in anxiety ratings within the first 2 weeks. Within this group, 66% of patients completing the study reported moderate to marked global improvement. Although more marked improvement was realized in the first 2 weeks of treatment with benzodiazepines, antidepressants consistently afforded the same efficacy as benzodiazepines or even surpassed them after 6 to 12 weeks of treatment, particularly in alleviating psychic symptoms.11,12,15,16 14 17 18 19,20 21 21,22 Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWDAside from the obvious issue of potential dependence with prolonged use, benzodiazepines are not desirable as first-line therapy because of their potential for withdrawal syndromes and rebound effects on abrupt discontinuation. Yet, primary care providers have traditionally used benzodiazepines as first-line treatment of acute anxiety. The anxiolytic buspirone has been used with moderate success but has not consistently demonstrated utility in any of the potentially comorbid conditions that can accompany GAD, with the exception of MDD. A retrospective analysis demonstrated significant improvement in HAM-A and global improvement scores relative to baseline, and another study reported buspirone's failure to differ from placebo on numerous outcome measures. In addition, buspirone was shown to be superior to placebo in improving anxiety symptoms as well as coexisting depressive symptoms in patients with GAD. The significant anxiolytic ef fect resulted in more than a 50% response rate, based on reductions in the HAM-A score. Buspirone exerts its effect by reducing serotonin (5-HT) release as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus and as a full agonist at the presynaptic serotonergic auto- receptors. It has been shown to have comparable but slightly weaker efficacy than diazepam, clorazepate, lorazepam, and alprazolam and a slower onset of action. Its utility is mainly associated with its propensity to relieve the cognitive aspects, but it lacks long-term efficacy, particularly in managing the behavioral and somatic manifestations. In addition, patients who had been previously treated with benzodiazepines, especially recently , tend to have a muted response to buspirone (ie, a reduction in the anxiolytic ef fects). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as imipramine, are typically more effective at attenuating the psychological symptoms of GAD as opposed to the somatic symptoms. Their inhibition of 5- HT and norepinephrine reuptake produces anxiolytic and antidepressant ef fects. According to a study conducted by Rickels and colleagues, significant resolution of anxiety was achieved in6,23,24 20 25,26 22,27,28 29 14,30 6 14 31 21 Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWDpatients who took imipramine between weeks 2 and 8 of therapy, and it afforded effects slightly superior to those of trazodone. Psychic symptoms of tension, apprehension, and worry were most effectively reduced in the imipramine arm: 73% of patients achieved moderate to marked improvement. The SSRIs are generally regarded as first-line medications, according to domestic and international practice guidelines. Paroxetine, specifically, is FDA-approved for the long-term treatment of depression as well as for GAD at dosages of 20 to 50 mg daily . While the 2- to 4- week delay in onset of therapeutic effect may be discouraging, significant reductions in \"anxious mood\" have been documented as early as 1 week into treatment. Remission rates in paroxetine responders at 32 weeks, admittedly a selected population of patients who persevere with treatment, are as high as 73%; relapse rates are only 1 1%. SSRIs have a sustained therapeutic effect and afford additional incremental improvement over a 24- week period. An 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined paroxetine's impact on HAM-A and SDS scores relative to baseline. The groups that received 20 mg and 40 mg of paroxetine demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant change in the HAM-A and psychic anxiety subscale relative to placebo. In the intent-to-treat group, 62% in the 20-mg arm and 68% in the 40-mg arm met the criteria for response by week 8 (P < .001). Response rates were as high as 80% among patients who completed the study. Remission was achieved in 36% of the patients in the 20-mg group and 42% of the patients in the 40-mg group by week 8 (P = .004). An SSRI discontinuation syndrome, characterized by dizziness, insomnia, and flu-like symptoms, occurs in approximately 5% of patients on abrupt discontinuation or significant dose reduction. This typically manifests within 1 to 7 days of discontinuation in patients who have been taking an21 18,32 14,33 22 32 Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWDSSRI for at least 1 month. Of the SSRIs, paroxetine is most often implicated in withdrawal symptoms: about 35% to 50% of patients experience discontinuation symptoms on abrupt cessation. Reinstating the drug resolves symptoms of withdrawal relatively quickly. Tapering the SSRI dosage before discontinuation reduces the likelihood of this syndrome. A promising alternative in first-line treatment in GAD therapy are the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, which have been studied in both short- and long-term ef ficacy trials. Venlafaxine XR at a dosage of 75 to 225 mg daily consistently demonstrated superior efficacy versus placebo in improving anxiety symptoms by measure of a reduction in HAM-A total scores. The added benefit of venlafaxine's efficacy in treating symptoms of anxiety in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression, in addition to pure GAD, has elevated its status in the treatment algorithm. Response rates approach 70%, and remission rates are as high as 43% short-term and as high as 61% long-term. The comorbidity of nonspecific somatic pain complaints is common in patients with GAD, which translates into a compounded negative impact on quality of life. A majority of patients (60%) with GAD and concomitant pain report that they experience a moderate to severe change in their somatic symptoms on days when they feel more anxious or depressed. Previous use of benzodiazepines was shown to reduce the probability of a response to venlafaxine in a study by Pollack and colleagues, although there was no substantial impact on attaining long-term remission. Abrupt discontinuation of venlafaxine also precipitates a discontinuation syndrome with similar or greater frequency than does paroxetine. In addition, more diligent patient monitoring is required secondary to its propensity to precipitate hypertension.34 35 36 37 14,38 39 40 35 32 Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWDDuloxetine is indicated for the treatment of anxiety disorders, MDD, neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia. Its dual impact on anxious symptoms and somatic pain resulted in 53% to 61% of treated patients who achieved a HAM-A score of 7 or less (symptomatic remission) and an about 47% who achieved an SDS score of 5 or less (functional remission). There is a positive correlation between improvement in pain scores and reduction in SDS scores: most patients who achieved remission also reported greater improvements in visual analog pain scales. V enlafaxine or an SSRI have been successfully used as initial monotherapy and long-term therapy; both have been shown to be equally effective. Patients with GAD are considerably more intolerant of normal uncertainty , which results in the formation of negative beliefs about uncertainty. Thus, these patients could benefit from psychosocial therapy. Numerous psychosocial treatment options are available as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy in combination with a pharmacological agent. A psychosocial therapy that specifically addresses these cognitive aspects and trains patients to develop and apply coping skills that address psychological and somatic symptoms may be useful. Overcoming the barriers to remission A multitude of factors are responsible for worsened outcomes and reduced probability of achieving remission in patients with GAD. Stressful life events, anxiety sensitivity , negative affect, gender, subsyndromal symptoms, and comorbidities all have a palpable impact on the course of illness and outcome. Frequently, patients elect to not complete long-term treatment and thus, life stressors may perpetuate subsyndromal symptoms. Although GAD is characterized by alternating periods of quiescence and exacerbation, the presence of comorbid depression, panic, or any Axis I or Axis II disorder, and a higher initial symptom rating, greatly lessens the possibility of remission. Pollack and colleagues found that restlessness predicted a worse treatment outcome, while sleep disturbance was typically associated with a more optimistic outcome.1,41 39 32 42 43,44 45-47 40 Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWDMost patients who present with GAD have been ill for an average of 15 years before seeking help. As evidenced consistently by the literature, patients with GAD may decide to discontinue medication once they experience some improvement of symptoms. Unfortunately , once they respond positively to treatment, many patients will settle for that level of response instead of continuing therapy. This decision typically arises from fear of dependence on medication. Discontinuation of medication may briefly elicit a mild improvement, secondary to the psychological empowerment of self-management, but it will frequently lead to relapse. This drives the need for extensive patient education and clear, focused, patient-physician interactions. Symptomatic remission traditionally precedes functional remission. Patient awareness of this fact should stem the inclination to discontinue therapy prematurely. Most of the first-line, long-term pharmacotherapies for GAD take 2 or more weeks to exert a full pharmacodynamic ef fect. The interval between the initial prescription of medication and a realization of ef fect may discourage adherence at an early stage. The likelihood of adherence can be increased by educating the patient about the expected onset of action and by prescribing a benzodiazepine at the start of long-term therapy. The majority of patients with GAD present to their primary care physician with a somatic complaint that is seemingly unrelated to GAD. This \"masquerading\" is another potential barrier to treatment. The inadvertent misdiagnosis of GAD or failure to identify a comorbid disorder results in poor treatment outcomes. Patients who are adherent and do not respond partially or fully to an appropriate medication may need to be reevaluated by a psychiatrist. Reevaluation may well lead to an alternative diagnosis and treatment regimen. Patients who present with predominantly depressive symptoms may be inaccurately labeled as depressed and treated accordingly. Treatment of depressive symptoms alone will not attenuate the somatic or functional aspects of GAD.15 15 45 48 4 49 Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWDOwing to the cyclical pattern of exacerbation and quiescence, many patients present for care during episodic exacerbations when symptoms are most debilitating. The risk is that the perceived acute anxiety will be treated as such, and the underlying, chronic anxiety will not be appropriately resolved. Inappropriate resolution of the chronic component of GAD will functionally impede remission and the prevention of relapse. Chronic pharmacotherapeutic treatment, as in MDD, is indicated for most patients who have GAD. Whether early symptomatic improvement is a potential predictor of future response is currently being explored. A diminution in anxious symptoms within the first 2 weeks of drug therapy may predict remission. Pollack and colleagues found that significant improvement by week 2 of treatment translated into an increased likelihood of a clinical HAM-A response and remission of functional disability (SDS). Even moderate symptomatic improvement early on yielded functional remission by the end of week 2. Conclusions A constellation of factors influence the likelihood of attaining remission of GAD. The frequent presence of psychiatric or physical comorbidities complicates the clinical picture. Depression is the most prevalent of the psychiatric comorbidities and, as a result, incomplete treatment or misdiagnosis of GAD is often a root cause for treatment failure. Patient nonadherence, high initial symptom ratings, and interpatient variability in clinical presentation of GAD all contribute to the modest remission rates. Perhaps the most consequential factor in determining the propensity for success of GAD treatment is the use of an appropriate drug for an appropriate length of time. The duration of treatment is proportional to the magnitude of the outcome and the potential for realizing symptomatic and functional remission. While not achievable in all patients, remission is the most appropriate therapeutic goal for GAD. Patients with personality problems and a multitude of comorbidities for whom the illness provides38 11 Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API PDFCROWDsecondary gain may have difficulty in achieving remission. Although attaining remission is complicated by numerous treatment- and patient-related barriers, overcoming these challenges is feasible in the majority of patients. The diagnosis of GAD must be distinct from any other intervening psychiatric or somatic disorders. While the level of comorbidity is relatively high, the GAD diagnosis must be reliable and not confounded by other disorders. T reatment outcome goals must be clearly established in advance of therapy and should be based on the individual patient' s needs. Psychotropic drug therapy for appropriate treatment duration is the foundation of successful therapy. A single drug is typically initially prescribed for patients who have GAD. Inadequate responses to monotherapy may warrant the addition of a second pharmacological agent or psychotherapy. Augmentation of drug therapy with benzodiazepines for 3 to 4 weeks and then gradually tapering the benzodiazepine may further reduce the reemergence of anxiety symptoms. Patients who demonstrate incomplete remission or lack of response need to be reevaluated in a timely manner to confirm the GAD diagnosis. In adherent patients for whom an appropriate duration of single drug therapy is unsuccessful, consider augmentation with a benzodiazepine or an anxiolytic with a different mechanism of action. The addition of a psychotherapeutic modality and/or a new pharmacological agent may generate additional benefit. Continuation of pharmacotherapy for 6 to 12 months beyond symptom resolution increases the likelihood of a sustained remission and decreases the likelihood of relapse.

New Eviden ce Cannabidiol in Anxiety and Sleep: A Large Case Series CBD appears to be better tolerated than routine psychiatric medications. Furthermore, CBD displays promise as a tool for reducing anxiety in clini cal populations . Use of cannabidiol in anxiety and anxiety -related disorders CBD has consistently demonstrated acute reduction in anxiety -related symptoms in patients, spe cifically within GAD and SAD. Additionally, the use of CBD for these disor ders has shown increasingly minimal adverse effects compared with existing pharmacotherapy. Cannabis use behaviors and prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in a cohort of Canadian medicinal cannabis users The vast majority of patients perceived symptom improvement with CMP (cannabis for medical purposes ) use and did not believe CMP use was associat ed with impairment o r an inability to control use. Previously Submitted Eviden ce Cannabidiol, a Cannabis sativa constituent, as an anxiolytic drug Studies using animal models of anxiety and involving healthy volunteers clearly suggest an anxiolytic -like effect of CBD. The Endocannabinoid System a nd the Brain Cannabidiol, which does not bind to either CB1 or CB2, possesses anxiolytic and antipsychotic properties (Mechoulam et al. 2002) both in animals and in humans. Anxiogenic -like effects of chronic cannabidiol administration in rats Chronic adm inistration of CBD produced an anxiogenic -like effect in clear opposition to the acute anxiolytic profile previously reported. In addition, CBD decreased the expression of proteins that have been shown to be enhanced by chronic treatment with antidepressan t/anxiolytic drugs. Effects of Cannabidiol (CBD) on Regional Cerebral Blood Flow These results suggest that CBD has anxiolytic properties, and that these effects are mediated by an action on limbic and paralimbic brain areas. Multiple mechanisms involved in the large -spectrum therapeutic potential of cannabidiol in psychiatric disorders In agreement with the results obtained in animal models, clinical studies confirmed that CBD has anxiolytic properties Cannabidiol as a Potential Treatment for Anxiety Di sorders Overall, current evidence indicates CBD has considerable potential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders...

It does not appear to alter conscious - ness or trigger a \"high. \" A recent surge in scientific publications has found preclinical and clinical evidence documenting value for CBD in some neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Evidence points toward a calming effect for CBD in the central nervous system. Interest in CBD as a treatment of a wide range of disorders has exploded, yet few clinical studies of CBD exist in the psychiatric literature. Objective: To determine whether CBD helps improve sleep and/ or anxiety in a clinical population. Design: A large retrospective case series at a psychiatric clinic involving clinical application of CBD for anxiety and sleep com-plaints as an adjunct to usual treatment. The retrospective chart review included monthly documentation of anxiety and sleep quality in 103 adult patients. Main Outcome Measures: Sleep and anxiety scores, using validated instruments, at baseline and after CBD treatment. Results: The final sample consisted of 72 adults presenting with primary concerns of anxiety (n = 47) or poor sleep (n = 25). Anxiety scores decreased within the first month in 57 patients (79.2%) and remained decreased during the study duration. Sleep scores improved within the first month in 48 patients (66.7%) but fluctuated over time. In this chart review, CBD was well tolerated in all but 3 patients. Conclusion: Cannabidiol may hold benefit for anxiety-related disorders. Controlled clinical studies are needed. INTRODUCTION The Cannabis plant has been cultivated and used for its me - dicinal and industrial benefits dating back to ancient times. Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica are the 2 main species.1 The Cannabis plant contains more than 80 different chemicals known as cannabinoids. The most abundant cannabinoid, tet - rahydrocannabinol (THC), is well known for its psychoactive properties, whereas cannabidiol (CBD) is the second-most abundant and is nonpsychoactive. Different strains of the plant are grown containing varying amounts of THC and CBD. Hemp plants are grown for their fibers and high levels of CBD that can be extracted to make oil, but marijuana plants grown for recreational use have higher concentrations of THC compared with CBD. 2 Industrial hemp must contain less than 0.3% THC to be considered legal, and it is from this plant that CBD oil is extracted. 3 Many different cultures have used the Cannabis plant to treat a plethora of ailments. Practitioners in ancient China targeted malaria, menstrual symptoms, gout, and constipation. During medieval times, cannabis was used for pain, epilepsy, nausea, and vomiting, and in Western medicine it was commonly used as an analgesic. 4,5 In the US, physicians prescribed Cannabis sativa for a multitude of illnesses until restrictions were put in place in the 1930s and then finally stopped using it in 1970 when the federal government listed marijuana as a Schedule I substance, claiming it an illegal substance with no medical value. California was the first state to go against the federal ban and legalize medical marijuana in 1996. 6 As of June 2018, 9 states and Washington, DC, have legalized recreational marijuana, and 30 states and Washington, DC, allow for use of medical marijuana. 7 The purpose of the present study is to describe the effects of CBD on anxiety and sleep among patients in a clinic presenting with anxiety or sleep as a primary concern. CBD has demonstrated preliminary efficacy for a range of physical and mental health care problems. In the decade before 2012, there were only 9 published studies on the use of canna-binoids for medicinal treatment of pain; since then, 30 articles have been published on this topic, according to a PubMed search conducted in December 2017. Most notable was a study con - ducted at the University of California, San Diego's Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research that showed cannabis cigarettes reduced pain by 34% to 40% compared with placebo (17% to 20% decrease in pain). 8 In particular, CBD appears to hold benefits for a wide range of neurologic disorders, including decreasing major seizures. A recent large, well-controlled study of pediatric epilepsy documented a beneficial effect of CBD in reducing seizure frequency by more than 50%. 9 In addition to endorphin release, the \"runner's high\" experience after exercise has been shown to be induced in part by anandamide acting on CB1 receptors, eliciting anxiolytic effects on the body. 10 The ac- tivity of CBD at 5-HT1A receptors may drive its neuroprotective, antidepressive, and anxiolytic benefits, although the mechanism of action by which CBD decreases anxiety is still unclear. 11 CBD was shown to be helpful for decreasing anxiety through a simulated public speaking test at doses of 300 mg to 600 mg in single-dose studies. 12-14 Other studies suggest lower doses of 10 mg/kg having a more anxiolytic effect than higher doses of 100 mg/kg in rats. 15 A crossover study comparing CBD with nitrazepam found that high-dose CBD at 160 mg increased the duration of sleep. 16 Another crossover study showed that Author Affiliations 1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Colorado, Denver 2 Department of Naturopathic Medicine, Wholeness Center, Fort Collins, CO 3 North Range Behavioral Health, Greeley, CO 4 School of Social Work, Colorado State University College of Health and Human Sciences, Fort Collins Corresponding Author Scott Shannon, MD (scottshannon@cowisp.net) Keywords: anxiety, cannabidiol, CBD, sleep2 The Permanente Journal https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-041 ORIGINAL RESEARCH & CONTRIBUTIONSCannabidiol in Anxiety and Sleep: A Large Case Series plasma cortisol levels decreased more significantly when given oral CBD, 300 to 600 mg, but these patients experienced a seda-tive effect. 17 The higher doses of CBD that studies suggest are therapeutic for anxiety, insomnia, and epilepsy may also increase mental sedation. 16 Administration of CBD via different routes and long-term use of 10 mg/d to 400 mg/d did not create a toxic effect on patients. Doses up to 1500 mg/d have been well tolerated in the literature. 18 Most of the research done has been in animal models and has shown potential benefit, but clinical data from randomized controlled experiments remain limited. Finally, the most notable benefit of cannabis as a form of treatment is safety. There have been no reports of lethal overdose with either of the cannabinoids and, outside of concerns over abuse, major complications are very limited. 19 Current research indicates that cannabis has a low overall risk with short-term use, but more research is needed to clarify possible long-term risks and harms. Given the promising biochemical, physiologic, and preclinical data on CBD, a remarkable lack of randomized clinical trials and other formal clinical studies exist in the psychiatric arena. The present study describes a series of patients using CBD for treatment of anxiety or sleep disturbances in a clinical practice setting. Given the paucity of data in this area, clinical observa - tions can be quite useful to advance the knowledge base and to offer questions for further investigation. This study aimed to determine whether CBD is helpful for improving sleep and/or anxiety in a clinical population. Given the novel nature of this treatment, our study also focused on tolerability and safety concerns. As a part of the evolving legal status of cannabis, our investigation also looked at patient acceptance. METHODS Design and Procedures A retrospective chart review was conducted of adult psychiat - ric patients treated with CBD for anxiety or sleep as an adjunct to treatment as usual at a large psychiatric outpatient clinic. Any current psychiatric patient with a diagnosis by a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) of a sleep or anxiety disorder was con - sidered. Diagnosis was made by clinical evaluation followed by baseline psychologic measures. These measures were repeated monthly. Comorbid psychiatric illnesses were not a basis for exclusion. Accordingly, other psychiatric medications were administered as per routine patient care. Selection for the case series was contingent on informed consent to be treated with CBD for 1 of these 2 disorders and at least 1 month of active treatment with CBD. Patients treated with CBD were provided with psychiatric care and medications as usual. Most patients continued to receive their psychiatric medications. The patient population mirrored the clinic population at large with the exception that it was younger. Nearly all patients were given CBD 25 mg/d in capsule form. If anxiety complaints predominated, the dosing was every morn - ing, after breakfast. If sleep complaints predominated, the dosing was every evening, after dinner. A handful of patients were given CBD 50 mg/d or 75 mg/d. One patient with a trauma history and schizoaffective disorder received a CBD dosage that was gradually increased to 175 mg/d. Often CBD was employed as a method to avoid or to re - duce psychiatric medications. The CBD selection and dosing reflected the individual practitioner's clinical preference. In - formed consent was obtained for each patient who was treated and considered for this study. Monthly visits included clinical evaluation and documentation of patients' anxiety and sleep sta - tus using validated measures. CBD was added to care, dropped from care, or refused as per individual patient and practitioner preference. The Western Institutional Review Board, Puyallup, WA, approved this retrospective chart review. Setting and Sample Wholeness Center is a large mental health clinic in Fort Col - lins, CO, that focuses on integrative medicine and psychiatry. Practitioners from a range of disciplines (psychiatry, naturopa-thy, acupuncture, neurofeedback, yoga, etc) work together in a collaborative and cross-disciplinary environment. CBD had been widely incorporated into clinical care at Wholeness Center a few years before this study, on the basis of existing research and patient experience. The sampling frame consisted of 103 adult patients who were consecutively treated with CBD at our psychiatric outpatient clinic. Eighty-two (79.6%) of the 103 adult patients had a documented anxiety or sleep disorder diagnosis. Patients with sole or primary diagnoses of schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and agitated depression were excluded. Ten patients were further excluded because they had only 1 documented visit, with no follow-up assessment. The final sample consisted of 72 adult patients presenting with primary concerns of anxiety (65.3%; n = 47) or poor sleep (34.7%; n = 25) and who had at least 1 follow-up visit after CBD was prescribed. Main Outcome Measures Sleep and anxiety were the targets of this descriptive re - port. Sleep concerns were tracked at monthly visits using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Anxiety levels were monitored at monthly visits using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Both scales are nonproprietary. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is a widely used and validated anxiety measure with 14 individual questions. It was first used in 1959 and covers a wide range of anxiety-related concerns. The score ranges from 0 to 56. A score under 17 indicates mild anxiety, and a score above 25 indicates severe anxiety. The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index is a self-report measure that assesses the quality of sleep during a 1-month period. It consists of 19 items that have been found to be reliable and valid in the assessment of a range of sleep-related problems. Each item is rated 0 to 3 and yields a total score from 0 to 21. A higher number indicates more sleep-related concerns. A score of 5 or greater indicates a \"poor sleeper.\" Side effects and tolerability of CBD treatment were assessed through spontaneous patient self-reports and were documented in case records. Any other spontaneous comments or complaints of patients were also documented in case records and included in this analysis.3 The Permanente Journal https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/18-041 ORIGINAL RESEARCH & CONTRIBUTIONSCannabidiol in Anxiety and Sleep: A Large Case Series Data Analysis Deidentified patient data were evaluated using descriptive statistics and plotted graphically for visual analysis and inter - pretation of trends. RESULTS The average age for patients with anxiety was 34 years (range = 18-70 years) and age 36.5 years for patients with sleep disorders (range = 18-72 years). Most patients with an anxiety di - agnosis were men (59.6%, 28/47), whereas more sleep-disordered patients were women (64.0%, 16/25). All 72 patients completed sleep and anxiety assessments at the onset of CBD treatment and at the first monthly follow-up. By the second monthly follow-up, 41 patients (56.9%) remained on CBD treatment and completed assessments; 27 patients (37.5%) remained on CBD treatment at the third monthly assessment. Table 1 provides means and standard deviations for sleep and anxiety scores at baseline and during the follow-up period for adults taking CBD. Figure 1 graphically displays the trend in anxiety and sleep scores over the study period. On average, anxiety and sleep improved for most patients, and these improvements were sustained over time. At the first monthly assessment after the start of CBD treatment, 79.2% (57/72) and 66.7% (48/72) of all patients experienced an improvement in anxiety and sleep, respectively; 15.3% (11/72) and 25.0% (18/72) experienced worsening symptoms in anxiety and sleep, respectively. Two months after the start of CBD treatment, 78.1% (32/41) and 56.1% (23/41) of patients reported improvement in anxiety and sleep, respectively, compared with the prior monthly visit; again, 19.5% (8/41) and 26.8% (11/41), respectively, reported worsening problems as compared with the prior month. These results demonstrated a more sustained response to anxi - ety than for sleep over time. Patient records displayed a larger decrease in anxiety scores than in sleep scores. The sleep scores demonstrated mild improvement. The anxiety scores decreased within the first month and then remained decreased during the study duration.CBD was well tolerated, with few patients reporting side ef - fects. Two patients discontinued treatment within the first week because of fatigue. Three patients noted mild sedation initially that appeared to abate in the first few weeks. One patient with a devel-opmental disorder (aged 21 years) had to be taken off the CBD regimen because of increased sexually inappropriate behavior. The CBD was held, and the behavior disappeared. The behavior reappeared on redosing 2 weeks later, and the CBD regimen was formally discontinued. The treating psychiatrist thought this was related to disinhibition because the patient's anxiety responded dramatically. One patient noted dry eyes. Reasons for patients not following-up at later assessment points are largely unknown but are probably because of standard attrition experienced in usual clinical practice. There was no evidence to suggest patients discontinued care because of tolerability concerns. The attrition rates were similar in nature and size to those found in routinely scheduled visits in this clinic. The treatment with CBD was in general well accepted, as judged by the clinicians' and patients' responses. Four patients declined CBD treatment because of religious or ethical con-cerns about the relation to cannabis. Nearly all patients easily provided informed consent once the nature of the treatment was explained. Most patients appreciated the opportunity to try something natural and avoid further or initial psychiatric medication use. DISCUSSION In an outpatient psychiatric population, sleep scores displayed no sustained improvements during the 3-month study. Anxiety scores decreased fairly rapidly, and this decrease was sustained during the study period. These results are consistent with the existing preclinical and clinical data on CBD. CBD was well accepted and well tolerated in our patients. Side effects were minimal (mainly fatigue) and may be related to dosing. The doses used in this study (25 mg/d to 175 mg/d) were much lower than those reported in some of the clinical literature (300 mg/d to 600 mg/d) 12-14,17 for 2 reasons. The first is that in our experience lower doses appear to elicit an adequate clinical Table 1.

Second, the current retail cost of CBD would make the use of 600 mg/d cost prohibitive. Study Limitations These results must be interpreted cautiously because this was a naturalistic study, all patients were receiving open-label treatment, and there was no comparison group. Concurrent psy - chiatric medications were employed as in routine clinical care. This is both a limitation and strength, as very few publications exist in this population. Other researchers have noted that the large societal notoriety about cannabis and medical marijuana probably contributes to a larger-than-normal placebo effect. 20 Any study that explores efficacy in this therapy probably will struggle with a potentially inflated placebo effect that will make these determinations more difficult. Likewise, the clinical population in this case series is skewed younger than typical for our clinic, and future studies could explore the possible selec - tion bias inherent in this treatment option. Most patients were also taking psychiatric medications and receiving other mental health services, such as counseling, which limits the ability to make any causal links to CBD treatment. Clinical attrition is evident in the dataset. The reason for this might be related to CBD ingestion or not, so the overall component remains un-clear. Furthermore, patients at our clinic often express a desire to reduce or to avoid use of psychiatric medications, which may contribute to an enhanced placebo effect or additional bias. The length of clinical monitoring may help to decrease this concern. However, the clinical data in this analysis show a trend toward clinically significant relief of anxiety upon the start of CBD treatment. Legality of Cannabidiol The legality of CBD is not clear. Like the issues surrounding the legality of cannabis in general, CBD presents the clinician with a confusing state vs federal legal quandary, and this keeps the issue in question. CBD is legal in the 33 states that have legalized medical or recreational use of marijuana and in 17 other states that have legalized some form of CBD, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). 21 But like marijuana, it is still not legal at the federal level. The federal government has announced that it is not focused on this compound in terms of enforcement or interdiction. 22 However, CBD is interpreted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Food and Drug Administration, and Congress to be a Schedule I substance, and therefore it is illegal in all 50 states. 23 Pragmatically, CBD is widely avail - able on the Internet, with sales expected to reach $1 billion by 2020. Pending federal legislation to redefine the legal status of cannabis would clarify this complex issue. Canada's move to legalize cannabis in October 2018 further highlights the need for a speedy resolution to this question. 24 CONCLUSION Formal studies on efficacy and dose finding are much needed. Some urgency exists, given the explosion of lay interest in this topic and the rush to market these compounds. Current understanding of the physiology and neurologic pathways points to a benefit with anxiety-related issues. The results of our clinical report support the existing scientific evidence. In our study, we saw no evidence of a safety issue that would limit future studies. In this evaluation, CBD appears to be better tolerated than routine psychiatric medications. Furthermore, CBD displays promise as a tool for reducing anxiety in clini - cal populations, but given the open-label and nonrandomized nature of this large case series, all results must be interpreted very cautiously. Randomized and controlled trials are needed to provide definitive clinical guidance. v Disclosure Statement Dr Shannon has published several professional books on integrative mental health.

Deas, Zachary Curren, Jonathan Ennis article info 2019Accepted 8 November 2019abstract Objective: Cannabidiol (CBD) has a proposed novel role in the management of anxiety owing to its actions on the endocannabinoid system. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the current evidence on the safety and ef cacy of CBD in anxiety and anxiety-related disorders. Data sources: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from database inception through June 2019. A bibliographic searchof relevant articles was also conducted.Study selection: Articles published from case reports, case series, or randomized controlled trials on human subjects were included in the review if they examined the safety and ef cacy of CBD therapy in anxiety and anxiety-related disorders.Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted the following data from the articles: year of publication; study design; patient characteristics (sex; type of anxiety disorder; use of concomitant anxiolytic therapy); dosing strategy and route CBD administration; and safety and ef cacy outcomes. Results: Eight articles were included in the review: 6 small, randomized controlled trials; 1 case series; and 1 case report. These studies examined the role of CBD in the anxiety responseof healthy volunteers; in generalized anxiety disorder; in social anxiety disorder; and in theanxiety component of posttraumatic stress syndrome. No articles that evaluated CBD in panicdisorder, speci c phobia, separation anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder were iden- tied. In the studies, CBD was administered orally as a capsule or as a sublingual spray and as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. Doses varied widely, with studies employing xed CBD doses ranging from 6 mg to 400 mg per dose. Various anxiety assessment scales were used in the studies to assess ef cacy, with CBD demonstrating improved clinical outcomes among the instruments. In general, CBD was well-tolerated and associated with minimal adverse effects, with the most commonly noted adverse effects being fatigue and sedation. Conclusion: CBD has a promising role as alternative therapy in the management of anxiety disorders. However, more studies with standardized approaches to dosing and clinical outcome measurements are needed to determine the appropriate dosing strategy for CBD andits place in therapy. \u00a92019 American Pharmacists Association \u00ae.

Background Anxiety is an adaptive, emotional response that naturally occurs as a result of a perceived threat.1Anxiety becomes maladaptive when it occurs excessively or inappropriately in the absence of relevant threatening stimuli.1The exact path- ophysiology of anxiety-related disorders is unknown.However, results from neuroimaging and biochemical studiessuggest that the variation between adaptive and maladaptive anxiety responses is modulated by regions of the limbic sys- temdprimarily the amygdala key (NE), g-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and serotonin (5-HT).2 Within Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor- ders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5 ), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), speci c phobia (SP), and separation anxiety are classi ed as anxiety disorders.

As a group, the anxiety disorders and anxiety-related disorders of PTSD and OCD are the most common psychiatric conditions in the United States.3Taken together, these disorders have an estimated lifetime preva-lence of approximately 29% for U.S. adults. 3,4As such, they pose a substantial disease burden to patients and the healthcare system because of their association with decreased well- being, physical impairment, loss of productivity, and increased health care utilization costs. 3,4 At present, the primary pharmacologic treatment for anx- iety and anxiety-related disorders involves the use of medi- cations that modulate the activity of DA, NE, GABA, and 5-HT neurotransmitters. Benzodiazepines are prescribed commonly because of their modulation GABA. Likewise, antidepres- sants and buspirone are frequently used for their effectson DA, NE, and 5-HT. Less commonly prescribed agents foranxiety and anxiety-related disorders include second genera- tion antipsychotics, certain antihista- mines, These pharmacotherapies have limitations in ef cacy and are associated with a number of adverse effects (e.g., sexual dysfunction and potential fordependence and tolerance), which suggests the need for novel therapeutic modalities for management of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders. 5-7 The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a promising thera- peutic target for anxiolytic-drug development owing to its pur- ported role in modulating synaptic plasticity and neuronal activity involved in the anxiety response.4,5,8-12Primary activity of signaling within the ECS is thought to be because of the actionon 2 known cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. 4,5,8-12Canna- bidiol (CBD), a chemical compound known as a phytocannabi-noid, is derived from the plant Cannabis sativa and may have a role in the management of anxiety given its pharmacologic ac- tivity within the ECS. 4,5,8-12Among the more than 400 chemicals produced by C sativa , delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD are the major compounds.4,5,8-12THC is the most abundant psychoactive chemical and is primarily responsible for the well-known hallucinogenic effects of C sativa . In contrast, CBD is not psychoactive. 4,5,8-12 In the literature, CBD has several proposed therapeutic ef- fects accomplished through multiple Despitelow af nity for CB1 and CB2 receptors, CBD has proposed in- direct activity on the ECS through its action of inhibiting theinactivation of anandamide da neurotransmitter within the ECSdwhich leads to activity on the CB1 receptor. 4,5,8-12This mechanism, in conjunction with activity on 5-HT 1Areceptors, is believed to be a key factor in the reported therapeutic effectsof CBD in anxiety. 4,5,8-12Available literature suggests a favor- able adverse-effect pro le of CBD and minimal drug interac- tion potential when compared with other therapeutic agents; however, it should be noted that there is a dearth of studies examining these parameters.13 CBD can be administered through various routes of administration and is currently available and marketed in numerous formulations, such as tinctures administered under the tongue, concentrated oil administered orally or topically, topical compounds such as ointments and creams, vaporized solutions, and infused beverages and food items. In the United States, there is only 1 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved CBD product, Epidiolex, which is approved for treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syn- drome and Dravet syndrome.14All other cannabis-derived under the purview of the FDA regulationunder the 2018 Farm Bill, and determination of the scope of this regulation is evolving. 15With the dramatic increase in use of CBD products, it is prudent to assess the validity of thera- peutic claims as well as the safety pro le.15This information will be bene cial to clinicians when examining the risks and bene ts of using CBD for pharmacologic activity in anxiety. Objective The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the current evidence on the safety and ef cacy of CBD in the management of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders.Key Points Background: /C15As a group, anxiety disorders and anxiety-related disorders are the most common psychiatric condi- tions in the United States.

Findings: /C15In the studies reviewed, CBD consistently demon- strated improved clinical outcomes in with adverse-effect prole. /C15However, optimal dose, route of administration,and dosing strategy (acute vs. chronic use) of CBD in the management of anxiety disorders remain undetermined. /C15Pharmacists have an essential role in advising pa-tients and prescribers on the use of alternative ther- apies. Given the heightened popularity of CBD, it is crucial that pharmacists are knowledgeable about its benets and are able to provide appropriate recom- mendations on the place in therapy of CBD in the treatment of common disorders, such as anxiety.J.W. Skelley et al. / Journal of the American Pharmacists Association xxx (2019) 1 e9SCIENCE AND PRACTICE 2Methods Data sources This study was a systematic review conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance statement.16A free text search of PubMed (January 1996-June 2019) was conducted.The term \"cannabidiol \"was combined with either \"or \"obsessive compulsive disorder \"with the Boolean operator AND. This free text search was duplicated on Google Scholar and International Pharma-ceutical Abstracts. In addition, references of relevant articles were also reviewed. Study selection Articles were included in the review if they examined CBD treatment in diagnosed anxiety or anxiety-related disorders or if they evaluated the anxiety response in healthy volunteers. Animal studies, articles evaluating the psychosis components of PTSD and OCD, and studies evaluating the role of CBD in managing THC-related anxiety were excluded from review. In addition, editorials, commentaries, and letters to the editorwere excluded. Two reviewers independently executed the search and screened articles for inclusion. Data extraction Two reviewers independently extracted the following data from the articles: year of publication; study design; patient characteristics (sex; of dosing and ef cacy outcomes. Ef cacy outcomes included scores on assessment scales for anxiety,such as the Screen for Anxiety-Related Disorders (SCARED), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI),Bodily Symptoms Scale (BSS), and Negative Self-Statements subscale (SSPS-N). Results Study characteristics A total of 233 potentially relevant articles resulted from the search.

Anxiety response in healthy volunteers: Effects of CBD on regional cerebral blood flow Crippa et al. 17conducted a double-blind, crossover study in 10 healthy male patients to evaluate the effect of CBD on neural activity of pathways that normally mediate anxiety, measured through neuroimaging. None of the patients nor their rst-degree relatives had a history of psychiatric illness. The participants were separated into 2 groups of 5. Regionalcerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured at rest via single- photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and eachparticipant was evaluated on 2 occasions separated by 1 week.At the rst session, 1 group received 400 mg of CBD while the other group received placebo, both administered as a gelatincapsule in double-blinded fashion. After 90 minutes, SPECT images were taken. In the second session, the procedure was repeated in a crossover design with those who received pla- cebo being administered CBD and vice versa. VAMS was used to assess subjective feelings of anxiety along with physical sedation, mental sedation, and other attitudes and percep- tions. VAMS scores were assessed at 30 minutes before CBD or placebo ingestion, at the time of ingestion, and at 60 and 75 minutes following ingestion. A signi cant reduction in sub- jective anxiety, measured through VAMS, was noted followingCBD administration at all measurements ( P<0.001).

The study results support ndings of another study, which found the role of CBD in GAD to occur owing to effectson the limbic and paralimbic regions of the brain. 18Crippa et al.17noted sedation as an observed adverse effect of CBD in the study but did not expound on the magnitude or frequency of this reported effect. GAD: CBD in anxiety and sleep Shannon et al.19evaluated the use of open-label CBD therapy on anxiety and sleep levels in a case series of 72 adults seen at a psychiatric outpatient clinic over a 3-month timeframe. Patients were included in the study if they had either a diagnosis of anxiety or a sleep disorder and had at least 1 follow-up visit in the clinic after CBD was prescribed. Patients were excluded if they had a sole or primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, PTSD, or agitated depression. Use of other psychoactive medications and adjunctive counseling services did not preclude participation in this study. Patients 'anxiety was assessed through the use of validated HAM-A. On HAM-A, anxiety scores range from 0 to 56,with a score below 17 being indicative of mild anxietyand a score above 25 indicating severe anxiety. Safety was assessed through spontaneous self-report in this study. Patients received CBD in xed doses, ranging from 25 mg/d to 175 mg/d, with the majority of patients receiving the 25-mg daily dose. All patientscompleted the 1-month follow-up assessment of HAM-A, whereas 56.9% and 37.5% followed up at the 2- and 3-month timeframes for HAM-A, respectively. At the 1-month assess- ment, the majority of patients (79.2%) experienced an improvement in anxiety based on HAM-A scores. Of those who followed up at the 2-month assessment, 78.1% demonstrated an improvement in anxiety compared with the prior 1-month visit. There was no appreciable difference in mean HAM-A scores between the 2-month and 3-month follow-up assessments (mean HAM-A scores of 16.35 and 16.36, respectively). A few adverse effects were reported in this study: dry eyes, mild sedation, fatigue, and an increase in sexually inappropriate be- haviors. The patients who experienced mild sedation reportedresolution within the rst weeks of treatment. Furthermore, a small percentage of patients who experienced fatigue or an in-crease in sexually inappropriate behavior discontinued therapy.The authors concluded that anxiety scores decreased over the course of the study, and the clinical effect on anxiety was maintained throughout the study duration. CBD was well- tolerated and associated with very few instances of treatment discontinuation. Anxiety response in PTSD: Effectiveness of CBD oil for pediatric anxiety and insomnia as PTSD A case report by Shannon et al. 20evaluated the effective- ness of CBD oil in anxiety and sleep disorder secondary to PTSD in a 10-year-old girl. The girl had previously been treated with ineffective pharmacotherapy and had experienced adverse effects from the medication. CBD, administered initially as a capsule and subsequently as a sublingual spray for as-needed dosing, was used for the patient 's anxiety and insomnia. The patient was also receiving eicosapentaenoicacidsh oil and diphenhydramine with CBD therapy. The pa- tient was originally initiated on a CBD 25-mg capsule doseddaily, which she took for a duration of 4 months as mono-therapy. After 4 months, the patient was prescribed adjunct CBD, administered as an as-needed sublingual spray and dosed at 6-12 mg per spray for breakthrough anxiety symptoms. The patient 's anxiety was evaluated using SCARED, with a score above 25 indicating a childhood anxiety disorder. A SCAREDscore was evaluated before initiation of CBD and then monthly for an additional 5 months, for a total of 6 measurements. From baseline to sixth evaluation, the patient 's SCARED score decreased from 34 to 18, a 47.06% reduction. No adverse effectsof CBD were reported in this case report. The authors concluded that CBD oil may be an effective option to consider when attempting to reduce anxiety secondary to PTSD.

Fifty-nine healthy men and women within the age range of 18-35 years were selected for the study. These patients had no diagnosed anxiety disorder, and no disorders involving alcohol or other substance abuse. However, the study was set up to test anxiety levels in public speaking scenarios as a manifestation of SAD. The volunteers were randomly assigned to 5 groups of 12 participants. Each volunteer received either 1 of 3 doses of CBD capsules (100 mg, 300 mg, or 900 mg), clonazepam 1-mg tablet, or placebo in a double-blinded randomized design. VAMS was used in this study to evaluate anxiety levels as well as the sedative effects of CBD. To assess physiological measurements, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, and heart rate were recorded. In the procedure, 1 participant was instructed to speak in front of their group. The other participants who were not speaking at the time were instructed to remain silent with a neutral expression. Each member in the group would take their turn tospeak. Each participant 's VAMS anxiety and sedation score, BP, and heart rate were recorded at baseline, before the speech,during the middle of the speech, and after the speech. Data were compared at the varying time phases. VAMS scores of subjective anxiety were noted to be signi cantly decreased when the CBD 300-mg group was compared with the placeboand CBD 100-mg groups during the postspeech phase (P < 0.05). Similarly, a signi cantly greater decrease in VAMS was noted in the comparison of the CBD 300-mg group with the CBD 900-mg group in the speech phase ( P<0.05). Higher sedative effects were noted with clonazepam in comparisonwith the CBD and placebo groups among the phases ( P<0.05). The authors concluded that the CBD 300-mg dose had agreater therapeutic effect on anxiety when compared with the 100-mg and 900-mg doses. These results con rmed prior study ndings and suggested that CBD induces acute anxio- lytic effects with an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve in humans dan effect that, at this time, is not fully understood and should not be considered as an absolute pharmacody-namics principle. 21,22 Effects of ipsapirone and CBD on human experimental anxiety In a double-blinded study, Zuardi et al.23used 40 healthy subjects separated into 4 groups of 10 who received either oralCBD 300 mg, diazepam 10 mg, ipsapirone 5 mg, or placebo. The volunteers were subjected to a simulated public speaking test (SPST) to compare the anxiolytic properties of the assigned drug. The effects of these drugs were measured using VAMS, STAI, and BSS, which evaluates somatic symptoms (fatigue, weakness) that would indirectly affect anxiety. After a 15-minute adaptation period, baseline measures were collected before the intervention (drug or placebo) was given. One hour and 20 minutes after the drug was taken, prestress measures were collected. After collection, the subjects watched a video with instructions about the task they would be performing. Each subject had 2 minutes to prepare a 4-minute speech about a topic covered previously in a uni- versity course and was told the speech would be recorded and analyzed by a psychologist. Anticipatory anxiety measure- ments were taken before the subject began speaking. During the middle of the speech, researchers interrupted the subject and subjective anxiety measurements were collected. Fifteen minutes after the speech ended, poststress measurements were collected. The VAMS results of the study demonstratedthat there was a signi cant increase in subjective anxiety in all groups ( P<0.001) during the SPST procedure. Diazepam signicantly decreased subjective anxiety throughout the study when compared with placebo ( P\u00bc0.016). sedation poststress anxiety ( P\u00bc0.017) measurements. Only diazepam showed signi cant physical and mental sedative effects, which may limit its therapeutic application in some patients. The authors concluded that acute administration of CBD or ipsapirone may have bene cial alternative anxiolytic effects when used in healthy subjectsand may be appropriate alternatives for those experiencingsedative effects from other anxiolytic medications. CBD presents an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve SPST Linares et al. 24conducted a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of 57 healthy adult males who were random- ized to receive either placebo or CBD dosed at 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg daily before SPST. The SPST was administered ac- cording to the Bergamaschi procedures.25VAMS was used to assess subjective anxiety. In the analysis of variance test ofgroup comparisons, there were no signi cantndings among groups and phases of the SPST ( P\u00bc0.1). A post hoc analysis among groups during the phases of SPST indicated that pa- tients in the CBD 300-mg group demonstrated lower anxiety levels in the speech phase than the placebo group ( P\u00bc0.042). The study investigators inferred an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve based on VAMS results with sequential CBD doses, with the 150-mg and 600-mg doses associated with minimal anxiolytic effects and the intermediate 300-mg dose producing the most clinically signi cant outcome on anxiety. This result supports ndings from previous studies. 21-23No safety outcomes were reported in this study. SAD: CBD reduces the anxiety induced by simulated public speaking in treatment-naive social phobia patients In a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial, Bergamaschi et al.25compared the effects of taking oral CBD 600 mg with those of taking placebo in SPST. A total of 36patients were included in the study; 24 were treatment-naive patients with SAD and 12 served as healthy controls (HCs) who did not receive medications. Of the 24 treatment-naive pa- tients with SAD, 2 separate groups of 12 were formed randomly. One group received CBD while the other received placebo, both packed in identical gelatin capsules. Subjective ratings using VAMS, SSPS-N, and physiological measures such as BP, heart rate, and skin conductance were all measured at 6 different time points during SPST. The time points of evalua- tion were selected for full evaluation of anxiolytic effects seen with CBD compared with those seen with placebo. In the rst stage of the procedure, a single dose of CBD or placebo wasadministered in a double-blind fashion along with adminis- tration of baseline measurements. In the second phase, par- ticipants were given instructions to prepare a 2- to 4-minute speech that would be videotaped and analyzed by aJ.W. Skelley et al. / Journal of the American Pharmacists Association xxx (2019) 1 e9SCIENCE AND PRACTICE 6psychologist. Researchers collected anticipatory speech mea- surements before the public speaking occurred. Interruptions in the speech were made in the middle and speech measure- ments were again taken. The speech was allowed to continue for another 2 minutes and then concluded, and 2 postspeech measurements were made 15 minutes and 35 minutes after the speech. After analyzing the results from the study, the VAMS scale showed that the placebo group presented with signicantly higher anxiety levels with greater cognitive impairment, discomfort, and alertness as compared with theHCs. The pretreated CBD SAD group had signi cantly reduced anxiety, cognitive impairment, and discomfort during thespeech performance compared with the placebo group ( P\u00bc 0.009). An important observation made by the authors wasthat negative self-evaluation was almost abolished by CBD. There were no signi cant differences found in vital signs. Overall, the effects of single dose CBD in patients experiencing SAD show a promising impact with a rapid-onset therapeutic effect. Neural basis of anxiolytic effects of CBD in generalized SAD In a double-blinded preliminary report, whose purpose was to con rm the hypothesis that CBD may be effective in treating SAD, Crippa et al. 26assessed 10 men with generalized SAD, which was con rmed by the structured clinical interview (SCID) for DSM-IV . All the subjects in the study were deter- mined to have a severe social phobia. To analyze the effects of CBD in these patients, researchers evaluated each subject us-ing the VAMS assessment. During the test, subjective ratings on VAMS were made 30 minutes before the ingestion of the drug (prestress), at the time of drug ingestion (adaptation), and at 75 minutes after ingestion (poststress). Functional neuroimaging was used to determine the neurophysiologic effect of CBD in patients with SAD. SPECT imaging was used to compare the effects of CBD and placebo on rCBF. This process was completed in a double-blind, randomized, repeated measures, within-subject crossover design using a dose of 400 mg of CBD given in oral gelatin capsules. In the rst session, the men were given CBD 400 mg or placebo. In the secondsession, this exercise was performed again, but this time the men who had received CBD earlier were administered the placebo and vice versa. Upon analysis of the VAMS score, the study showed that acute administration of CBD reduced subjective anxiety in patients clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, in this case SAD. Speci cally, CBD showed a signi cantly faster time onset of decreasing anxiety ( P<0.001) in the patient compared with placebo. Based on the VAMS score numbers, those taking CBD began with a mean assessment at prestress anxiety of 48.3 and ended poststress anxiety with 30.8, a decrease of 36.23%. Patients in the placebo group began prestress at an anxiety level of 46.9 and ended with a post- stress anxiety level of 42.1, a decrease of only 10.23%. The SPECT imaging was able to show that CBD was active in the paralimbic and limbic areas. Overall, the authors concluded that CBD has important advantages in treatment of SAD, such as a minimal adverse-effect pro le and early onset of action. However, the authors also concluded that more double-blind,placebo-controlled studies are needed to evaluate the long- term effects of CBD for treatment of anxiety disorders. Last, investigators suggested the need for further research anddenitive conclusions on whether a relationship exists be- tween rCBF and CBD plasma levels, which would potentiallyprovide a less invasive strategy for monitoring CBD 's clinical effects. Discussion CBD has been studied for use in treating anxiety-like re- sponses for more than a decade. 27Several early studies eval- uated the use of CBD in preventing neural responses to fearful faces.28,29Initial studies evaluating the difference in response between CBD and THC showed that while THC use often re-sults in negative behavioral and psychological effects, CBD is safe and well-tolerated with no difference from placebo in regard to increasing unwanted anxiety, sedation, positive psychotic symptoms, and intoxication. 28,30,31In addition, CBD may even have utility in minimizing the negative effects ofTHC. 32 On the basis of the results of currently available published human studies, it is seen that CBD has demonstrated a developing role as an alternative therapy in the indications of anxiety disorders, speci cally GAD, SAD, and anxiety related to PTSD. Because the majority of the reviewed studies had smallsample sizes, low statistical power posed a notable limitation. Primarily adult, male patients were enrolled in the studies, with only 1 pediatric case report meeting criteria for review. In addition, several studies enrolled healthy volunteers modeling varying anxiety disorders. Very few studies that enrolled pa-tients with an anxiety diagnosis and compared the outcomes of taking CBD with those of taking placebo were identi ed. Taken together, these overall study characteristics may limitthe generalizability of results. Similarly, because wide ranges of CBD doses were implemented among the studies, future evaluations of more intermediate range CBD doses may be warranted to determine optimal dosing de nitively. Last, many studies made conclusions related to the dose-responsecurve of CBD on the basis of the results of neuroimaging ndings and subjective scores on anxiety assessments without assessing plasma levels; therefore, these ndings should be interpreted with caution. In the studies reviewed, CBD regularly showed improved clinical outcomes in GAD, SAD, and anxiety related to PTSD, with minimal adverse effects, which differs from other thera- peutic agents that are currently used for these indications. These results indicate that CBD could provide a unique thera- peutic opportunity to augment or replace existing pharmaco- therapy in patients with inadequate relief while causing fewer adverse effects. While CBD did show positive bene ts in these patient populations, it can be challenging to translate resultsacross studies owing to the lack of a standardized assessment tool and the variety of dosing schedules and routes of admin- istration that were used. The most regularly used screening tool in CBD studies is VAMS, but its use has not been universal. Further standardized approaches in dosing and outcome measurement will be useful to best determine an effective therapeutic dose of CBD for broader patient populations. Of note, the increasing amount of human studies evaluating the role of CBD in the treatment of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders are showing potential therapeutic success, specif- ically when CBD is administered with acute dosing. Fewer studies exist that evaluate the safety and ef cacy of long-termCannabidiol 's role in anxiety managementSCIENCE AND PRACTICE 7use of CBD in human populations. While clinical evidence supporting the use of CBD in these patient populations now exists, there continue to be considerable challenges in terms of a lack of standardized dosage and route of administration. These challenges also persist in terms of lack of standardiza- tion in product manufacturing. Typically, CBD products are labeled not by strength per dose, but by strength of product contained in the entire package. The labeling of these products can lead to confusion for patients attempting to follow a spe- cic dosage schedule based on their clinical indication, sug- gesting a need for focused patient education and follow-upwith patients initiating CBD therapy for a chronic indication. While CBD has a generally mild adverse-effect pro le as demonstrated through human studies, some clinical consid- erations do exist. Clinical data have demonstrated the poten- tial for CBD to increase plasma levels of warfarin, and suggest that CBD products may potentiate some drug interactions viaCYP450 pathways. 33CBD has the potential to function as a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, which may result inincreased serum concentrations of or CYP3A4 function may be at risk forincreased CBD accumulation and exposure, while patients taking a CYP3A4 inducer may see a decrease in CBD expo- sure. 33,35Patients taking anticoagulants or other interacting medications should be counseled about the effects of initiatingand discontinuing CBD products. See Table 2 for a list of other CBD considerations. Another potential challenge surrounding the use of CBD in the general population concerns the persistent issuesregarding product purity. Generally, CBD products sold to the public for medical use contain high levels of CBD and low levels of THC, although these levels of THC may range between 0.3% and 5% based on state law. 36Even with the level of THC provided on product labeling, actual content of THC may behigher than what is listed on the label as found in FDA test results of products in 2015 and 2016. 37,38For patients where the presence of THC could be problematic because of work-place drug screenings or because the legal status of cannabis products in their state is in question, these factors should be considered before recommendation of CBD products. In addi- tion, because of the lack of product regulation for safety and purity given its status as a dietary supplement, products may also have a variable level of CBD present in them, further increasing dif culty in ensuring that patients receive a desired dose to obtain a speci c therapeutic effect. One study in 2015 demonstrated a wide range of product content of CBD, with products sold as medical cannabis products being both over- and underlabeled in regard to CBD content. 39Both regulation and increased quality assurance are needed for CBD products to be routinely recommended for use as a medical product. Last, patient access to CBD products can vary. While all 50 states have legislation that legalizes CBD products, restrictions vary widely, and CBD products are still considered by the federal government to be in the same restricted access class as marijuana. In similar fashion to their approach to medical marijuana, the federal government generally declines to enforce restrictions on CBD use. The legal status of CBD is evolving, and clinicians should pay careful attention to the laws surrounding CBD sales and usage in their states.Conclusion CBD has consistently demonstrated acute reduction in anxiety-related symptoms in patients, speci cally within GAD and SAD. Additionally, the use of CBD for these disor- ders has shown increasingly minimal adverse effects compared with existing pharmacotherapy. Further studies are needed to determine long-term safety and ef cacy of CBD products and a more standardized dose-effect response.Clinicians should be mindful of challenges related to product purity, legal status of CBD based on geographic area, and the potential for drug interactions when recommending the use of CBD for anxiety.

With only low-quality evidence suggesting anxiolytic e ects of cannabis and strong public sentiment surrounding such purported e ects, the purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of cannabis for medicinal purposes (CMP) use for anxiety symptoms. An online survey was disseminated to CMP users registered with a Canadian licensed producer. Respondents completed demographic and validated self-report questionnaires (GAD-7, PHQ-9, MINI-SPIN, and panic disorder/agoraphobia DSM-5 criteria). Cannabis use behaviors were also discussed. Overall, 2032 completed responses with a veri ed user number were col- lected. Of the total sample, 888 (43.7%) reported CMP authorization to treat anxiety symptoms and completed all psychometric screening instruments. Rates of probable disorders were high (Generalized Anxiety Disorder: 45.6%, Social Anxiety Disorder/Agoraphobia: 25.7%); 63.4% met screening criteria for 1 disorder. Most (92%) reported that cannabis improved their symptoms, despite continuing to endorse moderate-level severity. Nearly half (49%) reported replacing a non-psychiatric (53.7%) or psychiatric medication (46.3%) prescribed to them by their physician with CMP. Respondents endorsed daily CMP use and severity of anxiety (GAD-7, p < 0.001) and depressive (PHQ-9, p < 0.001) symptoms were positively associated with the amount of cannabis used/day. The vast majorityperceived symptom improvement with CMP use and did not believe CMP use was associated with impairment or an inability to control use. Nevertheless, the possibility of cannabis use disorder cannot be ruled out as well as the possibility that improvements in non-psychiatric conditions were attributed to improvements in anxiety.These results highlight the need to systematically evaluate CMP use for mental illness. 1. Introduction Cannabis is commonly used recreationally for its euphoric and re- laxing e ects. The dried plant is typically smoked or vaporized and also consumed in foods or used as a concentrated oil. Although considered an illicit substance in many parts of the world, regulatory bodies in the Netherlands, and several US states have legalized medicinal and/or recreational use, with Canada having legalized recreational use on October 17, 2018. Prior to this, only cannabis for medicinal purposes (CMP) could be legally obtained from licensed producers for a myriad of medical conditions, with appropriate physician authorization. Arecent meta-analysis revealed moderate-quality evidence to support cannabinoid treatment of chronic pain and spasticity, with very low- quality evidence suggesting improvement in anxiety and no e ect in depression ( Whiting et al., 2015). Only small studies of synthetic can- nabinoids ( Fabre and McLendon, et al., 2011; Crippa et al., ) have been examined in clinically anxious popula- tions. Yet, many Canadians report using cannabis to alleviate self-re-ported anxiety ( Walsh et al., 2013 ). Anxiety disorders are chronic conditions with a lifetime prevalence of 31.6% ( Kessler et al., 2012 ). They include social anxiety disorder https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.01.024 Received 13 April 2018; Received in revised form 24 January 2019; Accepted 30 January 2019Corresponding author.

These disorders are associated with signi cant burden for aicted individuals, their families and society ( Katzman et al., 2014 ). While many established e cacious rst-line treatments exist, including antidepressants and cognitive-behavioral therapy, 40 -60% of patients continue to have residual, impairing symptoms while others are non-compliant or have di culty accessing treatments ( Katzman et al., 2014 ). Given such limitations, individuals may seek alternative treatments and public sentiment surrounding cannabis 'purported an- xiolytic e ects suggest cannabis may ful l this role. The primary active components in cannabis are 9-tetra- hydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD. While THC is to have an-xiolytic, antidepressant and hypnotic e ects, CBD has demonstrated anti-in flammatory, analgesic, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic properties, (Walsh et al., 2017 ). Of the two primary cannabinoids, THC is the psychoactive constituent and at higher doses has been documented toinduce panic, paranoia and anxiety, ( D'Souza et al., 2004 ;Fusar-Poli et al., 2009). The ratio of these cannabinoids varies greatly betweenstrains of cannabis and consequently may induce a wide variety of ef- fects. For instance, when CBD is administered with THC, it has de- monstrated an ability to \"undo \"the unwanted and anxiogenic et al., 1974; Zuardi et al., 1982 ). Given the various cannabinoids and other active compounds in the cannabis plant, it is di cult to discern the speci c behavioral e ects of cannabis. As such, the existing cannabis literature comprised of studies of pure or synthetic cannabinoids may not be asucient proxy to illustrate cannabis' potential anxiolytic e ects. Ca- nadians are currently using cannabis for anxiety symptoms ( Sexton et al., 2016; Walsh et al., 2013) but whether these individuals are treating state anxiety or symptoms of a clinical disorder remains un-clear. With the scienti c literature indicating cannabis as a non-evi- dence-based treatment for anxiety, mood and related disorders ( Turna et al., 2017 ), this study examines the prevalence of CMP use for anxiety, psychiatric symptom severity and CMP use behaviors in a sample of authorized Canadian medicinal cannabis users. 2. Methods2.1. Study population and design An online survey was disseminated to all authorized CMP users registered with Tilray (British Columbia, Canada, n = 16,675) on January 9, 2017, and was closed 48 h later. Respondents received a $10 account credit towards future Tilray purchases. Following acknowl- edgement of a disclosure statement, information regarding demo-graphics and CMP use was collected. Questions were structured in multiple choice, checklist and rating scale format. Individuals were not able to skip question(s) they did not wish to answer, therefore, all completed questionnaires did not contain missing data. Many questions contained \"skip logic \", so that if the respondent answered \"no\", they did not complete further questions concerning this topic. Study datawas collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) ( Harris et al., 2009 ), a Health Insurance Portability and Ac- countability (HIPAA) and Personal Information Protection and Elec-tronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) compliant online survey tool allowing participants to directly enter responses. 2.2. Outcome measures All respondents answered questions regarding primary illness and symptoms treated with CMP. Those who identi ed anxiety as one of their primary symptoms treated with CMP in the second question then completed validated self-report symptom severity scales to characterize psychiatric morbidity including: 1) the GAD-7: a 7-item questionnaire used to screen for GAD and anxiety symptom severity, a score 10 was used to suggest moderate anxiety ( Spitzer et al., 2006); 2) The PatientHealth Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a multipurpose instrument for screening, monitoring and measuring depressive symptom severity with a total score 15 suggesting moderately severe depression ( Kroenke et al., 2001 ); 3) The MINI Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN) is a validated 3-item scale in which a total score 6 indicates signi cant SAD symptoms ( Connor et al., 2001). Given that no brief measure for panic disorder was found in the literature, four screening questions from the Panic Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) ( Bandelow, 1995 ) were in- cluded, and a positive screen for potential panic disorder symptoms wascoded if respondents identi ed the presence of panic attacks and re- ported > 1 panic attack in the past 2 weeks. Respondents were in-structed to answer questions based on the past two weeks. Additional questions regarding CMP use and its e ect on symptoms were also in- corporated. The survey included 25 anxiety-related questions. 2.3. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations and percentages were used to describe demographics, perceived e cacy, conditions, etc. Data analysis was performed using R (version 3.3.1, R Core Team). Frequencies were compared using a chi-square test. A one- way ANOVA or t-test was used to examine mean di erences between groups, where applicable. 2.4. Ethics approval This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board Services. 3. Results In total, 3405 responses were received and 2032 responses were paired with a veri ed user number. Of the total sample, 888 (43.7%, ANX group) identi ed anxiety as one of the primary symptoms for CMP use from a list of 14 prepopulated medical symptoms. These re- spondents were asked to complete all symptom severity screening questionnaires. 3.1. Sample demographics The mean age of the ANX group was 36.3 \u00b1 10.8 years (range: 16-84 years). The sample was primarily male (58.2%), married (36.1%), employed full-time (50.3%), living in an urban area (43.6%) and with a college education (32.2%); additional demographic char- acteristics can be found in Table 1. This sample was prescribed CMP by 607 di erent physicians. 3.2. Psychiatric comorbidity Based on the cut-o for each respective screening tool, rates of probable anxiety and depressive disorders within the ANX were high (Table 2). In this sample 63.4% met screening criteria for 1 disorder. The severity of anxiety (GAD-7) and depressive (PHQ-9) scores were positively associated with the amount of cannabis used per day. This was examined using a one-way ANOVA with GAD-7 score as the de- pendent variable and low (< 1 g/day), moderate (1 -2g/day) or high (3 g/day) CMP use as the independent variables. Post-hoc compar- isons revealed that high users had signi GAD-7 (11.5 \u00b1 5.8) and moderate (GAD-7:9.1 \u00b1 5.3; 0.001). No di erences were observed between low and moderate users. 3.3. Psychiatric e ects of CMP use To better understand perceived e cacy of CMP for symptomaticJ. Turna et al. Journal of Psychiatric Research 111 (2019) 134-139 135relief, the ANX group was asked to identify the anxiety and depressive symptoms CMP use improved, using 21 prepopulated choices (allowed to check all that applied). The majority of the ANX group reported that CMP improved their \"anxiety, worry, fears \"(92.0%), \"irritability \" (75.5%), and \"low mood \"(56.9%) ( Fig. 1). When asked how e ective CMP was at relieving these symptoms on a scale of 1 (not at all e ective) to 5 (very e ective), 64.9% reported a rating of 4 or more; only 1%responded \"not at all e ective \". Respondents using > 3 g cannabis/day reported signi cantly greater perceived bene t related to cannabis use as compared to individuals using < 3 g/day (p < 0.0001). Many in the ANX group reported using cannabis to feel relaxed (84.4%). Respondents were also asked which cannabis strains were thought to best improve their anxiety and which strains they found to worsen their anxiety. They could select as many of the 6 prepopulated options available. Cannabis indica was more often reported to have a subjective anxiolytic e ect (51.5%), while Cannabis sativa was the most frequently reported anxiogenic strain (32.3%) ( Fig. 2). 3.4. Cannabis use behaviors A majority of the ANX group used cannabis recreationally (99.5%) prior to medicinal use. However, 85.5% reported trying at least 1 tra- ditional mental health treatment before CMP ( x\u00af= 2.6 2.0 treat- ments), with 55.5% reporting and 20.5% reported cogni-tive-behavioral therapy. Use of other cannabinoid drugs was relativelyTable 1 Demographic characteristics of ANX sample.

Journal of Psychiatric Research 111 (2019) 136low (Dronabinol:1.0%, Nabilone:5.9%, Sativex:1.6%, Other Cannabinoids:0.6%). Fifty respondents (6%) endorsed having a primary mental health condition and had no previous treatment prior to their CMP. Although not signi cant, these individuals tended to be male, have lower levels of education and endorsed that cannabis is safer thanprescription medication compared with respondents who had tried at least one traditional treatment. They also reported signi cantly younger mean age of recreational cannabis use (15.96 vs. 17.48, t (99.97) = 2.5571, p= 0.01). In total, 22.1% of respondents stated that their use of cannabis had increased \"a lot \"since obtaining access to CMP, with 42% of in- dividuals using 1- 2 g of cannabis per day. Thirty- ve percent reported using < 1 g/day while 23% of the sample used 3 g/day. Respondents did not believe they had di culty controlling CMP use (79.7%) or that their social and leisure activities were impaired by it (84.4%). Mostrespondents also reported vaporizing (47.6%) as the preferred mode of delivery, followed by oral ingestion (21.4%, includes edibles, oils, etc.), joints (18.5%), etc. Respondents were also asked which prescription drugs they had replaced with cannabis (up to 3 answers permitted) and at what rate they were substituting the prescription medication with CMP. Nearly half of the ANX sample (49%) reported substituting a prescribed medication with CMP to some degree, of whom 61% indicated that cannabis had completely (100%) replaced a drug prescribed to them by their physician for a given medical condition ( Table 3). We also com- pared the rates of substitution between individuals with and withoutanxiety. No signi cant di erences in medication substitutions or CMP usage patterns were found between those with anxiety and thosewithout. 3.5. Primary condition for CMP Among all respondents (n = 2032), mental health (30.6%) was most frequently identi ed as the primary medical condition currently being treated with CMP. Mental health (52.9%) was also the most frequent indication in the ANX group (n = 888) ( Table 4). Demographic char- acteristics and cannabis use behaviours were compared among in-dividuals in the ANX group who were prescribed CMP to treat a mental health condition (52.9%) versus those taking CMP for a non-psychiatric condition (47.1%). Respondents who were prescribed CMP for a non- psychiatric condition appeared to use slightly more cannabis (2(6) = 19.339, p = 0.004) and were more likely to be on disability (2(5) = 33.15, p < 0.001; 24.1% vs. 11.9%) than respondents pre- scribed CMP to treat a mental health condition. Although not sig- nicant, most respondents using CMP for a non-psychiatric condition were male, married, living in a suburban area and have a technical ornon-university degree. No signi cant di erences were found between groups in terms of level of income, province of residence, scores on thePHQ-9 or GAD-7 nor in the perceived bene t of cannabis use. 4. Discussion The primary nding of this study is the high frequency of CMP use for the treatment of self-reported anxiety symptoms (43.7%, ANX).Almost 2/3 of the ANX group met screening criteria for 1 disorder (63.4%), with GAD and SAD being the most common ( Table 2). Simi- larly, anxiety and depressive scores were also higher in those using more cannabis (using3 g/day). Although the majority of participants reported that CMP use improved their anxiety symptoms ( Fig. 1), se- verity measures indicated at least ongoing moderate symptoms (Table 2). This suggests that even if cannabis has been helpful for these individuals, it may not be e ectively decreasing symptoms to a clini- cally signi cant level. For instance, their symptoms may have pre- viously been more severe and have, with CMP use, decreased to amoderate level. An alternative explanation may be that the improve- ment noted by CMP users in anxiety may be related to the relief of cannabis-withdrawal associated anxiety symptoms. Or that this im- provement may have been confounded by improvements in the non- psychiatric conditions also treated with CMP. Mental health conditions were the leading indication for CMP authorization in both the ANX group and the overall sample ( Table 4 ). Many were also replacing prescribed medications with CMP. The most frequently replaced drugs included psychotropics (antidepressants and benzodiazepines) and pain relievers ( Table 3). While most denied social impairment and di culty controlling use, many would be considered heavy users due to dailyuse. Cannabis indica, followed by hybrids, were most often rated as anxiolytic ( Fig. 2). Interestingly, both strains contain high THC (aboveFig. 2. Subjective reports of anxiogenic versus anxiolytic e ects of varying cannabis strains (n = 888).

Although THC has been purported to have anxiolytic properties, it has also been associated with the de- velopment of panic, paranoia and anxiety, D'Souza et al., 2004 ;Fusar- Poli et al. (2009) . Furthermore, while pre-clinical research suggests that CBD may be anxiolytic ( Bergamaschi et al., 2011 ;Crippa et al., 2011 ), it is critical to note that the vast biochemical variability of these plantsmakes it di cult to discern which e ects are attributable to which compound. Rather, the notion of an \"entourage e ect\"or synergistic eect between the flavonoids (Elzinga et al., 2015 ) may provide one possible explanation of the re- ported anxiolytic properties of Cannabis indica and hybrids in this sample. The prevalence of CMP use for anxiety in our sample exceeded what has been previously reported. An older study reported less than 10% ofauthorized Health Canada CMP users were prescribed cannabis for anxiety, while non-authorized use was signi cantly higher ( Walsh et al., 2013 ). Canadian regulations surrounding CMP authorization have become more inclusive since this study in 2013, now requiring physician authorization for any condition the physician feels warrants cannabis treatment. This process involves acquiring a medical docu- ment which includes the name of the healthcare practitioner and pa- tient, daily CMP quantity prescribed and duration of use; this document is then submitted to the licensed producer ( Health Canada, 2017). This change is likely re flected in the considerable increase of authorized users in our sample using cannabis for anxiety. Despite these changes in CMP legislation, the scienti c evidence examining cannabis treatment in anxiety disordered clinical populations is still in its infancy. Whenusing the four levels of evidence as de ned by the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) ( Kennedy et al., 2016 ), the existing cannabis literature would be considered Level Three evi- dence for certain mental health conditions including social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and Tourette's Syndrome ( Turna et al., 2017 ). The increasing number of CMP authorization for mental health issues, reveal that Canadian physicians are being approached forCMP prescriptions to treat these conditions and/or may be willing to prescribe for these symptoms despite a dearth of supporting evidence examining the e cacy and safety of CMP in anxiety. There is strong public sentiment regarding CMP e cacy for a wide range of medical conditions, including subjective anxiolytic e ects (Sexton et al., 2016). However, this is the rst study to characterize symptom severity beyond subjective reports of anxiety noted in pre- vious studies ( Sexton et al., 2016; Walsh et al., 2013 ). Validated clinical self-report measures revealed clinically signi cant psychiatric symp- toms in our sample, with 63.4% meeting criteria for at least 1 disorder. Yet, respondents perceived CMP treatment as e cacious for their an- xiety symptoms. Given that the symptom severity measures used in thissurvey have demonstrated sensitivity to change with treatment in clinical trials, these results elude to a possible disconnect between re- spondent belief regarding CMP e cacy and quanti able symptom im- provement. Furthermore, respondents using > 3 g/day also reportedgreater perceived bene t, yet endorsed higher anxiety and depression symptoms. This nding can be interpreted in several ways: these in- dividuals may be using more cannabis because they are more sympto- matic; perhaps cannabis used in this group is not reducing anxiety/ depressive symptoms but is providing an improved sense of well-being; or perhaps this a group of patients who have problematic use, as there is some evidence to suggest that higher daily use of cannabis is associated with cannabis use disorder (CUD) ( van der Pol et al., 2015 ). However, we have no way of evaluating CUD within this sample, and the cross-sectional nature of the study limits our ability to derive any conclusions regarding symptomatic change with CMP use. Even though respondents endorsed moderate symptoms we cannot preclude the possibility of improvement in that their symptoms may have been more severe prior to beginning treatment with CMP. Despite many respondents reporting increased cannabis use since receiving CMP authorization and many endorsing daily use, symptoms indicating problematic cannabis use(social impairment and di culty controlling use) were minimal. However, data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health(NSDUH) has suggested that up to 11% of individuals using CMP meet criteria for DSM-IV cannabis abuse/dependence ( Lin et al., 2016). Further, daily use is more frequent in medical cannabis users (33%)compared to recreational users (11%) ( Lin et al., 2016 ). We cannot preclude cannabis use disorder (CUD) in our sample as it was not di-rectly examined, however many respondents reported increased use of cannabis since obtaining a prescription. This may suggest the devel- opment of tolerance, a hallmark symptom of CUD. The recently pub- lished Lower-Risk Cannabis Use Guidelines (LRCUG) ( Fischer et al., 2017 ) suggest frequency or intensity of use to be the strongest and most consistent predictors of severe and/or long-term cannabis-related health problems. However, these guidelines are not speci c to medic- inal use as there is no existing data to suggest that daily medicinalcannabis use increases risk of CUD. These data highlight the need for additional research to appropriately characterize patients that may benet from CMP use while protecting those that may be at-risk to possible negative e ects. Of note, many respondents to our survey reported replacing a pre- scription medication with CMP, primarily antidepressants. A recent USstudy revealed that 71.8% of their sample of chronic pain medicinal cannabis users decreased use of anti-anxiety medications (benzodiaze- pines), and to lesser extent antidepressants (37.6%) while using medical cannabis ( Piper et al., 2017 ). Given the high rates of CMP prescription seen for mental health conditions and lack of literature examining theecacy of CMP in these conditions ( NASEM, 2017; Turna et al., 2017), there is an imminent need to begin developing a systematic body ofresearch examining CMP in these conditions. Future studies should examine both the e cacy of cannabis for mental health conditions, as well as its equivalence to current, evidence-based pharmacologicaltreatments. These studies will be critical to inform the development of treatment guidelines so that physicians may prescribe cannabis treat-ments to patients in an evidence-based and informed manner. As with any cross-sectional online survey, there are several limita- tions inherent to the study design. All responses were self-report and retrospective in nature. Although we utilized validated and reliable symptom severity scales to examine prevalence and severity of a given disorder, these do not replace physician con rmation of anxiety and mood disorders. Nevertheless, given that these individuals are physi-cian-authorized CMP users for primarily mental health conditions, it is likely that a medical diagnosis was made by their prescribing physician. We may have a potentially unrepresentative sample as the study was open to self-selection and non-response biases; although the submissionof multiple surveys from one participant was prevented, as a veri ed user number was required. Further participation was incentivizedwhich may have produced additional biases and the number of survey respondents capped. In addition, due to limitations inherent in the cross-sectional design, we were unable to answer several important questions including the impact of potential confounders such as non- psychiatric comorbidity or how many respondents developed anxiety or depression after beginning use of recreational cannabis or CMP. Further, only 25 of 888 respondents in the ANX group endorsed only anxiety and depression and no non-psychiatric condition, limiting the generalizability of these ndings. In light of these limitations, the pre- sented ndings should be interpreted cautiously and highlight the im- portance of additional studies to replicate ndings in samples of CMP users. Nevertheless, the results of this study show that patients and phy- sicians are pursuing CMP for a variety of medical conditions includinganxiety and a need to inform the signi cant gaps currently plaguing the existing literature is evident. This research highlights the importance offuture studies to clarify the role of cannabis in the treatment landscape. For instance, cannabis is thought to be safe, but it is unclear whether regular use as an anxiolytic treatment poses additional risks. Further, the abuse liability of cannabis is an issue warranting furtherJ. Turna et al. Journal of Psychiatric Research 111 (2019) 134-139 138consideration, as symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal are not well understood, and psychiatric populations may be particularly vulnerable to this potential consequence. CMP use for mental health conditions requires systematic evaluation to examine e cacy and equivalence using rigorously designed studies including, but not limited to double-blind randomized controlled trials. Research informing CMP prescribers will also be critical given that there is limited information to guide physicians on strains, frequency and dose. This raises a time-sensitive public health concern as legalization of recreational cannabis is forth- coming in Canada which may increase the rate of self-medication with cannabis for mental health purposes. With no information to guide CMP use, it is critical that the scienti c literature catch up to policy to better inform patients and physicians respectively.

Method: The articles selected for the review were identified through searches in English, Portuguese, and Spanish in the electronic databases ISI Web of Knowledge, SciELO, PubMed, and PsycINFO, combining the search terms \"cannabidiol and anxiolytic\", \"cannabidiol and anxiolytic-like\", and \"cannabidiol and anxiety\". The reference lists of the publications included, review articles, and book chapters were handsearched for additional references. Experimental animal and human studies were included, with no time restraints. Results: Studies using animal models of anxiety and involving healthy volunteers clearly suggest an anxiolytic-like effect of CBD. Moreover, CBD was shown to reduce anxiety in patients with social anxiety disorder. Conclusion: Future clinical trials involving patients with different anxiety disorders are warranted, especially of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The adequate therapeutic window of CBD and the precise mechanisms involved in its anxiolytic action remain to be determined.Cannabidiol, a Cannabis sativa constituent, as an anxiolytic Zuardi3,4 1 Laboratory of Panic and Respiration, Institute of Psychiatry (IPUB), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil 2 Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil 3 Department of Neuroscience and Behavioral Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Universidade de S\u00e3o Nacional de Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia Translacional em Medicina (National Institute for Translational Medicine; INCT-TM), Brazil Received on March 2, 2011; 18, 2011 anxiolytic drugS105 Introduction Cannabis sativa is the most used drug of abuse worldwide and around 20% of youth use it heavily and regularly around the globe. 1 The main psychoactive component of the plant is 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC), one of the substances responsible for the psychoactive effects of Cannabis. 2-4 Cannabidiol (CBD) is another abundant in Cannabis sativa, constituting around 40% of the plant's active substances. 5 The pharmacological effects of CBD are different and often opposite to those of 9-THC.6 The number of pub- lications on CBD has increased remarkably over the last years and support the view that CBD has a vast array of possible therapeutic effects. Among these possibilities, the anxiolytic and antipsychotic properties of CBD stand out. 7-10 CBD's anx- iolytic effects are apparently similar to those of approved drugs to treat anxiety, 11 although its effective doses have not been clearly established and the mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood. The low affinity of CBD for cannabinoid neuroreceptors 12,13 and its agonist properties at 5-HT1A receptors14,15 have been repeatedly demonstrated. Most studies on CBD have been conducted with rodents, but studies with human samples have also provided promis-ing results. 16,17 Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review the scientific literature on the anxiolytic properties of CBD in animal and in humans. Method The articles selected for this review were identified by searches in English, Portuguese, and Spanish in the elec-tronic databases ISI Web of Knowledge, SciELO, PubMed, and PsycINFO combining the search terms \"cannabidiol and anx - iolytic\", \"cannabidiol and anxiolytic-like\", and \"cannabidiol and anxiety\". In addition, the reference lists of the selected articles and relevant literature reviews and book chapters were handsearched for additional references. We included experimental studies with human and animal samples with no time limits. We sought to exclude studies that used smoked Cannabis, as it is not possible to establish the dose, composition, and proportion of the different cannabinoids in this case, besides the great individual variations in the samples enrolled. Finally, we did not include studies using extracts containing both THC and CBD in oral (Cannador\u00ae) or oromucosal spray (Sativex\u00ae) forms due to the difficulty to establish the effects of CBD alone (Table 1). Animal studies The two first articles about the effects of CBD on experi-mental anxiety were published in journals that were not indexed in the databases used for this review but were lo-cated through handsearch in the reference lists of relevant literature. These two investigations showed contradictory results. In one study, no significant effects of high doses of CBD (100 mg/kg) were seen in rats in the Geller-Seifter conflict test.18 In the other, a low dose of CBD (10 mg/kg) had anxiolytic effects in rats submitted to the conditioned emotional response test.19 Later studies using the elevated plus maze (EPM) helped to elucidate this contradiction.9 The EPM consists of two opposing open arms (50 x 10 cm) and two closed arms (50 x 10 x 40 cm) that intersect in their central portion. The arms are made of wood and stand 50 cm above the ground. In this study, mice injected with CBD, diazepam or vehicle (no active substances) were placed in the center of the maze facing the closed arms. The time spent and the numbers of entries in the open and closed arms were measured for 10 minutes. The frequency of entries in the open arms of ani - mals receiving CBD presented an inverted U-shaped curve, with significantly higher rates than those observed in animals treated with vehicle, at the doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg. The measures of mice treated with CBD 20 mg/ kg did not dif- fer from those of controls, suggesting that anxiolytic effects are only present at low doses, which explains the absence of effects with CBD 100 mg/kg reported in 1981.18 The same inverted U-shaped dose-response curve was obtained with a wider range of doses of CBD in the EPM (Onaivi et al.).20 Furthermore, the same pattern was observed with the direct infusion of CBD in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of rats tested in the EPM, 15,21 confirming that anxiolytic effects should only be expected with low doses of CBD. The mechanisms through which CBD acts to diminish anxiety have been studied in a number of animal models of anxiety using rodents. One of these studies used Vogel's conflict test, 22 in which the animal is water-deprived from and placed in a cage with an electrified grid at the bottom through which the animal receives a shock after licking wa-ter for a predetermined number of times. Three substances were tested in rats using the following procedure: CBD (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg), diazepam, and flumazenil (an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors), in addition to vehicle (placebo). The tests showed that CBD produced effects consistent with those of diazepam by increasing the number of licks, even if they resulted in punishment. Flumazenil antagonized the anxiolytic effect of diazepam, but not that of CBD, suggesting that the effects of CBD are not mediated by the activation of benzodiazepine receptors. There is strong evidence showing that the serotonergic system is involved in the anxiolytic action of CBD. The injec - tion of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (WAY) directly into the dorsolateral portion of the PAG (dlPAG) in rats antagonized the anxiolytic effects of CBD in the EPM and in Vogel's conflict test. 15 The participation of 5-HT1A recep- tors in the anxiolytic action of CBD was also derived from behavioral and cardiovascular responses to restraint stress in rats. 11 In this study, animals were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle or CBD (1, 10 and 20 mg/kg) and, after 30 min - utes, they were restrained for 60 minutes. Immobilization increased blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety responses in the EPM 24 hours later, and these effects were attenuated by CBD. Pretreatment with WAY blocked the anxiolytic action of CBD. The injection of CBD into the intra-dorsal PAG also blocked panic-like responses in the elevated T-maze (ETM) and flight responses to the electrical stimulation of this area. 23 The ETM has three arms with the same dimensions, two open and one closed, and allows the measure of entrance avoidance in the open arms when the animal is placed in the closed arm, as well as of escape when the animal is placed in the open arm. The panic-like response seen with CBD in the two procedures was antagonized by the previous intra-dlPAG administration of WAY . 22 Chronic oral administration of CBD also had anti-panic effects in the ETM that were neutralized A.R.M.

However, chronic administra- tion of CBD did not change the extracellular concentration of serotonin in the dlPAG or the expression of 5-HT1A or 5-HT2C, indicating that CBD directly activates 5-HT1A receptors. 24 CBD was also found to activate the vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) 25 and there is evidence that this activation could explain the inverted U-shaped dose-response curve of CBD's anxiolytic effect seen in the EPM. TRPV1 receptors regulate the release of glutamate in the dlPAG and the increased activation of this system would result in increased anxiety. Thus, it has been suggested that elevated doses of CBD in the dlPAG could activate local TRPV1 receptors facilitating the glutamatergic neurotransmission and increasing anxiety. To test this hypothesis, rats pre-treated with the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine in the dlPAG were injected with CBD (30 and 60 mg/kg) in the same region and tested in the EPM. The dose of 60 mg/kg CBD, which had no anxiolytic action before, was able to reduce anxiety after pre-treatment with capsazepine, suggesting that the activation of TRPV1 receptors by the higher dose of CBD would counterbalance the anxiolytic effect of CBD produced by the activation of 5-HT1A receptors. 21 Because serotonin has also been implicated in obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), the effects of CBD were tested in mice submitted to the marble-burying test (MBT), an animal model of compulsive behavior. CBD induced a significant re-duction in the number of buried marbles at different doses (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) co mpared to controls in a dose-depen- dent pattern. The same was found with the administration of the ISRS paroxetine (10 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg). However, the effects of CBD 30 mg/kg persisted even after seven days of repeated daily administration, whereas the effects of diazepam disappeared. Pre-treatment with WAY (3 mg/kg) counteracted the effects of paroxetine, but did not affect the action of CBD, which was prevented by pre-treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (1 mg/ kg).26 This action of CBD in the MBT was recently replicated by another group using a higher dose (120 mg/kg).27 The participation of specific cannabinoid receptors (CB1) in the anxiolytic action of CBD has also been investigated using animal models. In the study with the EPM that reported the antagonism of the anxiolytic effect of intra-dlPAG CBD by WAY , the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 was unable to avoid this effect. 15 However, this receptor system seems to be involved in another anxiolytic-like action of CBD, ac-cording to tests using a procedure known as contextual fear conditioning. In this procedure, animals are pre-conditioned to a hostile environment (foot shocks) and later exposed to the same environment, when they normally present freez-ing, the duration of which can be monitored as a measure of anxiety. Both CBD and diazepam are successful in attenuating freezing in rats, as well as the increased heart rate and blood pressure induced by re-exposure to the contextually feared environment. 10 This effect of CBD on contextual memory is also produced by the endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor AM404, which increases the availability of cannabinoids in the synaptic cleft. 28 In this study, the two drugs were injected into the ventricles and their effects were counteracted by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A, suggesting the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the anxiolytic action of CBD in this model. The pre-limbic region of the prefrontal cortex appears to underlie this effect of CBD, as the reduction in contextual fear produced by systemic administration of CBD (10 mg/kg) is associated with reduced c-Fos expression in this area. In addition, the microinjection of CBD (30 n mol) in the pre-limbic region of the frontal cortex reduced freezing induced by re-exposure to the aversive context. 29 The effects of CBD on contextual fear indicate a possible therapeutic action of this cannabinoid in post-traumatic stress disorder. Another area that is apparently involved in the anxiolytic- like effects of CBD is the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). The intra-BNST injection of CBD (15, 30, 60 nmol ) increased the number of punished licks in Vogel's conflict test and the number of open arm entries in the EPM. These effects were blocked in rats pre-treated with WAY . 30 CBD was also effective in an ethologic model that inves- tigates behaviors induced by innate fear, the predator-prey paradigm. 31 This procedure was performed using a semi-trans- parent plexiglass box in the shape of a quadrangular arena (154x72x64 cm) with walls covered with a light-reflecting film and floor in transparent plexiglass over a board of stainless steel divided in 20 equal rectangles. One of the corners of the arena has a shelter box with black walls and a complex maze inside. Three days prior to the experiment, the mice were placed and kept in this arena, with free access to food and water until the day of the trial. The \"no threat\" group had its behaviors recorded for five minutes. Animals exposed to the predator (snake) were divided into four groups (n = 12/11 per group) and pre-treated with intraperitoneal injections of CBD (0.3, 3 and 30 mg/kg) or vehicle (control group). The group of animals that were not confronted with the preda - tor presented no defensive behaviors. Animals pre-treated with CBD had significant reductions in explosive flight and defensive immobility, responses related to panic models. Risk assessment and defensive attention were unaltered in animals treated with CBD. These results suggest that CBD can be effective in the control of panic attacks. Human studies The first evidence of CBD's anxiolytic effects in humans, documented with assessment scales, was published in 1982 in a study on the interaction between CBD and THC. 7 The study sample consisted of eight volunteers with a mean age of 27 years, no health problems and who had not used Cannabis sativa in the previous 15 days. In a double-blind procedure, the volunteers received CBD, THC, THC + CBD, diazepam, and placebo in different sequences and days. The results showed that the increased anxiety following the administration of THC was significantly attenuated with the simultaneous administration of CBD (THC + CBD). Based on this preliminary evidence, researchers de- cided to investigate a possible anxiolytic action of CBD in experimentally induced anxiety in healthy volunteers using the simulated public speaking (SPS) model. 32 The procedure consists of asking a subject to speak in front of a video camera for a few minutes, while subjective anxiety is measured with self-rated scales and physiological correlates of anxiety are recorded (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance). CBD (300 mg), as well as the anxiolytic drugs diazepam (10 mg) and ipsapiro ne (5 mg), administer ed in a double-blind design, significantly attenuated SPS-induced anxiety.A.R.M. Schier et al.S108 The SPS test may be regarded as a good model of anxiety and has apparent validity for social anxiety disorder (SAD), as the fear of speaking in public is considered a central feature in this condition. Therefore, the anxiolytic effect of CBD in healthy volunteers observed in this test led to the hypothesis that this cannabinoid could be effective to treat SAD. This hypothesis was recently tested in 24 patients with SAD who had their performance in the SPS test compared to that of a group of 12 healthy controls. 33 The patients with SAD were divided into two groups of 12, one of which received CBD 600 mg and the other placebo, in a double-blind procedure. The results showed that the levels of anxiety, somatic symptoms, and negative self-assessment were higher in patients who took placebo than in those of the CBD group who performed similarly to healthy controls in some measures. In another study that investigated the effects of CBD on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in healthy volunteers using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), SPS-induced anxiety was reduced in patients receiving CBD. 34 In that study, patients received either CBD (400 mg) or pla - cebo, in a crossed double-blind design, in two experimental sessions with an interval of one week. CBD significantly re-duced subjective anxiety as measured by rating scales, while brain activity was increased in the left parahippocampal gyrus and decreased in the left amygdala-hippocampus complex, including the fusiform gyrus. This pattern of SPECT results is compatible with an anxiolytic action. SPECT was also used later to investigate the neural cor- relates of CBD's anxiolytic effects in a sample of patients with SAD. 17 A single dose of CBD 400 mg was able to reduce subjective anxiety measures and SPECT showed changes in the same regions previously identified in healthy volunteers. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which allows the acquisition of larger series of images with better temporal and spatial resolution, was used to investigate the neural correlates of the anxiolytic effects of CBD in 15 healthy volunteers. 35 This experiment showed that CBD (600 mg) attenu ated fMRI responses during the recognition of fearful facial expressions in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate, and that this attenuation pattern correlated with skin conductance responses to the stimuli. The same group also reported that the anxiolytic action of CBD occurs by altering the subcortical prefrontal connectivity via amygdala and anterior cingulated. 16 Conclusion Together, the results from laboratory animals, healthy vol - unteers, and patients with anxiety disorders support the proposition of CBD as a new drug with anxiolytic properties. Because it has no psychoactive effects and does not affect cognition; has an adequate safety profile, good tolerability, positive results in trials with humans, and a broad spectrum of pharmacological actions, 36 CBD appears to be the can - nabinoid compound that is closer to have its preliminary findings in anxiety translated into clinical practice. 37 Future studies should test this possibility in clinical trials involving patients with different anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disor-der, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, because the actions of CBD are biphasic, the adequate therapeutic window for each anxiety disorder remains to be determined. Regarding the mechanism underlying the anxiolytic effects of CBD, the most consistent evidence points to the involvement of the serotonergic system, probably through direct action on 5-HT1A receptors, although other systems, as the endo - cannabinoid system itself, may also be implicated. Further investigation is warranted to clarify these issues, especially if we consider that CBD is a drug with a variety of effects in the nervous system. 38-40 Disclosures Alexandre Rafael de Mello Schier Employm ent: Universidade do Rio de grant: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development, CNPq)*, Brazil.

It was named either ganzi-gun-nu (\"the drug that takes away the mind\") or azzalu, which was apparently a drug for \"depression of spirits,\" for a female ailment(possibly amenorrhea), or even for annulment of witchcraft (Campbell Thomson 1949). The importance of cannabis intoxication seemsto have been central in early Zoroastrian shamanic ecstasy (Mechoulam 1986). Its wide use in the Middle East has continued eversince. Indeed, it was a central theme in Arab poetry of the Middle Ages (Rosenthal 1971). In China and India it was known for the dualnature of its effects. In the Chinese classic medical pharmacopeia Ben Ts'ao, originally compiled around the rst century AD, cannabiswas recommended for numerous maladies, \"but when taken in excess it could cause seeing devils\" (Mechoulam 1986, p. 9). In Europe, cannabis was introduced by the Napoleonic soldiers returning from Egypt andby British physicians returning from India. Industrial hemp, which contains negligible amounts of psychoactive material, was ofcourse grown previously, but the psychoactive variety was unknown. The psychological effects caused by cannabis preparations\u2014presumablyNorth African hashish\u2014became known in Eu- rope mostly through the writings of members of the Parisian Le Club des Hachichins in the mid-nineteenth century, particularly Baude- laire, the time,emphasized the \"groundless gaiety\" and \"the distortion of sounds and colours\" following cannabis use. Moreau, a psychiatrist, in his1845 book, Hashish and Mental Illness (Moreau 1973), described in detail numerous psycho-logical phenomenon noted in experimental subjects: feeling of happiness, excitement and dissociation of ideas, errors of time and space,enhancement of the sense of hearing, delusions, fluctuations of emotions, irresistible impulses, and illusions and hallucinations. This diversityof actions\u2014some of them opposite to each other\u2014has confounded cannabis research ever since. Indeed, Moreau reported of 22 Mechoulam \u00b7Parker Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2013.64:21-47. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Ohio State University Library on 12/30/18. For personal use only. PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 his volunteers experienced \" ...occurrences of delirium or of actual madness\". He concluded, \"There is not a single, elementary manifes-tation of mental illness that cannot be found in the mental changes caused by hashish... \" (Moreau 1973, p. 18). But today few marijuanausers will reach a state of \"delirium or of actual madness.\" In most cases, they will report anincrease in relaxation and euphoria and possibly enhancement of their senses, but an impair- ment of memory. These striking differencesare probably due to the well-known biphasic activity of /Delta1 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\u2014 the psychoactive constituent\u2014whose effects at low doses may be opposite to those produced by high doses. Moreau's volunteers presumably orally consumed large amounts of hashish,whereas today North Americans and Euro- peans usually smoke cannabis, and most users adjust their dose to achieve the desired effects. Surprisingly, research on cannabis advanced slowly. A major reason for the neglect was thelack of knowledge of its basic chemistry. Mod- ern research\u2014namely research over the past 150 years\u2014is based on quantitative data. Unlikemorphine and cocaine, which had been isolated and made available in the nineteenth century and thus could be quantitatively investigated invitro, in animals, and in humans, the psychoac- tive constituent(s) of cannabis were not isolated and their structures were not elucidated untilthe 1960s; hence quantitative research was not possible before then. It is conceivable that the material reaching Europe in the past varied widely in its contents;thus its medical use also was not reliable, and research with it was of little value. Indeed,around the beginning of the twentieth century cannabis almost disappeared, both as a medic- inal agent and for recreational purposes in Europe and in North America. In addition, the anti-cannabis laws made research on it, partic-ularly in academic institutions, very difcult. Indeed, from the early 1940s until the mid- 1960s, research on cannabis was limited to a fewscattered groups. This paucity of early research has now been more than compensated for by the avalanche of papers on the plant cannabi-noids and on the endogenous cannabinoids. Not surprisingly, the burst of recreational marijuana use, in the mid-1960s in the UnitedStates and later in Europe, coincided with the new wave of research on cannabis. /Delta19-Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol Over nearly a century, numerous attempts were made to isolate in pure form the activemarijuana constituent(s) and to elucidate its (or their) structure(s), but these attempts were unsuccessful (Mechoulam & Hanus 2000).Now we can understand the reason for this lack of success. There are more than 60 cannabis constituents, with closely related structures andphysical properties, making their separation difcult. With the advance of modern separa- tion techniques, the isolation and the structureelucidation of the active principle, THC, was nally achieved in 1964 (Gaoni & Mechoulam 1964). Shortly thereafter, THC was synthe- sized (Mechoulam et al. 1967). Thus, THC became widely available for research, andseveral thousand papers have been published on it. Surprisingly, although most of the plant cannabinoids have now been identied\u2014andtheir structures are related chemically\u2014the only major mood-altering constituent is THC. Another major plant cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD), which was isolated duringthe late 1930s, but its structure was elucidated only in 1963 (Mechoulam & Shvo 1963).As it does not parallel THC in its central nervous system (CNS) effects, initially only a limited amount of research was focused on it.However, over the past two decades CBD was found to be a potent anti-inflammatory agent, to attenuate the memory-impairing effects produced by THC, and to cause a plethora of other effects. Hundreds of publications haveaddressed its various actions (for a review, see Mechoulam et al. 2009). Both THC and CBD are present in the plant mainly astheir nonpsychoactive carboxylic precursors (THC-acid and CBD-acid), which slowly acidic function (decarboxylate) in the www.annualreviews.org The Endocannabinoid System and the Brain 23 Annu.

The structures of THC and CBD are presented in Figure 1. The cannabis plant varieties differ tremen- dously in their contents. In industrial hemp the concentration of THC is less than 0.3%, in hashish in the 1960s it was about 5%, whereasin marijuana it was about 2% to 3%, but nowa- days strains have been developed\u2014mostly for illegal use\u2014that contain up to 25%. The Endocannabinoid Receptors Originally it was assumed that cannabinoids actthrough a nonspecic membrane-associatedmechanism; however, the very high stere- ospecicity of the action of some synthetic cannabinoids pointed to a more specic mech- anism (Mechoulam et al. 1988). The rst data indicating that cannabinoids may act throughreceptors were published by Howlett, who showed that cannabinoids inhibit adenylate cy- clase formation, and the potency of the cannabi-noids examined paralleled the level of their pharmacological action (Howlett et al. 1986). The same group shortly thereafter indeedreported the existence of binding sites in thebrain (Devane et al. 1988). Their distribution was found to be consistent with the pharmaco- logical properties of psychotropic cannabinoids (Herkenham et al. 1990), and the receptor was cloned (Matsuda et al. 1990). A second,peripheral receptor, CB2, was later identied in the spleen (Munro et al. 1993). Both CB1 and CB2 receptors belong to the superfamilyof G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The two cannabinoid receptors exhibit 48% amino acid sequence identity. Both receptor typesare coupled through G proteins to adenylyl cyclase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (for a detailed review on the pharmacology ofcannabinoids, see Howlett et al. 2002). The CB1 Receptor It was originally believed that the CB1 receptor was expressed mainly in the CNS, and hence it was considered a brain cannabinoid receptor.We are now aware that it is present in numerous peripheral organs, although in some of them the receptor levels are low. CB1 receptors are 24 Mechoulam \u00b7Parker Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2013.64:21-47. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Ohio State University Library on 12/30/18. For personal use only. PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 among the most abundant GPCRs in the brain. The highest densities of CB1 receptors, in the rodent brain, are noted ganglia,substantia nigra, cerebellum, the brainstem. The high CB1 levels in the sensory and motor regions are consistent with the important role of CB1 receptors in motivation and cognition.CB1 receptors appear to be involved in - aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neu-rotransmission, as they are found on GABAer-gic and glutamatergic neurons (Howlett et al. 2002). The CB1 receptor is present and active from the earliest phases of ontogeneticdevelopment, including during the embryonal stages, which indicates that it is of importance in neuronal development and newborn suckling(Fride et al. 2009). Surprisingly the CB1 re- ceptor levels in rats are increased on transition from adolescence [postnatal days (PND) 35-37] to adulthood (PND 70-72), a pattern that is opposite to that of other neuroreceptor systems (Verdurand et al. 2012). Also, unexpectedly, lig- ands that interact similarly with CB1 receptors may have signicantly different pharmacolog-ical proles. This may be due to the ability of CB1 receptors to form heteromeric complexes with other GPCRs (Pertwee et al. 2010). The distribution of CB1 receptors differs in neonatal brain and adult brain. It is abundant inwhite matter areas at the early age but is muchless abundant later (Romero et al. 1997). It is of interest to determine whether this difference has anything to do with the behavioral land-marks associated with different ages. The CB1 receptors are found primarily on central and peripheral neurons in thepresynapse. These locations facilitate their inhibition of neurotransmitter release, which is one of the major functions of the endocannabi- noid system. Activation of CB1 receptors leads to a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophos-phate (cAMP) accumulation and nase (PKA). stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, which is a mechanism by which cannabinoids affect synaptic plasticity,cell migration, and possibly neuronal growth (Howlett et al. 2002). CB1 receptors are also coupled, again through G proteins, to severaltypes of calcium and potassium channels. Several types of CB1 receptor gene knock- out mice are available and are widely used (Zimmer et al. 1999). CB1 receptor gene polymorphisms have been observed, and theirimportance is yet unknown, although suscep- tibility to addiction and neuropsychiatric con- ditions has been suggested (Zhang et al. 2004). The CB2 Receptor It was originally assumed that CB2 receptors were present only in cells of the immune sys- tem; however, they have now been identiedthroughout the CNS (Ashton et al. 2006, Onaivi et al. 2008a, van Sickle et al. 2005), particularly in microglial cells (Nunez et al.2004, Stella 2004), though at lower levels than those of the CB1 receptors. Under some patho- logical conditions, CB2 receptor expression is enhanced in the CNS as well as in other tissues. It seems possible that the CB2 receptor is partof a general protective system (for a review, see Pacher & Mechoulam 2011). In that review, we speculated that \"The mammalian body has ahighly developed immune system which guards against continuous invading protein attacks and aims at preventing, attenuating or repairing theinflicted damage. It is conceivable that through evolution analogous biological protective sys- tems have evolved against nonprotein attacks.There is emerging evidence that lipid endo- cannabinoid signaling through CB2 receptors may represent an example/part of such a pro-tective system\" (Pacher & Mechoulam 2011, p. 194). In view of the various protective effects associated with the CB2 receptor, several syn- thetic CB2-specic receptor agonists, which do not bind to the CB1 receptor, have been synthe-sized. HU-308 was one of the rst such com- pounds reported (Hanus et al. 1999); however, numerous additional ones are now known, andsince they do not cause the psychoactive effects associated with CB1 agonists, several pharma- ceutical rms are presently active in the eld. www.annualreviews.org The Endocannabinoid System and the Brain 25 Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2013.64:21-47. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Ohio State University Library on 12/30/18. For personal use only. PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 CB2 receptor agonists might be expected to become drugs in various elds, including neu- ropsychiatric, cardiovascular, and liver disease. Endogenous of the cannabinoid receptorssuggested that endogenous molecules, whichmay stimulate (or inhibit) the receptors, are presumably present in the mammalian body. The plant constituent THC, which, apparentlyby a quirk of nature, binds to these recep- tors, is a lipid compound; hence it was as- sumed that any possible endogenous cannabi-noid molecules (endocannabinoids) would also be lipids. Indeed, we were able to isolate and identify two compounds, one from brain\u2014which we named anandamide, based on the Sanskrit word ananda (\"supreme joy\")\u2014and a second one [2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG)] from peripheral tissues (Devane et al. 1992, Mechoulam et al. 1995). Their structures are presented in Figure 1. These two endogenous cannabinoids have been investigated in greatdetail (for a review, see Howlett et al. 2002).Additional endogenous molecules that bind to the cannabinoid receptors have been identied, but some of them may be artifacts, and interestin them is negligible. Unlike most neurotransmitters (e.g., acetyl- choline, dopamine, and serotonin), anandamideand 2-AG are not stored in vesicles but rather are synthesized when and where they are needed. Again, unlike most neurotransmitters,their action is not postsynaptic but rather mostly presynaptic, i.e., they serve as fast ret- rograde synaptic messengers (Howlett et al.2002). However, whether or only 2-AG, serve as fast retrograde synaptic messengers remains to be established. Thus 2-AG, after its postsynaptic synthesis, crosses the synapse and activates the cannabi-noid presynaptic receptor, which makes possi- ble the inhibition of various neurotransmitter systems that are present there. This is a primaryactivity of the endocannabinoids. Contrary to THC, which is metabolized over several hours and excreted (or stored asone of its metabolites), endocannabinoids are rapidly removed by a membrane transport pro- cess yet to be fully characterized (Fu et al. 2011).In the cell, anandamide is hydrolyzed to mono- acyl hydrolases. of these enzymesprolongs the activity of the endocannabinoids (Gaetani et al. 2009). Although there is solid evidence that the activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors canlead to inhibition of the release of a number of different excitatory or inhibitory neurotrans-mitters both in the brain and in the peripheral nervous system, there is also in vivo evidence that CB1 receptor agonists can stimulatedopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accum- bens (Gardner 2005). This effect apparently stems from a cannabinoid receptor-mediatedinhibition of glutamate release. Indeed, many of the actions receptor agonists (including endocannabinoids) are dose- dependently al. 1998). Endocannabinoids also exhibit an \"entourageeffect\"\u2014namely enhancement of their activity by structurally related, biologically inactive, endogenous constituents (Ben-Shabat et al.1988). The multiple functions of endocannabi- noid signaling in the brain have recently been very well reviewed (Katona & Freund 2012). In the following review of the effects of brain endocannabinoids and related fatty acidamides of amino acids (FAAAs) and closely re-lated compounds on emotions and cognition, we summarize the large number of published observations. It seems that many of the FAAAsin the CNS that have been investigated\u2014and most have not been investigated yet\u2014have sig- nicant effects. If we assume that the dozens of compounds of this type present in the brain are not biosynthesized by mistake but rather playsome physiological role, it is tempting to spec- ulate that their levels and their interactions may be of importance in the prole of emotions andpossibly of individual personalities. This topic is further discussed in the Conclusions section of this review. 26 Mechoulam \u00b7Parker Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2013.64:21-47.

PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 THE CANNABINOID SYSTEM IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION Freud considered the problem of anxiety a \"nodal point, linking up all kinds of most im- portant questions; a riddle, of which the solu- tion must cast a flood of light upon our whole mental life\" (Freud 1920). We have made someprogress since Freud's time, but according to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxi- ety disorders still affect about 40 million peo-ple in the United States alone, and antianxiety drugs are among the top prescription drugs. Cannabis has been used for millennia as a medicinal agent (Mechoulam 1986). In India,bangue (the local name for cannabis at the time) was believed to help the user to be \"deliveredfrom all worries and care\" (Da Orta 1563), and its extensive present-day use throughout the world is presumably due, in part at least, tothe same effects. For recent reviews on cannabis and anxiety, see Gaetani et al. (2009), Moreira & Wotjak (2010), Parolaro et al. (2010), and Zanettini et al. (2012). For general reviews on the endocannabinoid system, including detaileddata on anxiety and depression and emerging pharmacotherapy, see Pacher et al. (2006) and Pertwee (2009). A few years ago the major pharmaceutical rm Sano-Aventis developed and initiatedmarketing for an antagonist (or more preciselyan inverse agonist) of the CB1 receptor. Because CB1 agonists enhance appetite, such a drug could become a major weaponagainst obesity. Many other companies had related compounds in various stages of de- velopment. The Sano compound, namedrimonabant, indeed affected obesity and even blocked the psychoactive effects of THC, including short-term memory and loweredcocaine-seeking responses to suitable cues (in animals). However, although psychiatric disorders were indicated as exclusion criteria, rimonabant-treated patients had enhanced anxiety problems and suicidal tendencies(Christensen et al. 2007), and the drug had to be withdrawn from the market. This rather expensive proof is a further addition to previousevidence, indicating the importance of the CB1 cannabinoid system in anxiety. Interestingly, Lazary et al. (2011) have recently suggestedthat as some variants of the CB1 receptor gene contribute more signicantly than others to the development of anxiety and depression, by genomic screening\u2014possibly in combination with the gene of the serotonin transporter\u2014high-risk individuals could be identied and excluded from the treatment population and thus CB1 antagonists could still be useful.Such screening and treatment would represent a model for modern personalized medicine. As mentioned previously, many of the psychological effects of cannabis, as well as ofTHC, are biphasic, depending principally on the dose level and to a certain extent upon thepersonality of the user. In normal subjects, THC may cause either euphoria and relaxation or dysphoria and anxiety (D'Souza et al. 2004,Wade et al. 2003). Pure THC may not entirely mimic the effects of cannabis, which contains additional cannabinoid constituents, such as CBD, that modulate the effect of THC. Besides, CB1 receptors rapidly desensitizefollowing the administration of agonists, further diminishing the effect of agonists. Cannabidiol, which does not bind to either CB1 or CB2, possesses anxiolytic and antipsy-chotic properties (Mechoulam et al. 2002) both in animals and in humans. It shows anxiolytic-like effects with mice in the elevated plus maze and in the Vogel conflict test (Guimar aes et al. 1990, Moreira et al. 2006). In humans it was found to lower anxiety in stressful situations (Bergamaschi et al. 2011). The mode of action of CBD as an anxiolytic molecule is not wellunderstood. Most probably it involves action as a serotonin receptor (5-HT 1A) ofadenosine signaling through inhibition of up- take (Carrier et al. 2006), or inhibition of theGPR55 receptor (Sharir & Abood 2010).

To our knowledge neither anan- damide nor 2-AG has ever been administered to human subjects. This is an absurd situation,presumably a result of regulatory limitations. By contrast, when insulin was discovered in the 1920s, it became an available drug within a year. We can only assume that, because many of the physiological systems are regulated throughchecks and balances by a variety of endogenous molecules, the endocannabinoids, which affect neurotransmitter release, apparently exert suchan action on anxiety, which is a normal human reaction to a variety of stressful conditions. Considerable data exist on the direct effects of endocannabinoids on anxiety in animals.Rubino et al. (2008) have shown that methanan- damide (a stable analog of anandamide) injectedinto the prefrontal cortex of rats leads to an anxiolytic response. However, large increases of the dose administered led to an anxiogenicresponse due to TRPV1 stimulation. An indirect pathway for enhancement of endocannabinoid levels is by blocking their enzymatic hydrolysis. The Piomelli group (Kathuria et al. 2003) reported a novel classof potent, selective, and systemically active carbamate-based inhibitors of FAAH, the enzyme responsible for the degradation ofanandamide. The best inhibitors in this series (URB532 and URB597) had anxiolytic prop- erties elevated zero-maze testand suppressed isolation-induced vocalizations due to augmented brain levels of anandamide. These effects could be prevented by blockageof the CB1 receptor. These results indirectly conrmed that anandamide has antianxiety properties. The rationale behind this approachis based on the mechanism of anandamide formation and release, which is known to take place when and where needed. As mentioned above, contrary to the classical neurotrans- mitters, anandamide is not stored in synapticvesicles but rather is synthesized and released in the synaptic cleft following neuronal activation. Presumably its levels and those of FAAH in anx-iety and depression will be highest in the brain areas involved in the regulation of mood and emotions. Therefore, inhibition of anandamidemetabolism would enhance CB1 activation mainly where anandamide levels are highest. Following the same experimental rationale,Moise et al. (2008) conrmed that URB597 in- hibited FAAH activity and led to elevated levels additional fatty acid amides (N-palmitoyl ethanolamine and in hamster brain.However, Cippitelli et al. (2008) have reported an elevation of anandamide levels in rats with URB597, which was found to reduce anxietyassociated with alcohol withdrawal. Blockade of the CB1 receptor with rimonabant induced anxiogenic-like behavior in the elevated plusmaze; URB597 induced anxiolytic-like effects in this assay. URB597 did not alter uncondi- tioned or conditioned social defeat or rotarodperformance. Enhancement of 2-AG levels produces similar effects. Sciolino et al. (2011) haveshown that enhancement of endocannabinoid signaling lipase anxiolytic effects under conditions of high environmental aversivenessin rats. Recently, two parallel publications indi- cated that the mice overexpressing the CB2 receptor showed lower anxiety-like behaviors in the open eld, the light-dark box, and the elevated plus maze tests, indicating that increased expression ofthe CB2 receptor signicantly modies the re- sponse to stress in these tests. Busquets-Garcia et al. (2011), using doses of URB597 andJZL184 that selectively modulated the concen- trations of anandamide and 2-AG, respectively, recorded similar anxiolytic-like effects in two behavioral paradigms. However, whereas the anxiolytic-like effects of URB597 were medi-ated through a CB1-dependent mechanism, the anxiolytic-like JZL184 were CB1 independent. The anxiolytic-like effectsof JZL184 were absent in CB2 knockout mice and were prevented by pretreatment with selective CB2 antagonists. These two 28 Mechoulam \u00b7Parker Annu. Rev.

PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 publications indicate the crucial role of the CB2 receptor on the modulation of anxiety. As activation of the CB2 receptor does not lead toundesirable psychoactivity, these observations may be of signicant clinical importance, and therefore the CB2 receptor represents a novel target to modulate anxiety-like responses. The protective effect of the CB2 receptor is in linewith our previous suggestion that this receptor is part of a general protective mechanism (Pacher & Mechoulam 2011). The molecular mechanism of the effect of endocannabinoids on anxiety is still to be fullyclaried. And \u00b4o et al. (2012) have conrmed considerable involvement of CB1 receptors in the effect of exo- and endocannabinoids on GABA efflux. However, they also found thatCB2-like receptors are likely involved. Hof- mann et al. (2011) have described a new form of cannabinoid-mediated modulation of synaptictransmission, so far in the dentate gyrus only. They report that anandamide action under certain conditions is not mediated by CB1 receptors, CB2 receptors, or vanilloid type I re- ceptors, and is still present in CB1 /animals. It would be of interest to determine whether this new pathway (through a receptor?) is involved in anxiety and depression. The endocannabinoid system plays a gate- keeper role with regard to activation of the hor-monal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)axis. Tonic endocannabinoid signaling con- strains HPA axis activity, ultimately habituat- ing the stress response and restoring home-ostasis. Specically, glucocorticoids produced in response to stress recruit endocannabinoids to increase the excitability of principal neu-rons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex; the principal neurons initi- ate inhibitory relays terminating HPA axis ac- tivation (Hill et al. 2011). However, follow- ing chronic stress, endocannabinoid signalingdownregulation is implicated in the overload of hormonal signaling that can result in anxi- ety and depression in humans. For an excellentreview of this literature, see Riebe & Wotjak (2011).The Endocannabinoid System, Neurogenesis, and Depression Hill et al. (2008) have summarized the results of the experimental work done on the endo- cannabinoid system and depression and have concluded that research so far supports the assumption that hypofunctional endocannabi-noid signaling contributes to depressive illness and that enhanced endocannabinoid signaling is associated with antidepressant efcacy.However, a hyperfunctional endocannabinoid system contributes to depression. This dis- crepancy was explained by showing that inthe animal model of depression that was used, endocannabinoid signaling was differentially altered in various brain areas. The antidepres-sive drug imipramine affected some, though not all, of these changes. In view of the excellent existing summary by Hill et al. (2008), in the present review we dis-cuss mainly the relation between cannabinoids, their two known receptors, and neurogenesis. A leading current hypothesis of depression is that is it is linked with neurogenesis. This hypothesisis based on the downregulation of neurogenesis in depressive-like behaviors in animals and on its upregulation by antidepressant treatments. Over the past few years, considerable data have indicated that the endocannabinoidsystem plays a central role in neurogenesis (forreviews, see Galve-Roperh et al. 2009, Oudin et al. 2011). It is established that CB1 mRNA is expressed in many regions of the developingbrain (Buckley et al. 1998), activation of CB1 is required for the axonal growth response (Williams et al. 2003), the endocannabinoidsystem drives neural progenitor cell prolifer- ation and cannabinoids actually promote neurogenesis (Berghuiset al. 2007). Reductions in adult neurogenesis were noted in CB1- and CB2-knockout mice (Aguado et al. 2006, Palazuelos et al. 2006). Jin et al. (2004) have reported that both CB1 and VR1 receptors are involved in adultneurogenesis. lipases (DAGLs), which and Brain 29 Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2013.64:21-47.

PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 involved in 2-AG synthesis, play a major role in axonal growth and guidance during development (Oudin et al. 2011). Harkanyand colleagues (Keimpema et al. 2010) have shown that the synthesizing enzymes (the DAGLs) alone are not sufcient to account for the growth effect of 2-AG, but both the DAGLs and the degradation enzyme, MGL,play a role. However, MGL is temporally and spatially restricted from the neurite tip, thus enhancing 2-AG activity during axonal growth.The CB2 receptor has recently been shown to promote neural progenitor cell proliferation via mTORC1 signaling (Palazuelos et al. 2012). Because depression decreases neurogenesis, the ndings summarized above are particularlyexciting, as they not only help us understandthe role of endocannabinoids as endogenous antidepressants but also suggest that synthetic endocannabinoid-like compounds may bedeveloped as a novel type of antidepressive drug. Onaivi et al. (2008a) and van Sickle et al. (2005) have reported that, contrary to previous reports, CB2 receptors are present in the brain.This unexpected discovery led several groups to investigate the relevance of this receptor in various brain pathological states. Thus, trans-genic mice overexpressing the CB2 receptor showed decreased depressive-like behaviors in several relevant assays. Also, contrary to wild-type mice, these transgenic mice showed no changes in BDNF gene and protein expression under stress (Garc \u00b4a-Guti \u00b4errez et al. 2010). The Onaivi group reported that in Japanese depressed subjects there is high incidence of a certain polymorphism in the CB2 gene (Onaiviet al. 2008b). Hu et al. (2009) compared the antidepressant action of the CB2 agonist GW405833 with the action of desipramine in two time immobility, contrary GW405833 had no effect in the swimming test.These results indicate that desipramine and cannabinoid drugs have different mechanisms in their antidepressive action.These results together indicate that as increased CB2 receptor expression reducesdepressive-related behaviors, apparently via amechanism that differs from the mode of ac- tion of most antidepressants used at present, the CB2 receptor could be a novel therapeutic target for depression. It will be of interest to es- tablish whether the activity of the CB2 receptorin depression is related to neurogenesis. CANNABINOIDS AND REWARD SYSTEMS Although the conditions under which cannabi- noid drugs have rewarding effects are more re- stricted than with other drugs of abuse (such as cocaine and heroin), when they producereward-related behavior, similar brain struc- tures are involved (for an excellent recent review, see Serrano & Parsons 2011). Rewarding/Aversive Effects of Cannabinoids In humans, marijuana produces euphoria, but dysphoria, dizziness, and anxiety are also re- ported, probably the result of the previously mentioned biphasic effects of THC. Follow-ing administration of THC to humans, some studies have shown increased dopamine trans- mission (Bossong et al. 2009) but others haveshown no change in dopamine transmission (Barkus et al. 2011) as measured by positron emission tomography. The endocannabinoidsystem may play a specic role in appreciation of rewards, as THC pretreatment attenuated the brain response to feedback of monetary re-wards as measured by functional magnetic res- onance imaging (fMRI) (van Hell et al. 2012). In animal models, early research suggested that THC was not rewarding to monkeys (Harris et al. 1974) when assessed in the drugself-administration paradigm. In rodents, some investigators have reported that THC (as well as other abused drugs such as cocaine)reduces the threshold for electrical brain stimulation reward (Gardner et al. 1988), but other investigators report that it increases the 30 Mechoulam \u00b7Parker Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2013.64:21-47. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Ohio State University Library on 12/30/18. For personal use only. PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 threshold (Vlachou et al. 2007). Unlike the self-administration paradigm, the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm can be usedto assess both the rewarding and the aversive effects of drugs. Conflicting ndings were reported in studies using the CPP paradigm with rodents. Early reports revealed that THC produced CPPs (Lepore et al. 1995), but otherreports showed conditioned place aversions (e.g., Mallet & Beninger 1998a, Parker & Gillies 1995) due to differing CPP procedures.Indeed, unlike other rewarding drugs, such as cocaine or heroin, low-dose pre-exposure to the effects of THC is necessary to establish aCPP in rodents (Valjent & Maldonado 2000). More recently, Tanda et al. (2000) have de- veloped a very sensitive and reliable methodof establishing self-administration in monkeys, which relies on the use of very low doses of THC but does not require pre-exposure to thedrug. In addition, both anandamide ( Justinova et al. 2005) and 2-AG ( Justinova et al. 2011) are self-administered by monkeys with or with- out a cannabinoid self-administration history, and both effects are prevented by pretreatmentwith rimonabant, indicating that the reward- ing effect is CB1 receptor mediated. Treatment with the FAAH inhibitor, URB597, shifts theanandamide self-administration dose-response curve to the left, such that anandamide has rewarding effects at lower doses ( Justinovaet al. 2008). However, URB597 is not self- administered by monkeys ( Justinova et al. 2008) and does not produce a CPP in rats (Gobbi et al.2005), possibly because it neither causes THC- like effects nor increases extracellular mesolim- bic DA levels in rats ( Justinova et al. 2008, Soli-nas et al. 2007). In contrast, DA is known to be released in the striatum by THC (Bossong et al. 2009). Cues associated with marijuana use also activate the reward neurocircuitry associ- ated with addiction in humans (Filbey of THC into the posterior ventral tegmental area (VTA) and into the posterior shell of the nucleus accum-bens (NAcc) serve as rewards for both self- administration and CPP in rats (Zangen et al. 2006).Cannabinoids and Relapse Treatment of addiction is often hindered by thehigh rate of relapse following abstinence from the addicting drug. Multiple factors such as ex- posure to drug-associated stimuli, drug prim- ing, and stress can precipitate drug craving and relapse in humans. In humans, alterations inthe CB1 receptor gene and in the FAAH gene have been shown to enhance fMRI activity in reward-related areas of the brain during expo-sure to marijuana cues (Filbey et al. 2010). Considerable recent research suggests that CB1 receptor antagonism (or inverse agonism)interferes with drug- and cue-induced relapse in animal models. Relapse is characterized by drug-seeking behavior in extinction triggeredby renewed exposure to drug-associated cues or a priming dose of a drug itself (Everitt & Robbins 2005). Such drug-seeking behaviorcontrasts with actual drug-taking behavior during the self-administration session. Ri- monabant prevents drug-associated cues from producing relapse following extinction training in rats and mice (De Vries & Schoffelmeer2005). Recent evidence suggests that rimona- bant is relatively more effective in interfering with drug-seeking behavior than drug-takingbehavior (De Vries & Schoffelmeer 2005). In an early report, the CB1 receptor agonist, HU- 210, was shown to reinstate cocaine seekingfollowing long-term extinction of cocaine self- administration (De Vries et al. 2001), an effect that was prevented by rimonabant. Of mosttherapeutic importance, however, was that rimonabant alone blocked drug seeking evoked by the cocaine-paired cues and by a priminginjection of cocaine, as well as seeking of heroin (De Vries et al. 2005, Fattore et al. 2003), methamphetamine (Anggadiredja et al. 2004),and nicotine (De Vries et al. 2005) evoked by drug-associated cues and by a priming injection of the drug itself. Therefore, blockade (or inverse agonism) of the CB1 receptor interferes generally with drug-seeking behavior. Drug-seeking behavior represents the in- centive motivational effects of addictive drugsunder control of the mesolimbic DA system. www.annualreviews.org The Endocannabinoid System and the Brain 31 Annu.

PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 The regulation of the primary rewarding ef- fects of drugs of abuse may be in part controlled by endocannabinoid release in the VTA, whichproduces inhibition of the release of GABA, thus removing the inhibitory effect of GABA on dopaminergic neurons (Maldonado et al. 2006). In the NAcc, released endocannabinoids act on CB1 receptors on axon terminals of glu-tamatergic neurons. The resulting reduction in the release of glutamate on GABA neurons that project to the VTA results in disinhibition ofthe VTA dopamine neurons. Blockade of CB1 receptors attenuates the release of DA in the NAcc in response to rewarding medial fore-brain bundle electrical stimulation (Trujillo- Pisanty et al. 2011). The prefrontal cortex and NAcc appear to play a primary role in the pre-vention of cue-induced reinstatement of heroin (Alvarez-Jaimes et al. 2008) and cocaine (Xi et al. 2006) seeking by CB1 antagonism. Although blockade of CB1 receptors affects cue- and drug-induced relapse, it does not ap-pear to affect cocaine seeking that is reinstated by exposure to mild footshock stress (De Vries et al. 2001). Indeed, stress-induced relapse toheroin or cocaine seeking is much more sen- sitive to manipulations of the corticotrophin- releasing factor and noradrenaline systems thanthe DA system (Shaham et al. 2000). For in- stance, infusion of noradrenergic antagonists into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis orthe central nucleus of the amygdala prevents footshock-induced but not cocaine-induced re- instatement of cocaine seeking (Leri et al.2002). Rimonabant showed great promise as an antirelapse treatment; however, as mentionedabove, it was removed from the European market as a treatment for obesity because of the undesirable side effects of anxiety. The generality of the effects of cannabinoids on motivational processes may explain these unde-sirable side effects. Given that rimonabant not only acts as a CB1 antagonist but is also a CB1 inverse agonist, the relapse-preventing proper-ties, and potentially the adverse side effects, may also be mediated by its inverse cannabimimetic effects that are opposite in direction from thoseproduced by cannabinoid receptor agonists (Pertwee 2005). Recent evidence suggests that at least some adverse side effects of CB1 recep-tor antagonists/inverse agonists seen in clinical trials (e.g., nausea) may reflect their inverse agonist properties (Bergman et al. 2008). It will be of interest to evaluate the potential of more newly developed CB1 receptor neutralantagonists, such as AM4113 (Sink et al. 2008), to prevent drug-seeking behavior. Recently, selective CB2 receptor agonists were shown CB1 receptor knockout mice but not in CB2 knockout mice. This effect was blocked by a selective CB2 re-ceptor antagonist. These ndings suggest modulate cocaine's ef- fects (Xi et al. 2011). Again, as mentioned above,the CB2 receptor seems to have general protec- tive properties (Pacher & Mechoulam 2011). Although considerable evidence indicates that antagonism of the CB1 receptor interferes with cue- and drug-induced relapse, there literature inhi- cannabidiol also relapse to drug seeking. FAAH inhibition has been selec-tively evaluated for prevention of nicotine seek- ing (Forget et al. 2009, Scherma et al. 2008). However, it is not clear if these effects are medi-ated by the action of anandamide or other fatty acids [oleoylethanalamide (OEA) receptors, because Mascia and colleagues (2011) recently showed that selective PPAR-agonists also counteract the reinstatement of nicotine seeking in rats and monkeys. Thus, elevations in fatty acids produced by block- ade of FAAH may have potential in treating relapse. Most recently, Cippitelli et al. (2011)found that FAAH inhibition reduced anxiety produced the nonpsychoactive compound in marijuana,also attenuated cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking as well as restored disturbances of glutamatergic and endocannabinoid systems 32 Mechoulam \u00b7Parker Annu.

PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 in the accumbens produced by heroin seeking (Ren et al. 2009). Apparently, in addition to the many other ailments that cannabidiol im-proves (Mechoulam et al. 2002), it may also be a potential treatment for heroin craving and relapse. CANNABINOIDS AND COGNITION Cognition involves the ability to acquire, store, and later retrieve new information. Several re-cent reviews are available on the effects of cannabis on cognition in humans and other animals (Akirav 2011, Marsicano & Lafenetre 2009, Ranganathan & D'Souza 2006, Riedel & Davies 2005). Clearly, the chief psychoac-tive component in cannabis, THC, produces acute cognitive disturbances in humans and an- imals, more profoundly affecting short-termthan long-term memory. Effects of Cannabis on Cognition in Humans When under the influence of THC, humans demonstrate transient impairment in short- term episodic and working memory and consol- idation of these short-term memories into long-term memory, but no impairment in retrieval of information once it has been previously en- coded into long-term storage (Ranganathan &D'Souza 2006). However, a recent naturalistic study revealed that cannabidiol prevented the memory-impairing effects of acute THC in hu-mans (Morgan et al. 2010). Therefore, the rel- ative THC/cannabidiol ratio in cannabis will profoundly modify the effects of cannabis onmemory in human marijuana smokers. The effect of chronic cannabis exposure on cognitive abilities of abstinent individuals is, however, controversial and fraught with contradictions in the literature. Polydrugabuse and pre-existing cognitive and emo- tional differences between cannabis users and nonusers make interpretation of the humanliterature problematical. In a review of the literature, Solowij & Battisti (2008) conclude that chronic exposure to marijuana is associatedwith dose-related cognitive impairments, most consistently in attention and working memory functions\u2014not dissimilar to those observedunder acute intoxication. On the other hand, several reports indicate that few, if any, cog- nitive impairments are produced by heavy cannabis use over several years (e.g., Dregan & Gulliford 2012, Lyketsos et al. 1999). Morerecently, a thorough review of the specic versus generalized effects of drugs of abuse on cognition (Fernandez-Serrano et al. 2011)reported that there has been only one study (Fried et al. 2005) of \"pure\" cannabis users. Fried et al. (2005) conducted a longitudinalexamination of young adults using neurocog- nitive tests that had been administered prior to the rst experience with marijuana smoke.Individuals were dened (by urination samples and self-reports) as light (fewer than ve times a week) or heavy (greater than ve times aweek) current or former (abstinent for at least three months) users. Current heavy users performed worse than nonusers in overall IQ, processing speed, and immediate and delayed memory tests. In contrast, former heavymarijuana smokers did not show any cognitive impairment. Fernandez-Serrano et al. (2011) conclude that the acute effects of cannabison prospective memory are attenuated in long-term abstinence (at least three months). Drawing conclusions from the human liter- ature is challenging (Ranganathan & D'Souza2006) because of widely differing methodolo- gies, including different tasks, lack of sufcientcontrols, participant selection strategies (only experienced cannabis users included in sam- ples), different routes of administration, dif-ferent doses administered, often small sample sizes, tolerance of and dependence on cannabi- noids, and the timing of the test (given the long half-life of THC). In addition, factors such as a predisposition to substance use in general mayconfer greater vulnerability to cannabis-related cognitive effects. Therefore, experimental in- vestigation of the effects of cannabinoids on var-ious processes involved in learning and memory rely heavily upon animal models. These mod- els provide insights into the critical role of the www.annualreviews.org The Endocannabinoid System and the Brain 33 Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2013.64:21-47.

PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 endocannabinoid system in the physiology of learning and memory. Effects of CB1 Agonists on Learning and Memory in Nonhumans Consistent with the human literature, most reports using animal models suggest that acute administration of CB1 agonists selectivelydisrupts aspects of short-term or working memory while leaving retrieval of previously learned memory (long-term or referencememory) largely intact. A common behavioral paradigm designed to evaluate these different aspects of memory is the delayed matching (ornonmatching) to sample (DMS) task. Once the animal has learned to perform this operant task (reference memory), it must then indicate(usually by pressing a bar) which test sample matches (or does not match) the original sample stimulus presented several seconds ear-lier (working memory). CB1 agonists (THC and WIN-55,212) disrupt accuracy of such performance in a delay-dependent manner, consistent with a selective disruption of work- ing memory (Heyser et al. 1993). These effectsare blocked by the CB 1antagonist rimonabant. It is important to note that these effects occur atdoses that do not interfere with the acquisitionof the original reference memory of the task. A simpler variant of the DMS procedure used in rodents, the spontaneous object recognitiontask, does not rely upon prior operant training, but instead relies upon a rodent's natural preference to explore novel objects. In thistask, a rat or mouse is allowed to spontaneously explore two identical objects, then after a delay is given a choice to explore a novel object orthe previously presented sample object. In this measure of short-term memory, CB1 agonists (WIN-55,212 and CP55,940) produced a delay-dependent decit in discrimination between the novel and familiar objects in thechoice task (O'Shea et al. 2004, Schneider & Koch 2002), with the disruptive effect enhanced 21 days after chronic pretreatment inadolescents but not adults (O'Shea et al. 2004). Spatial memory tasks also rely upon accu- rate working memory. A demanding spatialmemory task is the 8-arm radial maze, which requires rats to rst learn which arms contain food rewards (reference memory) and thento remember which arms have already been visited in a test session (working memory) after an imposed delay. THC increases the number of working memory errors (re-entries) at low doses, and these effects are blockedby rimonabant (Lichtman & Martin 1996). The impairment of working memory by THC (5 mg/kg) in adult rats is enhanced followingchronic exposure (once a day for 90 days), but disappears following 30 days of abstinence from the drug (Nakamura et al. 1991). On theother hand, adolescent rats treated with very high escalating doses of THC (2.5-10 mg/kg) chronically for 10 days and left undisturbed for30 days until their adulthood exhibited greater impairment in spatial working memory on the radial arm maze than did vehicle controls. Theworking memory decit was also accompanied by a decrease in hippocampal dendritic spine density and length (Rubino et al. 2009). The commonly employed spatial memory task, the Morris water maze, requires animalsto navigate in a pool of water to locate a hid- den platform by learning its location relative to salient visual cues. The water maze task can beused to evaluate the effect of cannabinoid ago- nists on reference memory (location of the plat- form remaining xed across days and on trialswithin a day) and working memory (location of platform is changed each day, but remains constant across trials within a day). In the wa-ter maze task, THC disrupts working memory at much lower doses than those that disrupt reference memory; in fact, doses sufcient todisrupt working memory are below those that produce other effects characteristic of CB1 ago- nism, including these mod-els, manipulations that elevate endogenous cannabinoids do not consistently produce such an impairment. On the one hand, elevation 34 Mechoulam \u00b7Parker Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2013.64:21-47. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org Access provided by Ohio State University Library on 12/30/18.

PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 of anandamide (by FAAH inhibition), but not 2-AG (by MGL inhibition), interfered with the consolidation of contextual conditionedfear and object recognition memory (Busquets- Garcia et al. 2001); on the other hand, sev- eral other studies have reported facilitation of working memory by FAAH inhibition (Campo- longo et al. 2009a, Mazzola et al. 2009, Varvelet al. 2007). Likewise, FAAH-decient mice (with tenfold increases in brain levels of anan- damide) also showed improved rather than im-paired performance in this task. Therefore, the effects of exogenously administered CB1 ago- nists are not always consistent with the effects ofmanipulations that elevate the natural ligands for the receptors. However, FAAH inhibition also elevates several other fatty acids, includingOEA and PEA, which are ligands for PPAR- . Mazzola et al. (2009) recently found that the enhanced acquisition of a passive avoidance task by the FAAH inhibitor, URB597, was not only reversed by a CB1 antagonist, but also by a PPAR- antagonist (MK 886). The PPAR- agonist (WAY1463) also enhanced passive avoidance performance, and this effect wasblocked by a PPAR- antagonist (Campolongo et al. 2009a). inhibition mayenhance not only by increasing anan-damide, but also by elevating OEA and PEA. Most recently, Pan et al. (2011) reported that MGL knockout mice, with elevated levels of 2-AG, show improved learning in an object recog- nition and water maze task. Thus, there is evi- dence that both anandamide and 2-AG enhancelearning and memory under some conditions. Effects of CB1 Antagonists on Learning and Memory in Nonhumans The ndings that CB1 agonists produce work- ing memory decits suggest that inhibition of these receptors may lead to enhancement ofshort-term memory. However, the literature is replete with mixed ndings. CB1 antagonist administration produces memory enhance-ment in mice in an olfactory recognition task (Terranova et al. 1996) and a spatial memory task in an 8-arm radial maze (Lichtman 2000).In addition, CB 1-/- mice are able to retain memory in an object recognition test for at least48 hours after the rst trial, whereas wild-typecontrols lose their capacity to retain memory after 24 hours (Reibaud et al. 1999). In contrast, studies using other paradigms, such as the DMS, have shown no benets of rimonabant on learning or memory (e.g., Hampson & Dead-wyler 2000, Mallet & Beninger 1998b). One explanation (Varvel et al. 2009) for the mixed ndings is that the temporal requirements ofthe task predict the potential of CB1 antago- nism to facilitate or not facilitate performance. Studies showing enhancement of memorygenerally require memory processes lasting minutes or hours, whereas studies showing that rimonabant is ineffective generally require re-tention of information lasting for only seconds, suggesting that blockade of CB1 receptors may prolong the duration of a memory ratherthan facilitate learning. If this is the case, then rimonabant may facilitate retention of mem- ories tested after long intervals but may have no benets in tasks such as DMS and repeated acquisition that require rapid relearning of newinformation (for review, see Varvel et al. 2009). Role of Endocannabinoids in the Hippocampus in Learningand Memory The decrement in working memory by cannabinoids appears to involve their action at the hippocampus. The hippocampus is one ofthe areas of the brain with the highest density of CB1 receptors, and large amounts of anan- damide are found in the rodent hippocampus.Interestingly, the selective detrimental effect of CB1 agonists on working memory (but not reference memory) resembles the effects of hip- pocampal lesions on these two forms of memory (Hampson & Deadwyler 2000, Heyser et al.1993). Furthermore, THC-induced decits in the DMS paradigm are associated with specic decreases in ring of individual hippocampalneurons during the sample but not the match part of the experiment (Heyser et al. 1993).

In contrast, intrahippocam- pal AM251 also has been shown to disrupt memory consolidation of an inhibitory avoid-ance task (de Oliveira et al. 2005). Recent work suggests that the cannabinoid and the choliner- gic systems in the hippocampus interact duringperformance of a short-term memory task in the rat (Goonawardena et al. 2010). These ef- fects may be mediated by cannabinoid-induceddecreases in acetylcholine release in the hip- pocampus. Acetylcholine is also implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's diseaseand other disorders associated with declined cognitive function. Overall, the literature implicates changes in hippocampal functioning as the source ofworking memory decits produced by THC, although other brain regions are currently being investigated as well (Marsicano & Lafen- etre 2009). Cannabinoid receptors localizedto different brain regions modulate distinct learning and memory processes, such that the role of endocannabinoids in other regions maybe different than their role in the hippocampus. In fact, Campolongo et al. (2009b) showed that infusion of CB1 agonist WIN 55,212,2 into thebasolateral amygdala actually enhanced con- solidation of inhibitory avoidance learning by enhancing the action of glucocorticoids in thisregion. Consistently, Tan et al. (2011) found that delivery of a CB1 antagonist to this region interferes with olfactory fear conditioning. Thedifferential effects of CB1 agonists on different brain regions may account for different nd- ings reported between systemic and localized administration of cannabinoid agonists. Long-term changes in synaptic strength are believed to underlie associative memory for-mation in the hippocampus and amygdala. The impairments in working memory produced byCB1 agonists may be the result of the suppres- sion of glutamate release in the hippocampus, which is responsible for the establishment oflong-term potentiation, a putative mechanism for synaptic plasticity (Abush 2010, Shen et al. 1996). Retrograde signaling byendocannabinoids results in suppression of neurotransmitter release at excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) synapses in the hippocampus in a short- and a long-term manner. Endocannabinoid-inducedlong-term depression (LTD) is one of the best examples of presynaptic forms of long-term plasticity. Recent evidence indicates that presy-naptic activity coincident with CB1 receptor activation and NMDA receptor activation is required for some forms of endocannabinoidLTD. The long-lasting effects of LTD appear to be mediated by a CB1 receptor-induced reduction of cAMP/PKA activity in thehippocampus (Heifets & Castillo 2009). Endocannabinoid Modulation of Extinction of Aversive Memory Avoidance of aversive stimuli is crucial for survival of all animals and is highly resistant to extinction. Considerable evidence indicatesthat the endogenous cannabinoid system is specically involved in extinction learning of aversively motivated learned behaviors(Marsicano et al. 2002, Varvel & Lichtman 2002). A seminal paper by Marsicano et al. (2002) reported that CB1 knockout mice andwild-type mice administered the CB1 antago- nist showed impaired extinction in tests, withunaffected memory acquisition and consolida- tion. This effect appeared to be mediated by blockade of elevated anandamide in the baso-lateral amygdala during extinction (Marsicano et al. 2002). Using the Morris water maze task, Varvel & Lichtman (2002) reported that CB1 knockout mice and wild-type mice exhibited identical acquisition rates in learning to swimto a xed platform; however, the CB1-decient mice demonstrated impaired extinction of the originally learned task when the location of thehidden platform was moved to the opposite side of the tank.

PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 in suppressing previously learned behaviors, CB1 agonists would be expected to facilitate extinction of learned behaviors in nondecientanimals. Indeed, WIN-55,212 facilitated ex- tinction of contextual fear memory and spatial memory in rats (Pamplona et al. 2006). The effect of enhancing the endogenous levels of anandamide by blocking its reuptake orby inhibiting FAAH during extinction learning has also recently been investigated. Chhatwal et al. (2005) reported that the reuptake AM404 selectively facil- itated extinction of fear-potentiated startle in rats, an effect that was reversed by rimonabantpretreatment. Varvel et al. (2007) reported that mice decient in FAAH, either by genetic deletion (FAAH /) or by pharmacological inhibition, displayed both faster acquisition and extinction of spatial memory tested in the Morris water maze; rimonabant reversed theeffect of FAAH inhibition during both task phases. These effects appear to be specic to extinction of aversively motivated behavior, be- cause neither CB1-decient mice (Holter et al. 2005) nor wild-type mice treated with rimona-bant (Niyuhire et al. 2007b) displayed a decit in extinction of operant responding reinforced with food. Most recently, Manwell et al. (2009)found that the FAAH inhibitor URB597 promoted extinction of a conditioned place aversion produced by naloxone-precipitatedmorphine withdrawal but did not pro- mote extinction of a morphine-induced or amphetamine-induced CPP. It has been well established that extinction is not unlearning, but instead is new inhibitorylearning that interferes with the originallylearned response (Bouton 2002). The new learning responsible for extinction of aversive learning appears to be facilitated by activation of the endocannabinoid system and prevented by inhibition of the endocannabinoid system.More recent work has suggested that the apparent effects of manipulation of the endo- cannabinoids on extinction may actually reflectits effects on reconsolidation of the mem- ory that requires reactivation (Lin et al. 2006, Suzuki et al. 2008). That is, every time a consol-idated memory is recalled it switches to a labile state and is subject to being disrupted. Depend- ing upon the conditions of retrieval and thestrength of the original trace, these reactivated memories can undergo two opposing processes: reconsolidation, when the conditions favor the permanence of the trace, or extinction, when the conditions indicate that the memory hasno reason to persist. Suzuki et al. (2008) have proposed that the endocannabinoid system is important for the destabilization of reactivatedcontextual fear memories; that is, reconsolida- tion or extinction relies on a molecular cascade (protein synthesis and cAMP response element-binding-dependent transcription) that is im- peded by prior blockade of the CB1 receptors. Fear memory cannot be altered during resta-bilization if it was not previously destabilized via activation of the CB1 receptor. Whatever the actual mechanism for facilitated extinctionof aversive memories with activation of the en- docannabinoid system and inhibited extinction with inhibition of the endocannabinoid system, these results have considerable implications for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder.Progress in enhancing endocannabinoid sig- naling will be of great benet in the treatment of this distressing disorder. CONCLUSIONS Cannabinoid research was originally initiatedwith the limited aim of understanding the action of an illicit drug. After the chemistry of the plant and the pharmacological and psycho-logical actions of THC were elucidated\u2014or actually only assumed to be elucidated\u2014in the 1960s and early 1970s, research in the eldwaned. However, over a decade starting from the mid-1980s, two specic receptors and their ligands\u2014the bases of the endocannabinoid system\u2014were found to be involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes. Thisendocannabinoid system has opened new vistas in the life sciences, particularly in aspects associated with the CNS. One of the main results of activation of the presynaptic CB1 receptor is inhibition of neu-rotransmitter release.

PS64CH02-Mechoulam ARI 8 November 2012 8:45 endocannabinoids reduce excitability of presy- naptic neurons. CB1 receptors are responsible for the well-known marijuana effects as well asfor effects on cognition, reward, and anxiety. In contrast, a major consequence of CB2 receptor activation is immunosuppression, which limits inflammation and associated tissue injury. En- hancement of CB2 receptor expression and/orof endocannabinoid levels has been noted in numerous diseases, including CNS-related ones. Thus, a main result of CB2 receptoractivation seems to be a protective effect in a large number of physiological systems. In the present review we have summarized evidence that cannabinoids modulate anxiety,brain reward function, and cognition by act- ing at CB1 (and possibly CB2) receptors in dis-tinct brain regions. The effects of cannabis on anxiety appear to relate to the dose of THC and are modulated by the anxiolytic action ofcannabidiol (if present in the plant material). A major function of the endocannabinoid system is the homeostatic regulation of the HPA axis in response to stressors. Although THC does not appear to be as rewarding as other drugsof abuse (cocaine, heroin, amphetamine) in an- imal models of drug abuse, recent work sug- gests that under optimal conditions, animals doself-administer THC. The rewarding effects of THC are mediated by elevation of DA in the mesolimbic DA system. Blockade of CB1 recep-tors in this system interferes with the potential of drugs or drug-related cues (but not stress) to produce relapse in animal models. Both the animal and human literatures suggest that CB1 agonists interfere withshort-term working memory and may interferewith consolidation of these memories into long-term memories while leaving previously learned long-term reference memory intact. In cannabis, these effects of THC may be pre- vented by a sufciently high dose of cannabid-iol. In addition, the memory-impairing effects of THC are usually limited to the acute effects of the drug itself. Recent literature suggeststhat the endocannabinoid system may play an especially important role in the extinction of aversively motivated learning. Treatmentsthat amplify the action of endocannabinoids may play a critical role in treating posttrau- matic stress disorder in the future. Memorydecline in aging may also be protected by the action of the endocannabinoid system. Mice lacking CB1 receptors showed accelerated age-dependent decits in spatial learning as well as a loss of principal neurons in thehippocampus, which was accomplished by neu- roinflammation (Albayram et al. These exciting ndings CB1 receptorson hippocampal GABAergic neurons protect against age-dependent cognitive declines. In addition, interesting recent work suggests thatcannabidiol reduces microglial activity after -amyloid administration in mice and prevents the subsequent spatial learning impairment (Martin-Moreno et al. 2011), suggesting that this nonpsychoactive compound in marijuana may be useful in treating Alzheimer's disease.Cannabidiol has also been shown to recover memory loss in iron-decient mice, a model of neurogenerative disorders (Fagherazzi et al. 2012). A very large number of anandamide-like compounds, namely FAAAs or chemicallyrelated entities, have been found in the brain (Tan et al. 2010). The action of very few ofthem has been evaluated. However, those that have been investigated show a variety of effects. Arachidonoyl serine has vasodilator activity\u2014an important protective property in some brain diseases\u2014and lowers the damage caused by head injury (Cohen-Yeshurun et al. 2011).Surprisingly, this effect is blocked by CB2 antagonists, although this compound does not bind to the CB2 receptor. Apparently, its actionis indirectly CB2 related. Oleoyl serine, which is antiosteoporotic, is also found the brain (Smoum et al. 2010); oleoylethanolamide reg- ulates feeding and (Fu shows apoptotic activity(Maccarrone et al. 2002); the anti-inflammatory palmitoylethanolamide may also be protective in human (Naccarato et al. 2010); arachi-donoyl glycine is Annu.

Presumably, the additional many dozens of related endoge-nous molecules found in the brain will also exhibit a wide spectrum of activities. Why does the brain invest so much synthetic endeavor (and energy) to prepare such a large cluster of related molecules rather than just a few ofthem? If subtle chemical disparity is one of the causes for the variability in personality\u2014anarea in psychology that is yet to be fully understood\u2014we may have to look for a large catalog of compounds in the brain withdistinct CNS effects. Is it possible that theabove-described large cluster of chemically related anandamide-type compounds in the brain is related to the chemistry of the humanpersonality and the individual temperamental differences? It is tempting to assume that the huge possible variability of the levels and ratios of substances in such a cluster of compounds may allow an innite number of individualdifferences, the raw substance which of course is sculpted by experience. The known variants of CB1 and FAAH genes (Filbey et al. 2010,Lazary et al. 2010) may also play a role in these differences. If this intellectual speculation is shown to have some factual basis, it may leadto major advances in molecular psychology.

ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION Anxiogenic-like effects of chronic cannabidiol administration in rats Maha M. ElBatsh &N. Assareh &C. A. Marsden & D. A. Kendall 13 June 2011 /Accepted: 28 October 2011 /Published online: 15 November 2011 #Springer-Verlag 2011 Abstract Rational Several pre-clinical and human-based studies have shown that acutely administered cannabidiol (CBD) can produce anxiolytic-like effects Objectives The present study investigated the effects of chronic administration of CBD on rat behaviour and on the expression of brain proteins. Methods Male Lister-hooded rats (150 -200 g, n=8 per group) received daily injections of CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14 days. The rats were subjected to two behavioural tests:locomotor activity and conditioned emotional response (CER). The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor cyclicAMP response element binding protein activation(CREB) and phospho-CREB were determined in brain regions such as the frontal cortex and hippocampus using Western immunoblotting. Results CBD significantly increased the time spent freezing in the CER test with no effect on locomotor activity. CBD significantly reduced BDNF expression in thehippocampus and frontal cortex with no change in the striatum. In addition, CBD significantly reduced TrkB expression in the hippocampus with a strong trendtowards reduction in the striatum but had no effect inthe frontal cortex. In the hippocampus, CBD had noeffect or but in the frontal cortex, CBD significantly reduced phospho-ERK1/2 expression without affecting total ERK. Conclusion Chronic administration of CBD produced an anxiogenic-like effect in clear opposition to the acute anxiolytic profile previously reported. In addition, CBD decreased the expression of proteins that have been shownto be enhanced by chronic treatment with antidepressant/ anxiolytic including the main psychoactive component, 9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( 2001 ; Mechoulam and Hanus 2002 ). Although the relative amounts of phytocannabinoids in cannabis preparations are highly variable, the content of CBD can exceed that of THC, in cannabis resin for example (Potter etal.2008 ). CBD represents one of the most promising candidates for clinical utilisation, in a variety of conditions,due to its lack of cognitive and psychoactive actions and itsexcellent tolerability in humans (Mechoulam and Hanus 2002 ). Retrospective studies in cannabis users and small clinical trials have shown that moderate recreational or medicinal use of cannabis in humans results in mood elevation with a reduction in stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms (Gruber et al. 1996 ; Williamson and EvansM. M. ElBatsh :N. Assareh :C. A. Marsden :D. A. Kendall School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Nottingham Medical School,Queen 's Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK M. M. ElBatsh ( *) Clinical ), some of these effects have been attributed to CBD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear, and several mechanisms of actionshave been proposed for CBD, including diffuse targets within the endocannabinoid system (Bisogno et al. 2001 ), inhibition of catechol- McPartland 2003 ), activation of serotonergic (5HT1A) receptors (Russo et al. 2005 ), transient type V1 (TRPV1) (Bisogno etal.2001) and V2 (TRPV2) (Qin et al. enhancement of adenosinergic signalling (Carrier et al.2006 ). CBD, unlike 9-THC, has very low affinity for either cannabinoid CB1 or CB2 receptors (Petitet et al. 1998 ), but it has been shown to block the transport of anandamide, the archetypal endocannabinoid ligand (Bisogno et enzymatic hydrolysis (Mechoulam and Hanus 2002 ). Thus, the action of CBD could involve other cannabinoid receptors such as theabnormal cannabidiol receptor, a non-CB1/non-CB2 receptor (Franklin and Stella 2003 ; Jarai et al. 1999). Actions of CBD at GPR55, an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, either as an agonist or antagonist have also been described (Oka et al. 2007 ;R y b e r ge ta l . 2007). Acute anxiolytic properties of CBD have been demonstrated in several preclinical studies that employed various paradigms such as the Vogel conflict test(Moreira et al. 2006), the elevated plus maze (Guimaraes et al. 1990) and fear conditioning (Lemos et al. 2010; Resstel et al. 2006). Recently, antidepressant-like effects have also been reported in mice following acute CBD administration (Zanelati et al. 2010 ). However, the effects of repeated CBD administration on affective behaviours in pre-clinical tests have not been reported. The neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), has been implicated in a variety of affectivedisorders including anxiety and depression (Bergami et al.2009 ; Martinowich et al. 2007). Multiple classes of antidepressant drugs, as well as electroconvulsive shock treatment, can significantly increase BDNF messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Duman and Monteggia 2006;N i b u y a et al. 1995 ). This neurotrophin is thought to enhance neurogenesis (Li et al. 2008) via its receptor, tyrosinekinase B (TrkB), which response element binding protein activation (CREB) is one of the long-term transcriptional modulators that is thought to mediate the effects of antidepressants on BDNF expression (Malberg and Blendy2005 ). The effects of repeated CBD administration on the expression and function of these signalling proteins areunknown.Aim of the work In order to assess the therapeutic potential of CBD for the treatment of affective disorders, it is necessary to understand the effects of repeated administration. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesisthat repeated CBD administration would induce anxiolytic-like effects in aversive conditioned rats and modify the expression of proteins in the brain that havebeen associated with chronic antidepressant/anxiolytic drug treatments . Material and methods Animals Male Lister-hooded rats (150 -200 g, n=16) were obtained from the Biomedical Sciences Unit, University of Nottingham (a colony derived from Charles River UK stock). Animals were housed in groups of four and maintainedon a 12/12-h light/dark cycle, temperature was maintained at 22\u00b12\u00b0C and relative humidity 40 -60%. Animals had free access to standard rat laboratory chow and water. All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 and Local Ethical Committee Approval. Drugs and treatmentPure crystalline CBD (99.3% by HPLC with no other phytocannabinoids detectable) was a generous gift from GWPharmaceuticals. It was dissolved in a vehicle of 3:1:16 solution of ethanol/Tween 80/0.9% saline. The rats received daily i.p. injections of vehicle or CBD (10 mg/kg) for14 days ( n=8 per group). The dose of CBD was selected on the basis of other studies that reported effects of the drug inanimal models of anxiety (Moreira et al. 2009 ;Moreira et al. 2006 ;Ov i e d oe ta l . 1993 ; Resstel et al. 2009 ; Resstel et al. 2006 ). Moreover, this dose of CBD (10 mg/kg) was reported to induce an anxiolytic-like effect after acute administration(Moreira et al. 2006 ; Resstel et al. 2006 ). CBD and vehicle solutions were prepared immediately before use and injectedintraperitoneally (i.p.) in a volume of 1 ml/kg. Procedures Physiological measurements Body weight and food consumption were measured daily throughout the experiment. Each cage housed four rats, and the average amounts of chow consumed per rat per day were determined.240 Psychopharmacology (2012) 221:239 -247Locomotor activity Locomotor behaviour was recorded for 20 min on the third and ninth days of the experiment in a sound-isolated room (Fig. 1). The rats were habituated to the activity boxes (40\u00d7 24\u00d725 cm, clear acrylic) for 1 h on the second day. The activity boxes were cleaned with 20% ( v/v) ethanol after removal of rats. Spontaneous locomotor activity, in terms oftotal distance moved (cm), mean velocity (cm/s) andrearing frequency, was recorded using Ethovision software [Ethovision (version 2.0), Noldus Information Technology, Costerweg, and The Netherlands]. The duration of periodsof rearing and grooming was scored manually. Conditioned emotional response testingThe conditioned emotional response (CER) has been used as a model of conditioned aversion in order to evaluate theanxiolytic effects of several classes of drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Inoue et al. 1996 ) and benzodiazepines (Li et al. 2001 ). A conditioned fear response to a context is produced by exposing the animal toan environment (context) where an aversive or unpleasant stimulus (mild foot shock) is delivered (Rudy et al. 2004 ). Re-exposure to the same context induces conditioned fearresponses, such as freezing behaviour. The test consisted of two phases: conditioning on the 10th day and testing on the 11th day (Fig. 1). Rats were individually conditioned on the 10th day of the experimentby exposure to inescapable foot shock. Rats were subjected to 0.4 mA of footshock for 1 s every minute for 10 min in a shock chamber with a metal grid floor. This chamber hadPerspex walls (26\u00d723\u00d739 cm) with 21 stainless steel rods spaced 1.5 cm apart as the floor, and this was and connected to a shock generator (Campden Instruments,Loughbrough, UK). Twenty-four hours after the last shock session, the rats were again placed in the shock chamber for 10 mins but without shocks, and freezing behaviour wasmeasured. Freezing was defined as the complete absence of movement, except respiration, while the animal assumed a characteristic tense posture. The chamber was cleaned with20% ( v/v) ethanol before and after use (Finn et al. 2004a ). The tests were all carried out between 0900 and 1300hours. Western immunoblotting Rats were killed on day 15 of the experiment by a blow to the head followed by decapitation, and their brains were removed rapidly. The meninges were removed and brainregions dissected on ice and stored at 80\u00b0C. The expression of various proteins was measured in thehippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum.Sample preparation A volume of lysis buffer [20 mM Tris, 1 mM EGTA, 320 mM 0.1% X100, 1 mMNaF and 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate dissolved in500 ml distilled water (pH 7 .6) containing protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Sigma, UK)] was added basedon the weights of frontal cor tical samples to give a final concentration of 100 mg/ml. Samples were kept on ice through the assay all the time. The samples were homogenised by hand and mixed (rotating mixer) in acold room for 10 min. The sa mples were centrifuged at 13,000\u00d7 gfor 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was r e m o v e d ,a n dt h eL o w r yt e s t( L o w r ye ta l .1951)w a sperformed to measure the protein concentrations in each sample. Laemmli solubilisa tion buffer (2\u00d7) was added to the samples to give a 1:2 dilution, then the protein concentration was adjusted using volumes of lysis buffer calculated from the protein assay. The samples were a s s a y e di m m e d i a t e l yo rs t o r e da t 20\u00b0C until needed. For CREB and phospho-CREB assays, the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer to (SDS-PAGE) were prepared in concentrations suitable for running different proteins, e.g. 15% SDS-PAGE were used to run A layer of 4% gel (stacking gel) was added to the top of the running gel, and the comb was then placed into thegel to prepare ten wells. Based on preliminary studies, 20 -50g of protein was loaded onto each lane of the SDS gels. The gels were run in 1\u00d7 running buffer [Tris (30.3 g), glycine (144 g) and SDS (10g) dissolved in 1 L distilled water] at 200 V for 45 min using the Bio-Rad apparatus. A standard marker of known molecular weight (Bio-Rad laboratories Ltd, UK) was run alongside. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper in the transfer buffer; Tris (30.3 g), glycine (144 g) and weredissolved in distilled water. Methanol (2 L) was added, then made up to 10 L with distilled water using the Bio-Radapporatus at 100 V for 60 min at 4\u00b0C. Protein transfer was checked by adding a few drops of Ponceaus solution (Sigma, UK). The solution can be rapidly removed bywashing with Milli-Q water th en Tris-buffered saline- Tween 25 indistilled water, pH 7.6).The blots were blocked with 5%fat-free dried milk powder in TBST for 60 min using a platform shaker (Stuart Scientific, UK). The specific primary antibodies for different proteins were prepared in 5% milk in TBST.

Behavioural effects of repeated administration of CBD Locomotor activity The locomotor activity test was performed twice to detect any changes in locomotor activity over the course of CBD treatment. The first test was on the third day of drug injection, and the second was on the ninth day of treatment. CBD had no effect on total distance moved [ t(14)=1.4; P=0.18] or velocity [ t(14)=1.4; P=0.18] on the third day. This lack of effect of CBD on total distance [ t(14)=0.04; P=0.97] and velocity [ t(14)=0.04; P=0.97] continued to the ninth day.

Discussion The phytocannabinoid CBD, which is one of the most abundant bioactive components of the cannabis plant, has been reported to have an acute anxiolytic effect in both animals and humans (Crippa et al. 2004 ; Lemos et al. 2010 ; Moreira et al. 2006 ; Zuardi et al. 1982 ). More recently, CBD has also been shown to have an acute antidepressant-like effect, via the activation of 5-HT1A receptors, in amouse forced-swimming test (Zanelati et al. 2010 ) without changing activity in the open field. In the present study, no change in body weight was detected after administration of CBD for 14 days. On the contrary, Ignatowska-Jankowska et al. ( 2011 ) reported that repeated administration of CBD (2.5 and 5 mg kg 1day1)for 14 days decreased the body weight gain of rats. This variance from the present study 's findings may be related to the difference in species or dose of CBD used. In the present study, the locomotor activity of the rats in a neutral environment was measured to detect any hypoactivity or changes in rearing and grooming hyper- activity associated with CBD treatment that couldinterfere with the interpretation of behavioural changes in the CER test. The administration of CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p. for 14 days) failed to affect the rats 'spontaneous locomotor activity. This resu lt is in agreement with Wiley et al. ( 2005 ) and Finn et al. ( 2004b) who reported that acute administration of CBD had no effect on locomotor activity of mice or rats respectively. Rearing and grooming were examined as markers of anxiety-related behaviour as increased self-grooming in ratsis frequently observed after the application of mild stressors, such as novelty or handling of the animals(van Erp et al. 1994 ). Anxiolytic drugs attenuate the increase in grooming induced by a novel environmentwithout significantly affecting general locomotor activity, Fig. 7 Effect of chronic administration of CBD on protein expression ofaERK 1/2 and bp-ERK 1/2 in the frontal cortex.

In the present study, there were no differences in rearing and grooming between the treatment groups in agreementwith Finn et al. ( 2004b ), who found that rearing and grooming were unaltered by acute administration of a lower dose of CBD (5 mg/kg). In the CER test, however, the rats were exposed to an environment paired previously with inescapable electricfoot shock, which results in a well-characterised freezing response. The duration of freezing has been used as an index of induced fear and anxiety (Fanselow 1980 ), and a number of anxiolytic drugs decrease the duration of freezing (Hashimoto et al. 1996 ; Inoue et al. 1996 ). Resstel et al. ( 2006 ) observed that acute injection of CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the freezing time inconditioned rats, and Bitencourt et al. ( 2008 ) reported that CBD facilitated conditioned fear extinction in rats, which might contribute to the anti-anxiogenic effect detected in the same study. In the present study, it was hypothesised that CBD would induce an anxiolytic-like effect in the CERtest in the form of reduced conditioned freezing. However, on the contrary, repeated CBD administration significantly increased the time spent in freezing behaviour indicating an anxiogenic-like effect after chronic administration. There were some differences in methodology between the present study and those previously reporting anxiolytic effects. For example, rats were individually housed in the study of Resstel et al. ( 2006 ), while they were group housed in the present study. There were also differences the conditioning protocols in that the rats received six 2.5 mA foot shocks in the study of Resstel et al. ( 2006 ) and ten 0.4 mA shocks in the present study. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that the qualitative differences in behavioural outcomes between acute and chronic administration ofCBD could be explained by relatively minor variations in methodology. It is noteworthy that the anxiolytic effect of CBD in humans has only been reported after acuteadministration (Zuardi et al. 2006 ). Long et al. ( 2009 ), however, demonstrated that chronic daily administration of CBD to male adult C57BL/6JArcmice for 21 days produced moderate anxiolytic-like effects in the open-field test at 50 mg/kg and in the light -dark test at a low dose (1 mg/kg). This variance from the present study 's findings may be related to the species used, the behavioural test employed or the dose and duration of CBDadministration. For example, in the study of Magen et al.(2009 ) the optimal dose of CBD for cognitive enhancement in the bile duct ligation model was 5 mg/kg over a 4-weekperiod, while 1 and 10 mg/kg were ineffective. Thisindicates a complex dose -response relationship for CBD, at least in this model, which complicates interpretation ofinter-study differences. Although the dose of CBD used inthe present study was reported to induce an anxiolytic-like effect after acute administration in previous studies (Moreira et al. 2006; Resstel et al. 2006 ), a biphasic effect of CBD was reported in other studies (Guimaraes et al.1990 ; Kwiatkowska et al. 2004; Malfait et al. 2000; Rock et al. 2008), which emphasises the need for additional long-term m ulti-dose studies. The neurotrophic hypothesis of depression (Nestler et al. 2002 ) suggests that BDNF is reduced in depression and increased by many antidepressant/anxiolytic treatments. Wehypothesised that CBD might increase expression of BDNF protein, its receptor (TrkB) or the downstream mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAP K) signalling protein cascade (ERK). This is, of course, relevant to potential anxiolyticactions of CBD since antidepressant drugs are the first linetherapy for long-term anxiety (Dell 'Osso et al. 2010 ). We focused on the hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum asthese brain areas may be dysfunctional in affective disorder(Kennedy et al. 1997 ; Sheline 2000 ). However, in the present study, Western immunoblotting showed that chronicadministration of CBD significantly decreased BDNF expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex while having no effect on BDNF levels in the striatum. Moreover, CBD also significantly reduced TrkB expression in the hippocampus with a strong trend towards a decrease in the striatum but with no effect in the frontal cortex. Magen etal. (2009 ) reported that chronic administration of CBD (5 mg/kg) for 4 weeks to female Sabra mice had no BDNF et ( 2010 ) reported that acute administration of CBD (30 mg/kg) did not affect BDNF expression in the mouse hippocampus, although it showed an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test. Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic antidepressant treatment increases the expression ofCREB in limbic regions of rat brain (Nibuya et al. 1996 ). CREB in its phosphorylated form is a transcription factor that mediates the actions of intracellular messengers on gene expression. The function of CREB is regulated largely by phosphorylation at Ser 133, which results in activation of gene transcription (Thome et al. 2000). CREB activation could alter the expression of specificgene products involved in the modulation of anxiety, suchas BDNF and could, thereby, underlie some of the effects of antidepressant treatment o n long-term anxiety. Since the phosphorylation of CREB may be mediated by the MAPK pathway through the phosphorylation of ERK and TrkB signals, at least partly, through MAPK activation, we f o c u s e do u ra t t e n t i o no nt h ee f f e c t so fC B Do np - C R E Band p-ERK induction. In the present study, CBD had no effect on CREB expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus or p-Psychopharmacology (2012) 221:239 -247 245CREB cortex, while in the hippocampus, p-CREB was undetectable. With respect to ERK and p-ERK, CBD significantly reduced p-ERK1/2in the frontal cortex without affecting total ERK1/2 expression, and there was no apparent change in ERK1/2 or p-ERK2 expression in the hippocampus. Given the pleiotropic effects of cannabidiol, it is difficult to propose a straightforwa rd molecular mechanism to explain the effects of the drug on the expression ofthese proteins, but, although no direct assessments of neurogenesis were made in these animals, the combined negative effects of cannabidiol on BDNF and BDNF-related signalling proteins would certainly not be consistent with the enhance d neurogenesis reported for clinically effective antidepressants/anxiolytics and would probably predict the opposite. Conclusion The data presented indicate an anxiogenic-like profile of behaviour in normal healthy rats following repeated CBD administration. This was accompanied by reductions in the expression of the neurotrophin BDNF and related signallingproteins, and, overall, the results are not consistent with the potential clinical anxiolytic properties suggested by acute experiments with CBD. This emphasises the need for additional long-term multi-dose studies of the drug in models of affective disease.

The aim of the present study was to investigate this using functional neuroimaging. Regional cerebral blood flow(rCBF) was measured at rest using 99mTc-ECD SPECT in 10 healthy male volunteers, randomly divided into two groups of five subjects. Each subject was studied on two occasions, 1 week apart. In the first session, subjects were given an oral dose of CBD (400 mg) orplacebo, in a double-blind procedure. SPECT images were acquired 90 min after drug ingestion. The Visual Analogue Mood Scale wasapplied to assess subjective states. In the second session, the same procedure was performed using the drug that had not beenadministered in the previous session. Within-subject between-condition rCBF comparisons were performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). CBD significantly decreased subjective anxiety and increased mental sedation, while placebo did not induce significant changes. Assessment of brain regions where anxiolytic effects of CBD were predicted a priori revealed two voxel clusters of significantly decreased ECD uptake in the CBD relative to the placebo condition ( po0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). These included a medial temporal cluster encompassing the left amygdala-hippocampal complex, extending into the hypothalamus, and a second cluster inthe left posterior cingulate gyrus. There was also a cluster of greater activity with CBD than placebo in the left parahippocampal gyrus(po0.001). These results suggest that CBD has anxiolytic properties, and that these effects are mediated by an action on limbic and paralimbic brain areas.Neuropsychopharmacology (2004) 29,417-426, Cannabis sativa (Grlie, 1976) and has quite different psychological effects to the plant's best known constituent, D9-tetrahy- drocannabinol (D9-THC) (Perez-Reyes et al, 1973; Zuardi et al , 1982). In particular, in animal studies CBD has effects similar to anxiolytic drugs in conditioned emotional paradigms (Zuardi and Karniol, 1983), the Vogel conflicttest (Musty et al , 1984), and the elevated plus maze test (Guimaraes et al, 1990; Onaivi et al , 1990). Using the latter test, anxiolytic effects were also reported for three derivates of CBD, HU-219, HU-252, and HU-291 (Guimaraes et al, 1994). In humans, oral administration of CBD in healthy volunteers attenuates the anxiogenic effect of D9-tetrahy- drocannabinol (D9-THC) (Zuardi et al , 1982). This effect does not seem to involve any pharmacokinetic interactions(Agurell et al , 1981; Zuardi et al , 1982), and CBD does not bind to the central known cannabinoid receptor, CB 1, (Bisogno et al, 2001; Mechoulam et al , 2002) and hence cannot be a competitive antagonist (Howlett et al, 1992). CBD may thus possess inherent anxiolytic properties unrelated to THC-type activity. This is consistent with its anxiolytic effect on anxiety elicited by simulated publicspeaking (Zuardi et al, 1993a). As the receptors that mediate the psychological effects of CBD are unknown, its mechanism of action on the brain isunclear. The aim of the present study was to use functional Online publication: 29 September 2003 at http://www.acnp.org/ citations/Npp09290303172/default.pdfReceived 22 April 2003; revised 22 August 2003; accepted September 2003*Correspondence: Ribeira Bandeirantes, All rights reserved 0893-133X/04 $25.00 www.neuropsychopharmacology.orgneuroimaging to investigate this. In view of its anxiolytic effect, we tested the hypothesis that CBD would affect neuralactivity in areas that normally mediate anxiety. We compared the effects of CBD and placebo on resting cerebral regional blood flow (rCBF) in healthy volunteersin a double-blind, cross-over design. Based on previousfunctional imaging studies of anxiety (Maddock and Buonocore, 1997; al, 1996; Liotti et al , 2000; Ketter et al, 1996), we predicted that, relative to placebo, CBD would modulate rCBF in cortex, and the insula. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects A total of 10 healthy male postgraduate students were studied. None had undergone rCBF SPECT examinations orother nuclear medicine procedures before. All were right- handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971), and were nonsmokers (of tobacco). Theirmean age was 29.8 years (range 25-42 years, SD \u00bc5.1), their mean weight was 74.1 kg (67-85 kg, SD \u00bc6.05), and their body mass index ranged between 21 and 25 kg/m 2. The subjects had not taken any medicines for at least 3 monthsbefore the study (Mathew et al, 1992). No subject had a history of head trauma, neurological, or major medicalillnesses, based on a semistandardized medical question-naire and physical examination. Neither the subjects (based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, First et al, 1997) nor their first-degree relatives (based on subjects' report) had a history of psychiatric illness. No subject had used marijuana more than five times in their lives (nor in the last year), and none had used any other illegal drug. Theexperiment was conducted with the understanding and consent of each subject, following approval by the local ethical committee. Cannabidiol CBD in powder, approximately 99.9% pure (supplied by THC-Pharm, Frankfurt, Germany), was dissolved in corn oil (Zuardi et al, 1993a, 1995). The same amount of corn oil was used as a placebo. The drug and placebo were packed inside identical gelatin capsules. Self-Rating Scale Subjective states were evaluated by means of the VisualAnalogue Mood Scale (VAMS) of Norris (1971), translated into Portuguese by Zuardi and Karniol (1981b). It consistsof 16 analogue scales to measure drug effects, which werearbitrarily divided by Norris into four factors: anxiety, physical sedation, mental sedation, and other feelings and attitudes. A factor analysis with the Portuguese version ofthis scale (Zuardi et al , 1993a) extracted four factors that can be identified with those of the Norris proposal. Prior tothe experiment, each volunteer had performed a trainingsession completing this scale.Procedure Subjects were told not to consume any alcohol for 24 h and caffeine for at least 4 h before each visit to the laboratory (Mathew et al , 1999). Subjects who reported having less than 6 h of sleep the previous night were excluded. After at least 8 h of fasting, subjects were instructed to have a light, standardized breakfast 2 h before the experiment.They were randomly divided into two groups of fivesubjects. Each subject was evaluated on two different occasions, 1 week apart. In the first session, after a 30- min period of adaptation, subjects were given a single doseof oral CBD (400 mg) or placebo, in a double-blind procedure. The sessions were held in the morning (between 0800 and 1200) to minimize the effects of circadianvariation. SPECT image acquisition was performed 110 min after drug ingestion. Subjective ratings on the VAMS were made 30 min before drug ingestion, at the timeof drug ingestion, and at 60 min and at 75 min afterwards. In the second session, an identical procedure was followed except that the other drug was administered (ie those givenCBD in the first session received placebo in the second;and vice versa ). Subjects were informed that they would receive CBD and placebo, but they were not told in whichorder. The investigators were also blind to the content ofthe capsules. SPECT Subjects had a venous cannula inserted into their rightarm, and rested supine with minimal environmentalsensory stimulation. They were instructed to keep theireyes closed under eye pads and to relax for 15 min without falling asleep. Their ears were unplugged. VAMS ratings were made just before and 15 min after insertionof the venous cannula. At 30 min after insertion of venous cannula, 740 MBq (20 mCi) dimer (ECD) labeled with technetium-99 m ( 99mTc-ECD) was injected. Subjects rested for an additional period of 5 min postinjection, after which the venous cannula was removed. Image acquisition started 20 min after the99mTc-ECD injection, using a double-detector SOPHAsDST system (Sophy Medical Vision, Twinsburg, USA). High-resolutionlow-energy collimators were used, with 128 views acquiredon a 128 /C2128 matrix (30 s per view), with a total acqui- sition time of 30 min, and approximately 75 000 counts/frame/head. Raw images were prefiltered with a Butterworthfilter (order number 4, cutoff frequency 0.16), and reconstructed by filtered back-projection as transaxial slices parallel to the long axis of the temporal lobe. Attenuationcorrection was performed considering a pixel size of 2.55 mm and using the first-order algorithm of Chang (coefficient 0.12/cm). Image Processing and Analysis Images were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mappingsoftware (SPM99) (Friston et al , 1995). Reconstructed transaxial datasets were transferred to a PC (Pentium IV,2.2 GHz, 512 Mb RAM), converted to Analyze formatand reoriented to neurological convention (ie left \u00bcleft). Effects of CBD on rCBF JAS Crippa et al 418 NeuropsychopharmacologyPlacebo images were realigned to CBD images using sinc (translations and non-linear (7 /C28/C27 nonlinear basis functions) deformations were used to register images to the SPM SPECT template,which is based on the Montreal Neurological Institute(MNI) template (Mazziotta et al , 1995). Finally, an isotropic Gaussian filter of 12 mm was applied to diminish inter- individual differences, and to conform data to the theory of Gaussian Random Fields (Friston et al , 1995), in order to allow the subsequent application of parametric statistical tests. Between-condition (CBD vsplacebo) comparisons of regional tracer uptake were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis using paired t-tests. Before statistical testing, the regional ECD uptake of every voxel in each subject was standardized to the mean global uptake of the imagein that subject, using proportional scaling. Only voxels with signal intensities above a threshold of 0.8 of the global mean (calculated using the standardized values)entered the statistical analysis. The resulting statistics at each voxel were transformed to Z-scores, thresholded atZ\u00bc2.33 (corresponding to po0.01, and displayed as 3-D statistical parametric maps (SPM). Thesemaps were first inspected for the presence of voxel clusters of significant difference in the regions whereeffects of CBD had been predicted a priori (medial temporal, cingulate, orbitofrontal, and insular cortices).Clusters in these regions were considered as significant ifthey included voxels with Z-scores of 3.09 or greater (corresponding to one-tailed po0.001), and contained more than 20 voxels. Levels of po0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons, have been frequently used inprevious SPM analyses of positron emission tomography (PET) (Dougherty 1999; 1999; Busatto et al , 2000) data, and are considered to provide good protection against false-positive results when there are clear hypotheses as to the location of findings. The SPMs were also inspected fordifferences in other, unpredicted regions. These areas were reported as significant if they survived a correction for multiple comparisons based on Gaussian random fieldtheory (p o0.05) (Friston et al , 1995). For each voxel cluster showing significant between- condition differences, estimates were calculated for themean, median, and maximal percentages of ECD countrate change (and their variances) (Table 1). These indices were obtained by partitioning the Student's t-test value of each voxel into its main components, with the numerator of the tstatistic used as an approximation of the magnitude of the signal change for each contrast(placebo 4CBD or CBD 4placebo), and the denominator (the standard error) used to calculate the variances. TheMNI coordinates for the voxels of maximal statistical significance for each anatomical brain region included in a given cluster were converted to the Talairach andTournoux (1988) system using the method described by Brett et al (2002). The four VAMS factors were submitted to an ANOVA for repeated measures in both CBD and placebo sessions.The differences between CBD and placebo in each phase of the experimental session (/C0 30, 0, 1 000, 1015) were analyzed by t-tests. Correlations between the regional tracer uptake and each of the VAMS factors scores werealso investigated with SPM99, at the same statisticalsignificance levels as described above for the between-condition rCBF comparisons. The last point in which the VAMS was applied (75 0after drug intake) was chosen for these correlations due to its proximity to the injection of the SPECT tracer. Moreover, this is the point where CBD is expected to have its maximum anxiolytic effect among all the time points chosen for assessment during theexperimental session (Zuardi et al, 1993a).

Effects of CBD on rCBF JAS Crippa et al 419 Neuropsychopharmacologythis time point was also based on previous studies, which have shown that the plasma peak of an oral doseof CBD usually occurs between 1 and 2 h after ingestion (Agurell et al, 1981). RESULTS Visual Analogue Mood Scale The administration of CBD was associated with signi- ficantly decreased subjective F(3,27) \u00bc2.24, p\u00bc0.11, respectively) (Figure 1). In addition, an analysis at each time point indicated the following: (i) CBD was associated with significantlydecreased anxiety at cannula insertion (60 0after drug intake, and resting (750after drug intake, t\u00bc5.50, po0.001) as compared to placebo; (ii) CBD was associated with significantly increased feelings of mental sedation at cannula insertion (600 after drug intake, t\u00bc/C03.91, p\u00bc0.001) and resting phases (750after drug intake, t\u00bc/C03.67, p\u00bc0.002) as compared to placebo. Between-Condition rCBF Comparisons The SPM showing increases in ECD uptake in the CBD relative to placebo condition revealed only one cluster (420 voxels) that surpassed the initial Z\u00bc2.33 statistical cutoff (Figure 2). This cluster, which achieved statistical significance at the po0.001 level (uncorrected for multi- ple comparisons), was located in the medial temporal cortex, where the effects of CBD had been predicted a priori , and involved the left parahippocampal gyrus,extending inferiorly to encompass the left fusiformgyrus (Table 1). Significantly decreased (p o0.001, uncorrected for multi- ple comparisons), ECD uptake in the CBD relative to theplacebo condition was evident in two regions where effectsof CBD had been predicted a priori (Table 1). One cluster included the medial portion of the left amygdala-hippo- campal complex and uncus, as well as the hypothalamus. The other was located in the superior portion of theleft posterior cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area FBA31), Figure 1 Effect of CBD and placebo (PLCB) on the four factors of the VAMS.

The results are displayed in neurological convention (ieleft\u00bcleft). The numbers associated with each frame represent the standard coordinate in the y- (for the coronal frames) and x-axis (for the sagittal frames). The voxel cluster shown was located in the left parahippocampalgyrus extending inferiorly to encompass the on rCBF JAS al paracentral lobule (BA5/6). At the po0.001 uncorrected level of significance, this SPM showed additional, unpredicted foci of decreased rCBF in the ECD relative to the placebo condition (4 20 voxels) in the right cerebellum, medial occipital cortex, left posterior lateral frontal cortex, but none of theseretained significance after correction for multiple compar- isons. Figure 3 displays, for each subject, the magnitude of tracer uptake changes between the CBD and placeboconditions at the voxel of maximal statistical significance in the regions where ECD uptake differences were observed(as summarized in Table 1). All 10 subjects showed greaterECD uptake values in the CBD condition relative to the placebo condition in the left parahippocampal/fusiform gyri. Of the 10 subjects, eight showed lower ECD activity inthe CBD condition relative to the placebo condition in the left amygdala-hippocampal complex; eight in the left hypothalamus; and nine in the left posterior cingulatecortex/paracentral lobule (Figure 2). Similar patterns across individual subjects were observed when we used the mean tracer uptake values of all voxels included in the clusters ofsignificant difference between the CBD and placeboconditions (data not shown). Correlations with Subjective Status Ratings No correlations were observed between subjective anxietyratings and ECD uptake in the brain areas where the effectsof CBD had been predicted a priori (po0.001, uncorrected), or in other unpredicted areas after correction for multiplecomparisons. DISCUSSION When undergoing neuroimaging procedures, such as PETor SPECT, subjects often report increased anxiety beforescanning, which is greater than that during or after image acquisition (Grey et al , 2000; Gur et al, 1987; Giordani et al, 1990; Malizia, 1999). The results of the present study showed that a single dose of CBD induced significant decreases in state anxiety before SPECT scanning. Our data thus suggest that this compound has anxiolytic properties,consistent with the results from previous studies in both laboratory animals (Zuardi and Karniol, 1983; Musty et et al , 1990) and humans (Zuardi et al, 1982, 1993a). The anxiolytic effects found in the present study were detected before the anxiety-evoking situation (the tracer injection and scanning procedure), indicating that CBD canaffect anticipatory anxiety. In a previous study (Zuardi et al, 1993a), the anxiolytic effect of CBD was evident after thestress of public speaking. These antianxiety effects are incontrast to the anxiogenic effects of high doses of D 9-THC (Malit et al, 1975; Zuardi et al , 1982; Mathew et al , 1999), and may help to reconcile apparently conflicting findingsobtained with Cannabis sativa in relation to anxiety (Johns, 2001; Tournier et al, 2003). Consistent with an anxiolytic effect, we found that CBD significantly modulated resting activity predominantly inlimbic and paralimbic cortical areas, which are usually implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety (Gray, 1982; Graeff, 1994). Thus, between-condition activity differenceswere detected in a left medial temporal cluster, which included portions of the amygdala and the hippocampus, as well as the hypothalamus, the left posterior cingulate gyrus,and the left parahippocampal gyrus. The only brain region that showed significantly increased activity in the CBD relative to the placebo condition was theleft parahippocampal gyrus. Deactivation of the parahippo-campal region in healthy volunteers has been reported after panic attacks induced by lactate (Reiman et al , 1989) and CCK-4 (Javanmard et al , 1999), and with anxiety induced by presentation of combat-related images (Bremner et al, 1999b) and autobiographical memory scripts (Liotti et al, 2000). In addition, the abnormal asymmetry of resting activity in the parahippocampal gyri has been associated with panic disorder and with vulnerability to lactate- induced panic (Reiman et al , 1984, 1986; , 1998; De Cristofaro et al , 1993). These studies suggest that anxiety can be associated withreduced parahippocampal activity, consistent with ananxiolytic effect of CBD and the increased activity in thisregion that we observed. In contrast, activity in the left amygdala-hippocampal complex, hypothalamus, and posterior cingulate cortexdecreased with CBD relative to placebo. The amygdala is thought to play a key role in mediating fear and anxiety (Deakin and Graeff, 1991; LeDoux, 1998; Gorman et al, 2000), being activated during fear conditioning (Furmark Figure 3 Tracer uptake values during the CBD (filled circle) and PLCB (hollowed circle) conditions are plotted for the 10 subjects, using the voxel of maximal significant difference of each of the four regions reported in Table 1. From left to right and top to bottom: /C04,/C027, parahippocampal/fusiform gyri). Individual values were normalizedto the global ECD uptake for each subject and condition. The graphs showthat the large majority of individual subjects showed lower ECD activity inthe CBD condition relative to the placebo condition in the left amygdala-hippocampus complex, hypothalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex/paracentral lobule, while all subjects had greater ECD uptake in the CBDcondition relative to the placebo condition in the left parahippocampal/fusiform gyri. Effects of CBD on rCBF JAS Crippa al , 1998; Buchel et al, while processing anxious faces (Breiter et al , 1996; Morris et al , et al 1998; Hariri et al , 2002) and during pharmacologically induced anxiety (Ketter et al, 1996; Benkelfat et al, 1995; Servan-Schreiber et al , 1998). Functional and structural changes in the amygdala have also been reported in PTSD (Pitman et al , 2001; Rauch et al et al , 2000; Liberzon et al, 1999), panic disorder (Uchida et al, 2003; Bystritsky et al, 2001), generalized anxiety disorder (Thomas et al , 2001; De Bellis et al , 2000), and in , et al , et 2002) and simple phobias (Wik et al , 1997). The reduction in amygdala activity that we observed with CBD is thus consistent withthe anxiolytic effect that it had in our subjects. Thehippocampus has also been implicated in the processingof anxiety. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown increased activity in the hippocampus in association with anxiety in OCD (McGuire et al, 1994), panic disorder (Bisaga et al, 1998; Bystritsky et al, 2001; Boshuisen et al, 2002), PTSD (Osuch et al , 2001), and in social phobia (Schneider et al, 1999). However, other studies have reported either decreased or no difference in activity in the hippocampus in association with normal anxiety or anxiety disorders (Schuff et al, 2001; Schneider et al , al al, 1996; et al, 1997; Liotti et al, 2000). The hypothalamus is a major component of the central autonomic nervous system, and is often involved inmediating the effects of stress and anxiety (Afifi and Bergman, 1998). Functional imaging studies during fear and anxiety induction in healthy subjects (Fredrikson et al, 1995b; Javanmard et al, 1999) and in panic disorder patients (Boshuisen et al, 2002) have reported increases in the activity of the hypothalamic region, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis abnormalities have been commonly reported in anxiety disorders (Hageman et al, 2001). The reduced hypothalamic activity that we observed is thus consistent with the anxiolytic effect of CBD. The posterior cingulate cortex is 1992; Maddock, 1999; Bergman, 1998), and is thought to play acentral role in emotion and anxiety (MacLean, 1993; Maddock, 1999). Increased activity in the posterior cingulate gyrus has been associated with watching anxi-ety-provoking videos (Fischer et al, 1996, Fredrikson et al, 1995a), and with experimentally provoked obsessions andanxiety in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) (McGuire et al , 1994). Untreated patients with OCD show increased metabolism in the posterior cingulate(Perani et al , 1995) that decreases with treatment, with the change in posterior cingulate rCBF correlated withsymptomatic improvement (Rauch et al, 2001, 2002). There have also been reports of increased posterior cingulateactivation during symptom provocation in post-traumaticstress disorder (Bremner et al, 1999a) and panic disorder (Bystritsky et al, 2001). However, anxiety induction in phobic patients has been associated with deactivation inthe posterior cingulate region (Wik et al, 1993) and Busatto et al (2000) reported a negative correlation between rCBF in the left posterior cingulate cortex and severity ofsymptoms in OCD.We did not observe a correlation between the severity of anxiety and rCBF in the areas where activity was modulatedby CBD, but this may have been difficult to detect because there was a 15-min gap between the points when the ratings were made and the SPECT tracer was injected. While the areas where we found modulatory effects of CBD are thus implicated in mediating anxiety, and have also been associated with the anxiolytic effects of diazepam (Di Piero et al, 2001), citalopram (Van der Linden et al , 2000; Furmark et al, 2002), sertraline, and desipramine (Hoehn- Saric et al, 2001), these effects of CBD could be related to an effect other than on anxiety. For instance, we also observedsedative effects of CBD, confirming former findings in animals (Pickens, 1981; Monti, 1977; Colasanti et al, 1984; Zuardi humans (Carlini et al , 1979; Zuardi et al, 1982, 1993b). This effect has been reported to be dose-related (Pickens, 1981) and CBD has also beenshown to decrease wakefulness (Monti, 1977) and to cause longer sleep duration in insomniacs (Carlini and Cunha,1981). Thus, the reduced hypothalamic activity observed after CBD use in our study could equally be related to sedative effects of CBD, as suggested to occur with othersedative compounds (Tung et al, 2001). Other pharmacological effects of CBD have been reported in studies in laboratory animals and humans, such as anti-inflammatory (Malfait et al, 2000), anticonvulsant al, 1980), (Hampson et al , 1998), and hormonal effects (Zuardi et al , 1984, 1993a). In addition, the pharmacological profile of CBD is similar to that of clozapine, an 'atypical' antipsychotic drug (Zuardi et al, 1991, 1995), and both CBD and clozapine induce c-fos expression in the prefrontal cortex and lateral septalnucleus in rats (Zuardi et al , 2001). The mechanism(s) of action whereby CBD produces all these effects remains obscure. This is largely in contrast with the effects of D 9- THC, which mimics the endogenous cannabinoids in manyof its actions. CBD does not act through the knowncannabinoid receptors, but the stereospecificity previously observed may indicate that CBD binds to another type of receptor in the brain (Mechoulam et al, 2002). In conclusion, our results suggest that CBD has anxiolytic effects that are mediated through an action on limbic and paralimbic areas of the brain. However, the findings need to be seen as preliminary, given thelimitations of the study. Firstly, it would have been desirable to measure plasma levels of CBD and relate them to the magnitude of change in rCBF. Without a dose-responsecurve, uncertainty about the regional cerebral effects of CBD remains. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that it is not clear whether there is a relation between plasma levelsof cannabinoids Fespecially CBD Fand their clinical effects (Agurell et al , 1986). In addition, the subject sample was modest and the use of SPECT limited the study'sstatistical power. Finally, given the limited spatial resolutionof the SPECT technique and the smoothing procedure, the interpretation of large foci of tracer uptake changes as involving different brain structures of small size (such asthe amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus) should be made with caution. These limitations could be overcome by examining a larger sample and using functional magneticresonance imaging, which would permit the acquisition of Effects of CBD on rCBF JAS Crippa et al 422 Neuropsychopharmacologygreater numbers of images with a better spatial and temporal resolution.

It lacks the psy- chotomimetic and other psychotropic effects that the main plant compound D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being able, on the contrary, to antagonize these effects. This property, together with its safety prole, was an initial stimulus for the investigation of CBD pharmacological properties. It is now clearthat CBD has therapeutic potential over a wide range of non-psychiatric and psychiatric disorders suchas anxiety, depression and psychosis. Although the pharmacological effects of CBD in different bio-logical systems have been extensively investigated by in vitro studies, the mechanisms responsible for its therapeutic potential are still not clear. Here, we review recent in vivo studies indicating that these mechanisms are not unitary but rather depend on the behavioural response being measured.Acute anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects seem to rely mainly on facilitation of 5-HT1A-mediated neurotransmission in key brain areas related to defensive responses, including the dorsalperiaqueductal grey, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and medial prefrontal cortex. Other extinction and impaired reconsolidation of aversive memories, and facilitation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis could depend on potentiation of anandamide- mediated neurotransmission. Finally, activation of TRPV1 channels may help us to explain theantipsychotic effect and the bell-shaped dose-response curves commonly observed with CBD. Consid-ering its safety prole and wide range of therapeutic potential, however, further studies are needed toinvestigate the involvement of other possible mechanisms (e.g. inhibition of adenosine uptake, inverseagonism at present in the Cannabis sativa plant, constituting up to 40 per cent of its extract. The chemical characterization of the main cannabi- noids present in this plant by Mechoulam's group inthe 1960s [ 1] originated the rst wave of scientic interest in this compound. With the discovery of theendocannabinoid (eCB) system in the early 1990sand the rise, in the words of Bill Devane [ 2], of the new dawn of cannabinoid pharmacology, there was arenewed interest in CBD, with the number of relatedpublished studies growing exponentially since then. Recent comprehensive reviews suggest that this compound is one of the most promising candidatesfor a therapeutic tool in a wide range of disorders[3,4]. In the present paper, we will review the evidence that supports its use in psychiatric disorders and theproposal mechanisms that try to explain it. 2.

These apparent contradictory results weresubsequently explained by Guimara eset al .[7]. Using an ethologically based model of anxiety, theelevated plus maze, they showed that CBD promotesanxiolytic-like effects with an inverted U-shapeddose-response curve, higher doses (more than20 mg kg 21in rats) being ineffective (table 1 ).The anti-anxiety properties of CBD in rats were later conrmed in different species (mice) andanimal models, including the Vogel conflict test andcontextual fear conditioning [ 8-10]. More recently, CBD was shown to decrease defensive behavioursevoked by predator exposure, a proposed model ofpanic attacks and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [ 11,13]. CBD also reduces marble burying behaviour in mice, suggesting that this compound could be effective in obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) [ 14]. Moreover, CBD can interfere in learning and/or memory of aversive events, processes that haveT able 1.

In this same paradigm, it can also impair reconsolidation, resulting in the attenuation ofthe aversive memory trace. In this study, the impair-ment of contextual fear memory did not show reinstatement and was long-lasting (22 days) [ 23]. Contrasting with these results, Elbatsh et al.[ 22] have recently reported that repeated (14 days) admin- istration of CBD increases freezing in a contextual fearconditioning test. The reasons for this difference isunknown, but may involve the distinct conditioning protocols and drug administration regime (chronic versus acute) used compared with other studies thatinvestigated the effects of CBD in this model[15,21,23]. Moreover, in this study, it is also possible that CBD could have interfered in learning/memorymechanisms, because the animals were conditioned under the drug effect [ 22]. (a)Clinical anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol In agreement with the results obtained in animal models, clinical studies conrmed that CBD has anxio-lytic properties (table 1 ). Following the initial report that it blocks the anxiogenic effects of high doses ofthe main psychoactive compound present in the Canna- bis sativa plant, D 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [ 31], it was demonstrated that CBD can also reduce anxietyin healthy volunteers during a neuroimaging study orafter a simulated public-speaking procedure [ 24,25]. More recently, using the latter procedure, Bergamaschiet al.[29] showed that CBD (600 mg p.o.) decreases anxiety treatment-naive social phobic patients. (b)Brain sites of cannabidiol anxiolytic effects Neuroimaging studies show that CBD changes the activity of brain regions related to the control ofemotional process [ 25,27]. It attenuates blood oxygen- ation in the amygdala and the anterior and posteriorcingulate cortex in subjects exposed to fearful faces[27], impairs the connectivity between the pre-frontal and subcortical regions [ 27] and clinical ndings were complemented by studies in rodents, using direct administration intobrain sites related to anxiety- or panic-like responses periaqueductal grey (DPAG) promoted anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus maze, elev-ated T maze and Vogel conflict tests. It alsodecreased escape latency in a model of panic attacks,electrical stimulation of the DPAG [ 16,18]. Anxiolytic effects were also found after CBD injection into thebed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in rats tested in the elevated plus maze, Vogel conflict testand contextual fear conditioning [ 19,20]. This latter effect corroborates results showing that the effects ofCBD in a contextual fear conditioning model is associ- ated with decreased neuronal activation (measure by cFos expression) in this area [ 21]. This same treatment attenuated the activation of the pre- and infra-limbiccortical regions. In these two brain areas, however,CBD produced opposite effects, decreasing and facili-tating, respectively, conditioned emotional responses[10]. Recently, Hsiao et al.[26] showed anxiolytic effects of CBD injection into the central nucleus ofthe amygdala. Other possible brain sites of CBDanxiolytic effect have not yet been investigated (e.g.the hippocampus). (c)Mechanisms of the anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol CBD can produce multiple pharmacological actionsover a wide range of drug concentrations (table 2 ) [3,4]. CBD is proposed to activate or modify the func- tion of several receptors in the central nervous system(CNS), including CB1, CB2, GPR55, TRPV1 and 5-HT1A receptors the (?) (5-HT1A) Figure 1.

Some of CBD effects involve intracellular pathways that play fundamental roles in neuronal physiology. For example, in hippocampal neurons, CBD increasesintracellular calcium concentrations via mitochon-drial uptake and release and/or activation of type-L voltage-gated calcium channels [ 38,39]. CBD has also a potent action in inhibiting oxidative and nitrosa- tive stress, a mechanism that has been related to itsneuroprotective effects with implications for the treat-ment of Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson'sdiseases. It decreases the neuronal pro-moted by b-amyloid protein deposit [ 47,51] the depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa-mine nitric oxide the expression of adhesionmolecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 [ 48].

The large majority of these possible mechanisms have been unveiled by in vitro studies. Their associ- ation to the behaviour effects of CBD is still notclear, a topic that is further complicated by the common bell-shaped dose-response curves produced by this compound in distinct biological systems [ 4]. In the last decade, however, several in vivo studies have helped us to understand the mechanisms ofCBD central effects. (d)In vivo mechanisms of cannabidiol anxiolytic effects: 5-HT1A receptors Russo et al.[35] were the rst to suggest that CBD could act as a 5HT1A receptor agonist. They observed that, at mM range, this drug displaces 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, from cloned human 5-HT1A receptors expressed in cultured cells obtainedfrom Chinese hamster ovary. In vivo experiments gave further support to the involvement of 5-HT1A recep-tors in the effects of CBD [ 18-20,55]. For instance, the neuroprotective effects of CBD in hepatic ence-phalopathy or cerebral infarction are mediated bythese receptors [ 55,56]. Regarding the behavioural studies, the effects of CBD in a PTSD model (preda-tor exposure) were prevented by W AY100635, a5HT1A receptor antagonist [ 11]. This same antagon- ist prevented the anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like effects of CBD after injections into the DPAG [ 16,18], bed nucleus of the stria terminalis tal Guimara es 2012, unpublished data; gure 1 ). In humans, although no study so far has investigated the involvement of 5- HT1A mechanisms in CBD effects, the anxiolytic pro- le of this drug in the public speaking model was remarkably similar to the positive control ipsapirone,a 5HT1A receptor partial agonist [ 24]. Other CBD effects also involve 5-HT1A receptors. It decreases nausea and vomiting probably by an indir-ect agonism at these receptors. Although the mechanism of this indirect action is unclear, it may involve interactions with allosteric sites or changes indifferent systems that would result in a facilitation of5-HT1A-mediated responses [ 57]. Adding to the evi- dence that the interaction of CBD with 5-HT1Areceptors could be complex, it was recently shownthat this compound antagonizes food intake induced by 8-OH-DPAT [ 58]. Therefore, additional research is clearly needed to clarify how CBD facilitates 5-HT1A-mediated neurotransmission. could facilitate eCB-mediated neurotrans-mission by blocking the metabolism and uptake ofanandamide [ 33]. However, AM251, a CB1 receptor antagonist, failed to prevent the anxiolytic effects ofCBD injected into the DPAG observed in the elevatedplus maze at the same dose that antagonized the anxio-lytic effects of anandamide [ 18,59]. On the other hand, CB1, but not 5-HT1A, receptor antagonism was able to prevent CBD effects on bothextinction and reconsolidation, indicating that its interference on aversive memories involves eCB- mediated mechanisms [15,23]. These results agree with the well-described facilitation of extinction byendogenous cannabinoids [ 60], suggesting that CBD interferes with aversive memories by facilitating the effects of eCBs [ 45]. Finally, AM251 blocked CBD effects in the marble burying model [ 14], whereas 5-HT1A-receptor antag- onism was ineffective. This result corroborates the proposal that anxiety and OCD models engage distinctbrain mechanisms, with the marble burying beha- viour being related to repetitive behaviours instead of anxiety [ 61]. How facilitation of eCB-mediated neurotrans- mission decreases repetitive behaviour is unknown,but may involve attenuation of glutamate-mediatedneurotransmission. eCBs can reduce the release ofseveral neurotransmitters, including glutamate [ 62], a major neurotransmitter of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry that has been implicated inthe pathophysiology of OCD [ 63]. Anti-glutamatergic drugs and memantine decrease marbleburying behaviour [ 64,65] and are proposed to be clinically useful for OCD treatment [ 66,67]. An indirect anti-glutamatergic action via increased eCB neurotransmission may also be involved in othercentral effects of CBD such as anticonvulsant [ 3], an effect that could also be related to indirect CB1-mediated inhibition of glutamate release. Corroboratingthis proposal, anticonvulsant effects of inhibitorsof anandamide metabolism/uptake have recently been described [ 3]. Moreover, epileptic patients present a signicant reduction in the fraction of CB1-positive glutamatergic, but not the pathogenesis of anxiety dis-orders and depression [ 69] and at least some of the behavioural effects of prototype antidepressant drugsdepend on facilitation of this process [ 70]. CBD can also increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis, as rst demonstrated by Wolf et al.[71]. They also showed that the proneurogenic effect of CBD was absent in CB1-knockout mice [ 71]. Because CBD is not a CB1-receptor agonist, this result suggested thatCBD effect was mediated by an indirect activation ofthese receptors, possibly by inhibition of anandamide metabolism/uptake [ 33]. Corroborating this latter possibility, recent results from our group showed that CBD increases proliferation of hippocampal progeni-tor cells in culture, an effect mimicked by CB 1or CB 2receptor agonists and prevented by antagonists of these receptors [ 72]. Moreover, CBD effects were also inhibited by overexpression of the FAAH, reinfor- cing the proposal of anandamide involvement. These results agree with those previously reported by Jianget al.[ 73] showing that a synthetic CB1 agonist is able to promote embryonic and adult hippocampusneurogenesis, an effect associated with the anxiolytic3368 A. C. Campos et al. Review .Cannabidiol and psychiatric disorders Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012) on October 29, 2012 rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from and antidepressant properties of the drug. Similar to prototype antidepressants, the anxiolytic effectof repeated administered CBD (30 mg/daily for 14days) in mice submitted to a chronic unpredictablestress model disappeared when hippocampal neuro-genesis was inhibited [ 72], suggesting a causal link between its proneurogenic and anxiolytic effect afterrepeated administration ( gure 1 ). Other mechanisms could also be involved in CBD effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis\u2014forexample, activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. This particular mechanism seems to be important during neuroinflammation and neuro- degenerative process related to b-amyloid protein deposits in CNS [ 51]. Although the pro-neurogenic effect of CBD has not yet been studied in rats, itcould help us to explain the recent report that repeatedCBD treatment enhances contextual fear conditioning[22]. Immature newborn neurons are selectively acti- vated by this task [ 74], and neurogenesis suppression impairs contextual fear memory [ 75]. Considering the important role proposed for hippocampal neuro-genesis in several brain functions [ 76,77], the effects and mechanisms of CBD on this process is anotherimportant research venue to be pursued. (g)Cannabidiol and the vanilloid system CBD can activate transient receptor potential (TRP) channels [ 33]. These channels comprise a family of over 50 members and are present in different species,including yeast, worms, insects, sh and mammals [ 78]. The vanilloid receptor 1 or TRPV1 is one of the rstidentied members of the family, being a non-selectivecation channel with a preference for calcium. It is acti-vated by noxious stimuli, heat, protons (pH ,5.9) and various, mostly noxious, natural products such as cap- saicin [ 79]. TRPV1 receptors are present in the brain, where anandamide has been proposed to act as an endogenous agonist or an endovanilloid [ 80]. These receptors can facilitate the release of glutamate [ 81], a neurotransmitter that induces defensive responses inbrain areas such as the DPAG [ 82]. On the basis of these pieces of evidence, we hypothesized that TRPV1activation could be at least partially responsible for theinverted U-shaped dose-response curves commonlyobserved with CBD. Accordingly, using intra-DPAGinjections, we showed that local pretreatment with anineffective dose of the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine turned a higher, ineffective dose (60 nmol) of CBD into an anxiolytic one [ 83]. TRPV1 receptors are also involved in the bell-shaped dose responses curves ofanandamide analogues [ 84,85]. In addition to TRPV1, CBD could also interfere with other members of the TRP family, activating TRPV2and ankyrin type 1 (TRPA1) channels and antagonizing melastatin type 8 (TRPM8) channels [ 45,46]. The role played by these mechanisms on CBD behavioural effects, however, is unknown at the moment. 3. CANNABIDIOL AND PSYCHOSIS Initial studies with laboratory animals suggested thatCBD prevents some of the effects produced by THC[86]. Similar antagonism was also found in humans,where CBD attenuated the impairment of time pro-duction tasks and the euphoria induced by THC inhealthy volunteers [ 87,88]. Conrming and extending these results, Zuardi et al. [31] demonstrated that CBD inhibits THC-induced anxiety and psychotic-like symptoms such as disconnected thoughts, perceptual disturbance, depersonalization and resist- ance to communication. In the same year, it wasobserved that patients admitted to a psychiatric hospi-tal in South Africa after the use of a variety of Cannabis virtually devoid of CBD showed a much higher fre-quency of acute psychotic episodes than in other countries [ 89], suggesting that the presence of CBD inCannabis samples protects users against the occur- rence of THC-induced acute psychotic episodes. Because experimental evidence indicates that theantagonistic effect of CBD did not result from a phar-macokinetic interaction between the two cannabinoids[90], these initial observations led to the hypothesis that CBD could possess antipsychotic properties. An initial study in rats investigated whether this compound could attenuate stereotypies induced bythe 91]. Both drugs reduced apomorphine-induced stereotyped be- haviour in a dose-related manner. Even though they increased plasma levels of prolactin, CBD had muchlower potency, with signicant increases only seenafter the doses of 120 and 240 mg kg 21. Moreover, contrary to haloperidol, CBD did not induce cata-lepsy, even at doses as high as 480 mg kg 21. These results suggest that CBD exhibits a prole similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs. In another study, CBD was compared with haloperidol and clozapine, an aty-pical antipsychotic drug. The drug inhibited thehyperlocomotion induced by amphetamine and keta-mine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, in mice [ 92]. As expected, while both haloperidol and clozapine inhibited hyperlocomotion, only haloperidol induced catalepsy. These results extend CBD antipsychotic-like effects to a glutamate-based model. In agreementwith these CBD, similar to clozapine, disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in mice andthe hyperactivity and reduction of social interaction inrats caused by MK-801, another NMDA receptor antagonist [ 93,94]. Typical antipsychotics, on the other hand, are usually unable to restore the decits in PPI and social interaction induced by NMDAreceptor antagonists [ 95,96]. Extending ndings from studies using single drug administration, chronic treatment with CBD attenu- ated amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion [ 97]. Preliminary results from our group indicate that this treatment regime is also able to decrease the impair-ments in PPI and object recognition induced byrepeated administration of MK-801 (F. V . Gomes,E. A. Del Bel & F. S. Guimara es, unpublished data). Despite these ndings, there are also negative results regarding the possible antipsychotic effects of CBD. Chronic treatment with this drug failed to change be-havioural changes such as locomotor hyperactivity andPPI decits observed in transmembrane domain neur-egulin 1 mutant (Nrg1) mice, a proposed model for aschizophrenia susceptibility gene [ 98].

(a)Cannabidiol and psychosis: clinical studies The antipsychotic-effects of CBD have also been demon-strated in humans ( table 3 ). In healthy volunteers, Leweke et al. [100] observed that the decrease of the perception of illusory image induced by nabilone, asynthetic cannabinoid drug with THC-like properties,was reduced by CBD. Another model used to evaluateantipsychotic-like activity of drugs in humans is theadministration of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine.This drug induces psychotic symptoms that mimic both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. An initial investigation in healthy subjects showedthat CBD induced a non-signicant trend to reduceketamine-induced dissociative effects, but, at the sametime, augmented the activating effects of ketamineT able 3.

Because only a single dose of CBD was used, additional studies are needed to characterize the effects of CBD in this model [ 102]. The therapeutic use of CBD in psychotic patients was tested for the rst time in 1995. In an open, case-report study, a 19-year-old black schizophrenic female patient, who presented serious side effects after treat- ment with conventional antipsychotics, receivedincreasing oral doses of CBD (up to 1500 mg d 21) for four weeks [ 103]. A signicant improvement with no side effects was observed in all items of the standardbrief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) during CBD treat- ment, with an efcacy similar to that of haloperidol. Symptom worsening was observed when the adminis-tration was interrupted. In another case study, CBDwas administered to three 22- or 23-year-old maleschizophrenic patients who had not responded to typicalantipsychotic drugs for 30 days [ 104]. The dose of CBD was increased from 40 up to 1280 mg d 21. One patient showed mild improvement, but only slight or no changewas observed in the other two, suggesting that CBD maynot be effective for the treatment of resistant schizo-phrenia. Moreover, CBD had no benecial effects onthe performance of schizophrenic patients in theStroop colour word test, which can be used to assess attentional processes frequently impaired in schizo- phrenia [ 106]. It is still unknown whether chronic administration of CBD could improve the cognitive def-icits in the disorder. No signicant side effects wereobserved during CBD treatment in these clinicalstudies, suggesting that CBD is safe and well toleratedin schizophrenic patients. In an open-label study evaluating CBD effects on psychotic symptoms associated with L-dopa use in Par-kinson's patients [ 105], the drug decreased scores of a questionnaire developed to assess psychotic symptomsin Parkinson's disease (Parkinson psychosis question-naire), improved total BPRS scores as well as scores specically related to positive and negative symptoms. Conrming the lack of motor effects observed inanimal studies, CBD did not affect motor function.On the contrary, it decreased the total scores of theunied Parkinson's disease rating scale, suggesting animprovement of this function. Overall, therefore, even if there are negative results, most clinical studies with normal subjects or schizo-phrenic patients suggest that CBD has antipsychoticproperties. Corroborating this possibility, a four-weekdouble-blind controlled clinical trial in 42 acuteschizophrenic and schizophreniform psychosis patientscomparing the effects of CBD with those of amisul- pride, an atypical antipsychotic, showed that both treatments were equally effective in reducing acutepsychotic symptoms after two and four weeks of treat-ment [ 34]. Moreover, compared with amisulpride, CBD caused a lower incidence of extrapyramidalsymptoms and increases in prolactin and weight gain. The presence of antipsychotic properties in CBD is also supported by convergent evidence linking thehabitual use of Cannabis to the risk of developing schizo- phrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis, especially invulnerable subjects [ 107]. This effect has been attribu- ted to THC. In agreement with the initial reportsshowing antagonism of THC-induced psychotomimeticeffects [ 31,87,88], the presence of CBD in Cannabis strains has been shown to be protective against theoccurrence of psychotic-like reactions and cognitiveimpairment [ 108-110]. In this context, Di Forti et al. [111] found that the use of Cannabis containing high THC- and low CBD concentration was associated with a higher risk of a rst psychotic episode. Furthermore, the presence of CBD protects from Cannabis -associated decrease in hippocampal volume [ 112]. This neuropro- tective effect of CBD has also been reported in thehuman basal ganglia, where there was a strong positivecorrelation between N-acetylaspartate/total creatine ratio and the amount of CBD (as measured by itspresence in hair samples) in the putamen/globus palli-dum of recreational Cannabis users. This nding could reflect a CBD-induced enhancement of neuronal andaxonal integrity in these regions [ 113]. More recently, Bhattacharyya et al. [114], investigating the effects of THC and CBD during attentional salience proces- sing, have also showed that these two cannabinoids produce opposite effects on prefrontal, striatal andhippocampal functions. (b)Brain sites and mechanisms of cannabidiol antipsychotic effects Few studies in laboratory animals have investigated the possible brain sites and mechanisms of CBD antipsy-chotic effects. Consistent with the behavioural datadescribed earlier, both CBD and clozapine, but not halo-peridol, activation (measured bycFos-protein expression) in the prefrontal cortex. Prob-ably reflecting its motor side effects, only haloperidol increased cFos in the dorsal striatum. CBD, and, in addition, increased cFos in the nucleus accumbens[115], an effect shared by typical and atypical antipsycho- tic drugs [ 116]. Intracerebroventricular administration of CBD (10 mg) also enhanced cFos expression in waking- related brain areas such as hypothalamus and dorsal raphe nucleus [ 117], but the relation between this nding and its antipsychotic properties is unclear. A number of neuroimaging studies in healthy volunteers have compared the effects of CBD and high doses of THC. Consistent with the behavioural ndings in humans and rodents, these drugs caused opposite effects on brain activity in the striatum, anterior [ 27, 101,114,118-120]. Behavioural measurements in these studies indicated that some of these changes(decreased activation of ventral and dorsal the psychotic-like effects of THC, suggestingthat these regions could be possible brain suites of CBDaction [ 121]. No study using direct injections into key brain regions associated with the pathophysiology ofschizophrenia, such as the prefrontal cortex and nucleusaccumbens, has been performed so far to investigate CBD antipsychotic properties. Regarding the pharmacological mechanisms, intra- cerebroventricular administration of CBD enhanced extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleusaccumbens [ 122]. A similar nding was found afterReview .Cannabidiol and psychiatric disorders A. C. Campos et al. 3371 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012) on October 29, 2012 rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from microdialysis perfusion of CBD (30, 60 or 90 nM) into the rat lateral hypothalamus [ 117], a procedure that also enhanced alertness. It is unclear how this effectwould relate to the antipsychotic properties of CBDbecause usual antipsychotic drugs act by antagonizingdopamine-2 receptors [ 123]. Moreover, studies with animal models that involve dopaminergic stimulation suggest that the antipsychotic-like doses of CBD (60-120 mg kg 21) are higher than those needed to induce anxiolytic-like effects [ 7,91,92] and reverse be- havioural decits the NMDA receptorantagonist MK-801 [ 93,94,99]. These ndings indicate that the mechanisms of CBD effects on glutamate- or dopamine-based models could be at least partially distinct. This possibility needs to be further explored. Recently, Leweke et al.[34] showed that schizo- phrenic patients treated with CBD present serum levels with those receiv-ing the antipsychotic amisulpride. Moreover, in theCBD group, there was a signicant association between anandamide levels and improvement of psychotic symptoms. In the same study, they conrmed, in vitro , that CBD inhibits FAAH activity in a concentration(10mM) that does not interact with receptors (dopa- mine, GABA, serotonin and glutamate) commonlyassociated with schizophrenia. However, by indirectly activating CB1 receptors via increased levels of anandamide, CBD could potentially modulate neuro-transmitters systems related to these receptors [ 121, 124]. Moreover, as previously discussed, facilitation of CB1-mediated neurotransmission by CBD alsoincreases adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a mechan-ism that could be related to the cognitive decits found in schizophrenic patients [ 124]. As discussed already, CBD and anandamide can also activate TRPV1 channels. This mechanism, probably by facilitating the pre-synaptic release of glu-tamate [ 80], is involved in the ability of CBD to reverse the disruption of PPI induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 [ 93]. Other mechanisms that could also help us to explain CBD anti-psychotic effects are facilitation of 5-HT1A- mediated neurotransmission, an effect shared by theatypical anti-psychotic aripiprazole, which acts as a par-tial agonist at these receptors, and anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective AND DEPRESSIONCannabis sativa exerts signicant effects upon humour, which include euphoria and mood elevation [ 125].THC may account for most of these effects throughactivation of CB1 receptors. Considering these obser-vations, as well as the effects of synthetic cannabinoidsand drugs that increase eCB levels, a putative rolefor the eCB system in mood disorders has been pro-posed [ 126]. The effects of CBD, however, have been scarcely investigated (table 4 ). The fact that this compound, in addition to facilitating eCB activity[33], may facilitate the activation of 5-HT1A receptors [35] suggests that it might also have antidepressant- like properties. 5HT1A receptors modulate responsesto stressful stimuli and are proposed to mediate theeffects of antidepressant drugs [ 129]. Stress exposure is a key aetiological factor in depression [ 130] and animal models used to study antidepressant-like effects are generally based on acuteresponses to inescapable aversive stimuli, which areprevented by antidepressants [ 131]. Alternatively, con- sidering the nature of depression as a chronicpsychiatric disorder, some models investigate drug effects upon the diverse consequences of chronic stress, including anhedonia and changes in exploratoryactivity [ 132]. One of the rst studies that indicate the presence of antidepressant-like properties in CBD focused on itsability to prevent the autonomic and behavioural conse- quences of inescapable stress [ 17]. Rats were submitted to restraint stress during 60 min, which increases heart rate and blood pressure and caused anxiogenic-likeresponses in rats exposed to the elevated plus maze24 h later. CBD was injected 30 min before the stressat the doses of 1, 10 or 20 mg kg 21. The doses of 10 and 20 mg kg21attenuated the changes in autonomic parameters, whereas at 10 mg kg21CBD also prevented the late anxiogenic-like effect of stress. There were nochanges in motor activity or basal cardiovascular par-ameters, discarding any possible confounding factor[17]. Similar effects were observed after intra-cisterna magna administration of CBD [ 12], thus suggesting that these effects are centrally mediated. Another behavioural model widely used to assess antidepressant-like effects, mainly due to its pharmaco-logical predictability, is the forced swim test. In thisassay, rats or mice exposed to inescapable swimmingassume a posture of immobility, which is reversed byantidepressants [ 131]. We tested in mice the effects of CBD (3-100 mg kg 21) injected 30 min prior to the test [ 128]. The drug produced an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. At the dose of 30 mg kg21,i t reduced immobility similar to the tricyclic antide-pressant imipramine (30 mg kg 21). Our behaviouralT able 4. Antidepressant-like effects of CBD.

B (2012) on October 29, 2012 rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org Downloaded from ndings in the forced swimming test were conrmed by another study, published in the same year. CBD wastested at the doses of 20, 100 and 200 mg kg 21[127], with the higher dose being effective. The drug had noeffect, however, in the mouse tail suspension test. Onedrawback common to all these studies is that the animals received only acute injections. Depression, however, is a chronic disorder that requires long-lasting drug treat-ment [ 130]. CBD has been recently tested against the consequences of chronic unpredictable stress, whichincludes anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviour [ 130]. Chronic treatment with CBD was able to prevent these behavioural changes, an effect that depends on hippocampal neurogenesis, similar to antidepressantdrugs [ 72]. This observation further strengthens the notion that this natural cannabinoid should be con-sidered as a potential approach for the treatment ofmood disorders. Despite this body of evidence, no clinical study has investigated whether CBD can decrease depressivesymptoms in patients. This compound has beentested, however, in patients suffering from bipolar dis-orders, a subtype of mood disorder, in whom it wasnot effective in treating manic episodes [ 133]. Actu- ally, this is in line with animal models, in which CBD failed to prevent hyperactivity in rodents [ 134]. To summarize, although the data are scarce, preclini- cal studies so far do provide evidence that this compound could induce antidepressant-like effects.Clinical studies are important to conrm this possibility. (a)Mechanisms of cannabidiol antidepressant effects Similar to ndings with animal models of anxiety, theattenuation of the behavioural consequences of restraintstress and the antidepressant-like effects of CBD in the forced swimming test were attenuated by a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist [ 17,128]. In the latter model, despite the association between increasedexpression of neurotrophic factors and antidepressantactivity [ 130], CBD modify brain-derived neurotrophic factor hippocampal levels [ 128]. As discussed earlier, CBD can also facilitate hippo- campal neurogenesis, probably by facilitation of eCBneurotransmission [ 72]. The involvement of this mechanism on its antidepressant-like properties afterrepeated administration remains to be investigated. 5. CONCLUSIONS CBD is a safe compound with a wide range oftherapeutic applications, including the treatment of psychiatric disorders [ 3,4]. These ndings make this drug an attractive candidate for future clinical use. Its therapeutic use, however, has some limiting factors.In addition to its low and variable oral bioavailability inhumans [ 135], it causes bell-shaped dose-response curves and, judging from the studies with laboratoryanimals, possesses a narrow therapeutic dose range. A clear target of future research, therefore, is to try to develop compounds with similar safety and clini-cal prole but with larger effective dose ranges. Tothis aim, a better understanding of the mechanismsr e s p o n s i b l ef o rt h eu n i q u ep r o p e r t i e so fC B Di se s s e n t i a l .The behaviour studies reviewed here clearly indicatethat more than one mechanism is involved, dependingon the effects being measured (anxiolytic, anti-compulsive, antidepressant or antipsychotic-like) andthe drug regime (single versus repeated administration).Facilitation of 5-HT1A-mediated neurotransmission in key brain areas related to defensive responses, including the dorsal periaqueductal grey, bed nucleus anti-compulsive, increased extinc-tion and impaired reconsolidation of aversive memories, facilitation of adult hippocampal neurogen- esis and blockade of the anxiogenic consequences ofchronic unpredictable stress could depend on poten-tiation of anandamide-mediated neurotransmission.Finally, activation of TRPV1 channels may help us toexplain the antipsychotic effect and the bell-shapeddose-response curves commonly observed with CBD. In addition to these mechanisms, CBD can interfere in several other important biological processes (e.g. inhi-bition of adenosine uptake, inverse increase, etc.). Additional in vivo studies are clearly needed to investigate their possible involvement onCBD behavioural effects. This work was supported by grants from CNPq, CAPES, NAPNA-USP and FAPESP .

Blessing1&Maria M. Steenkamp1&Jorge Manzanares1,2& Charles R. Marmar1 Published online: 4 September 2015 #The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc. 2015 Abstract Cannabidiol (CBD), a Cannabis sativa constituent, is a pharmacologically broad-spectrum drug that in recent years has drawn increasing interest as a treatment for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of the current re- view is to determine CBD 's potential as a treatment for anxiety-related disorders, by assessing evidence from preclin-ical, human experimental, clinical, and epidemiological stud-ies. We found that existing preclinical evidence strongly sup- ports CBD as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder when adminis- tered acutely; however, few studies have investigated chronic CBD dosing. Likewise, evidence from human studies sup-ports an anxiolytic role of CBD, but is currently limited to acute dosing, also with few studies in clinical populations. Overall, current evidence indicates CBD has considerable po-tential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders, with need for further study of chronic and therapeutic effects in relevant clinical populations. Keywords Cannabidiol .Endocannabinoids .Anxiety . Generalized anxiety disorder .Post-traumatic stress disorderIntroduction Fear and anxiety are adaptive responses essential to coping with threats to survival. Yet excessive or persistent fear may be maladaptive, leading to disability. Symptoms arising from excessive fear and anxiety occur in a number of neuropsychi- atric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),panic disorder (PD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety -compulsive dis- order Notably, PTSD and OCD are no longer classi- fied as anxiety disorders in the recent revision of the Diagnos- tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5; however, excessive anxiety is central to the symptomatology of bothdisorders. These anxiety-related disorders are associated with a diminished sense of well-being, elevated rates of unemploy- ment and relationship breakdown, and elevated suicide risk[1-3]. Together, they have a lifetime prevalence in the USA of 29 % [ 4], the highest of any mental disorder, and constitute an immense social and economic burden [ 5,6]. Currently available pharmacological treatments and atypical antipsy- chotics are also to treat PTS D. These medications are asso- ciated with limited response rates and residual symptoms, partic-ularly in PTSD, and adverse effects may also limit tolerability and adherence [ 7-10]. The substantial burden of anxiety-related disorders and the limitations of current treatments place a high priority on developing novel pharmaceutical treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid constituent of Cannabis psychoactive CBD has broad erties across a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, stemmingfrom diverse central nervous system actions [ 11,12].

The purpose of this review is to assess evidence from current preclinical, clinical, and epi- demiological studies pertaining to the potential risks and ben- efits of CBD as a treatment for anxiety disorders. Methods A search of MEDLINE (PubMed) , PsycINFO, Web of Science Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted for English-language papers published up to 1 January 2015, usingthe Bcannabidiol ^and ^orBpost-trau- matic stress disorder^ orBpanic disorder ^orBobsessive com- pulsive disorder ^. In total, 49 primary preclinical, clinical, or epidemiological studies were in cluded. Neuroimaging studies that documented results from anxi ety-related tasks, or resting neural activity, were included. Epidemiological or clinical stud-ies that assessed CBD 's effects on anxiety symptoms, or the potential protective effects of CBD on anxiety symptoms in- duced by cannabis use (where the CBD content of cannabis is inferred via a higher CBD:T HC ratio), were included. CBD Pharmacology Relevant to Anxiety General Pharmacology and Therapeutic Profile Cannabis sativa ,as p e c i e so ft h e Cannabis genus of flowering plants, is one of the most frequently used illicit recreational substances in Western culture. The 2 major phyto- cannabinoidconstituents with central nervous system activity are THC, re- sponsible for the euphoric and mind-altering effects, and CBD, which lacks these psychoactive eff ects. Preclinical and clinical studies show CBD possesses a wide range of therapeutic [11 ,12,16-19]f o r reviews). A review of potential side effects in humans found that CBD was well tolerated across a wide dose range, up to 1500 mg/day (orally), with no reported psychomotor slowing, negative mood effects, or vital sign abnormalities noted [ 20]. CBD has a broad pharmacological profile, including inter- actions with several receptors known to regulate fear andanxiety-related behaviors, specifically the cannabinoid type1 receptor (CB 1R), the 5-HT 1Areceptor, receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1)receptor [ 11,12,19,21]. In addition, CBD may also regulate, directly or indirectly, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- , the orphan G-protein-coupled transporter, the TRP channels, and glycine receptors [ 11,12,19, 21]. In the current review of primary studies, the following receptor-specific actions were found to have been investigated as potential mediators of CBD 's to actions is detailed below. The Endocannabinoid System Following cloning of the endogenous receptor for THC, endogenous 2-arachidonoylglycerol in [ 22]). The CB 1R is an inhibitory G i/oprotein-coupled receptor that is mainly localized to nerve terminals, and is expressed on both -aminobutryic acid-ergic and glutamatergic neurons. eCBs are fatty acid derivatives that are synthesized on demand inresponse to neuronal depolarization and Ca 2+influx, via cleavage primary mecha- nism by which eCBs regulate synaptic function is retrograde signaling, wherein eCBs produced by depolarization of thepostsynaptic neuron activate presynaptic CB 1Rs, leading to inhibition of neurotransmitter release [ 23]. The BeCB system ^ and related CB 2re- ceptor (the latter expressed mainly in the periphery); as well as several other receptors activated by eCBs, including the TRPV1 receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated which func- tionally interact with CB 1R signaling (reviewed in [ 21,24]). Interactions with the TRPV1 receptor, in particular, appear tobe critical in regulating the extent to which eCB release leadsto inhibition or facilitation of presynaptic neurotransmitter re- The TRPV1 receptor is postsynaptic cation chan- nel that underlies sensation of noxious heat in the periphery, with capsacin (hot chili) as an exogenous ligand. TRPV1 re- ceptors are also expressed in the brain, including the amygdala, periaqueductal grey, hippocampus, and other areas [ 26,27]. The eCB system regulates diverse physiological functions, including caloric energy balance and immune function [ 28]. The eCB system is also integral to regulation of emotionalbehavior, being essential to forms of synaptic plasticity that determine learning and response to emotionally salient, par- ticularly highly aversive events [ 29,30]. Activation of CB 1Rs produces anxiolytic effects in various models of uncondi-tioned fear, relevant to multiple anxiety disorder symptomdomains (reviewed in [ 30-33]). Regarding conditioned fear, the effect of CB 1R activation is complex: CB 1R activation may enhance or reduce fear expression, depending on brainlocus and the eCB ligand [ 34]; however, CB 1R activation potently enhances fear extinction [ 35], and can prevent fear reconsolidation. Genetic manipulations that impede826 Blessing et al.CB1R activation are anxiogenic [ 35], and individuals with eCB system gene polymorphisms that reduce eCB tone \u2014 for example, FAAH gene polymorphisms \u2014exhibit physio- logical, psychological, and neuroimaging features consis- tent with impaired fear regulation [ 36]. Reduction of AEA- CB 1R signaling in the amygdala the anxiogenic effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone[37], and CB 1R activation is essential to negative feedback of the neuroendocrine stress response, and protects against the adverse effects of chronic stress [ 38,39]. Finally, chronic stress impairs eCB signaling in the hippocampusand amygdala, leading to anxiety [ 40,41], and people with PTSD show elevated CB 1R availability and reduced peripheral AEA, suggestive of reduced eCB tone [ 42]. Accordingly, CB 1R activation has been suggested as a tar- get for anxiolytic drug development [ 15,43,44]. Proposed agents for enhancing CB 1R activation include THC, which is a potent and direct agonist; synthetic CB 1R agonists; FAAH inhibitors and other agents that increase eCB as well as nonpsychoactive cannabis phytocannabinoids, includ- ing CBD. While CBD for the CB 1R, it func- tions as an indirect agonist, potentially via augmentation of CB1R constitutional activity, or via increasing AEA through FAAH inhibition (reviewed in [ 21]). Several complexities of the eCB system may impact upon the potential of CBD and other CB 1R-activating agents to serve as anxiolytic drugs. First, CB 1R agonists, including THC and AEA, have a biphasic effect: low doses are anxiolytic, but higher doses are ineffective or anxiogenic, in both preclinicalmodels in and humans (reviewed in [ 33,45]). This biphasic profile may stem from the capacity of CB 1R agonists to also activate TRPV1 receptors when administered at a high,but not low dose, as demonstrated for AEA [ 46]. Activation of TRPV1 receptors is predominantly anxiogenic, and thus acritical balance of eCB levels, determining CB1 versus TRPV1 activation, is proposed to govern emotional behavior [27 ,47]. CBD acts as a TRPV1 agonist at high concentrations, poten-tially by interfering with AEA inactivation [48]. In addition todose-dependent activation of TRPV1 channels, the anxiogenic versus anxiolytic balance of CB 1R agonists also depends on dynamic factors, including environmental 33,49]. 5-HT 1AReceptors The other 5-HT 1AR agonists are approved for the treatment of GAD, with fair response rates [ 50]. In preclinical studies, 5-HT 1AR agonists are anxiolytic in animal models of general anxiety [ 51], prevent the adverse effects of stress [ 52], and enhance fear extinction [ 53]. Both pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT 1ARs are coupled to various members of the Gi/oprotein family. They are expressed on serotonergic neurons in the raphe, where they exert autoinhibitory function, andvarious other brain areas involved in fear and anxiety[54,55]. Mechanisms underlying the anxiolytic effects of 5-HT 1AR activation are complex, varying between both brain region, and pre- versus postsynaptic locus, and are not fully established [ 56]. While in vitro studies suggest CBD acts as a direct 5-HT 1AR agonist [ 57], in vivo or facilitator of 5-HT 1A signaling [ 58]. Preclinical Evaluations Generalized Anxiety Models Relevant studies in animal models are summarized in chro- nological order in Table 1. CBD has been studied in a wide range of animal models of general anxiety, including the elevated plus maze (EPM), the V ogel-conflict test (VCT), and the elevated T maze (ETM). See Table 1for the anxi- olytic effect specific to each paradigm. Initial studies of CBD in these models showed conflicting results: high (100 mg/kg) doses were ineffective, while low (10 mg/kg) doses were anxiolytic [ 59,60]. When tested over a wide range of doses in further studies, the anxiolytic effects of CBD presented a bell-shaped dose -response curve, with an- xiolytic effects observed at moderate but not higher doses [61,90]. All further studies of acute systemic CBD without prior stress showed anxiolytic effects or no effect [ 62,65], the latter study involving intracerebroventricular rather thanthe intraperitoneal anxiogenic effects of acute sys- temic CBD dosing in models of general anxiety have yet been reported. As yet, few studies have examined chronicdosing effects of CBD in models of generalized anxiety. Campos et al. [ 66] showed that in rat, CBD treatment for 21 days attenuated inhibitory avoidance acquisition [ 83]. Long et al. [ 69] showed that, in mouse, CBD produced moderate anxiolytic effects in some paradigms, with no ef- fects in others. Anxiolytic effects of CBD in models of generalized anxiety have been linked to specific receptor mechanisms and brainregions. The midbrain dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) isintegral to anxiety, orchestrating autonomic and behavioral responses to threat [ 91], and DPAG stimulation in humans produces feelings of intense distress and dread [ 92]. Microin- jection of CBD into the in the EPM, VGC, and ETM that were partially mediated byactivation of 5-HT 1ARs but not by CB 1Rs [65,68]. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) serves as a principaloutput structure of the amygdaloid complex to coordinatesustained fear responses, relevant to anxiety [ 93]. Anxiolytic effects of CBD in the EPM and VCT occurred upon microin-jection into the BNST, where they depended on 5-HT 1ARCannabidiol as a Potential Treatment for Anxiety Disorders 827Table 1 Preclinical studies Study Animal Route Dose Model Effect Receptor Involvement Silveira Filho et al.

In the prelimbic cortex, which drives expression of fear responses via connections with the amygdala [ 94], CBD had more complex effects: acute was anxiolytic [ 87]. Finally, the anxi- olytic effects of systemic CBD partially depended onGABA Areceptor activation in the EPM model but not in the VCT model [ 61,62]. As noted, CBD has been found to have a bell-shaped re- sponse curve, with higher doses being ineffective. This mayreflect activation of TRPV1 receptors at higher dose, as block- ade of TRPV1 receptors in the DPAG rendered a previously ineffective high dose of CBD as anxiolytic in the EPM [ 66]. Given TRPV1 receptors have anxiogenic effects, this may indicate that at higher doses, CBD 's interaction with TRPV1 receptors to some extent impedes anxiolytic actions, although was notably not sufficient to produce anxiogenic effects. Stress-induced Anxiety Models Stress is an important contributor to anxiety disorders, and traumatic stress exposure is essential to the development of PTSD. Systemically administered CBD reduced acute in- creases in heart rate and blood pressure induced by restraintstress, as well as the delayed (24 h) anxiogenic effects of stress in the EPM, partially by 5-HT activation [ 67,73]. How- ever intra-BNST microinjection of CBD augmented stress- induced heart rate increase, also partially via 5-HT 1ARa c t i v a - tion [ 85]. In a subchronic study, CBD administered daily 1 h after predator stress (a proposed model of PTSD) reduced thelong-lasting anxiogenic effects of chronic predator stress, par- tially via 5-HT 1AR activation [ 77]. In a chronic study, system- ic CBD prevented increased anxiety produced by chronic un- predictable stress, in addition to increasing hippocampal AEA; these anxiolytic effects depended upon CB 1R activation and hippocampal neurogenesis, as demonstrated by genetic ablation techniques [ 81]. Prior stress also appears to modulate anxiogenic of animals was anxiogenic in theEPM but following restraint stress was found to be anxiolytic [87]. Likewise, systemic CBD was anxiolytic in the EPM following but not prior to stress [ 65]. PD and Compulsive Behavior Models CBD inhibited escape responses in the ETM and increased DPAG escape electrical threshold [ 68], both proposed models of panic attacks [ 95]. These effects partially depended on 5- HT 1AR activation but were not affected by CB 1R blockade. CBD was also panicolytic in the predator -prey model, whichassesses explosive escape and defensive immobility in re- sponse to a boa constrictor snake, also partially via 5-HT 1AR activation; however, more consistent with an anxiogenic ef- fect, CBD was also noted to decrease time spent outside the burrow and increase defensive attention (not shown in Table 1)[75,86] . Finally, CBD, partially via CB 1Rs, de- immobility and explosive escape caused by neuronal activation in the superior colliculus [ 89]. Anticompulsive of CBD were investi- marble-burying conceptualized to model [ 96]. Acute systemic CBD reduced marble-burying be- havior for up to 7 days, with no attenuation in effect up to high (120 mg/kg) doses, and effect shown to depend on CB 1Rs but not 5-HT 1ARs [71,74,88]. Contextual Fear Conditioning, Fear Extinction, and Reconsolidation Blockade Several studies assessed CBD using contextual fear condition- ing. Briefly, this paradigm involves pairing a neutral context, the conditioned stimulus (CS), with an aversive unconditionedstimulus (US), a mild foot shock. After repeated pairings, the subject learns that the CS predicts the US, and subsequent CS presentation elicits freezing and other physiological re-sponses. Systemic administration of CBD prior to CS re-exposure reduced conditioned cardiovascular re- sponses [ 63], an effect reproduced by microinjection of CBD into the BNST, and partially mediated by 5- HT 1AR activation [79 ]. Similarly, CBD in the prelimbic cortex reduced conditioned freezing [70], an effect p r e v e n t e db y5 - H T 1ARb l o c k a d e[ 87]. By contrast, CBD microinjection in the infralimbic cortex enhanced c o n d i t i o n e df r e e z i n g[ 70]. Finally, El Batsh et al. [ 80] reported that repeated CBD doses over 21 days, that is chronic as opposed to acute treatment, facilitated condi- tioned freezing. In this study, CBD was administered prior to conditioning rather than prior to re-exposure as in acute studies, thus further directly comparablestudies are required. CBD has also been shown to enhance extinction of contextually conditioned fear responses. Extinction train-ing involves repeated CS exposure in the absence of theUS, leading to the formation of a new memory that inhibits fear responses and a decline in freezing over subsequent training sessions. Systemic CBD administra- tion immediately before training markedly enhanced ex- tinction, and this effect depended on CB 1R activation, without involvement of TRPV1 receptors [65 ]. Further studies showed CB 1Rs in the infralimbic cortex may be involved in this effect [ 82]. CBD also blocked reconsolidation of aversive memo- ries in rat [76 ]. Briefly, fear memories, when reactivated by re-exposure (retrieval) , enter into a labile state in830 Blessing et al.which the memory trace may either be reconsolidated or extinguished [ 97], and this process may be pharmacolog- ically modulated to achieve reconsolidation blockade or extinction. When administered immediately following re- trieval, CBD prevented freezing to the conditioned con- text upon further re-exposure, and no reinstatement orspontaneous recovery was observed over 3 weeks, con- sistent with reconsolidation blockade rather than extinc- tion [ 76]. This effect depended on CB 1R activation but not 5-HT 1ARa c t i v a t i o n[ 76]. Summary and Clinical Relevance Overall, existing preclinical evidence strongly supports the potential of CBD as a treatment for anxiety disor-ders. CBD exhibits a broad range of actions, relevant to multiple symptom domains, including anxiolytic, panicolytic, and anticompulsive actions, as well as adecrease in autonomic arousal, a decrease in conditioned fear expression, enhancement of fear ex- tinction, reconsolidation blockade, and prevention of thelong-term anxiogenic effects of stress. Activation of 5- HT 1ARs appears to mediate anxiolytic and panicolytic effects, in addition to reducing conditioned fear expres- sion, although CB 1R activation may play a limited role. By contrast, CB 1R activation appears to mediate CBD' s anticompulsive effects, enhancement of fear extinction,reconsolidation blockade, and capacity to prevent the long-term anxiogenic consequences of stress, with in- volvement of hippocampal neurogenesis. While CBD predominantly has acute anxiolytic ef- fects, some species discrepancies are apparent. In addi-tion, effects may be contingent on prior stress and varyaccording to brain region. A notable contrast between CBD and other agents that target the eCB system, in- THC, direct CB 1R inhibi- tors, is a lack of anxiogenic effects at a higher dose. Further receptor-specific studies may elucidate the recep- tor specific basis of this distinct dose response profile.Further studies are also required to establish the efficacy of CBD when administered in chronic dosing, as rela- tively few relevant studies exist, with mixed results, in-cluding both anxiolytic and anxiogenic outcomes. Overall, preclinical evidence supports systemic CBD as an acute treatment of GAD, SAD, PD, OCD, and PTSD, and suggests that CBD has the advantage of not producing anxiogenic effects at higher dose, as dis-tinct from other agents that enhance CB 1R activation. In particular, results show potential for the treatment ofmultiple PTSD symptom domains, including reducingarousal and avoidance, preventing the long-term adverse effects of stress, as well as enhancing the extinction and blocking the reconsolidation of persistent fear memories.Human Experimental and Clinical Studies Evidence from Acute Psychological Studies Relevant studies are summarized in Table 2. The anxiolytic effects of CBD in humans were first demonstrated in the con- text of reversing the anxiogenic effects of THC. CBD reduced THC-induced anxiety when administered simultaneously with this agent, but had no effect on baseline anxiety when admin-istered alone [ 99,100]. Further studies using higher doses supported a lack of anxiolytic effects at baseline [ 101,107]. By contrast, CBD potently reduces experimentally inducedanxiety or fear. CBD reduced anxiety associated with a simu- lated public speaking test in healthy subjects, and in subjects with SAD, showing a comparable efficacy to ipsapirone (a 5-HT 1ARa g o n i s t )o rd i a z e p a m[ 98,105]. CBD also reduced the presumed anticipatory undergoing asingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) im-aging procedure, in both healthy and SAD subjects [ 102,104]. Finally, CBD enhanced extinction of fear memories in healthyvolunteers: specifically, inhaled CBD administered prior to orafter extinction training in a contextual fear conditioning par- adigm led to a trend-level enhancement in the reduction of skin conductance response during reinstatement, and a signif- icant reduction in expectancy (of shock) ratings during rein- statement [ 106]. Evidence from Neuroimaging Studies Relevant studies are summarized in Table 3. In a SPECTstudy of resting cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in normal subjects, CBD reduced rCBF in left medial temporal areas, including the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as the hypothalamusand left posterior gyrus, increased rCBF in These rCBF changes were not correlated with anxiolytic effects [ 102]. In a SPECT study, by the same authors, in patients with SAD, CBD reduced rCBF in overlapping, but distinct, limbic and paralimbic areas; again, with no correlations to anxiolytic effects [ 104]. In a series of placebo-contr olled studies involving 15 healthy volunteers, Fusar-Poli et al. the effectsof CBD and THC on blood-oxygen-level imaging activation, spe- cifically the go/no-go and fearful faces tasks [ 109,110]. The go/no-go task measures response inhibition, and prefrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and parietal areas [ 111]. Response activation is diminished in PTSD and other anxiety disorders, and increased activation predicts response to treatment [ 112]. CBD produced no changes in predicted areas (relative to placebo) but reduced activation in the left insula, superior temporal gyrus, and trans- verse temporal gyrus. The fearful faces task activates the amygdala, and other medial temporal areas involved inCannabidiol as a Potential Treatment for Anxiety Disorders 831Table 2 Human psychological studies Study Subjects, designCBD route,doseMeasure Effect Karniol et al.

CBD attenuated blood-oxygen-level dependent activation in amygdala, and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex in response to intensely fearful faces, and also reduced amplitude in skin conductance fluctu-ation, which was highly correlated with amygdala activation [109]. Dynamic causal modeling analysis in this data set fur- ther showed CBD reduced forward functional connectivity between the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex [ 110]. Evidence from Epidemiological and Chronic Studies Epidemiological studies of various neuropsychiatric disorders indicate that a higher CBD content in chronically consumed cannabis may protect against adverse effects of THC, includ- ing psychotic symptoms, drug cravings, memory loss, andhippocampal gray matter loss [ 115-118] (reviewed in [ 119]). As THC acutely induces anxiety, this pattern may also beevident for chronic anxiety symptoms. Two studies were iden-tified, including an uncontrolled retrospective study in civilian patients with PTSD patients [ 120], and a case study in a pa- tient with severe sexual abuse-related PTSD [121 ], which showed that chronic cannabis use significantly reduces PTSDsymptoms; however, these studies did not include data on the THC:CBD ratio. Thus, overall, no outcome data are currentlyavailable regarding the chronic effects of CBD in the treat- ment of anxiety symptoms, nor do any data exist regarding the potential protective effects of CBD on anxiety potentially in-duced by chronic THC use. Summary and Clinical Relevance Evidence from human studies strongly supports the potential for CBD as a treatment for anxiety disorders: at oral dosesranging from 300 to 600 mg, CBD reduces experimentally induced anxiety in healthy controls, without affecting baseline anxiety levels, and reduces anxiety in patients with SAD.Limited results in healthy subjects also support the efficacy of CBD in acutely enhancing fear extinction, suggesting po- tential for the treatment of PTSD, or for enhancing cognitive behavioral therapy. Neuroimaging findings provide evidence of neurobiological targets that may underlie CBD 's anxiolytic effects, including reduced amygdala activation and altered medial prefrontal amygdala connectivity, although current findings are limited by small sample sizes, and a lack of inde-pendent replication. Further studies are also required to estab- lish whether chronic, in addition to acute CBD dosing is an- xiolytic in human. Also, clinical findings are currently limitedto SAD, whereas preclinical evidence suggests CBD 'sp o t e n - tial to treat multiple symptom domains relevant to GAD, PD,and, particularly, PTSD.Conclusions Preclinical evidence conclusively demonstrates CBD 'se f f i c a - cy in reducing anxiety behaviors relevant to multiple disor- ders, including PTSD, GAD, PD, OCD, and SAD, with a notable lack of anxiogenic effects. CBD 's anxiolytic actions appear to depend upon CB 1Rs and 5-HT 1ARs in several brain regions; however, investigation of additional receptor actionsmay reveal further mechanisms. Human experimental find-ings support preclinical findings, and also suggest a lack of anxiogenic effects, minimal sedative effects, and an excellent safety profile. Current preclinical and human findings mostlyinvolve acute CBD dosing in healthy subjects, so further stud- ies are required to establish whether chronic dosing of CBD has similar effects in relevant clinical populations. Overall,this review emphasizes the potential value and need for further study of CBD in the treatment of anxiety disorders.

Cannabis has been reported anecdotally as being beneficial for a number of commonsymptoms and complications in HIV infections, for example, poor appetite and neuropathy. This study aimed to investigate symptom management with cannabis. Following Ethics Committee approval, HIV-positive individuals attending a large clinic were recruited into an anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire study. Up to one-third (27%, 143/523) reported using cannabis for treating symptoms. Patients reported improved appetite (97%),muscle pain (94%), nausea (93%), anxiety (93%), paresthesia (85%). Many cannabis users (47%) reported associated memory deterioration. Symptom control using cannabis is widespread in HIV outpatients. A largenumber of patients reported that cannabis improved symptom control. J Pain Symptom Manage 2005;29:358-367. /L502622005 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This has increased the clinical focus on the management of chronic symptoms associated with both HIV and the sideeffects of antiretroviral medication. Recently, in small sample studies of HIV patients, the medici- nal use of cannabis has been documented as a treatment for varied symptoms. 4-7 Symptoms associated with HIV occur as both direct and indirect consequences of the diseaseprocess and as a side effect of the antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of the disease. These symptoms include nausea and vomiting,pain (e.g., in a nerve distribution), reduced ap-petite, weight loss, headaches, diarrhea,constipation, anxiety, and depression. Flu-likesymptoms and severe myalgia can result directlyVol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 359 Cannabis Use in HIV for Symptom Control from seroconversion early in the disease. Cen- tral pain and peripheral neuropathy can occur as a result of viral-mediated neurotoxicity, sec- ondary to either mitochondrial damage, demy-elination, or low B 12levels, all of which have been observed in patients with HIV. The inflam-mation that occurs as a result of the mito-chondrial damage can result in HIV-related encephalopathy or HIV-related colitis. Symp- toms may also occur secondary to infections ortumors, which have resulted from HIV-related immunosuppression. Examples of this include nausea and dysphagia from esophageal can-dida, or pain from a gastrointestinal lymphoma. Symptoms commonly occurring as a side effect of HIV treatment include renal colic from nephrolithiasis associated with the protease inhibitor, indinavir; painful peripheral neu-ropathy from use of stavudine, or sleep from the non- nucleoside inhibitor, efavirenz. Thus, a widerange of symptoms can significantly affect the quality of life of individuals living with HIV as a long-term chronic infection. 8,9 It has been recognized that cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),which is now available as a licensed pharmaceu-tical preparation, can improve appetite and re- lieve nausea and vomiting. 10Cannabis plant material not only contains THC but also other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), that may mitigate psychotic mood effects of THC.11 The aim of this study was to measure the patterns and prevalence of cannabis use in pa-tients presenting at a large HIV clinic and to evaluate its beneficial or detrimental effect on symptom control. Methods Subjects Following Ethics Committee approval, HIV- positive patients were recruited into an anony- mous cross-sectional questionnaire survey using a single center. The outpatient clinic provided a walk-in service as well as pre-arranged appoint-ments, including pharmacy and phlebo- tomy sections. All patients entering the clinic were asked to verbally consent to participate inthe study. Written consent was not obtained in order to protect patient anonymity. The number of patients who refused to take partwas recorded. Many patients were regular clinicusers, had discussed their symptoms with HIV and pain specialists, and were able to distin- guish between the various types of pain de-scribed on the questionnaire. A researcher was available to answer questions (e.g., on the inter- pretation of words). Patients completed thequestionnaire while waiting and confidentiality was maintained by enumerating the papers without patient identification. Questionnaire The questionnaire was piloted to refine its content, word use, and format and then issuedto patients attending the clinic. The question-naire (see Appendix) was designed to contain close-ended questions with defined yes/no or categorical responses. It was divided into sec- tions. The first included demographics (age, sex, number of years with HIV) and a vali-dated scale to measure degree of disability de- scribed by Sharrack and Hughes. 12The second had specific questions concerning the patient's use of cannabis medically to treat symptoms of HIV. These symptoms included those directly related to HIV plus those resulting from theirmedication. Those who did not use cannabis for medicinal purposes, including those who used it solely for recreation, were not requiredto continue completing the questionnaire, al- though their demographic details were re- corded. The next section included questionsrelating to frequency, patterns, and reasons for cannabis use. Then in tabular form, a range of symptoms were listed (Table 1), and against Table 1 Order of Symptom List in Questionnaire as Scored by Patients for Benefit or Detriment Lack of appetite Feeling sick (i.e., nausea) Tremor DepressionAnxietyWeight loss Weakness TirednessVision dimness Slurred speech Memory lossConstipationHeadaches Diarrhea Pain in musclesNerve painTingling Numbness360 Vol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 Woolridge et al. each one, the patient was invited to score bene- fit or detriment as the symptoms of pain and sensory changes,the questionnaire also contained 'body dia- grams', that is, pain maps, so that the patients could mark where they identified their nerveor muscle pain, tingling and numbness. Analysis Data from the questionnaires were entered into an Access database (Windows 98 version)and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 11.5, SPSS Inc., Chicago). Categorical data comparing the sex differencesbetween the two groups and symptom severity were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test. Be- cause the distribution of age and the numberof years with HIV were not normal and had some outliers, the differences in these variables between the two groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Both simple frequency analysis and the sign test were used in assessingthe percentage improvement or deterioration in symptoms. Results A total of 523 questionnaires were completed from 565 patients approached. This was a 93% response rate. Of those who completed the study, 143 (27%) used cannabis to treat symp- toms associated with HIV. Physical Data The sex, age, years with HIV, disability, and cannabis user status are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

Compared with females, males were statistically significantly likely to be cannabis users (P /H11021 0.01) and those who had the disease for longer and were more disabled were also more likely to be users (P /H110210.01). When nerve pain was reported on the pain map, it was experienced mainly in the legs, andless in the feet and hands (27, 19, and 15 pa-tients, respectively). Muscle pain was predomi- nantly localized to the legs, but also to the lower back, shoulders and neck (46, 19, and 19 pa-tients, respectively). Tingling and numbness was experienced in the periphery, with the hands and feet being affected (34 and 26 patients, respectively). Patient Choice of Route and Timing for Symptom Control Of the 143 patients who had used cannabis to treat HIV symptoms, 107 (75%) were current users. Within the whole group, smoking was the single route of administration in 101 (71%),and was combined with eating and drinking the plant in 39 (27%); ingestion was the only route in 3 (2%). On a day that cannabis wasused, 50 patients (36%) would take it once, 33 (23%) twice, 23 (16%) three times, and 35 (24%) four or more times. Most patients (79/143 [55%]) were daily users and 15 (11%) used it weekly. Others reported intermittent adminis- tration during the week. Thus, all patients re-ported using cannabis at least once a week to relieve symptoms. Throughout the day, the majority of patients (91/143 [64%]) took cannabis after 6 p.m. andVol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 361 Cannabis Use in HIV for Symptom Control Table 3 Demographic Differences Between Users and Non-Users of Cannabis for Symptom Control Users n/H11005143 However, an overlapping group (66/143 [46%]) also reported use at anytime if necessary. The reasons for taking the cannabis at these times were reported in a struc- tured format, as detailed in Table 4. A number of reasons related to the time of administration,not least of which was recreational use together with medicinal use. Relief of symptoms of anxi-ety and depression was common, as was generalsymptom relief. The reported use for relaxation may reflect the time at which it was taken, namely, during the evening. Effect on Symptoms A lack of appetite was the most frequent symptom reported (Table 5) and 97% experi-enced improvement with cannabis use. Pain wasthe next most frequent, being present in 45%of patients and improved in 94% of them. Thecollective results demonstrated statistically sig-nificant improvement in half or more patients in symptoms of nausea, anxiety, nerve pain, de- pression, tingling, numbness, weight loss, head-aches, tremor, constipation, and tiredness.Symptoms that were not improved includedweakness and slurred speech, and statistically significant memory deterioration was recorded in 47% of users.

In addition, their ages and duration of HIV disease were comparable with thegeneral UK data for such patients. 13Our sample of 523 patients has the highest response rate and is the largest study of its kind. It com- pares with previous studies, which have hadsamples ranging from 72 subjects 7to 442.6This detailed report of cannabis use for symptomcontrol in a clinically significantly large groupof patients can form the basis for more exten- sive investigations using purified and standard- ized cannabis extracts. Despite the fact that cannabis is still illegal, its use for medical purposes appears to be quitewidespread. A report from the British MedicalAssociation 14stated \"many normally law abiding citizens\u2014probably many thousands veloped world\" use cannabis illegally for ther- apy. Wesner15reported from an anonymous mail survey of 123 HIV-positive patients in Honolulu that 36.9% of them used cannabisfor therapeutic reasons. Approximately one-quarter of 228 HIV-positive men in the SydneyMen and Sexual Health study reported thera-peutic use of cannabis. 16Thirty-two percent (32%) of 72 patients at a clinic in Alabamareported the medical use of marijuana. 7These results are comparable to a more recent studycarried out in Northern California, in which33.3% of HIV-positive patients who respondedto an anonymous mailed questionnaire usedcannabis to treat symptoms associated with their disease. 6Our study expanded these findings in a large city clinic population by focusing on the patient's perceived improvement or worseningof symptoms for which cannabis was consideredthe origin. The large number of patients using cannabis as medicinal therapy for symptoms related to HIV raises a number of issues. First, patients are being left with no alternative but to use anon-medical source of supply, which has the362 Vol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 Woolridge et al.

Second, if part of the plantmaterial has therapeutic efficacy, the source of this material should be standardized and sub- jected to clinical trials so that safe and effectiveuse is advocated. Third, the patient is unlikely to divulge cannabis use to their medical team, so that potential drug interactions with pre-scribed antiretroviral medications may be oc- curring. In addition, in this study, the number of purely recreational users was not determinedso that the overall incidence of drug interac- tions may be far greater. The type of drug inter- actions to be considered include loss of cognitive function because it is well-recognized that this is an effect of both cannabis 17and anti- retroviral drugs such as efavirenz.18Certainly, the loss of memory reported by these patientsis of clinical significance, particularly in themethodological design of clinical trials, and if it is the result of combining preparations, this may be investigated using known standardizedcannabinoid therapies. This approach may be one way to reduce additive effects and prevent patients being subject to the effects of unpre-dictable concentrations of illicit drugs. The positive responses to symptom control re- corded in this study, as exemplified in Table 5, suggest that it is highly probable that canna- binoid medications have a medicinal role in this condition for a number of reasons. First, theyare reported by patients to improve appetite, reduce weight loss, and alleviate nausea. 19-23 These effects have been recognized and synthetic THC (dronabinol) is licensed for use in the U.S. for this indication. However, no direct comparison has been attempted with acannabis plant extract that will contain not only THC but also other cannabinoids, of which CBD is reputed to reduce the adverse effectsof THC. 24Secondly, pain relief appears to be significant in cannabis users, thereby suggestinga potential target for investigation in the use ofcannabinoids as analgesics in HIV patients. Patients have reported various forms of pain with HIV, such as muscular and neuropathic pain, and these were characterized in the pain maps drawn by the patients. Currently availableanalgesic drugs have limited efficacy, particu- larly for neuropathic pain. 25Clearly, there is a need to develop alternative analgesic agents, such as cannabinoids, to improve the choice of therapies. There is animal evidence that canna- binoids have analgesic effects that operate inmodels of hyperalgesia allodynia, both indi- cators of the discovery of the endogenous cannabinoid sys- tem has led scientists to explore the role of endocannabinoids in chronic pain models.28,29 However, in clinical practice the choice of natu- ral or synthetic phyto- or endo-cannabinoids for clinical trials is very limited. There have been several anecdotal and clinical trial reports thatVol. 29 No. 4 April 2005 363 Cannabis Use in HIV for Symptom Control cannabis plant extract and synthetic THC and related analogues produce pain relief in humans.30-33For this present select group of HIV patients, given the reported symptoms ex- perienced using cannabis plant material, there is a strong concern from the medical commu- nity managing these patients to limit adverseside effects from self-administered drugs and to provide cannabinoids in a formulation and dosing schedule that avoids harm to the patient.For example, there is strong evidence that the smoking route of administration of cannabis is not safe long-term because of the carcinogenicproperties of a cannabis cigarette. 34 A pattern of cannabis use emerges from this study that is regular, ongoing, and treats the symptoms of HIV patients to their satisfaction. Given the sedative properties of cannabis, it isimportant to assess whether evening dosing for cannabinoid therapies is more useful or appro- priate. Its sedative effects may be helpful at thistime but none were reported as predominant. Presumably there is tolerance to these types of effects. 29More importantly, reduction of pain, anxiety, and gastrointestinal upset appears to be the constellation of symptom control sought by these HIV patients, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. In relation to HIV, there have been anecdotal reports35of patients who were already recre- ational users of cannabis reporting that it im- proved certain symptoms, such as loss of appetite and nausea, as well as pain and generalwell being. A small, uncontrolled study of 10 symptomatic AIDS patients reported that dro- nabinol might be effective in reducing nausea and increasing appetite. 10Where patients are also medicating with antiretroviral agents, the combination of cannabis and protease inhibi- tors may be detrimental by altering viral loads. Thus, the effect of smoking on the viral loadof HIV-infected patients was investigated by a short-term randomized placebo controlled trial. 36No adverse effects of either therapy were measured with respect to RNA levels, CD4/H11001and CD8/H11001cell counts, or protease inhibitor levels. This brief trial suggests that there are no obvi-ous harmful effects, but these need to be deter- mined using an appropriate route of drug administration and a longer-term study. There is accumulating evidence that suggests that cannabinoids have therapeutic applica-tions in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases,such as multiple sclerosis, 37,38Huntington's disease,39and brain injury.40So far, in terms of HIV, the evidence for therapeutic efficacy ofcannabinoids is still mainly anecdotal. We havesought to establish if an improvement from can- nabis use, albeit self-administered and not standardized, is seen in symptoms such as pain,appetite, and nausea in a large sample of HIV patients. To do this, we expanded on previous research by determining specifically the varietyand groups of symptoms that patients select to modify by their use of cannabis. We also secured a therapeutic timetable in order to predict thefrequency of drug administration for the patient's selected symptoms. These results will be important in the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing conventional treatments to cannabis for symp-toms of HIV.

Case Presentation: These symptoms were present in our patient, a ten-year-old girl who was sexually abused and had minimal parental supervision as a young child under the age of five. Phar - maceutical medications provided partial relief, but results were not long-lasting, and there were major side effects. A trial of cannabidiol oil resulted in a maintained decrease in anxiety and a steady improvement in the quality and quantity of the patient's sleep. Discussion: Cannabidiol oil, an in - creasingly popular treatment of anxiety and sleep issues, has been documented as being an effective alternative to phar - maceutical medications. This case study provides clinical data that support the use of cannabidiol oil as a safe treatment for reducing anxiety and improving sleep in a young girl with posttraumatic stress disorder. INTRODUCTION Cannabidiol (CBD) oil is a naturally oc - curring constituent of industrial hemp and marijuana, which are collectively called cannabis. CBD oil is 1 of at least 85 can - nabinoid compounds found in cannabis and is popular for its medicinal benefits. After tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD oil is the second-most-abundant compo - nent cannabis. Other names for CBD oil, CBD oil, or CBD-rich cannabis oil. Con - sidered to be generally safe, CBD has been used medicinally for decades. However, CBD is not medical marijuana and should be distinguished from high-CBD strains of medical marijuana, which do contain THC, such as \"Charlotte's Web.\" The most abundant compound in can - nabis, THC is also a cannabinoid. The THC component induces the psychoac - tive effect, \"high.\" A cannabis plant has different amounts of CBD and THC depending on the strain and thus provides different recreational or medicinal effects. The cannabinoid profile of industrial hemp or medical marijuana is ideal for people looking for the medical benefits of CBD without the \"high\" of the THC. The mechanism of action of CBD is multifold.1-3 T wo cannabinoid receptors are known to exist in the human body: CB1 and CB2 receptors. The CB1 recep-tors are located mainly in the brain and modulate neurotransmitter release in a manner that prevents excessive neuronal activity (thus calming and decreasing anxiety), as well as reduces pain, reduces inflammation, regulates movement and posture control, and regulates sensory perception, memory, and cognitive func-tion. a2 An endogenous ligand, anan - damide, which occurs naturally in our bodies, binds to the CB1 receptors through the G-protein coupling system. CBD has an indirect effect on the CB1 receptors by stopping the enzymatic breakdown of anandamide, allowing it to stay in the sys-tem longer and provide medical benefits. 4 CBD has a mild effect on the CB2 recep-tors, which are located in the periphery in lymphoid tissue. CBD helps to mediate the release of cytokines from the immune cells in a manner that helps to reduce inflam - mation and pain. 2 Other mechanisms of action of CBD include stimulation of vanilloid pain recep - tors (TRPV-1 receptor), which are known to mediate pain perception, inflamma-tion, and body temperature. 5 In addition, CBD may exert its anti-anxiety effect by activating adenosine receptors which play a significant role in cardiovascular function and cause a broad anti-inflammatory effect throughout the body. 5 At high concentra - tions, CBD directly activates the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor, thereby conferring an antidepressant effect. 6 Cannabidiol has been found to be an antagonist at the po-tentially new third cannabinoid receptor, GPR55, in the caudate nucleus and puta - men, which if stimulated may contribute to osteoporosis. 7 Since the 1940s, a considerable number of published articles have dealt with the chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical effects of CBD. 8 The last de- cade has shown a notable increase in the scientific literature on CBD, owing to its identification for reducing nausea and vomiting, combating psychotic disorders, reducing inflammation, decreasing anxi-ety and depression, improving sleep, and increasing a sense of well-being. 9-12 Find- ings presented at the 2015 International Cannabinoid Research Society at its 25th Annual Symposium reported the use of CBD as beneficial for kidney fibrosis and inflammation, metabolic syndrome, over - weight and obesity, anorexia-cachexia syn-drome, and modification of osteoarthritic and other musculoskeletal conditions. 13-16 Although studies have demonstrated the calming, anti-inflammatory, and relaxing effects of CBD, clinical data from actual cases is minimal. This case study offers evidence that CBD is effective as a safe alternative treatment to traditional psy - chiatric medications for reducing anxiety and insomnia. 17 CASE PRESENTATION A ten-year-old girl presented in Janu - ary 2015 for a reevaluation of behaviors related to her diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) secondary to sexual Scott Shannon, MD, ABIHM, is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Fort Collins.

Her chief issues included anxiety, insomnia, outbursts at school, suicidal ideation, and self-destructive behaviors. Her grandmother, who has permanent custody of the patient and her younger brother, accompanied her. Our patient had been seen for an initial evaluation in January 2012 and received a diagnosis of PTSD secondary to sexual abuse on the basis of her history, clinical observations, and behaviors (Table 1). Her father had died 6 months earlier in a motor vehicle accident, and our patient's maternal grandparents became her perma - nent guardians. Before her father's death, our patient had no supervision from her father and very little supervision from her mother. An 11-year-old boy had molested her when she was 3 years old. Her medi - cal history included her mother having methadone addiction, alcoholism, bipolar disorder, and depression. Her mother used marijuana her entire pregnancy with the girl. The patient presented in January 2012 as displaying aggressive, disobedient, im - pulsive, and sexually inappropriate behav-iors. She also demonstrated low self-esteem and anxiety and had poor sleep (restless, interrupted, and unable to sleep alone). Workup during 2012 included labora - tory studies, which ruled out a thyroid dysfunction and an iron or vitamin D deficiency. The patient was started on a Table 1.

Three grams of inositol 3 times a day and 500 mg/d of eicosapentaenoic fish oil were also helpful in reducing her anxiety. A trial of cloni - dine was implemented, which resulted in hallucinations and thus was discontinued. The patient was switched to a regimen of 25 mg of imipramine at bedtime to de-crease her anxiety, which appeared to be helpful. Counseling sessions were started. The patient continued psychotherapy for 3 years, but she was not seen again in our clinic until the return visit in January 2015, when she was not receiving any of her medications and supplements. At the patient's return in January 2015, she demonstrated the same prominent symptoms as at her initial presentation. At that time, the initial treatment in - cluded the following supplements and medications to assist with her sleep and anxiety: melatonin, 5 25 mg/night. Our patient demonstrated slight gains but was still hav - ing outbursts at school and was reportedly difficult to manage at home. In addition, her underlying anxiety continued. Cannabidiol oil was explored as a po - tential additional treatment to help her insomnia and anxiety, but we deferred for two months while we waited for a response from other interventions. The grandmother preferred reducing the phar - macologic load given her granddaughter's failure to respond long term to psychiatric medications. In March 2015, CBD oil was recom - mended as a potential additional treatment to help her insomnia and anxiety, and her grandmother provided full informed consent. Our patient was administered the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children 18 and the Screen for Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) 19 before taking the CBD oil and each month afterward for the next 5 months. Test scores on the Sleep Distur-bance Scale for Children and Screen for Anxiety Related Disorders demonstrated an improvement (Table 2). A trial of CBD supplements (25 mg) was then initiated at bedtime, and 6 mg to 12 mg of CBD sublingual spray was administered during the day as needed for anxiety. A gradual increase in sleep quality and quantity and a decrease in her anxiety were noted. After 5 months, the patient was sleeping in her own room most nights and handling the new school year with no difficulties. No side effects were observed from taking the CBD oil. DISCUSSION Studies repeatedly recognize the preva- lence of an anxiety-provoked sleep disor - der after a traumatic experience.20 Our patient was definitely experiencing this phenomenon, which was aggravated by daily stressful activities. The main finding from this case study is that CBD oil can be an effective com-pound to reduce anxiety and insomnia secondary to PTSD. A review of the lit-erature suggests some benefits from the use of CBD because of its anxiolytic and sleep-inducing effects. 9 Animal studies support use of this treatment and report that \" CBD may block anxiety-induced [rapid eye movement] sleep alteration via its anxiolytic effect on the brain.\" 21 The strength of this particular case is that our patient was receiving no phar - maceutical medications (other than non - prescription diphenhydramine) but only nutritional supplements and the CBD oil to control her symptoms. Her scores on the sleep scale and the anxiety scale consistently and steadily decreased during a period of 5 months (see Table 2). She was ultimately able to sleep through the night most nights in her own room, was less anxious at school and home, and dis - played appropriate behaviors. The patient's grandmother (her caregiver) reported: \"My granddaughter's behaviors are definitely better being on the CBD. Her anxiety is not gone, but it is not as intense and she is much easier to be around. She now sleeps in her own room most of the time, which has never happened before.\" Further study will need to be conducted to determine the permanency of our pa-tient's positive behaviors and how long she will need to continue taking the CBD oil. We do not have a reasonable foundation to recommend dosing from the scientific literature. However, in our experience, this supplement given 12 mg to 25 mg once daily appears to provide relief of key symptoms with minimal side effects. Our patient did not voice any complaints or discomfort from the use of CBD. We routinely asked about headache, fatigue, and change in appetite or agitation in ad - dition to conducting a routine psychiatric evaluation. Although CBD is considered generally safe, 17 the long-term effects are yet to be studied. The ultimate goal is to gradually taper her off the use of CBD oil and transition our patient into lifelong coping strategies such as yoga, meditation, and various other therapeutic activities. v a GW Pharmaceuticals is the founder of the Cannabinoid Research Institute, directed by Philip Robson, MD.

The medical literature contains a growing number of studies on cannabinoids as well as case studies and anecdotal reports suggesting therapeutic potential. Fifteen states have passed medical marijuana laws, but little is known about the growing population of patients who use mari- juana medicinally. This article reports on a sample of 1,746 patients from a network of nine medical marijuana evaluation clinics in Califomia. Patienu completed a standardized medical history form; evaluating physicians completed standardized evaluation forms. From this data we describe patient characteristics, self-reported presenting symptoms, physician evaluations, other treatments tried, other drug use, and medical marijuana use practices. Pain, insomnia, and anxiety were the most common conditions for which evaluating physicians recommended medical marijuana. Shifts in the medical marijuana patient population over time, the need for further research, and the issue of diversion are discussed.

Marijuana was admitted to the United States Pharmacopoeia in 1850 and listed in the National Formulary and the US Dispensatory. Major pharmaceutical companies including Lilly, Burroughs- Wellcome, and Parke-Davis produced cannabis-based therapeutic agents (Brecher et al. 1972). In 1936, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics advocated a law prohibiting its use, which Congress passed in 1937, against the advice of the American Medical Association (Grinspoon & Bakalar 1993:9-11). This law, along with increased prescribing of aspirin and barbiturates, pushed cannabis out of the United States Pharmacopoeia and common medical practice by 1942. After nonmedical cannabis use spread in the 1960s, the number of Americans reporting lifetime prevalence Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 128 Volume 43 (2), April - June 2011Reinarman et ai. Wito Are Medicai Marijuana Patients? increased sharply. Recent estimates from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health show that 102,404,000 Americans have used this drug, 41 % of the population aged 12 and over, or about half the adult population (SAMHSA 2010). This widespread use led to a gradual rediscovery of the therapeutic uses of cannabis, albeit largely without physician involvement. Alongside the spread of nonmedical use, in 1964 sci- entists determined the precise chemical structure of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), thought to be the ingredient in cannabis (Gaoni & research in the clin- ical pharmacology of cannabinoids. Many physicians in clinical practice also recognized the therapeutic potential of cannabis (Irvine 2006; Charuvastra, Freidmann & Stein 2005), specifically, for example, for pain (Woolridge et al. 2005), as an antiemetic for chemotherapy patients (Doblin & Kleiman 1991), or for symptoms of AIDS (Abrams et al. 2003). More recently a broader medical litera- ture documenting the therapeutic properties of endogenous cannabinoids has developed (e.g., NicoU & Alger 2004; Lehmann et al, 2002; Hall, Degenhart & Currow 2001), Numerous case reports in the medical literature also have suggested that cannabis has therapeutic potential for a vari- ety of conditions. But rigorous experimental research that might determine more precisely the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis for specific conditions has been blocked by the Drug Enforcement Administration (see Zeese 1999; Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration 1994). This combination of increasing therapeutic use and federal government opposition ultimately led to passage of new state laws providing for the medical use of cannabis upon physician recommendation. Since 1996, 15 U,S. states and the District of Columbia have passed such laws: California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Maine, Montana, Michigan, and Washington, DC by ballot initiative; Rhode Island, New Mexico, Vermont, Hawaii, and New Jersey by state legislation. The first of these laws was California's Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act, passed in 1996 {San Francisco Chronicle 1996). This act made it legal under state law for patients to possess and use cannabis if recom- mended by their physicians. Numerous medical and scien- tific associations endorsed medical use of cannabis and/or supported further research into its therapeutic poten- tial. These included the American College of Physicians (2008), the American Public Health Association (1995), the British Medical Association (1997), the Canadian Medical Association (2005), and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences (1999). Such elections and endorsements notwithstanding, the Bush Administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy threatened to revoke the licenses of physicians who recommended cannabis to patients. One physicianchallenged this policy and the U.S, Court of Appeals ruled (in Conant v, Walters) in 2002 that it unconstitutionally infringed physicians' First Amendment rights to freedom of speech with their patients (McCarthy 2004), Subsequent legislation and case law have left medical marijuana (MM) patients and their physicians in legal limbo: In 2003, the California legislature passed SB 420 to provide specific implementation guidelines for Proposition 215, including how counties should han- dle MM patient ID cards, Most drug law enforcement is done by local police who enforce state, not federal, drug laws. In 2005, The California Attorney General ruled that Proposition 215 is the legitimate will of the voters and is therefore valid under the California Constitution for purposes of state law enforcement. He advised the Highway Patrol and other state law enforcement agencies that under California law MM patients were legally entitled to possess and use cannabis for therapeutic purposes (Hoge 2005), In 2006, Bush administration Attorney General Gonzales sought to invalidate state MM laws, and the U,S, Supreme Court ruled {Gonzales v. Raich 2006) that the Compassionate Use Act\u2014its legiti- mate electoral provenance notwithstanding\u2014neither supersedes nor invalidates federal laws that prohibit marijuana use (see Mikos 2009 for a legal analysis of the states' neglected power to legalize behavior that is criminalized under federal law), In 2008 the Supreme Court denied without comment an appeal by two California counties that had refused to implement Proposition 215 {County of San Diego V, San Diego NORML 2008), thereby letting stand a lower court ruling that upheld SB 42O's provisions regarding counties issuing MM identification cards. In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder issued a pol- icy stating that federal drug control agencies would no longer raid MM dispensaries if they operated within state and local laws (Moore 2009). That policy notwithstanding, the DEA has continued to raid MM dispensaries in California into 2011 (e,g,, Blankstein 2009). Within this grey area between conflicting state and federal laws, the number of patients who have received rec- ommendations for medical marijuana from physicians has continued to grow, albeit by how much remains unknown. Over 1,000 MM dispensaries, delivery services, and coop- eratives are said to be operating in California to meet the demand (NORML 2007), A rough estimate of the number of MM patients in California can be extrapolated from Oregon figures. Unlike California's Compassionate Use Act, Oregon's MM law set up an Oregon Medical Marijuana Program that requires centralized record keep- ing. As of July, 2009, some 2,983 Oregon-licensed physi- cians had approved 20,307 applications for MM (Oregon Journal of Psychoactive Drugs i 29 Volume 43 (2), April - June 2011Keinarman et al. Who Are Medical Maryuana Patients? Department of Human Services 2008). The population of California is 9.7 times that of Oregon (U.S. Census 2007), which yields a crude estimate of 196,978 MM patients in California. This is likely an underestimate because the California statute affords greater latitude to physicians regarding the conditions for which they can recommend MM (\", . . any other illness for which marijuana provides relief\"). Americans for Safe Access (2008), a MM patient advocacy group, has estimated that there are well over 200,000 physician-sanctioned MM patients in California. Despite their growing numbers, however, the ambigu- ous legal status of MM patients renders them a half-hidden population whose characteristics are not well documented, with the partial exception of the San Francisco Bay Area (O'Connell & Bou-Matar 2007; Reiman 2007a). Medical marijuana will likely continue to be a contentious issue, but across fifteen states and the District of Columbia several hundred thousand people are using marijuana as a medicine recommended by physicians, and yet little is known about them as a patient population. We intend this study as a modest contribution toward filling this gap. It presents data on the demographic char- acteristics, presenting symptoms, physician evaluations, conventional treatments tried, and MM use practices of patients from a network of MM assessment clinics in California, METHODS These data were drawn from 1,746 consecutive admissions to nine MM assessment clinics operating in California in July, August, and September 2006. These assessment clinics are not dispensaries and are not con- nected to dispensaries. They were located throughout the state\u2014in the north and south, coast and central valley, and large and small cities: Modesto, Oakland, Sacramento, Hollywood, San Diego, Santa Cruz, Ukiah, San Francisco, and Santa Rosa. They charged $100 to $125 for an assess- ment. At the time our sample was drawn, these assessment clinics had evaluated over 54,000 MM patients. Without a comprehensive patient database or representative house- hold surveys, there is no way to determine precisely how representative this sample is of the overall population of MM patients. Moreover, there is a large albeit unknown number of people who use marijuana medicinally but who have not sought physician recommendations or official patient ID cards, perhaps because of the expense of the assessment. ' Evaluating physicians interviewed potential patients and evaluated their patient medical histories for purposes of recommending MM and issuing patient identification cards under the Compassionate Use Act and SB 420, The eval- uation instruments were (1) a basic patient-administered medical history questionnaire covering demographics, pre- senting symptoms or conditions, brief medical history.conventional and alternative medical treatments tried, drug use history, and MM use practices; and (2) a physician eval- uation form using International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-9), Each patient received and signed an exten- sive informed consent form noting confidentiality, which was approved by the clinics' IRB. Most prior studies of MM patients are based on small, symptom-specific samples. Initially, the population of MM patients in the San Francisco Bay Area were people with HIV/AIDS and cancer (e.g., Harris, Mendelson & Jones 1998), Later, physicians began to recommend cannabis to patients with chronic pain, mood disorders and other psy- chiatric conditions (Gieringer 2002). The data reported here describe what is among the largest and most symp- tomatically and demographically diverse samples of medi- cal cannabis patients to date (cf., O'Connell & Bou-Matar 2007). RESULTS As Table 1 indicates, the MM patients are three-fourths male and three-fifths White. Compared to the US Census of California, the patients in this sample are on average somewhat younger, report slightly more years of formal education, and are more often employed. The comparison also indicates that women. Latinos, and Asian Americans are underrepresented. Given the limitations of our data, we can offer only informed speculation as to why. The underrepresentation of women may be in part an epidemiological artifact of the gender distribution of certain kinds of injuries (e.g., workplace, sports, and motor- cycle accidents). It may also have to do with the double stigma women face in seeking MM\u2014for using an illicit drug and for violating gender-specific norms against ille- gal behavior in general. Moreover, as with alcohol use, pregnant women and women considering pregnancy are likely to have health concerns and many may fear that MM could put them in jeopardy if discovered by child protection agencies. Given the high poverty rate among Latinos and their concentration in the manual labor end of the occupational structure. Latinos are exposed to equal or greater risks of work-related injuries and to no less epidemiologic risk of other conditions for which MM is sometimes used. It seems likely that their under-representation has to do with the undocumented status of many Latinos in California. The undocumented often avoid contact with government agencies for fear of apprehension by law enforcement, for beyond arrest and incarceration this carries the risk of deportation. Such fears reduce the likelihood of Latinos accessing health care in general and MM in particular. Asian Americans are also underrepresented, but this may be because they have lower prevalence of marijuana use than other racial/ethnic groups and/or because they have their own venerable traditions of herbal medicine.

This does not appear to stem from their prevalence of marijuana use, for representative national surveys show that Blacks generally do not have signif- icantly higher prevalence of marijuana use than Whites (SAMHSA 2005). African-Americans may be more likely to seek MM for any of several reasons: because they are disproportionately poor, more often lack health insur- ance, are significantly less likely to be prescribed other medication for pain (Pletcher et al. 2008) or to receive treatment for cancer (Gross et al. 2008), and because African-Americans are a growing proportion of HIV/AIDS cases. Some of these same reasons may help to explain why Native Americans are also ovcrrcpresented, although their proportion of both this sample and the general population is too small to judge representativeness accurately. In their medical history questionnaires, patients were asked \"Which of the following best describe the therapeu- tic benefit you receive from medicinal cannabis? (Check the most important).\" Patients typically reported more than one therapeutic benefit (mean \u2014 3). Early studies showed most patients used MM to relieve symptoms of HIV/AIDS (Woolridge et al. 2005) or cancer, and it is likely that the majority of patients in our sample who reported \"nausea\" were cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. However, Table 2 suggests that cancer and AIDS patients are now aTABLE 2 Patient Self-Reports of Therapeutic Benefits from Medicinal Marijuana* To Relieve: Pain Muscle Spasms Headaches Anxiety Nausea/Vomiting Depression Cramps Panic Attacks Diarrhea Itching To Improve: Sleep Relaxation Appetite Concentration/Focus Energy To Prevent: Medication Side Effects Anger Involuntary Movements Seizures As Substitute for: Prescription Medication AlcoholPercent 82.6 41.1 40.7 .^7.8 27.7 26.1 19.0 16.9 5.0 2.8 70.7 55.1 37.7 22.9 15.9 22.5 22.4 6.2 3.2 50.9 13.0 *N = 1,745; patients could report more than one benefit in more than one category. significantly smaller proportion of the total (e.g., \"to relieve nausea/vomiting\" 27.7%, \"to improve appetite\" 37.7%) and that the MM patient population has become more diverse since the Compassionate Use Act was passed in 1996 (cf. Ware, Adams & Guy 2005, on MM use in the UK, and Grotenherman 2002 on MM use in Germany). Instead, relief of pain, muscle spasms, headache, and anxiety, as well as to improve sleep and relaxation were the most comtnon reasons patients cited for using MM. Chronic pain also topped the list of maladies for which MM was used in another California clinical sample (Reiman 2007b). Table 3 shows the ICD-9 diagnostic codes most fre- quently recorded by evaluating physicians. Pain from back and neck injuries was the most frequently coded. This appears consistent with a nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which found a 19.3% increase in the prevalence of spine problems between 1997 and 2005 (Martin et al. 2008). Back and neck pain was fol- lowed in frequency by sleep disorders (also increasing), anxiety/depression, muscle spasms, and arthritis.

Table 4 indicates that the MM patients in the sample had tried a variety of other treatments, conventional and alternative, for the conditions for which they were seek- ing a MM identification card. Four in five (79.3%) reported having tried other medications prescribed by their physi- cians (almost half were opiates); about half (48.7%) had tried physical therapy; over a third (36.3%) had tried chi- ropractic; nearly one-fourth (22.3%) reported having had surgery for their condition. Table 5 compares patient responses to the drug use questions to those in the 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (SAMHSA 2007). Prevalence of tobaccouse was somewhat higher than in the general popula- tion, but prevalence of alcohol use was significantly lower. Many patients reported that they valued MM because it allowed them to reduce their alcohol use. It is possible that self-reports on a self-administered instrument will under- estimate illicit drug use, particularly if patients felt that admitting illicit drug use could reduce their chances of obtaining a MM identification card. Rigorous assessments of the reliability of such data must await further research, but limitations aside, these data suggest low prevalence of other illicit drug use among MM patients. While it is true that the great majority of our respondents had used mari- juana recreationally, in response to a separate question over two-fifths (41.2%) reported that they had not been using it recreationally prior to trying it for medicinal purposes. Table 6 presents data on patients' medical marijuana use practices. Amoutits used per week varied from three grams or less (40.1%) to seven or more grams (23.3%). Two-thirds (67%) reported using MM daily while one- fourth (26%) reported using less than once a week. Half (52.9%) reported using one or two times per day while one in ten (10%) reported using three or more times per day. Patients consumed MM primarily in the evenings (52.3%) or prior to sleep (56.1%). More than two in five (42.3%) reported that when they used depended on their medi- cal symptoms. Patients ingested MM predominantly by smoking (86.1%), although one-fourth (24.4%) reported ingesting orally and nearly a fourth (21.8%) reported using a vaporizer. These latter figures suggest that at least some of the time, many MM patients are choosing modes of inges- tion that reduce the perceived risk of harms from smoking (Tan et al. 2009; Hashibe et al. 2006).

DISCUSSION Rediscovery of Medicinal Utility and Diversifying Patient Population Compared to earlier studies of MM patients, these data suggest that the patient population has evolved from mostly HIV/AIDS and cancer patients to a significantly more diverse array. The diffusion of marijuana as a medicine may have been slower than that of other medicines in con- ventional clinical practice because the flow of information from physician to patient is impeded by MM's ambiguous legal status. Thus, information about the potential thera- peutic utility of cannabis is spread mostly via word of mouth and other informal means. This suggests that the patient population is likely to continue evolving as new patients and physicians discover the therapeutic uses of cannabis. Ironically, this trend toward increasing thera- peutic uses is bringing marijuana back to the position it held in the U.S. Pharmacopeia prior to its prohibition in 1937,Further Research Like other medicines, marijuana's therapeutic efficacy varies across conditions and patient groups. This variation seems more likely when supplies remain illicit because standardized dosages or other quality controls are more dif- ficult to achieve. To gain maximum therapeutic potential across the growing range of conditions for which MM is being recommended, more systematic research is needed. Longitudinal, case control, and double-blind studies are required to rigorously assess marijuana's therapeutic effi- cacy for specific patient groups, conditions, and diseases. With regard to shifts in the patient population, it also would be very useful to have follow-up studies of patients access- ing the assessment clinics in our sample and others drawn from similar assessment clinics. Diversion Critics have argued that some MM patients are \"gam- ing the system\" to get marijuana for nonmedical use. Neither our data nor any other data we are aware of allow any clear-cut, empirical estimate of the scale of such diver- sion. Given the widespread nonmedical use marijuana in Ihe general population (102,404,000 Americans report life- time prevalence; see SAMHSA 2010) and the risk of arrest (847,864 Americans were arrested for marijuana offenses in 2008, 754,224 or 88.96% of them for possession alone; EBI 2009), it seems likely that at least some MM patients use MM dispensaries as sources of supply for nonmedical use. Defining and measuring such diversion, however, is complicated at best. Given the high prevalence of nonmed- ical use, it is not surprising that most MM patients in our sample reported having used it recreationally before using it therapeutically. But as noted above, two-fifths had not been using marijuana recreationally prior to trying it for medicinal purposes. Their self-reported rales of other illicit drug use are slightly lower than those found among the gen- eral population, and their levels of educational attainment and rate of employment are comparable to the California population. Our data have clear limitations, but they con- tain no obvious signs that MM patients differ from the general population. Nor is drug diversion unique to medical marijuana. A significant albeit unknown proportion of other patients obtain prescriptions for numerous drugs through legal medical channels that they then use for nonmedical pur- poses, for example, Valium and other benzodiazepines (Haafkens Ritalin and other stimulants prescribed for ADHD, and Oxycontin and other opiates prescribed for pain. The diversion issue will likely become more impor- tant as the line between medical and nonmedical drug use is increasingly blurred (Murray, Gaylin & Macklin 1984). Beyond the spread of MM, Prozac and other SSRI- type antidepressants, for example, are often prescribed Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 133 Volume 43 (2), April - June 2011Reinarman et ai. Wiio Are Medicai Marijuana Patients? for patients who do not meet DSM criteria for clinical depression but who simply feel better when taking it. Such \"cosmetic psychopharmacology\" (Kramer 1993) is likely to grow as new psychiatric medications come to market. The line between medical and nonmedical drug use has also been blurred by performance enhancing drugs such as steroids, so-called \"smart drugs\" that combine vitamins with psychoactive ingredients, and herbal remedies like ma huang (ephedra) available in health food stores (Burros & Jay 1996). These examples suggest that despite the best intentions of physicians and law makers, much drug use does not fit into two neat boxes, medical and nonmedical, but rather exists on a continuum where one shades into the other aspatients' purposes shift to suit situational exigencies in their health and their daily lives. It is not clear where a border line between medical and nonmedical marijuana or other drug use might be drawn nor how it might be effec- tively policed (see Reinarman & Levine 1997: 334^4), NOTE 1, We are grateful to one anonymous reviewer for pointing out that the cost of these assessments may well have prevented some potential MM patients\u2014including many impoverished HIV/AIDS patients\u2014from obtaining ID cards, which may have affected the demographics of this sample.

Webb RN, BSN Abstract Clinical research regarding the therapeutic benefits of cannabis (\"marijuana\") has been almost non-existent in the United States since cannabis was given Schedule I status in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. In order to discover the benefits and adverse effects perceived by medical cannabis patients, especially with regards to chronic pain, we hand-delivered surveys to one hundred consecutive patients who were returning for yearly re-certification for medical cannabis use in Hawai'i. The response rate was 94%. Mean and median ages were 49.3 and 51 years respectively. Ninety-seven per cent of respondents used cannabis primarily for chronic pain. Average pain improvement on a 0-10 pain scale was 5.0 (from 7.8 to 2.8), which translates to a 64% relative decrease in average pain. Half of all respondents also noted relief from stress/anxiety, and nearly half (45%) reported relief from insomnia. Most patients (71%) reported no adverse effects, while 6% reported a cough or throat irritation and 5% feared arrest even though medical cannabis is legal in Hawai'i. No serious adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that Cannabis is an extremely safe and ef fective medication for many chronic pain patients. Cannabis appears to alleviate pain, insomnia, and may be helpful in relieving anxiety. Cannabis has shown extreme promise in the treatment of numerous medical problems and deserves to be released from the current Schedule I federal prohibition against research and prescription. Introduction Research into the therapeutic benefits of cannabis has been severely limited by the federal Schedule I classification, which essentially prohibits any ability to acquire or to provide cannabis for studies investigating possible therapeutic effects. Limited studies have been done in Canada and in Europe, as well as several in California. Hawai'i is one of twenty states (plus the District of Colum - bia) which allow certifications for use of medical cannabis. The authors have been certifying patients for use of medical cannabis in Hawai'i for more than four years. In an attempt to discover the perceived benefits and adverse effects of medical cannabis, we conducted a survey of medical cannabis patients. Methods Sample SelectionBetween July of 2010 and February of 2011, we hand-delivered questionnaires to one hundred consecutive patients who had been certified for the medical use of cannabis for a minimum of one year and were currently re-applying for certification. Survey Design and Administration The subjects were verbally instructed to complete the questionnaire in the office at the time of re-certification or were provided a stamped and addressed envelope so they could complete the questionnaire at home. All patients were instructed to remain anonymous and to answer the questions as honestly as possible. A universal pain scale was used to assess pain before and after treatment (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain ever). Open-ended questions were asked to ascertain the following: (1) \"Any adverse effects you have had from using medical cannabis?\" (2) \"Does medical cannabis help you with any other problems? If so, what?\" The purpose of the last question was to explore benefits out - side the parameters of the state of Hawai'i's medical cannabis qualifying conditions. Results The overall response rate was 94%. The mean age was 49.3 years and the median age was 51. No data was collected on sex or race/ethnicity. Almost all respondents (97%) used medical cannabis primarily for relief of chronic pain. Average reported pain relief from medical cannabis was substantial. Average pre-treatment pain on a zero to ten scale was 7.8, whereas average post-treatment pain was 2.8, giving a reported average improvement of 5 points. This translates to a 64% average relative decrease in pain. Other reported therapeutic benefits included relief from stress/anxiety (50% of respondents), relief of insomnia (45%), improved appetite (12%), decreased nausea (10%), increased focus/concentration (9%), and relief from depression (7%). Several patients wrote notes (see below) relating that cannabis helped them to decrease or discontinue medications for pain, anxiety, and insomnia. Other reported benefits did not extend to 5% or more of respondents. Six patients (6%) wrote brief notes relating how cannabis helped them to decrease or to discontinue other medications. Comments included the following: \"Medical cannabis replaced my need for oxycodone. Now I don't need them at all.\" \"I do not need Xanax anymore.\" \"In the last two years I have been able to drop meds for anxiety, sleep, and depression.\" \"I've cut back 18 pills on my morphine dosage.\" A majority (71%) reported no adverse effects, while 6% reported a cough and/or throat irritation and 5% reported a fear of arrest. All other adverse effects were less than 5%. No serious adverse effects were reported. DiscussionAccording to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain afflicts 116 million Americans and costs the nation over $600 billion every year in medical treatment and lost productivity. 1 Chronic pain is a devastating disease that frequently leads to major depression and even suicide. 2 Unfortunately, the therapeutic options for chronic pain are limited and extremely risky.HAWAI'I JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & PUBLIC HEALTH, APRIL 2014, VOL 73, NO 4 110 Spurred by efforts to encourage physicians to become more pro-active in treating chronic pain, US prescription opioids (synthetic derivatives of opium) have increased ten-fold since 1990. 3 By 2009 prescription opioids were responsible for almost half a million emergency department visits per year.4 In 2010 prescription opioid overdoses were responsible for well over 16,000 deaths. 5 A 2010 article in the New England Journal of Medicine addressing this problem is aptly titled \"A Flood of Opioids, a Rising Tide of Deaths.\"3 Drugs such as OxyContinR are so dangerous that the manufacturer's boxed warning states that \"respiratory depression, including fatal cases, may occur with use of OxyContin, even when the drug has been used as recommended and not misused or abused.\" 6 Clearly safer analgesics are needed. The Hippocratic Oath reminds to \"first, do no harm.\" It can - not be over-emphasized that there has never been a death from overdose attributed to cannabis. 7 In fact, no deaths whatsoever have been attributed to the direct effects of cannabis.7 Canna - bis has a safety record that is vastly superior to all other pain medications. Many physicians worry that cannabis smoke might be as dan - gerous as cigarette smoke; however, epidemiologic studies have found no increase in oropharyngeal or pulmonary malignancies attributable to marijuana. 8-10 Still, since smoke is something best avoided, medical cannabis patients are encouraged to use smokeless vaporizers which can be purchased on-line or at local \"smoke-shops.\" In states that (unlike Hawai'i) allow cannabis dispensaries, patients can purchase \"vapor pens,\" analogous to e-cigarettes and fully labeled regarding doses of THC and other relevant cannabinoids. Tests have proven that smoke-free vaporizers deliver THC as well or even more efficiently than smoking, and that most patients prefer vaporizers over smoking. 11 Like smoking, vapor - izers allow patients to slowly titrate their medicine just to effect, analogous to IV patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) that has been so successful in hospital-based pain control. This avoids the unwanted psychoactive side-effects often associated with oral medication such as prescription Marinol R (100% THC in oil) capsules which tend to be slowly and erratically absorbed and are often either ineffectually weak or overpoweringly strong. 12,13 Because inhaled cannabis is rapid, reliable, and titratable, most patients strongly prefer inhaled cannabis over Marinol R capsules.14 While the relative safety of cannabis as medication is easily established, the degree of efficacy is still being established. The reported pain relief by patients in this survey is enormous. One reason for this is that patients were already self-selected for suc - cess: they had already tried cannabis and found that it worked for them. For this sample, the benefits of cannabis outweighed any negative effects. The study design may therefore lend itself to over-estimating the benefits and under-estimating the nega - tive side-effects if extrapolated to the general population. Another reason that the reported pain relief is so significant is that cannabis has been proven effective for many forms of recalcitrant chronic pain. A University of Toronto systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT's) examining cannabinoids in the treatment of chronic pain found that fifteen of eighteen trials demonstrated significant analgesic effect of cannabinoids and that there were no serious adverse effects. 15 While opioids are generally considered to have little benefit in chronic neuropathic pain, several RCT's have shown that cannabinoids can relieve general neuropathic pain, 16 as well as neuropathic pain associated with HIV and with multiple scle-rosis (MS). 17,18 One study found that cannabis had continuing efficacy at the same dose for at least two years. 19 Even low dose inhaled cannabis has been proven to reduce neuropathic pain. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial involving patients with refractory neuropathic pain, Ware, et al, found that therapeutic blood levels of THC (mean 45 ng/ml achieved by a single inhalation three times a day) were much lower than those necessary to produce a cannabis euphoria or \"high\"(> 100 ng/ml). 19 Cannabis is relatively non-addicting, and patients who stop using it (eg, while traveling) report no withdrawal symptoms. One author (Webb C.) worked for 26 years in a high volume emergency department where he never witnessed a single visit for cannabis withdrawal symptoms, whereas dramatic symptoms from alcohol, benzodiazepine, and/or opioid withdrawal were a daily occurrence. So why is cannabis still held hostage by the DEA as a Schedule I substance? On June 18, 2010, the Hawai'i Medical Association passed a resolution stating in part that: \"Whereas, 1) Cannabis has little or no known withdrawal syndrome and is therefore considered to be minimally or non-addicting; and Whereas, 2) Cannabis has many well-known medical benefits (including efficacy for anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pain, muscle spasms, and glaucoma) and is currently recommended by thou - sands of physicians; and Whereas 3) Cannabis has been used by millions of people for many centuries with no history of recorded fatalities and with no lethal dosage ever discovered; and Whereas, Cannabis therefore fulfills none of the required three criteria (all of which are required) to maintain its current restric-tion as a Schedule I substance... The Hawai'i Medical Association recommends that Medical Cannabis be re-scheduled to a status that is either equal to or less restrictive than the Schedule III status of synthetic THC (Marinol R), so as to reduce barriers to needed research and to humanely increase availability of cannabinoid medications to patients who may benefit.\" 20 Medical cannabis remains controversial mainly because the federal government refuses to recognize cannabis as an ac - cepted medication. To this we would echo the words of Melanie Thernstrom in her excellent book The Pain Chronicles, 2 \"How could treating pain be controversial?\" one might ask, \" Why wouldn't it be treated? Who are the opponents of relief?\"HAWAI'I JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & PUBLIC HEALTH, APRIL 2014, VOL 73, NO 4 111Conclusions Cannabis is an extremely safe and effective medication for many patients with chronic pain. In stark contrast to opioids and other available pain medications, cannabis is relatively non-addicting and has the best safety record of any known pain medication (no deaths attributed to overdose or direct effects of medication). Adverse reactions are mild and can be avoided by titration of dosage using smokeless vaporizers. More research needs to be pursued to discover degrees of efficacy in other areas of promise such as in treating anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, autism, nausea, vomiting, muscle spasms, seizures, and many neurologic disorders. Patients deserve to have cannabis released from its current federal prohibition so that scientific research can proceed and so that physicians can prescribe cannabis with the same freedom ac - corded any other safe and effective medications.

Troutt, N.M.D. & Matthew D. DiDonato, Ph.D. Abstract \u2014 Many advances have been made toward understanding the benets of medical cannabis. However, less is known about medical cannabis patients themselves. Prior research has uncovered many important patient characteristics, but most of that work has been conducted with partici-pants in California, who may not represent medical cannabis patients throughout the United States.Furthermore, it is unknown if medical cannabis legalization, which typically imposes strict regula-tions on cannabis cultivation and sale, impacts patients' experiences acquiring and using cannabis. Thegoal of this study was to address these limitations by (1) examining the characteristics, perceptions,and behaviors of medical cannabis patients in Arizona; and (2) questioning participants with a historyof cannabis use regarding their experiences with cannabis before and after legalization. Patients inArizona share many characteristics with those in California, but also key differences, such as averageage and degree of cannabis consumption. Participants also had positive perceptions of the effect ofmedical cannabis legalization, reporting that feelings of safety and awareness were higher after legal-ization compared to before. The results are discussed in relation to evidence from patients in otherstates and in terms of their potential policy implications. Keywords \u2014 Arizona, medical cannabis, medical cannabis legalization, patient characteristics, perceptions Support for the use of cannabis for medical purposes is growing throughout the United States. To date, 23 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws legaliz- ing medical cannabis, and 16 states have similar legislation under consideration. Recent polls also show that the major- ity of Americans believe that cannabis should be legal-ized for medical purposes (Anderson Robbins Research & Shaw & Company Research 2013 ; Associated Press- CNBC 2010 ), and the popularity of this sentiment has Medical Marijuana Research Institute, Mesa, AZ. Please address correspondence to William D. Troutt, 10613 N. 2008; email: drtroutt@yahoo.comincreased over time (Anderson Robbins Research & Shaw & Company Research 2013 ). Support may be on the rise, in part, due to research that shows the potential therapeutic effects of medical cannabis. Animal studies, for example, show that cannabis-derived extracts mitigate cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth(Aviello et al. 2012) and have antidepressant-like effects (Jiang et al. 2005). Studies also show that cannabis may be benecial for humans. Bar-Sela and colleagues ( 2013 ) found that nausea, vomiting, weight loss, sleep disorders, and pain were reduced in cancer patients after 6-8 weeks of cannabis use. Studies also show that cannabis signicantlyreduces chronic pain (see Lynch and Campbell 2011 ), Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 259 Volume 47 (4), September - October 2015Troutt & DiDonato Medical Cannabis in Arizona inflammatory bowel disease (Allegretti et al. 2013), post- traumatic stress disorder (Greer, Grob, and Halberstadt 2014), and seizure disorders (Lorenz 2004). Although many advances have been made in under- standing the benets of medical cannabis, less is known about US medical cannabis patients themselves.Demographically, most patients are White, male, and approximately 35 to 45 years of age (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014; Grella, Rodriguez, and Kim al. 2011; Aggarwal et al. 2009;R e i m a n 2009; O'Connell and Bou- Matar 2007; Harris et al. 2000). Most patients report medicating with cannabis daily (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014; Ilgen et al. 2013; Reinarman et al. 2011; O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007), consuming six to nine grams of cannabis per week (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014; Reinarman et al. 2011; O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007), and prefer inhalation as the method of consumption (O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007). Studies also show that the majority of patients use medical cannabis to relieve pain. However, patients also report using cannabis to treat a variety of other conditions,including anxiety, sleep apnea, hypertension, incontinence, and depression (Aggarwal et al. 2013; Nunberg et al. 2011; Reinarman et al. 2011). Generally, patients report that med- ical cannabis is effective for helping them manage theircondition(s) (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014; Ryan-Ibarra, Induni, and Ewing 2015 ; Aggarwal et al. 2013; Harris et al. 2000). For example, Aggarwal and colleagues ( 2013 ) found that, on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 indicated absolute symptom control, patients reported that cannabis providedsymptom control in the range of 7 to 10 across a vari- ety of conditions. Patients also often reduce their use of other medications (i.e., prescription and over-the-counterdrugs) when using medical cannabis (Nunberg et al. 2011; Aggarwal et al. 2009;R e i m a n2009, 2007). Though these studies are informative, one limitation is that most were conducted with samples of patients livingin California. California patients may not represent those living in other areas of the country because the regula- tions that govern patients in California are different from those in other states. For example, residents of California may legally obtain medical cannabis to treat a number of ailments, including any chronic or persistent condition that considerably limits major life activities or that, if notalleviated, may compromise the patient's safety or health (California Senate Bill 420 2003). Because the list of con- ditions for which the legal medical use of cannabis is granted in other states is often less inclusive, patients from these states may differ from those in California. Considering that medical cannabis has been legalized in many states, there is an opportunity to paint a more com-prehensive picture of American medical cannabis patients by conducting similar studies in other geographic locations.Scientists have begun to conduct such research throughthe examination of patients living in Washington State (Aggarwal et al. 2013, 2009) and Michigan (Ilgen et al. 2013). Our rst goal was to continue this line of researchby studying medical cannabis patients in Arizona. To aid comparisons with previous research, we assessed patientcharacteristics, behaviors, and perceptions that have been examined in prior studies. These included patterns of use (e.g., frequency of consumption, amount of consumption,preferred method of consumption), degree of relief expe- rienced when using medical cannabis, and use of other medications. In addition to the limited research on medical cannabis patients outside of California, to our knowledge there hasbeen no systematic examination of patients' perceptions ofthe outcomes of medical cannabis legalization. One objec- tive of legalizing cannabis for medical use is to safeguard its acquisition and production, which often involves strictregulation of its cultivation and sale. For instance, the rules and regulations of the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program require that those authorized to operate medical cannabis dispensaries and cultivation facilities enact strict security policies and procedures (Arizona Department ofHealth Services Medical Marijuana Rules 2012). In addi- tion, many dispensaries and facilities employ third-partylaboratories to test cannabis products for possible contami-nants. However, it is unknown if such regulations translate to changes in patient safety or product quality. Because individuals who use cannabis medicinally are those most affected by these regulations, surveying patientsregarding their experiences purchasing and using medi- cal cannabis may uncover the changes legalization hashad on patient safety and product quality. In particular, patients with a history of using cannabis medicinally prior to legalization can provide their perspective on the changesthat legalization has generated. The second goal of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of mea- sures invoked to regulate and secure the cultivation and sale of medical cannabis by examining the perceptions of patients that used cannabis medicinally prior to legal-ization. Patients were asked to compare their perceptions of safety, product knowledge, and the effectiveness of cannabis for treating their condition(s) before and afterlegalization. Because of the regulations imposed with the legalization of medical cannabis, we hypothesized that patients would feel greater safety, have better knowledge,and that cannabis effectiveness would be greater after legalization. METHOD Participants and Procedures Participants were 367 patients recruited from four medical cannabis dispensaries located throughout Arizona. The majority of the patients were male (63.8%), and Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 260 Volume 47 (4), September - October 2015Troutt & DiDonato Medical Cannabis in Arizona ranged from 18 to 83 years of age (M =45.78 years; SD=13.76 years). Most of the patients were White (86.4%), whereas the rest were Hispanic (6.3%), Black (2.5%), Native American (1.9%), Asian (0.8%), or Other (2.1%). These gures are similar to those reported by the Arizona Department of Health Services (2014) for thispatient population. To protect patient condentiality, the authors did not directly contact patients, but approached dispensary ownersto request assistance in recruiting participants. Dispensary owners informed their patients of the study, and interested patients were directed to a website that provided infor-mation about the research, including a description of the study, an explanation of patients' rights as participants, and information regarding the collection and storage ofparticipant responses (i.e., responses were anonymous and would be stored on a password-protected server and /or computer only accessible to the researchers). If the patient agreed to participate, he or she checked a box indi- cating his or her agreement and the survey questions appeared. Measures Patient conditions. Participants were asked to select from an extensive list of conditions for which they use medical cannabis to control or treat. For each condition selected, participants completed subsequent questions and rated them on ve-point Likert-type scales regarding thedegree of relief experienced overall (1 =No relief at all; 5=Almost complete relief), the degree of relief compared to other medications (1 =Much less relief; 5 =Much more relief), and the use of other medications since using medical cannabis (1 =I use other medications much less frequently; 5 =I use other medications much more fre- quently). Higher scores indicated greater relief or morefrequent use of other medications. Patterns and methods of cannabis use. Patients reported on the frequency (\"On average, how frequentlydo you medicate with medical cannabis?\": \"Less than once per month\" to \"Several times per day\") and amount (\"On average, how much medical cannabis do you con- sume in a month?\": \"Less than one gram\" to \"More thanone ounce\") of consumption. Patients also completed a single-item measure regarding their preferred method of consumption (smoking, edibles, tinctures, vaporizing, rawconsumption, or oils). Perceptions of prior medical cannabis users. Participants were asked if they had used cannabis totreat their condition(s) before its legalization in Arizona. Those who replied \"yes\" were asked to complete four additional items. These items included the perceivedsafety of acquiring cannabis (\"Compared to when you did not have a medical marijuana card, acquiring cannabis as a medical marijuana card holder feels\": 1 =Much more dangerous; 5 =Much safer), knowledge of straincharacteristics (\"Compared to when you did not have amedical marijuana card, your knowledge of what strain you are acquiring and its characteristics is\": 1 =Much worse; 5 =Much better), condence in a safe product (\"Compared to when you did not have a medical marijuana card, your condence that you are receiving a safe, uncon-taminated product is\": 1 =Much lower; 5 =Much higher), and product effectiveness for treating their condition(s)(\"Compared to when you did not have a medical marijuanacard, the effectiveness of the cannabis you receive to treat your condition is\": 1 =Much worse; 5 =Much better). RESULTS The conditions for which patients reported using med- ical cannabis are displayed in Table 1. Consistent with pre- vious research, the majority of patients reported suffering from chronic pain. Other commonly reported conditions included anxiety, depression, headaches, insomnia, muscle spasms, nausea, and stress. Figure 1 shows the distributions of patients for fre- quency of cannabis use ( Figure 1A), amount of cannabis consumed per month ( Figure 1B), and preferred method of cannabis consumption (Figure 1C). The large majority of patients (83.7%) reported using medical cannabis several times per week or more, with most using medical cannabisdaily (61%). Most patients consumed one-half of an ounce of cannabis or less per month (78.1%), and the most popu- lar method of consumption was inhalation (i.e., smoking or vaporizing; 67.2%). Perceived Effectiveness of Medical Cannabis Patients' perceptions of the effectiveness of medical cannabis for treating their condition(s) are presented in Table 1. The values reflect the percent of patients who reported experiencing, overall, a lot of relief oralmost complete relief from their symptoms and conditions when using medical cannabis (second column), a little more relief ormuch more relief from medical cannabis compared to other medications (third column), and using other medica- tions a little less frequently ormuch less frequently when medicating with cannabis (fourth column). For many of the conditions, patients reported that cannabis was effective for helping them manage their ail- ments. For example, at least 70% of patients reported experiencing a lot of relief oralmost complete relief for 24 of the 42 conditions. Similarly, for 27 of the 42 con- ditions, at least 70% of patients reported experiencing a little more relief ormuch more relief from medical cannabis compared to other medications. Finally, at least 70% of patients reported using other medications a little less frequently ormuch less frequently f o r2 4o ft h e4 2 conditions.

Patient Characteristics, Perceptions, and Behaviors Consistent with research in other states (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Aggarwal et al. 2013; Ilgen et al. al. 2011; Aggarwal et al. 2009 ;R e i m a n 2009; O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007; Harris et al. 2000), participants in the present study were mostly White men. Average patient age, approximately 46 years, differed from that in other states. For exam- ple, average ages reported in studies of patients from California range from 28 to 41 years (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014; Grella, Rodriguez, and Kim 2014;R e i m a n2009, 2007; Harris et al. 2000). Average patient age is somewhat higher in Colorado (42 years of age; Colorado Departmentof Public Health and Environment 2014) and Washington State (41 to 47 years of age; Aggarwal et al. 2013, 2009). In Michigan (46 years of age; Murphy 2013) and Montana (47 years of age; Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services 2014 ), average patient age more closely approximates that of Arizona. State-level variation in the average age of medical cannabis patients may in part be explained by the condi-tions that qualify a person to use medical cannabis in each state. For example, the qualifying conditions in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Michigan, and Washington State areless inclusive than those in California, and are generally limited to more debilitating diseases. Individuals who suf- fer from more serious conditions may also be older, which may account for higher average patient ages in states other than California. The variability in these statistics under-scores the risk of generalizing ndings from patients living in California to those residing in other states and highlights the importance of studying patients throughout the UnitedStates. State-level differences in regulations also present an opportunity to explore how such regulations shape patient characteristics. A potential avenue for future work may beto study and compare patients in all states that have legal- ized the medical use of cannabis, ideally using a national sample to aid state-level comparisons. Participants in the present study reported that, on average, they consumed cannabis on a daily basis and that inhalation was the preferred method of consump-tion, patterns of use that reflect those found in prior work (Bonn-Miller et al. 2014; Ilgen et al. 2013; Reinarman et al. 2011 ; O'Connell and Bou-Matar 2007). However, previous research shows that patients consume between Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 263 Volume 47 (4), September - October 2015Troutt & DiDonato Medical Cannabis in Arizona FIGURE 2 Distributions of patient responses, by percentage, of their current experiences acquiring and knowledge of medical cannabis compared to their experiences before legalization: (A) the perceived safety of acquiring cannabis; (B) knowledge of medical cannabis characteristics; (C) perceived condence in a safe product; and (D) perceived effectiveness of cannabis for treating their condition(s). 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90% Much More DangerousSomewhat More the SameSomewhat BetterMuch BetterKnowledge B.

This is in contrast to the ndings of the present study, whichshow that 78% of patients consumed 0.5 ounces of cannabis per month or less. State-level differences in average patient age, in par- ticular, may affect variation in consumption. Patients inArizona are, on average, older than those in California, and older patients may consume less cannabis than youngerpatients. Evidence from the present study supports this hypothesis, as there is a small, but signicant, nega- tive correlation between age and the amount per month ( r= .11, p<.05). Relatedly, Grella and colleagues (2014) found that younger patientsvisited dispensaries more frequently than older patients.Although there are likely other factors that contribute to consumption disparities, these ndings also highlight the importance of studying medical cannabis patients acrossthe US.Patients reported using medical cannabis to treat a variety of conditions. The most commonly reported con-ditions included chronic pain, muscle spasms, nausea, anx- iety, arthritis, depression, headaches, insomnia, and stress. Patients also reported that cannabis was effective for treat- ing the symptoms of many of these conditions, ndings that are consistent with previous research (Bonn-Miller et al.2014; Ryan-Ibarra, Induni, and Ewing 2015; Aggarwal et al. 2013 ; Harris et al. 2000). This effectiveness included feelings of general relief and relief compared to other medi-cations. The conditions for which the highest proportions of patients reported relief included alcohol dependency, anx- iety, bowel distress, depression, insomnia, muscle spasms,and stress. Furthermore, patients reported using other medi- cations less frequently when using cannabis. This is consis- tent with ndings from other studies of patient perceptions(Reiman 2007, 2009; Nunberg et al. 2011; Reinarman et al. 2011), as well as a study of opiate overdose mortality,which showed that states with legalized medical lower opiate overdose mortality compared Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 264 Volume 47 (4), September - October 2015Troutt & DiDonato Medical Cannabis in Arizona to those without legalized medical cannabis (Bachhuber et al. 2014 ). Medical cannabis may benet Arizona patients suf- fering from a variety of conditions. This conclusion has potential policy implications, as patients report deriv- ing benet not only for conditions that fall under thelist of conditions that qualify a person to use medical cannabis (e.g., cancer, chronic pain, muscle spasms), but also for conditions that are not listed (e.g., anxiety, depres-sion, insomnia). Ofcials in Arizona previously considered research on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Greer, Grob, and Halberstadt 2014) in their decision to include PTSD among Arizona's qualifying conditions. Thus, of- cials may consider the ndings from the present study, in conjunction with other research, to determine the suit-ability of expanding the list of qualifying conditions in Arizona. Legalization and Patient Experiences The present study was, to our knowledge, the rst to examine the effect of legalization on patient's experi- ences with medical cannabis. Regarding safety, the major-ity of patients reported feeling safer acquiring medi- cal cannabis after legalization, and their condence that they were acquiring a safe, uncontaminated product washigher. Patients also reported that their knowledge of the strains they acquired was better and that the cannabis they acquired after legalization was more effective for treatingtheir condition(s) than the cannabis they acquired before legalization. These ndings show that the Arizona medical cannabis program has had some success, as regulations have pro- vided a safe environment for patients to acquire a safeand high-quality product. However, the potential negative effects of medical cannabis legalization were not assessed in the present study. For example, participants in otherstudies have reported difculties affording legal medi- cal cannabis (Aggarwal et al. 2009 ), a factor which may preclude some individuals from taking advantage of the program, leaving them seeking other, potentially illegal means of cannabis acquisition. Other factors, such as limits on the amount of cannabis that can be purchased or legalissues related to medical cannabis use, may also havenegative consequences for some segments of the patient population. The results of this study should be considered in light of some limitations. First, participant recruitment was con- ducted through medical cannabis dispensaries. Althoughthis is a common method of recruitment (e.g., Bonn-Miller et al. 2014 ; Grella, Rodriguez, and Kim 2014; Aggarwal et al. 2013 ;R e i m a n 2009, 2007; Harris et al. 2000), such samples may have a positive bias for medical cannabis, asindividuals who medicate with cannabis but for whom it was not effective are unlikely to be available to participate.However, at least one study using a large, representative sample of current and former medical cannabis users reported similar ndings (Ryan-Ibarra, Induni, and Ewing2015), lending validity to the results of the present study and those of previous research. Second, relatively few patients reported using medical cannabis for some of theconditions. Although this is not surprising, given the low incidence of some conditions, conclusions should be tem- pered for these conditions with respect to the effectiveness of medical cannabis for providing relief and /or for use as a substitute for other medications. Finally, patients' expe- riences acquiring and their knowledge of medical cannabis before and after legalization were assessed retrospectively, using a single measurement time-point. Despite these limitations, this study has signi- cance for understanding the characteristics, behaviors,and perceptions of Arizona medical cannabis patients.Additionally, it highlights the importance of studying patients throughout the US and understanding the poten- tial effects of state-level regulatory differences on patientpopulations. The ndings regarding the effectiveness of cannabis for treating various conditions have potential policy implications for the state of Arizona, as patientsreported that cannabis was effective for treating condi- tions that currently do not qualify individuals for med- ical cannabis use. Furthermore, the results showed that the majority of patients report positive experiences as a result of legalization, although more work is needed tofully understand the consequences of Arizona's medical cannabis program.

Themed Issue: Cannabinoids in Biology and Medicine, Part I REVIEW bph_1238 1344..1364 Taming THC: potential cannabis synergy andphytocannabinoid-terpenoidentourage effects Ethan B Russo GW Pharmaceuticals, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UKCorrespondence Ethan Russo, November 2010 Revised 29 December 2010 Accepted 12 January 2011 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been the primary focus of cannabis research since 1964, when Raphael Mechoulam isolated and synthesized it. More recently, the synergistic contributions of cannabidiol to cannabis pharmacology including tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabigerol andcannabichromene, exert additional effects of therapeutic interest. Innovative conventional plant breeding has yielded cannabischemotypes expressing high titres of each component for future study. This review will explore another echelon ofphytotherapeutic precursor with phytocannabinoids, and are all flavour and fragrancecomponents common to human diets that have been designated Generally Recognized as Safe by the US Food and DrugAdministration and other regulatory agencies. Terpenoids are quite potent, and affect animal and even human behaviourwhen inhaled from ambient air at serum levels in the single digits ng\u00b7mL -1. They display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute meaningfully to the entourage effects of cannabis-based medicinal extracts. Particular focus will be placed onphytocannabinoid-terpenoid interactions that could produce synergy with respect to treatment of pain, inflammation,depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Scientic evidence is presented for non-cannabinoid plant components as putative antidotes to intoxicating effects ofTHC that could increase its therapeutic index. Methods for investigating entourage effects in future experiments will beproposed. Phytocannabinoid-terpenoid synergy, if proven, increases the likelihood that an extensive pipeline of newtherapeutic products is possible from this venerable plant.

While a host of phytocannabinoids were discovered in tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) (Gill et al., 1970), the overwhelming preponderance of research focused on psycho-active THC. Only recently has renewed interest been manifestin THC analogues, while other key components of the activ-ity cannabis and its extracts, the cannabis terpenoids,remain understudied (McPartland and Russo, 2001b;Russo and McPartland, 2003). The current review will recon-sider essential oil (EO) agents, their peculiar pharmacologyand possible therapeutic interactions with phytocannab-inoids. Nomenclature follows conventions in Alexander et al. (2009). Phytocannabinoids and terpenoids are synthesized in cannabis, in secretory cells inside glandular trichomes(Figure 1) that are most highly concentrated in unfertilizedfemale flowers prior to senescence (Potter, 2004; Potter,2009). Geranyl pyrophosphate viathe deoxyxylulose pathway in cannabis (Fellermeier et al., 2001), and is a parent compound to both phytocannabinoidsand terpenoids (Figure 2). After coupling with either olive-tolic acid or divarinic acid, pentyl or propyl cannabinoidacids are produced, respectively, via enzymes that accepteither substrate (de Meijer et al., 2003), a manifestation of Mechoulam's postulated 'Nature's Law of Stinginess'.Although having important biochemical properties in theirown right, acid forms of phytocannabinoids are most com-monly decarboxylated via heat to produce the more familiarneutral phytocannabinoids (Table 1). Alternatively, geranylpyrophosphate may form limonene and other monoterpe-noids in secretory cell plastids, or couple with isopentenylpyrophosphate in the cytoplasm to form farnesyl pyrophos-phate, parent compound to the sesquiterpenoids, thatco-localizes with transient potential vanilloid recep-tor (TRPV) 1 in human dorsal root ganglion, suggesting a rolein sensory processing of noxious stimuli (Bradshaw et al., 2009), and which is the most potent endogenous ligand todate on the G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 92 (Oh et al., 2008). An obvious question pertains to the chemical ecology of such syntheses that require obvious metabolic demands onthe plant (Gershenzon, 1994), and these will be considered. Is cannabis merely a crude vehicle for delivery of THC? Might it rather display herbal synergy (Williamson, 2001)encompassing potentiation of activity by active or inactivecomponents, antagonism (evidenced by the ability of CBD toreduce side effects of THC; Russo and Guy, 2006), summation,pharmacokinetic and metabolic interactions? Recently, fourbasic mechanisms of Ulrich-Merzenich, 2009): (i) multi-target effects; (ii) solubility or bioavail-ability; (iii) agent interactions affecting bacterial resistance;and (iv) modulation of adverse events. Cannabis was cited asan illustration. Could phytocannabinoids function analogously to the endocannabinoid system (ECS) with its combination ofactive and 'inactive' synergists, rst described as an entourage(Ben-Shabat et al., 1998), with subsequent renement (Mechoulam and Ben-Shabat, 1999) and qualication(p. 136): 'This type of synergism may play a role in the widelyheld (but not experimentally based) view that in some casesplants are better drugs than the natural products isolatedfrom them'. Support derives from studies in which cannabisextracts demonstrated effects two to four times greater thanTHC (Carlini et al., 1974); unidentied THC antagonists and synergists were claimed (Fairbairn and Pickens, 1981), anti-convulsant activity was observed beyond the cannabinoidfraction (Wilkinson et al., 2003), and extracts of THC and CBD modulated effects in hippocampal neurones distinctlyfrom pure compounds (Ryan et al., 2006). Older literature also presented refutations: no observed differences werenoted by humans ingesting or smoking pure THC versusherbal cannabis (Wachtel et al., 2002); pure THC seemed to account for all tetrad-type effects in mice (Varvel et al., 2005); and smoked cannabis with varying CBD or CBC contentfailed to yield subjective differences combined with THC (Ilanet al., 2005). Explanations include that the cannabisemployed by Wachtel yielded 2.11% THC, but admission that CBN and CBD contentmight be too low to modulate THC. Another factor is appar-ent in that terpenoid yields from vaporization of street can-nabis were 4.3-8.5 times of those from US National Instituteon Drug Abuse cannabis (Bloor et al., 2008). It is undisputed that the black market cannabis in the UK (Potter et al., 2008), Continental Europe (King et al., 2005) and the USA (Meh- medic et al., 2010) has become almost exclusively a high-THC preparation to the almost total exclusion of other phytocan-nabinoids. If - as many consumers and experts maintain(Clarke, 2010) - there are biochemical, pharmacological and Figure 1 Cannabis capitate glandular (EBR by permission of Bedrocan BV, Netherlands).BJPPhytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects British Journal of Pharmacology (2011) 163 1344-1364 1345phenomenological distinctions between available cannabis 'strains', such phenomena are most likely related to relativeterpenoid contents and ratios. This treatise will assess addi-tional evidence for putative synergistic phytocannabinoid-terpenoid effects exclusive of THC, to ascertain whether thisbotanical may full its promise as, 'a neglected pharmaco-logical treasure trove' (Mechoulam, 2005). Phytocannabinoids, beyond THC: Phytocannabinoids are exclusively produced in cannabis (vide infra for exception), but their evolutionary and eco- logical raisons d'\u00eatre were obscure until recently. THC pro- duction is maximized with increased light energy (Potter,2009). It has been known for some time that CBG and CBCare mildly antifungal (ElSohly et al., 1982), CBD against a cannabis pathogen (McPartland, 1984). Morepertinent, however, is the mechanical stickiness of thetrichomes, capable of trapping insects with all six legs(Potter, 2009). Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) andcannabichromenic acid (Morimoto et al., 2007), as well as cannabidiolic acid and cannabigerolic acid (CBGA; Shoyamaet al., 2008) produce necrosis in plant cells. Normally, thecannabinoid acids are sequestered in trichomes away fromthe flower tissues. Any trichome breakage at senescence maycontribute to natural pruning of lower fan leaves that oth-erwise utilize energy that the plant preferentially diverts tothe flower, in continued efforts to affect fertilization, gen-erally in vain when subject to human horticulture for phar-maceutical production. THCA and CBGA have also provento be insecticidal in their own right (Sirikantaramas et al., 2005). Over 100 phytocannabinoids have been identied (Bren- neisen, 2007; Mehmedic et al., 2010), but many are artefacts of analysis or are produced in trace quantities that have notpermitted thorough investigation. The pharmacology of themore accessible phytocannabinoids has received excellentrecent reviews and Di Marzo, 2010; De Petrocellis et al., 2011), and will be summarized here, with emphasis on activities withparticular Russo British Journal (2011) 1344-1364Table 1 Phytocannabinoid activity table 2009) AI/antioxidant (Hampson et al., 1998) Limonene et al.

THC is a partial agonist at CB 1and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB 2) analogous to AEA, and underlying many of its activities as apsychoactive agent, analgesic, muscle relaxant and antispas-modic (Pacher et al., 2006). Additionally, it is a bronchodila- tor (Williams et al., 1976), neuroprotective antioxidant (Hampson et al., 1998), antipruritic agent in cholestatic jaun- dice (Neff et al., 2002) and has 20 times the anti- inflammatory power of aspirin and twice that ofhydrocortisone (Evans, 1991). THC is likely to avoid potentialpitfalls of either COX-1 or COX-2 inhibition, as such activityis only noted at concentrations far above those attainedtherapeutically (Stott et al., 2005). CBD is the most common phytocannabinoid in bre (hemp) plants, and second most prevalent in some drugchemotypes. It has proven extremely versatile pharmacologi-cally (Table 1) (Pertwee, 2004; Mechoulam et al., 2007), dis- playing the unusual ability to antagonize CB 1at a low nM level in the presence of THC, despite having little bindingafnity (Thomas et al., 2007), and supporting its modulatory effect on THC-associated adverse events such as anxiety,tachycardia, hunger and sedation in rats and humans(Nicholson et al., 2004; Murillo-Rodriguez et al., 2006; Russo and Guy, 2006). CBD is an analgesic (Costa et al., 2007), is a neuroprotective antioxidant more potent than ascorbate ortocopherol (Hampson et al., 1998), without COX inhibition (Stott et al., 2005), acts as a TRPV1 agonist analogous to capsaicin but without noxious effect (Bisogno et al., 2001), while also inhibiting uptake of AEA and weakly inhibiting itshydrolysis. CBD is an antagonist on GPR55, and also onGPR18, possibly supporting a therapeutic role in disorders ofcell migration, notably endometriosis (McHugh et al., 2010). CBD is anticonvulsant (Carlini and Cunha, 1981; Jones et al., 2010), anti-nausea (Parker et al., 2002), cytotoxic in breast cancer (Ligresti et al., 2006) and many other cell lines while being cyto-preservative for normal cells (Parolaro and al., 2000), enhances adenosine receptor A 2Asignalling via inhibition of an adenosine transporter (Carrier et al., 2006), and prevents prion accumulation and neuronal toxicity (Dirikoc et al., 2007). A CBD extract showed greater anti-hyperalgesia overpure compound in a rat model with decreased allodynia,improved thermal perception and nerve growth factor levelsand decreased oxidative damage (Comelli et al., 2009). CBD also displayed powerful activity against methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.5-2 mg\u00b7mL -1(Appendino et al., 2008). In 2005, it was demonstrated that CBD has agonisticactivity at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1Aat 16 mM (Russo et al., 2005), and that despite the high concentration, mayunderlie its anti-anxiety activity (Resstel et al., 2009; Soares Vde et al., 2010), reduction of stroke risk (Mishima et al., 2005), anti-nausea effects (Rock et al., 2009) and ability to affect improvement in cognition in a mouse model of hepaticencephalopathy (Magen et al., 2009). A recent study has dem- onstrated that CBD 30 mg\u00b7kg -1i.p. reduced immobility time in the forced swim test compared to imipramine (P <0.01), an effect blocked by pre-treatment with the 5-HT 1AantagonistWAY100635 (Zanelati et al., 2010), supporting a prospective role for CBD as an antidepressant. CBD also inhibits synthesisof lipids in sebocytes, and produces apoptosis at higher dosesin a model of acne (vide infra). One example of CBD antago-nism to THC would be the recent observation of lymphope-nia in rats (CBD 5 mg\u00b7kg -1) mediated by possible CB 2inverse agonism (Ignatowska-Jankowska et al., 2009), an effect not reported in humans even at doses of pure CBD up to 800 mg(Crippa et al., 2010), possibly due to marked interspecies differences in CB 2sequences and signal transduction. CBD proved to be a critical factor in the ability of nabiximolsoromucosal extract in successfully treating intractable cancerpain patients unresponsive to opioids (30% reduction in painfrom baseline), as a high-THC extract devoid of CBD failed todistinguish from placebo (Johnson et al., 2010). This may represent true synergy if the THC-CBD combination wereshown to provide a larger effect than a summation of thosefrom the compounds separately (Berenbaum, 1989). on adenylate cyclase inhibi- tion 1987), but showed activity in mouse can-nabinoid tetrad, but only at 100 mg\u00b7kg -1, and at a fraction of THC activity, via a non-CB 1, non-CB 2mechanism (Delong et al., 2010). More pertinent are anti-inflammatory (Wirthet al., 1980) and analgesic activity (Davis and Hatoum, 1983),its ability to reduce THC intoxication in mice (Hatoum et al., 1981), antibiotic and antifungal effects (ElSohly et al., 1982), and observed cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines (Ligresti et al., 2006). A CBC-extract displayed pronounced antidepressanteffect in rodent models (Deyo and Musty, 2003). Additionally,CBC was comparable to mustard oil in stimulating TRPA1-mediated Ca ++in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (50- 60 nM) (De Petrocellis et al., 2008). CBC recently proved to be a strong AEA uptake inhibitor (De Petrocellis et al., 2011). CBC production is normally maximal, earlier in the plant'slife cycle (de Meijer et al., 2009a). An innovative technique employing cold water extraction of immature leaf matterfrom selectively bred cannabis chemotypes yields a high-CBC'enriched trichome preparation' (Potter, 2009). CBG (Table 1), the parent phytocannabinoid compound, has a relatively weak partial agonistic effect at CB 1(Ki 440 nM) and CB 2(Ki337 nM) (Gauson et al., 2007). Older work supports gamma acid (GABA) uptakeinhibition greater than THC or CBD (Banerjee et al., 1975) that could suggest muscle relaxant properties. Analgesic andanti-erythemic effects and the ability to block lipooxygenasewere said to surpass those of THC (Evans, 1991). CBG dem-onstrated modest antifungal effects (ElSohly et al., 1982). More recently, it proved to be an effective cytotoxic in highdosage on human epithelioid carcinoma (Baek et al., 1998), is the next most effective phytocannabinoid against breastcancer after CBD (Ligresti et al., 2006), is an antidepressant in the rodent tail suspension model (Musty and Deyo, 2006)and is a mildly anti-hypertensive agent al., Additionally, CBG inhibits keratinocyte proliferation suggest-ing utility in psoriasis (Wilkinson and Williamson, 2007), it isa relatively potent TRPM8 antagonist for possible applicationin prostate cancer (De Petrocellis and Di Marzo, 2010) anddetrusor over-activity and bladder pain (Mukerji et al., 2006). It is a strong AEA uptake inhibitor (De Petrocellis et al., 2011) and a agent MRSA (Appendino et al., 2008; vide infra). behaves as a potent a-2 adrenorecep-BJPEB Russo 1348 British Journal of Pharmacology (2011) 163 1344-1364tor agonist, supporting analgesic effects previously noted (Formukong et al., 1988), and moderate 5-HT 1Aantagonist suggesting antidepressant properties (Cascio et al., 2010). Normally, CBG appears as a relatively low concentrationintermediate in the plant, but recent breeding work hasyielded cannabis chemotypes lacking in downstreamenzymes that express 100% as CBG and Hammond, 2005; de Meijeret al., 2009a). THCV (Table 1) is a propyl analogue of THC, and can modulate intoxication of the latter, displaying 25% of itspotency in early testing (Gill et al., 1970; Hollister, 1974). A recrudescence of interest accrues to this compound, which isaC B 1antagonist at lower doses (Thomas et al., 2005), but is a CB 1agonist at higher doses (Pertwee, 2008). THCV produces weight loss, decreased body fat and serum leptin concentra-tions with increased energy expenditure in obese mice(Cawthorne 2007; Riedel et al., in pyriform cortex (Hill et al., 2010). THCV appears as a fractional component of many southern African can-nabis chemotypes, although plants highly predominant inthis agent have been produced (de Meijer, 2004). THCVrecently demonstrated a CB 2-based ability to suppress carageenan-induced hyperalgesia and inflammation, andboth phases of formalin-induced pain behaviour via CB 1and CB 2in mice (Bolognini et al., 2010). CBDV (Table 1), the propyl analogue of CBD, was rst isolated in 1969 (Vollner et al., 1969), but formerly received little investigation. Pure CBDV inhibits diacylglycerol lipase[50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) 16.6 mM] and might decrease activity of its product, the endocannabinoid, 2-AG(De Petrocellis et al., 2011). It is also anticonvulsant in rodent hippocampal brain slices, comparable to phenobarbitone andfelbamate (Jones et al., 2010). Finally, CBN is a non-enzymatic oxidative by-product of THC, more prominent in aged cannabis samples (Merzoukiand Mesa, 2002). It has a lower afnity for CB 1(Ki211.2 nM) and CB 2(Ki126.4 nM) (Rhee et al., 1997); and was judged inactive when tested alone in human volunteers, but pro-duced greater sedation combined with THC (Musty et al., 1976). CBN demonstrated anticonvulsant (Turner et al., 1980), anti-inflammatory (Evans, 1991) and potent effectsagainst MRSA (MIC 1 threshold thermosensor) agonist (EC 77.7 mM) of possible interest in treatment of burns (Qin et al., 2008). Like CBG, it inhibits keratinocyte proliferation (Wilkinson and William-son, 2007), independently of cannabinoid receptor effects.CBN stimulates the recruitment of quiescent mesenchymalstem cells in marrow (10 mM), suggesting promotion of bone formation (Scutt and Williamson, 2007) and inhibits breastcancer resistance protein, albeit at a very high concentration(IC 50145 mM) (Holland et al., 2008). Cannabis terpenoids: neglected entourage compounds? Terpenoids are EO components, previously conceived as the quintessential fth element, 'life force' or spirit (Schmidt,2010), and form the largest group of plant chemicals, with15-20 000 fully characterized (Langenheim, 1994). Terpe-noids, not cannabinoids, are responsible for the aroma ofcannabis. Over 200 have been reported in the plant (Hendrikset al., 1975; 1977; Malingre et 1997;Rothschild et al., 2005; Brenneisen, 2007), but only a few studies have concentrated on their pharmacology (McPart-land and Pruitt, 1999; McPartland and Mediavilla, less than 1% inmost cannabis assays, but they may represent Monoterpenes usually pre-dominate (limonene, myrcene, pinene), but these headspacevolatiles (Hood et al., 1973), while only lost at a rate of about 5% before processing (Gershenzon, 1994), do suffer dimin-ished yields with drying and storage (Turner et al., 1980; Ross and ElSohly, 1996), resulting in a higher relative proportionof sesquiterpenoids (especially caryophyllene), as also oftenoccurs in extracts. A 'phytochemical polymorphism' seemsoperative in the plant (Franz and Novak, 2010), as productionfavours agents such as limonene and pinene in flowers thatare repellent to insects (Nerio et al., 2010), while lower fan leaves express higher concentrations of bitter sesquiterpe-noids that act as anti-feedants for grazing animals (Potter,2009). Evolutionarily, terpenoids seem to occur in complexand variable mixtures with marked structural diversity toserve various ecological roles. Terpenoid composition isunder genetic control (Langenheim, 1994), and someenzymes produce multiple products, again supportingMechoulam's 'Law of Stinginess'. The particular mixture ofmono- and sesquiterpenoids will determine viscosity, and incannabis, this certainly is leveraged to practical advantage asthe notable stickiness of cannabis exudations traps insects(McPartland et al., 2000), and thus, combined with the insec- ticidal phytocannabinoid acids (Sirikantaramas et al., 2005), provides a mechano-chemical defensive strategyversus predators. As observed for cannabinoids, terpenoid production increases with light exposure, but decreases with soil fertility(Langenheim, 1994), and this is supported by the glasshouseexperience that demonstrates higher yields if plants experi-ence relative nitrogen lack just prior to harvest (Potter, 2004),favouring floral over foliar growth. EO composition is muchmore genetically than environmentally determined, however(Franz and Novak, 2010), and while cannabis is allogamousand normally requires repeat selective breeding for mainte-nance of quality, this problem may be practically circum-vented by vegetative propagation of high-performance plantsunder controlled environmental conditions (light, heat andhumidity) (Potter, 2009), and such techniques have proven toprovide notable consistency to tight tolerances as GoodManufacturing Practice for any pharmaceutical would require(Fischedick et al., 2010). TheEuropean Pharmacopoeia, Sixth Edition (2007), lists 28 EOs (Pauli and Schilcher, 2010). Terpenoids are pharmaco-logically versatile: they are lipophilic, interact cell neuronal muscle ion channels, neurotransmitterreceptors, G-protein coupled (odorant) receptors, secondmessenger systems and enzymes (Bowles, Buchbauer,2010). All the terpenoids discussed herein are Generally Rec-ognized as Safe, as attested by the US Food and Drug Admin-BJPPhytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects British Journal of Pharmacology (2011) 163 1344-1364 1349istration as food additives, or by the Food and Extract Manufacturers Association and other world regulatorybodies. Germane is the observation (Adams and Taylor, 2010)(p. 193), 'With a high degree of condence one may presumethat EOs derived from food are likely to be safe'. Additionally,all the current entries are non-sensitizing to skin when fresh(Tisserand and Balacs, 1995; Adams and Taylor, 2010), butmay cause allergic reactions at very low rates when oxidized(Matura et al., 2005). For additional pharmacological data on other common cannabis terpenoids not (2001b). Are cannabis terpenoids actually relevant to the effects of cannabis? Terpenoid components in concentrations above0.05% are considered of pharmacological interest (Adams andTaylor, 2010). Animal studies are certainly supportive (Buch-bauer et al., 1993). Mice exposed to terpenoid odours inhaled from ambient air for 1 h demonstrated profound effects onactivity levels, suggesting a direct pharmacological effect onthe brain, even at extremely low 45% reduction at 4.7 ng\u00b7mL-1). These levels are comparable to those of THC measured in humans receivingcannabis extracts yielding therapeutic effects in pain, orsymptoms of multiple sclerosis in various randomized con-trolled 2006; limonene, 35.25% increase in mouse activ-ity), could be explainable on the basis of rapid redistributionand concentration in lipophilic cerebral structures. A similarrationale pertains to human studies (Komori et al., 1995), subsequently discussed. Limonene is highly bioavailable with70% human pulmonary uptake (Falk-Filipsson et al., 1993), and a gure of 60% for pinene with rapid metabolism orredistribution (Falk et al., 1990). Ingestion and percutaneous absorption is also well documented in humans (J\u00e4ger et al., 1992): 1500 mg of lavender EO with 24.7% linalool (total372 mg) was massaged into the skin of a 60 kg man for10 min, resulting in a peak plasma concentration of100 ng\u00b7mL -1at 19 min, and a half-life of 13.76 min in serum (J\u00e4ger et al., 1992). EO mixtures (including limonene also increase permeation through mouseskin (Monti et al., 2002). Government-approved cannabis supplied to patients in national programmes in the Netherlands and Canada isgamma-irradiated to sterilize coliform bacteria, but the safetyof this technique for a smoked and inhaled product has neverbeen specically tested. Gamma-radiation signicantlyreduced and linalool in orange juice (Fan andGates, 2001). D-limonene, common to the lemon and other citrus EOs (Table 2), is the second most widely distributed terpenoid innature (Noma and Asakawa, 2010), and is the precursor toother monoterpenoids (Figure 2) through species-specicsynthetic schemes. Unfortunately, these pathways have notyet been investigated in cannabis. The ubiquity of limoneneserves, perhaps, as a demonstration of convergent evolutionthat supports an important ecological role for this monoter-pene. Studies with varying methodology and dosing in citrusoils in mice suggest it to be a powerful anxiolytic agent(Carvalho-Freitas and Costa, 2002; Pultrini Ade et al., 2006), with one EO increasing serotonin in the prefrontal cortex,and dopamine (DA) in hippocampus mediated via 5-HT 1A (Komiya et al., 2006). Compelling conrmatory evidence in humans was provided in a clinical study (Komori et al., 1995), in which hospitalized depressed patients were exposed tocitrus fragrance in ambient air, with subsequent normaliza-tion of Hamilton Depression Scores, successful discontinua-tion of antidepressant medication in 9/12 patients and serumevidence of immune stimulation (CD4/8 ratio normaliza-tion). Limonene also produces apoptosis of breast cancercells, and was employed at high doses in Phase II RCTs(Vigushin et al., 1998). Subsequent investigation in cancer treatment has centred on its immediate hepatic metabolite,perillic acid, which demonstrates anti-stress effects in ratbrain (Fukumoto et al., 2008). A patent has been submitted, claiming that limonene effectively treats gastro-oesophagealreflux (Harris, 2010). Citrus EOs containing limonene provedeffective against dermatophytes (Sanguinetti et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2010), and citrus EOs with terpenoid proles resembling those in cannabis demonstrated strong radicalscavenging properties (Choi et al., 2000). As noted above, limonene is highly bioavailable (Falk-Filipsson et al., 1993), and rapidly metabolized, but with indications of accumula-tion and retention in adipose tissues (e.g. brain). It is highlynon-toxic (estimated human lethal dose 0.5-5 g\u00b7kg -1) and non-sensitizing monoterpenoid in can- nabis (Table 2) with myriad activities: diminishing inflam-mation via prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) (Lorenzetti et al., 1991), and blocking hepatic carcinogenesis by aflatoxin (De-Oliveira et al., 1997). Interestingly, myrcene is analgesic in mice, but this action can be blocked by naloxone, perhapsvia the a-2 adrenoreceptor (Rao et al., 1990). It is non- mutagenic in the Ames test (Gomes-Carneiro et al., 2005). Myrcene is a recognized sedative as part of hops prepara-tions (Humulus lupulus), employed to aid sleep in Germany(Bisset and Wichtl, 2004). Furthermore, myrcene acted as amuscle relaxant in mice, and potentiated barbiturate sleeptime at high doses (do Vale et al., 2002). Together, these data would support the hypothesis that myrcene is a promi-nent sedative terpenoid in cannabis, and combined withTHC, may produce the 'couch-lock' phenomenon of certainchemotypes that is alternatively decried or appreciated byrecreational cannabis consumers. a-Pinene is a bicyclic monoterpene (Table 2), and the most widely encountered terpenoid in nature (Noma andAsakawa, 2010). It appears in conifers and innumerable plantEOs, with an insect-repellent role. It is anti-inflammatory viaPGE-1 (Gil et al., 1989), and is a bronchodilator in humans at low exposure levels (Falk et al., 1990). Pinene is a major com- ponent of Sideritis spp. (Kose et al., 2010) and Salvia spp. EOs (Ozek et al., 2010), both with prominent activity against MRSA (vide infra). Beyond this, it seems to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Nissen et al., 2010). a-Pinene forms the biosynthetic base for CB 2ligands, such as HU-308 (Hanus et al., 1999). Perhaps most compelling, however, is its activityas an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aiding memory (Perryet al., 2000), with an observed IC 50of 0.44 mM (MiyazawaBJPEB Russo 1350 British Journal of Pharmacology 163 1344-1364Table 2 Cannabis Terpenoid via 5-HT 1A(Komiya et al., 2006)CBD Apoptosis of breast cancer cells (Vigushin et al., 1998) CBD, CBG Active against acne bacteria (Kim et al., 2008) CBD Dermatophytes (Sanguinetti et al., 2007; Singh et reflux (Harris, 2010) THC a-Pinene PineAnti-inflammatory via PGE-1 (Gil et al., 1989) CBD in humans (Falk et al., 1990) THC Acetylcholinesterase aiding memory (Perry via Vale et THC Blocks hepatic by Oliveira mice (Buchbauer et al., 1993) THC Local anesthetic (Re et al., 2000) THC Analgesic via adenosine A 2A(Peana et al., THCV, via (Basile et cytoprotective (Tambe et al., 1996) THC Anti-malarial (Campbell et al., 1997) ?

This feature could by THC intoxication (vide infra). D-Linalool is a monoterpenoid alcohol common to lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), whose psycho-tropic anxiolytic activity has been reviewed in detail (Russo,2001). Interestingly, linalyl acetate, the other primary terpe-noid in lavender, hydrolyses to linalool in gastric secretions(Bickers et al., 2003). Linalool proved sedating to mouse activ- ity on inhalation (Buchbauer et al., 1991; Jirovetz et al., 1992). In traditional aromatherapy, linalool is the likelysuspect in the remarkable therapeutic capabilities of lavenderEO to alleviate skin burns without scarring (Gattefosse, 1993).Pertinent to this, the local anaesthetic effects of linalool (Reet al., 2000) are equal to those of procaine and menthol(Ghelardini et al., 1999). Another explanation would be its ability to produce hot-plate analgesia in mice ( P<0.001) that was reduced by administration of an adenosine A 2Aantago- nist (Peana et al., 2006). It is also anti-nociceptive at high doses in mice via ionotropic glutamate receptors (Batistaet al., 2008). Linalool demonstrated anticonvulsant and anti-glutamatergic activity (Elisabetsky et al., 1995), and reduced seizures as part of Ocimum basilicum EO after exposure to linalool decreased K release and uptake in mouse synaptosomes (Silva Brum et al., 2001). These effects were summarized (Nunes et al., 2010, p. 303): 'Overall, it seems reasonable to argue that the modu-lation of glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems arelikely to be the critical mechanism responsible for the seda-tive, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant a powerful anti-leishmanial agent (doSocorro et al., 2003), and as a presumed EO compo- nent, decreased morphine opioid usage in gastric banding in morbidly obese surgical patients (Kim et al., 2007). b-Caryophyllene (Table 2) is generally the most common sesquiterpenoid encountered in cannabis (Mediavilla andSteinemann, 1997), wherein its evolutionary function may bedue to its ability to attract insect predatory green lacewings,while simultaneously inhibiting insect herbivory (Langen-heim, 1994). It is frequently the predominant terpenoidoverall in cannabis extracts, particularly if they have beenprocessed under heat for decarboxylation (Guy and Stott,2005). Caryophyllene is common to black pepper and ofcinalis) (Lawless,1995). It inpotency to the toxic phenylbutazone (Basile et al., 1988), and an EO containing it was on par with etodolac and indometha-cin (Ozturk and Ozbek, 2005). In contrast to the latter agents,however, caryophyllene was a gastric cytoprotective (Tambeet al., 1996), much as had been claimed in the past in treatingduodenal ulcers in the UK with cannabis extract (Douth-waite, 1947). Caryophyllene may have contributed to anti-malarial effects as an EO component (Campbell et al., 1997). Perhaps the greatest revelation regarding caryophyllene hasbeen its demonstration as a selective full agonist at CB 2 (100 nM), the rst proven phytocannabinoid beyond thecannabis genus (Gertsch et al., 2008). Subsequent work has demonstrated that this dietary component produced anti-inflammatory analgesic activity at the lowest dose of5 mg\u00b7kg -1in wild-type, but not CB 2knockout mice (Gertsch, 2008). Given the lack of attributed psychoactivity of CB 2 agonists, caryophyllene offers great promise as a therapeuticcompound, whether systemically, or in dermatological appli-cations such as contact dermatitis (Karsak et al., 2007). Sen- sitization reactions are quite rare, and probably due tooxidized product (Skold et al., 2006). Nerolidol is a sesquiterpene alcohol with sedative proper- ties (Binet et al., 1972), present as a low-level component in orange and other citrus peels (Table 2). It diminished experi-mentally induced formation of colon adenomas in rats (Wat-tenberg, 1991). It was an effective agent for enhancing skinpenetration of 5-fluorouracil (Cornwell and Barry, 1994). Thiscould be a helpful property in treating fungal growth, whereit is also an inhibitor (Langenheim, 1994). It seems to haveanti-protozoal parasite control benets, as a potent antima-larial (Lopes et al., 1999; Rodrigues Goulart et al., 2004) anti-leishmanial agent (Arruda al., 2005). Nerolidol is non- toxic and non-sensitizing (Lapczynski et al., 2008). Caryophyllene oxide (Table 2) is a sesquiterpenoid oxide common to lemon balm (Melissa ofcinalis), and to the euca-lyptus, Melaleuca stypheloides, whose EO contains 43.8% (Farag et al., 2004). In the plant, it serves as an insecticidal/ anti-feedant (Bettarini et al., 1993) and as broad-spectrum antifungal in plant defence (Langenheim, 1994). Analo-gously, the latter properties may prove therapeutic, as caryo-phyllene oxide demonstrated antifungal efcacy in a modelof clinical onychomycosis to ciclopiroxalamineand sulconazole, with an 8% concentration affecting eradi-cation in 15 days (Yang et al., 1999). Caryophyllene oxide is non-toxic and non-sensitizing (Opdyke, 1983). This agentalso demonstrates anti-platelet aggregation properties in vitro (Lin et al., 2003). Caryophyllene oxide has the distinction of being the component responsible for cannabis identicationby drug-snifng dogs (Stahl and Kunde, 1973). Phytol (Table 2) is a diterpene (McGinty et al., 2010), present in cannabis extracts, as a breakdown product of chlo-rophyll and tocopherol. Phytol prevented vitamin A-inducedteratogenesis by inhibiting conversion of retinol to a harmfulmetabolite, all-trans-retinoic acid (Arnhold et al., increased GABA inhibition of succinicsemialdehyde dehydrogenase, one of its degradative enzymes(Bang et al., 2002). Thus, the presence of phytol could account for the alleged relaxing effect of wild lettuce (Lactucasativa), or green tea (Camellia sinensis), despite the latter'scaffeine content. Selected possibilities for phytocannabinoid-terpenoid synergy Cannabis and acne AEA simulates lipid production in human sebocytes of seba- ceous glands at low concentrations, but induces apoptosis athigher levels, suggesting that this system is under ECS control(Dobrosi et al., 2008). CBD 10-20 mM did not affect basal lipid synthesis in SZ95 sebocytes, but did block such stimulationby AEA and arachidonate (Biro et al., 2009). Higher doses (30-50 mM) induced sebocyte apoptosis, which was aug- mented in the presence of AEA. The effect of CBD to increaseBJPEB Russo 1352 British Journal of Pharmacology (2011) 163 1344-1364Ca++was blocked by ruthenium red, a TRP-inhibitor. RNA- mediated silencing of TRPV1 and TRPV3 failed to attenuate CBD effects, but experiments did support the aetiological roleof TRPV4, a putative regulator of systemic osmotic 2010, pers. comm.). Given the observed ability ofCBD to be absorbed transcutaneously, it offers great promiseto attenuate the increased sebum production at the patho-logical root of acne. Cannabis terpenoids could offer complementary activity. Two citrus EOs primarily composed of limonene inhibitedPropionibacterium acnes, the key potently than triclosan (Kim et al., 2008). Linalool alone demonstrated an MIC of 0.625 mL\u00b7mL-1. Both EOs P. acnes-induced TNF-a adjunctive anti-inflammatory effect. In a similarmanner, pinene was the most potent component of a tea-treeeucalyptus EO in suppression of P. acnes and Staph spp. in another report (Raman et al., 1995). Considering the known minimal toxicities of CBD and these terpenoids and the above ndings, new acne therapiesutilizing whole CBD-predominant extracts, via multi-targeting (Wagner and Ulrich-Merzenich, 2009), may presenta novel and promising therapeutic approach that posesminimal risks in comparison to isotretinoin. MRSA MRSA accounted for 10% of cases of septicaemia and 18 650deaths in the USA in 2005, a number greater than that attrib-utable to human immunodeciency virus/acquired al., a major component of Sideritis erythrantha EO that was as effective against MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains as vancomycin andother agents (Kose et al., 2010). A Salvia rosifolia -1). The ability of monoterpenoids to enhance skin permeability and entry of other drugs may further enhanceantibiotic benets (Wagner and Ulrich-Merzenich, 2009). Given that CBG can be produced in selected cannabis chemotypes (de Meijer and Hammond, 2005; de Meijer et al., 2009a), with no residual THC as a possible drug abuse liabilityrisk, a whole plant extract of a CBG-chemotype also express-ing pinene would seem to offer an excellent, safe new anti-septic agent. Psychopharmacological applications: depression, anxiety, insomnia,dementia and addiction Scientic investigation of the therapeutic application of ter- penoids in psychiatry has been hampered by methodologicalconcerns, subjective variability of results and a genuinedearth of appropriate randomized controlled studies of highquality (Russo, 2001; 2003; Lis-Balchin, Thesame is true of phytocannabinoids (Fride and Russo, 2006).Abundant evidence supports the key role of the ECS in medi-ating depression (Hill and Gorzalka, 2005a,b), as well asanxiety, whether induced by aversive stimuli, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (Marsicano et al., 2002) or pain (Hohmann et al., 2005), and psychosis (Giuffrida et al., 2004). With respect to the latter risk, the presence of CBD in smokedcannabis based on hair analysis seems to be a mitigatingfactor reducing its observed incidence (Morgan and Curran,2008). A thorough review of cannabis and psychiatry isbeyond the scope of this article, but several suggestions areoffered with respect to possible therapeutic synergies opera-tive with phytocannabinoids-terpenoid combinations. Whilethe possible benets of THC on remain (Denson Earleywine, much less worrisomewould be CBD- or CBG-predominant preparations. Certainlythe results obtained in human depression solely with a citrusscent (Komori et al., 1995), strongly suggest the possibility of synergistic benet of a phytocannabinoid-terpenoid prepara-tion. Enriched odour exposure in adult mice induced olfac-tory system neurogenesis (Rochefort et al., 2002), an intriguing result that could hypothetically support plasticitymechanisms in depression (Delgado and Moreno, 1999), andsimilar hypotheses with respect to the ECS in addiction treat-ment (Gerdeman and Lovinger, 2003). Phytocannabinoid-terpenoid synergy might theoretically apply. The myriad effects of CBD on 5-HT 1Aactivity provide a strong rationale for this and other phytocannabinoids as basecompounds for treatment of anxiety. Newer ndings, particu-larly imaging studies of CBD in normal individuals in anxietymodels (Fusar-Poli et al., 2009; 2010; Crippa et al., 2010) support this hypothesis. Even more compelling is a recentrandomized control trial of pure CBD in patients with socialanxiety disorder with highly statistical improvements overplacebo in anxiety and cognitive impairment (Crippa et al., 2011). Addition of anxiolytic limonene and linalool couldcontribute to the clinical efcacy of a CBD extract. THC was demonstrated effective in a small crossover clini- cal trial versus placebo in 11 agitated dementia patients withAlzheimer's disease (Volicer et al., 1997). THC was also observed to be an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in its ownright, as well as preventing amyloid b-peptide aggregation in that disorder (Eubanks et al., 2006). Certainly, the anti- anxiety and anti-psychotic effects of CBD may al., 1991; 2006; Zuardi and Guimaraes, 1997). A recent study supports the concept thatCBD, when present in signicant proportion to THC, iscapable of eliminating induced cognitive and memory de-cits in normal subjects smoking cannabis (Morgan et al., 2010b). Furthermore, CBD may also have primary benets onreduction in linalool could putatively extendbenets in mood in such patients. The effects of cannabis on sleep have been reviewed (Russo et al., 2007), and highlight the benets that can accrue in this regard, particularly with respect to symptom reductionpermitting better sleep, as opposed to a mere hypnotic effect.Certainly, terpenoids with pain-relieving, anti-anxiety orsedative effects may supplement such activity, notably, caryo-phyllene, linalool and myrcene.BJPPhytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects British Journal of Pharmacology (2011) 163 1344-1364 1353The issue of cannabis addiction remains controversial. Some benet of oral THC has been noted in cannabis with- drawal (Hart et al., 2002; Haney et al., 2004). More intriguing, perhaps, are claims of improvement on other substancedependencies, particularly cocaine (Labigalini et al., 1999; Dreher, 2002). The situation with CBD is yet more promising.CBD and THC at rats, and CBD produced no hedoniceffects of its own (Parker et al., 2004). CBD 5 mg\u00b7kg -1\u00b7d-1in rats attenuated heroin-seeking behaviour by conditionedstimuli, even after a lapse of 2 weeks (Ren et al., 2009). A suggested mechanism of CBD relates to its abilityto reverse changes in a-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4- isoxazole-propionate glutamate and CB 1receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens induced by heroin. The authorsproposed CBD as a treatment for heroin craving and addic-tion relapse. A recent study demonstrated the fascinatingresult that patients with damage to the insula due to cere-brovascular accident were able to quit tobacco smokingwithout relapse or urges (Naqvi et al., 2007), highlighting this structure as a critical neural centre mediating addiction tonicotine. Further study has conrmed the role of the insula incocaine, alcohol and heroin addiction (Naqvi and Bechara,2009; Naqvi and Bechara, 2010). In a provocative parallel,CBD 600 mg p.o. was demonstrated to deactivate functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in human vol-unteers in the left insula versus placebo (P <0.01) without accompanying sedation or psychoactive changes (Borgwardtet al., 2008), suggesting the possibility that CBD could act asa pharmaceutical surrogate for insular damage in exerting ananti-addiction therapeutic benet. Human studies haverecently demonstrated that human volunteers smoking can-nabis with higher CBD content reduced their liking for drug-related stimuli, including food (Morgan et al., 2010a). The authors posited that CBD can modulate reinforcing proper-ties of drugs of abuse, and help in training to reduce relapseto alcoholism. A single case report of a successful withdrawalfrom cannabis dependency utilizing pure CBD treatment wasrecently published (Crippa et al., 2010). Perhaps terpenoids can provide adjunctive support. In a clinical trial, 48 cigarette smokers inhaling vapour from anEO of black pepper (Piper nigrum), a mint-menthol mixture orplacebo (Rose and Behm, 1994). Black pepper EO reducednicotine craving signicantly (P <0.01), an effect attributed to irritation of the bronchial tree, simulating the act of ciga-rette smoking, but without nicotine or actual burning ofmaterial. Rather, might not the effect have been pharmaco-logical? The terpenoid prole of black via increasedalertness, or via CB 2agonism and a newly discovered putative mechanism of action in addictiontreatment. CB 2is expressed in dopaminergic neurones in the area and nucleus accumbens, areas mediatingaddictive phenomena (Xi et al., 2010). Activation of CB 2by the synthetic agonist JWH144 administered systemically,intranasally, or by microinjection into the nucleus accum-bens in rats inhibited DA release and cocaine self-administration. Caryophyllene, as a high-potency selectiveCB 2agonist (Gertsch et al., 2008), would likely producesimilar effects, and have the advantage of being a non-toxic dietary component. All factors considered, CBD, withcaryophyllene, and possibly other adjunctive terpenoids inthe promise in future addictiontreatment. Taming THC: cannabis entourage compounds as antidotesto intoxication Various sources highlight the limited therapeutic index of pure THC, when given intravenously (D'Souza et al., 2004) or orally (Favrat et al., 2005), especially in people previously na\u00efve to its effects. Acute overdose incidents involving THCor THC-predominant cannabis usually consist of self-limitedpanic reactions or toxic psychoses, for which no pharmaco-logical intervention is generally necessary, and supportivecounselling (reassurance or of THC and reduces its adverse event prole(Russo and Guy, 2006), highlighted by recent results abovedescribed. Could it be, however, that other cannabis compo-nents offer additional attenuation of the less undesirableeffects of THC? History provides some clues. In 10th century Persia, Al-Razi offered a prescription in his Mana al-agdhiya wa-daf madarri-ha (p. 248), rendered (Lozano, 1993, p. 124; translation EBR) ' - and to avoid theseharms {from ingestion of cannabis seeds or hashish}, oneshould drink fresh water and ice or eat any acid fruits'. Thisconcept was repeated in various forms by various authoritiesthrough the ages, including ibn Sina (ibn Sina (Avicenna),1294), and Ibn al-Baytar (ibn al-Baytar, 1291), untilO'Shaughnessy Robert Christison subsequently citedlemon (Figure 3A) as an antidote to acute intoxication innumerous cases (Christison, 1851) and this excerpt regardingmorning-after residua (Christison, 1848) (p. 973): Next morning there was an ordinary appetite, muchtorpidity, great defect and shortness of memory, extremeapparent protraction of time, but no peculiarity ofarticulation or other effect; and these symptoms lasteduntil 2 P .M., when they ceased entirely in a few minutesafter taking lemonade. Literary icons on both sides of the Atlantic espoused similar support for the citrus cure in the 19th century,notably Bayard Taylor after travels in Syria (Taylor, 1855), andFitzhugh Ludlow after his voluntary experiments with everhigher cannabis extract doses in the USA (Ludlow, 1857). Thesentiment was repeated by Calkins (1871), who noted thesuggestion of a friend in Tunis that lemon retained the con-dence of cure of overdoses by cannabis users in that region.This is supported by the observation that lemon juice, whichnormally contains small terpenoid titres, is traditionallyenhanced in North Africa by the inclusion in drinks of thelimonene-rich rind, as evidenced by the recipe for Agua Lim\u00f3n from modern Morocco (Morse and Mamane, 2001). In hiscomprehensive review of cannabis in the rst half of the20th century, Walton once more supported its prescription(Walton, 1938).BJPEB Russo 1354 British Journal of Pharmacology (2011) 163 traditional antidote to cannabis employing Acorus (Figure 3B) is evident from the of India (Lad, 1990, p. 131): Calamus root is the best antidote for the ill effects of marijuana....i f o n e smokes a pinch of calamus root powder with the marijuana, this herb will completelyneutralize the toxic side effects of the drug. This claim has gained credence, not only through force of anecdotal accounts that abound on the Internet, butwith formal scientic case reports and scientic analysis(McPartland et al., 2008) documenting clearer thinking and improved memory with the cannabis-calamus combination,and with provision of the cannabis terpenoid, a-pinene, also has been characterized as a potent inhibitor of that enzyme (Miyazawaand Yamafuji, 2005), bolstering the hypothesis of a secondantidote to THC contained in cannabis itself. Historical pre-cedents also support pinene in this pharmacological role. In the rstt century, Pliny wrote of cannabis in his Natural History, Book XXIV 1980, p. The gelotophyllis ['leaves grows in Bactria and along the Borysthenes. If this be taken inmyrrh and wine all kinds of phantoms beset the mind,causing laughter which persists until the kernels of pine-nuts are taken with pepper and honey in palm wine. Of the components, palm wine is perhaps the most mys- terious. Ethanol does not reduce cannabis intoxication (Melloand Mendelson, 1978). However, ancient wines were stored inclay pots or goatskins, and required preservation, usually withaddition of pine tar or terebinth resin (from Pistacia spp.; McGovern et al., 2009). Pine tar is rich in pinene, as is tere- binth resin (from Pistacia terebinthus; Tsokou et al., 2007), while the latter also contains limonene (Duru et al., 2003). Likewise, the pine nuts (Figure 3C) prescribed by Pliny theElder harbour pinene, along with additional limonene (Sal-vadeo et al., 2007). Al-Ukbari also suggested pistachio nuts as a cannabis antidote in the 13th century (Lozano, 1993), and theripe fruits of Pistacia terebinthus similarly contain pinene (Cou- ladis et al., 2003). The black pepper (Figure 3D), might offer the mental clarity afforded by pinene, sedation via myrceneand helpful contributions by b-caryophyllene. The historical suggestions for cannabis antidotes are thus supported bymodern scientic rationales for the claims, and if provenexperimentally would provide additional evidence of synergy(Berenbaum, 1989; Wagner and Ulrich-Merzenich, 2009). Conclusions and suggestions for future study Considered ensemble, the preceding body of information supports the concept that selective breeding of cannabischemotypes rich in ameliorative phytocannabinoid and ter-penoid content offer complementary pharmacological activi-ties that may strengthen and broaden clinical applications andimprove the therapeutic index of cannabis extracts containingTHC, or other base phytocannabinoids. Psychopharmacologi-cal and dermatological indications show the greatest promise. Figure 3 Ancient cannabis antidotes. (A) Lemon ( Citrus limon). (B) Calamus spp.). (D) Black pepper (Piper nigrum ).BJPPhytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects British Journal of Pharmacology (2011) 163 1344-1364 1355One important remaining order of business the of mono- and sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic pathways in cannabis, speciesof plants (Croteau, 1987; Gershenzon and 1999; Trapp and Croteau, 2001). Various cannabis component combinations or cannabis extracts should be examined via high throughput pharmaco-logical screening where not previously accomplished. Anothergoal is the investigation of the biochemical targets of thecannabis terpenoids, along with their mechanisms of action,particularly in the central nervous system. Possible techniquesfor such research include radio-labelling of select agents inanimals with subsequent necropsy. On a molecular level,investigation of terpenoid changes to phytocannabinoidsignal transduction and trafcking may prove illuminating.While it is terpenoids bind to odorant nasal mucosa (Friedrich, 2004) and proximal olfactorystructures (Barnea et al., 2004), it would be essential to ascer- tain if direct effects in limbic or other cerebral structures areoperative. Given that farnesyl pyrophosphate is a sesquiterpe-noid precursor most potent endogenous agonist yetdiscovered for GPR92 (McHugh et al., 2010), in attempting to match minor cannabinoids and terpenoids toorphan GPCRs may prove fruitful. Behavioural assays ofagents in animal models may also provide clues. Simple com-binations of phytocannabinoids and terpenoids may demon-strate synergy as antibiotics if MICs appreciable emission studies inhumans, with simultaneous drug reaction questionnaires andpsychometric testing employing individual agents andphytocannabinoid-terpenoid pairings via vaporization or oro-mucosal application, would likely offer safe and effectivemethods to investigate possible interactions and synergy. Should positive outcomes result from such studies, phy- topharmaceutical development may follow. The develop-ment of zero-cannabinoid cannabis chemotypes (de Meijeret al., 2009b) has provided extracts that will facilitate discern-ment of the pharmacological effects and contributions ofdifferent fractions. Breeding work has already resulted inchemotypes that produce 97% of monoterpenoid content chemotypes has thus become arational target that may lead to novel approaches to suchdisorders as treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, drugdependency, dementia and a panoply of dermatological dis-orders, as well as industrial applications as safer pesticidesand antiseptics. A better future via cannabis phytochemistrymay be an achievable goal through further research of theentourage effect in this versatile plant that may help it fullits promise as a pharmacological treasure trove.

Methods: Between 5/03/2016 sessions self-administering medical cannabis and indicated their primary health symptom severity rating on an 11-point (0-10) visual analog scale in real-time prior to and following cannabis consumption, along with experienced side effects. Results: Releaf AppTMresponders used cannabis to treat myriad health symptoms, the most frequent relating to pain, anxiety, and depressive conditions. Signicant symptom severity reductions were reported for all the symptom categories, with mean reductions between 2.8 and 4.6 points (ds ranged from 1.29-2.39, ps<0.001). On average, higher pre-dosing symptom levels were associated with greater reported symptom relief, and users treating anxiety or depression-related symptoms reported signicantly more relief (ps<0.001) than users with pain symptoms. Of the 42 possible side effects, users were more likely to indicate and showed a stronger correlation between symptom relief and experiences of positive (94% of sessions) or a context-specic side effects (76%), whereas negative side effects (60%) were associated with lessened, yet still signicant symptom relief and were more common among patients treating a depressive symptom relative to patients treating anxiety and pain-related conditions. Conclusion: Patient-managed cannabis use is associated with clinically signicant improvements in self-reported symptom relief for treating a wide range of health conditions, along with frequent positive and negative side effects.

Medical Cannabis Effects INTRODUCTION Medicinal cannabis use is expanding rapidly in the United States, with thousands of new users daily, particularly older patients and people with signicant health concerns, treating many dierent symptoms (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016; Han et al., 2016). Most patients have a wide variety of medicinal cannabis products available to them, ranging from traditional flower to edibles and tinctures. Naturalistic observational studies are generally well-suited for capturing how patients manage their treatment decisions in real-life, and how patient-managed cannabis therapies may contribute to symptom relief and potential side eects from use. Observational research designs allow patients to use the myriad Cannabis strains and cannabis-derived formulations (e.g., concentrates, tinctures, edibles, topicals, suppositories, toothpaste) made at home and/or commercially available and widely used in society, and can incorporate the breadth of health conditions for which medical cannabis has been sanctioned for use at the state-level. Lastly, observational studies also circumvent research barriers associated with cannabis' Schedule I status under United States federal law, which makes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) challenging to conduct (Stith and Vigil, 2016; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Since its release in 2016, the commercially developed Releaf AppTMapplication (app; Releaf App, 2018) has been the only publically available, incentive-free patient educational software program designed for recording how individual cannabis usage sessions may correspond to immediate changes in primary symptom intensity levels and experienced side eects. This electronic assessment tool enables patients to monitor and manage their cannabis consumption decisions under naturalistic conditions while avoiding the limitations of retrospective survey collection methods (e.g., memory bias, social desirability eects). We used the Releaf AppTMrepository of over 2,830 patients and 13,368 individual cannabis administration sessions to examine two research questions: How does cannabis used under naturalistic conditions aect user-experienced symptom relief and side eects? Does the magnitude of experienced symptom relief and the prevalence of side eects vary across symptom categories? The results have clinical relevance for understanding how patient-managed medical cannabis therapies may correspond to changes in symptom intensity and potential side eects among people using cannabis for treating distinct health conditions (Hill and Weiss, 2016; Rubin, 2017). MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design A naturalistic observational research design, approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of New Mexico, was used to analyze the Releaf AppTMuser-submitted data recorded between 5/03/2016 and 12/16/2017. Releaf AppTMis a cross-platform (iOS and Android) mobile and tablet app backed by a secure cloud programming interface for capturing, processing, and storing anonymized user data. Out of 4,369 totalusers and 23,373 user interactions, we included only cannabis consumption sessions with reported starting symptom levels greater than 0 (on a 0-10, 11-point scale) and ending symptom levels reported within 90 min of the start of the session, resulting in a nal sample of 2,830 users and 13,638 individual sessions for analysis. The Releaf AppTMmeasures 27 possible negative symptom categories and 42 possible side eects. Symptoms were ultimately derived from qualifying conditions across medical cannabis programs in the United States, along with a few suggested by dispensaries and patients. The side eects (called \"feelings\" within the app) were crowd-sourced among Releaf AppTMdevelopers, beta testers, dispensaries, and patients, and included 19 positive, 12 negative, and 11 context-specic side eects available for selection. Supplementary Tables S1, S2 in theSupplemental Appendix provide descriptive statistics for all symptoms and side eects. User sessions consist of a series of electronic instructions for recording characteristics of the cannabis medication (e.g., strain, potency, formulation), pre-dosing symptom severity rating along an 11-point visual analog facial pain scale from 0 (no detectable symptom level) to10 (severe), the timing of cannabis consumption, a post-dosing symptom severity rating, and the option to indicate any of the 42 listed side eects at any time during the session. Among our primary sample of users, 2,332 users reported side eects during 10,535 sessions. Study Outcomes Our goal was to calculate changes in patient-perceived symptom severity, the prevalence of positive and negative side eects associated with cannabis consumption, and whether the reported-eects diers depending on the symptom for which users were seeking treatment. We measured changes in symptom relief by subtracting the ending symptom level from the beginning symptom (possible range from \u000010 to 10). (Supplementary Figure S1 in the Supplemental Appendix provides a frequency table for each level of symptom relief.) Side eects were recorded as {0,1} variables for whether the user selected that side eect from the menu. We categorize the side eects as positive, negative, or context-specic and then convert these categories of side eects into {0,1} outcomes, count outcomes and outcomes measuring the portion of total available side eects in that category a user selected. Statistical Analysis We use means comparisons and least squares regression models to estimate the absolute and relative symptom changes and side eect proles resulting from the cannabis user sessions. We also created an adjusted symptom relief prole score, the mean change in symptom levels plus the absolute number of listed negative side eects, to provide a relative metric of cost-benet tradeos associated with cannabis use. Due to the small user counts for some of the reported symptoms, the large number of possible symptoms, and to facilitate interpretation in our regression analysis, we aggregate the most commonly reported symptoms across three broad symptom categories that included: Anxiety Symptoms (agitation/irritability, anxiety, insomnia, stress, and muscle spasms), Pain Symptoms (ten pain categories), and Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 2 August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 916fphar-09-00916 August 27, 2018 Time: 10:23 # 3 Stith et al. Medical Cannabis Effects Depression Symptoms (depression). The remaining types of symptoms are less frequently reported or not clearly categorized. We also report the full regression results for the three categories of side eects (positive, negative, and context-specic) and the sign for regressions of symptom relief on the full range of 42 side eects. Standard errors are clustered at the user level to control for heteroskedasticity and arbitrary correlation. RESULTS Figure 1 shows the starting and ending symptom severity levels, the change in levels, the Cohen's d of the dierence, and the adjusted symptom relief prole score for each of the 27 discrete symptom categories. For all symptoms, the null hypothesis that the starting symptom severity level is less than or equal to the ending symptom severity can be rejected at the p<0.001 level. Using the adjusted symptom relief measure (symptom relief plus negative side eects), all but users with convulsions, dizziness, excessive appetite, or tremors experienced a net improvement in their symptom severity levels. Even for these symptoms, the adjusted mean symptom relief score still indicates a net benet from use and the lack of a statistically signicant change likely relates more to the small number of observations rather than the lack of an eect, given that these symptoms together constituted less than 3% of users and less than 1% of our sample. For all other symptoms, the null hypothesis of an increase or no change in the adjusted symptom relief score can be rejected at the p<0.001 level. Table 1 provides additional information on starting and ending symptom severity levels, mean symptom relief, andthe prevalence of positive, negative, and context-specic side eects by the aggregated symptom categories (anxiety, pain, and depression symptoms). For completeness, we include a fth column including the remaining discrete symptom categories which did not fall under the three aggregated symptom categories. Little variation exists in starting and ending symptom levels and the symptom relief experienced, with the average user reporting a symptom decrease of 3.7. With regards to side eects, those with depression have a higher probability of reporting negative or context-specic side eects. The most common positive (64%), \"peaceful\" (54%), and \"sleepy\" (27%), and \"thirsty\" (27%). Table 2 examines how symptom relief varies across the broader symptom categories, with the constant representing the mean adjusted symptom change for the omitted category, (patients with pain-related symptoms). The rst two regressions shown in Table 2 indicate that people with anxiety and depression report greater relief from using cannabis than people with chronic pain, and users with higher starting symptom levels report greater symptom relief. (The eects of cannabis on anxiety and depression symptoms are not statistically dierent from each other, although they are both greater than the eect of cannabis on pain-related symptoms). Negative responses or increases in symptom severity do occur, but the intercept in combination with the starting symptom level predicts that increases in symptom severity levels predominantly occur among users with starting symptoms equal to one. The third column in Table 2 shows that cannabis is more eective for anxiety and depression symptoms than for pain-related symptoms among patients reporting higher FIGURE 1 | Patient-reported symptom relief following medical cannabis consumption. Values in parantheses are the symptom category sample size, Cohen's d, and adjusted symptom relief score (symptom relief + number of negative side effects), respectively.

In order to take advantage of the full range of symptom categories available to Releaf AppTMusers, we also ran regressions including dummy variables for each of the symptoms, using back pain as the omitted category. After controlling for starting symptom level, clustering the standard errors at the user level, and using a statistical signicance threshold of p<0.05, our results indicate that patients report greater symptom relief for treating agitation/irritability, anxiety, depression, excessiveappetite, insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea, gastrointestinal pain, stress, and tremors than they do for treating back pain. Patients reported less symptom relief for treating impulsivity, headache, and nerve pain as compared to relief for treating back pain. The symptom relief for the other discrete symptom categories was indistinguishable from the reported symptom relief associated with back pain.

Individuals with depression, however, are more likely to report negative and context-specic side eects than positive side eects. Higher starting symptom levels are also associated with more negative or context-specic side eect reporting and this relationship persists whether the side eect prole is dened as any of the side eects from that category of side eects, the number of side eects by category, or the percent of possible side eects in a category. Table 4 tests whether dierent types of side eects are associated with dierences in symptom relief. The results are robust across specications; reporting positive or context-specic side eects is associated with greater symptom relief, while reporting negative side eects is associated with less symptom relief. For example, based on Column (4), a person with a starting symptom level of 5 who reports 100% of negative side eects would experience a 0.5 point increase in symptom severity on a 1-10 scale, whereas a similar user who does not report any negative side eects would experience 2.2 points of symptomrelief, highlighting the importance of adjusting for starting symptom severity level and side eect proles when evaluating the overall eectiveness of cannabis as a treatment modality. DISCUSSION This is the largest observational study to measure immediate changes in patient-reported symptom severity ratings and experienced side eects in real-time from using cannabis under naturalistic conditions. Building on previous research showing that cannabis may be an eective substitute for opioids (Hurd, 2016; Vigil et al., 2017) and other classes of prescription medications (e.g., sedatives; Piper et al., 2017; Stith et al., 2017), we provide evidence that cannabis is used to treat many dierent types of symptoms for which conventional pharmaceutical medications are typically prescribed, and that the magnitude of reported symptom relief and side eect proles from using cannabis varies for people with dierent symptoms.

The Releaf AppTMusers consumed cannabis to treat a wide range of health symptoms, the most frequent relating to pain, anxiety, or depression. Clinically and statistically signicant reductions in patient-reported symptom severity levels existed in every single symptom category, suggesting that cannabis may be an eective substitute for several classes of medications with potentially dangerous and uncomfortable side eects and risky polypharmaceutical interactions, including opioids, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants (Weich et al., 2014; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016; Fontanella et al., 2016; Rudd et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2016). Higher pre-dosing symptom levels were generally associated with greater post-dosing symptom relief and users treating an anxiety-related symptom or depression showed stronger symptom relief than users treating a pain symptom, even though depression is not a condition approved for medical cannabis use in most states. Similar to clinical reviews showing that cannabis is associated with numerous, yet generally non-serious side eects (Wang et al., 2008; Whiting et al., 2016), positive and context-specic side eects were more commonly reported than negative side eects by the Releaf AppTMusers, with the most frequent reported side eects being positive (relaxed, peaceful, comfy) and the least frequent side eects being negative (paranoid, confused, headache). Positive side eect reporting was associated with the greatest reported symptom relief, followed by context-specic side eects, while negative side eects were associated with lower reported symptom relief. In general, patients treating depression were more likely to indicate a negative side eect than patients treating anxiety- or pain-related symptoms, though even users who reported only negative side eects reported signicant decreases in moderate to severe symptom intensity levels after using cannabis. One of the most striking patterns in the current results was the breadth of symptoms that appeared to improve followingcannabis consumption. This pattern of responses could have been a function of characteristics of the software user interface (e.g., symptom intensity scale range), manner in which responders interacted with their mobile device (e.g., visual attention to common symptom severity levels), or with the systemic nature by which phytocannabinoids may aect the human mind and body. According to the endocannabinoid deciency theory, many mental and physical health disturbances result from the dysregulation of the body's innate endocannabinoid system (ECS; Smith and Wagner, 2014; Di Marzo et al., 2015; Karhson et al., 2016; Russo, 2018), often described as a master network of chemical signals that promote somatic and psychological homeostasis, or psychobiological state-eciency 2013; Acharya et al., 2017). ECS consists of natural ligands (e.g., anandamide and 2-AG) and receptors (CB1 and CB2) that appear to play a major role in ecient regulation of a wide range of systems that include sleep, feeding (e.g., gut permeability and adipogenesis), libido and fertility, pain perception, motivation, happiness, anxiety, learning and memory, social functioning, autoimmune responses, cellular redox, and cancer pathophysiology (Valvassori et al., Androvicova et al., 2017; Sierra et al., 2018). In other words, unlike conventional pharmaceutical approaches, which largely target specic neurotransmitter sites (e.g., al., 2015), cannabis may act to improve a broad spectrum of symptoms by regulating homeostatic functioning, perhaps best described as a system-modulating rather than symptom-modulating form of therapy. Notwithstanding the strengths of the naturalistic research design and the potential implications of the study's ndings, Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 6 August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 916fphar-09-00916 August 27, 2018 Time: 10:23 # 7 Stith et al. Medical Cannabis Effects the study was limited primarily by the lack of a control group, e.g., non-cannabis users with the same symptom using a mobile device to indicate their immediate symptom intensity levels. There is also the potential confound of user-selection bias and exclusion of users that failed to complete sessions or even use the Releaf AppTMdue to a lack of symptom relief or negative side eects. (It is possible that selection bias could have worked in the opposite way, excluding patients that are already satised with their cannabis choices and therefore choose not to use the software app). This study chose to focus on the existence of symptom relief and side eects rather than oer clinical guidance as to which cannabis products oer preferential symptom relief and side eects proles. As such we did not include product characteristics, e.g., routes of administration, quantity and method of ingestion, and cannabinoid content, all of which are likely crucial for understanding how cannabis aects symptom relief and side eect manifestation. We only show that, on average, most cannabis users experience symptom relief. Future research will benet by incorporating these contextual factors into measurements of patient decisions and by dissecting how fundamental characteristics of the cannabis products themselves aect immediate and longer term changes in symptom relief and potential adverse consequences. Patients with certain health conditions such as neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache) may face dierential risks for experiencing adverse eects or exacerbating their symptoms, for instance, depending on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol they consume, and caution should be used for patients considering using highly potent cannabis products (Solimini et al., 2017). Complicating matters are the allogamous (variable) and unstable nature of the Cannabis plant and the inherent inconsistencies in the chemical contents across plant batches and derived formulations, which are aected by genetic characteristics, but also environmental, cultivation, and storage conditions (Thomas and Pollard, 2016; Pacici et al., 2017, 2018). These factors present challenges for both medical cannabis consumers and researchers as patients never have continuous access to cannabis products with precisely consistent chemotypes. Cannabis-based products (e.g., driedflower vs. oils) can dier in their dose reliability, and researchers have oered guidelines for dosing titration and experimental usage (Kahan et al., 2014; Pichini et al., 2018). However, until federal laws currently restricting pharmacodynamics research in the United States are reformed (Stith and Vigil, 2016) investigators still have tremendous opportunities to develop and incorporate innovative assessment tools, like the Releaf AppTM, into observational research designs for measuring how patients experience self-directed cannabis treatment in their normal everyday lives outside of clinical settings.

The purpose of this study was to describe the health concer ns and problems that prompt some adolescents to use marijuana for therapeutic reasons, and thei r beliefs about the risk s and benefits of the therapeutic use of marijuana. Methods: As part of a larger ethnographic study of 63 adolescents who were regular marijuana users, we analyzed interviews conducted with 20 youth who self-i dentified as using marijuana to relieve or manage health problems. Results: Thematic analysis revealed that these teens differentiated themselves from recreational users and positioned their use of marijuana for reli ef by emphasizing their inability to find other ways to deal with their health pr oblems, the sophisticated ways in which they titrated their intake, and the benefits that they experienced. These teen s used marijuana to gain relief from difficult feelings (including depression, a nxiety and stress), sleep difficulti es, problems with concentration and physical pain. Most were not overly concerned about the risks associated with using marijuana, maintaining that their use of marijuana was not 'i n excess' and that their use fit into the realm of 'normal.' Conclusion: Marijuana is perceived by some teens to be the only available alternative for teens experiencing difficult health pr oblems when medical treatments have failed or when they lack access to appropriate health care. Background There is lively public debate surrounding the use of med- ical marijuana. While some remain sceptical about thetherapeutic value of marijuana, there is a growing body ofresearch that emphasizes its salutary effects. The literaturepoints to the use of marijuana among adults to alleviate avariety of symptoms including pain, nausea, muscle spasm, insomnia, anorexia and anxiety as well as the treat- ment of a variety of medical conditions that are bothphysical and psychological [1-5]. However, less is knownabout adolescents' use of marijuana for therapeutic pur-poses.Published: 23 April 2009 Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 doi:10.1186/1747-597X-4-7Received: 3 December 2008 Accepted: 23 April 2009 This article is available from: \u00a9 2009 Bottorff et al; licen see BioMed Central Ltd.

In contrast to the adult literature on marijuana use where therapeutic use is linked to treatment of specific symptoms and illnesses, inthe adolescent literature there is less clarity about how todefine non-recreational uses of marijuana. A motivationally-driven approach is one way that researchers have attempted to understand marijuana use among adolescents [7]. It is proposed that different rea-sons for using marijuana may shape patterns and contextsof use, which in turn may be associated with differentproblems related to use. Social motives for marijuana use,for example, have been associated with patterns of recrea-tional use (e.g., sensation seeking). Coping motives have been used to classify adolescents using marijuana for non- recreation purposes. Differences have been observedamong youth using marijuana for social and coping rea-sons that support the motives framework. In contrast toyouth aged 16-24 years using marijuana for social rea-sons, users of the same age reporting coping motives have been observed to have lower mental health, higher psy- chopathology, more psychosocial distress and morestressful life events than non-cannabis-using youth [8]. Although there is a large body of literature related to rec- reational use of marijuana among adolescents [9,10] less is known about other motivations for the use of mari- juana in this population. Several hypotheses haveemerged related to non-recreational uses of marijuanaamong adolescents. The \"self-medication hypothesis\"[11-14] is most closely associated with the therapeutic useof marijuana. Instrumental use is another term applied to taking drugs for specific pharmacological effects of the substance rather than for pleasure or recreational pur-poses. For example, Glassner [15] examined the notion ofinstrumental drug use in a qualitative study of young drugusers, and found that marijuana was used for its calmingeffects, to relieve tension, and to gain self-confidence. Fur-ther, support for a typology of drug related beliefs that included relief-oriented beliefs [16] was demonstrated in a study of cannabis use in a sample of 285 French highschool students [17]. In this study, four 'positive' relief-oriented beliefs were identified related to how the sub-stance creates relaxation and calms anxiety, reduces suffer-ing, relieves boredom, and makes one feel better. The presence of relief-oriented beliefs was the only predictor of cannabis dependence. Associations between marijuana and psychological prob- lems have also lead researchers to consider other possibleexplanations, including whether marijuana use may rein- force psychiatric symptoms or increase the risk of devel- oping a psychiatric illness later in life [18-21]. A fullunderstanding of marijuana use and its potential adverseeffects, however, will require further research. The trend toward the use of marijuana for therapeutic pur- poses among adults raises questions regarding how this may influence young people's use of marijuana for similar rea-sons. Recent studies suggest that adolescents are aware thatmarijuana is sometimes used to gain relief from physical andpsychological pain [22-24]. Furthermore, there is evidencesuggesting that adolescents may be using marijuana for rea- sons that are analogous to adults who use marijuana for ther- apeutic reasons. For example, young marijuana users withcoping motives report more stressful life events (e.g., deathof a family member or friend), personal injury and illnessthan socially motivated marijuana users and non-users [8].There is also indirect evidence that adolescents with mentalhealth conditions might be seeking relief through marijuana use. In a sample of 992 adolescents in drug treatment pro- grams in four U.S. cities, more than half had at least one co-morbid mental disorder. In total, 72.5% of these youth weredependent on marijuana [25]. Among youth entering outpa-tient treatment programs for cannabis use disorders, 76%were reported to have concurrent mental health conditions [26]. Finally, in a sample of homeless young people in the UK who used a variety of drugs including marijuana, partic-ipants were found to be self-medicating to deal with thestress and problems they encountered including depression,loneliness, and physical problems such as aches and pains[13]. As part of a larger study to understand the culture of fre- quent marijuana use among young people, we were struckby the extent to which some participants spontaneouslydescribed using marijuana to gain relief from symptoms.In order to develop these emergent findings, we con- ducted a focused ethnography in which we examined the ways in which youth use marijuana to seek relief. Methods This study was designed to understand and describe ado-lescents' experiences in using marijuana for therapeuticreasons, and explore how their constructions of these experiences are influenced by social norms. Compared to other types of ethnographic studies, focused ethnogra-phies occur on a smaller scale and seek to examine a spe-cific problem or phenomenon [27]. Typically, focusedethnographies are time-limited, involve a limited numberof participants drawn from a specific population who have experience and understanding directly related to the area of inquiry, and are conducted through selected epi-sodes of participant observation and/or interview [28]. Inthis focused ethnography, both in-depth interviews andparticipant observation were employed.Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 3 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)We drew data from a larger ethnographic study of fre- quent marijuana use among adolescents conducted in two rural and one urban location in British Columbia (BC),Canada. In the study communities, as is the case in muchof BC, marijuana is readily accessible to youth despite thefact that it is illegal to grow, sell or possess. The use of mar-ijuana for medical reasons is legally supported in Canada in limited circumstances; individuals meeting the criteria are provided with cannabis or given a license to grow alimited quantity for personal use. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Uni- versity Behavioral Research Ethics Board. Given the sensi- tivity of the topic and because we successfully argued that teens were able to provide consent for research participa-tion, we did not require parental consent. As a courtesy,we provided the youth with a parent/guardian informa-tion letter which outlined the study's focus as pertainingto attitudes about marijuana use in general. Participantswere told that they could take the letter home if they so chose. Prior to the interviews, written consent was obtained from the participants. Confidentiality wasensured at the outset and participants were informed thatall identifying information would be removed from thedata. Sample In the larger study, participants were recruited by means ofinformation fliers posted at high schools which invitedyouth to share their \"views on marijuana use and teens.\"Youth who expressed interest in participating werescreened for eligibility by the research team. Eligibility cri- teria included being 13-18 years of age and reporting hav- ing smoked marijuana at least once in the previous week.In total, 63 young people participated in the study.Although many youth described \"feeling better\" marijuana on a regular basis specifi- cally to manage, reduce or eliminate unpleasant and uncomfortable feelings or other health problems. Theyconstructed marijuana as a treatment for health problems,often suggesting it had significantly greater benefit thanother medical treatments they had been offered. None ofthese students were legally provided with cannabis formedical treatment or given a licence to grow marijuana for medicinal use. Characteristics of this sub-set of partici- pants are presented in Table 1. The majority of youthusing marijuana for relief were male, and the average ageof initiation of marijuana was 13 years of age. Youth inthis subset were of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Most [n =12] indicated that they were \"Canadian\" or \"Caucasian; \" More specifically, 2 participants identified as First Nations, 6 individuals were part First Nations, 3 of UKdescent and 3 were of European background includingItalian, Croatian, and Ukrainian. Compared to those whoused marijuana for the purpose of relief, those recruited to this study who smoked marijuana for recreational pur-poses (n = 43) smoked marijuana less frequently (averageof 11 days in the last 30 days) and used marijuana moreoften with others. Data Collection The primary source of data was in-depth, semi-structuredinterviews with youth to glean accounts of their experi-ences with marijuana. We used a short questionnaire priorto beginning the qualitative interview to collect demo- graphic data and to assess history of marijuana use and current use. The questionnaire included items related tomarijuana use including age of initiation, use in the lastmonth, frequency and quit attempts. We also collecteddata on the time of day that individuals usually used mar-ijuana. The interviews were conducted using an interview guide. Broad discussion categories included: history and patternof use, the reasons for their use, what they knew aboutmarijuana, the sources of that information as well as con-textual factors related to their use. Open-ended questionswere posed in relation to each of these topics, as required during the interviews. Many of these youth were at ease when talking about their use of marijuana and needed lit-tle prompting. When youth described the use of mari-juana to help them feel better, participants were asked toelaborate further on their experiences. The tape-recorded interviews took place in privacy within the school setting and lasted from 1 to 2 hours. Partici-pants were offered a $20 honorarium. Field notes wereused to record impressions of responses to the interviewTable 1: Description of partic ipants who smoke marijuana for relief (n = 20) Gender Female 7 (35%)Male 13 (65%) Age (years) X = 16 yrs (range 14-18 yrs) Age of initiation (years) X = 13 yrs (range = 10-16 yrs) Frequency of use (days) X = 2 days/mo (range = 2-31 days/mo) Number of times/day 1 - > 5 times/day Time of day of first use Morning 4 (20%)Afternoon 11 (55%)Evening 5 (55%) Marijuana use when alone yes = 16 (80%) Reasons for use* Depression 6Stress/anxiety 12Sleep problems 9Focus/concentration 3 Physical pain 5 * some participants used mari juana for more than one reasonSubstance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 4 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)and the interviewer's assessment of the quality of the interview. In addition, field notes were maintained to record pertinent observations within the school and in thelarger community (e.g., noting school policies regardingmarijuana use at school and the presence of graffiti relatedto marijuana in close proximity of the school; visitingfavourite outdoor settings where some indicated that they preferred to smoke marijuana along with hemp shops where they purchased pipes and bongs and other para-phernalia). Data Analysis All data including transcribed interviews and field notes were reviewed several times by the research team paying close attention to young people's descriptions of experi-ences with the use of marijuana to address uncomfortablefeelings or health problems, and the circumstances thatsurrounded this use. Close readings of the interviews bythe investigative team involved highlighting potentiallyimportant comments, raising questions about the data, and identifying prominent dimensions of participants' experiences. During team meetings, interview data werediscussed and emergent categories were identified to cap-ture experiences related to marijuana use. These categorieswere organized into a coding framework and used to codethe data. All coding was completed by one of the authors who completed a majority of the interviews (BMM). To code the data, we used [29] the NVivo software programdesigned for qualitative analysis of textual data. The pro-gram was also used to retrieve data coded under each cat-egory for a more nuanced analysis by the investigativeteam. Through reflective questioning of these data and detailed comparisons, themes were identified and dis- cussed in team meetings. Results The Context of Using Marijuana for Relief The teens situated their use of marijuana for relief of health problems in the context of difficult life events and illness experiences marked by a lack of supportive familynetworks, unexpected and sometimes traumatic losses ofclose friends or family members, and difficulties atschool. Many indicated that they had few people to turnto help them; for some their parents were having difficultycoping with their own situations of unemployment, sub- stance use, and marriage breakdowns and offered little support. Those living in households with a parent andstep-parent had difficulty coping with unresolved feelingstowards their estranged biological parent. Finally, severalteens who made frequent moves with their families expe-rienced social isolation at school and were subject to being bullied and teased. Experiences with the medical system to address their health problems consistently fell short of the teens' expec-tations; their problems were either not taken seriously or the solutions offered were not helpful. For example, youth who reported they had been prescribed drugs such as Rita-lin, Prozac or sleeping pills, stopped using them becausethey did not like how these drugs made them feel or foundthem ineffective. Despite visits to doctors, prescribedtreatments and, for a few, hospitalizations, many of these teens perceived that they did not receive the help they needed from doctors. A final contextual feature to these teens' lives were their observations of others' use of marijuana to deal with dif-ficult circumstances or symptoms, including, in a few cases, parents and other significant adults in their life. For example, one young man reported that his mother wasusing marijuana while receiving cancer treatment. As heobserved, \"It helped her sleep and calmed her down.\"Others described how they were given advice from otherteens about how marijuana could \"help.\" Together thesecircumstances created a context where teens routinely turned to marijuana to manage physical and psychologi- cal problems in their lives. Marijuana was readily availa-ble, used by others in their network, and was perceived toprovide an effective solution not offered to them from themedical system. Regular Relief:Patterns of Us ing Marijuana for Persistent Problems Most of the participants who consistently used marijuana for relief, smoked it when alone, often several times a day.For some, their day began and ended with using mari-juana; they smoked before leaving home for school and prior to going to bed. Some indicated that they needed to smoke marijuana during the school day to manage symp-toms, and when this occurred it was often in the companyof friends. A few participants smoked marijuana for reliefin adult company that included relatives and \"older\"friends who supported their need to use marijuana to manage symptoms. There were two patterns of marijuana use for relief: inter- mittent and chronic. With intermittent use, youth rou-tinely relied on marijuana to deal with short-termproblems such as stressful situations or limited periods ofphysical pain. One 14 year old male described non-daily use occurring whenever he had a \"really bad day.\" In the case of chronic use, daily marijuana was used for the reliefof identified conditions such as depression, ADHD and toroutinely settle at night or manage sleeplessness. Youngpeople's descriptions of marijuana use for relief wereimbued with language common to using pharmaceuti- cals. A number of these youth indicated how they care- fully titrated their intake; others described their use as\"moderate,\" involving a \"few puffs,\" or just a \"certainamount.\" Through experience, they had learned to honeSubstance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 5 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)ways of using the right amount of marijuana to achieve a state of relief. As one male elaborated, he regulated his intake by mixing his marijuana with tobacco so as to get\"just enough\" marijuana to relieve regular states of agita-tion and high levels of stress. Along with skills at monitor-ing their intake of marijuana, these youth confidentlyshared in-depth knowledge of the strength and associated effects of different strains of marijuana. Explaining the Need to Use Marijuana for Relief The young people in the sub-sample were particularly articulate in describing their \"need\" to use marijuana.They were adamant and confident that marijuana pro- vided relief from their health problems. The decision to smoke marijuana was stated in a straight forward fashion(e.g., \"I started it to make myself feel better\") and justifiedbecause they had a \"reason for it.\" Participants alsoframed their marijuana use in a positive manner; in sodoing, gave credence to the claim that this was the rightcourse of action. As one girl elaborated on her daily use, \"Pot helps me be me.\" Several described unpleasant phys- ical sensations such as feeling \"jittery\" associated with theabsence of marijuana. For these youth, regular marijuanause allowed them relief from these unpleasant symptomsso that they were able to feel \"normal.\" One 18-year oldmale who used marijuana everyday indicated, \"If any- thing, it makes you more normal.\" Of note, he had first started to use marijuana at the age of 13, and smoked itregularly for 5 years typically 4 times a day. For these youth, the purpose of smoking marijuana was not specifically about getting high or stoned, nor was mar- ijuana used for \"pleasure.\" In fact, participants tended to differentiate their own use from peers who were recrea-tional users who smoked marijuana when they were \"par-tying\" or \"socializing.\" As one 16-year old male describedhis use, \"I don't get a strong sense of euphoria, I just calmdown a bit, that's just how it is for me.\" However, there were a few instances when female participants did smoke \"to get high\" for the purpose of \"escaping reality,\" a strat-egy used to remove themselves temporarily from the chal-lenging circumstances that accompanied their daily lives.The participants also distinguished themselves from the\"stoner\" stereotype, whose preferred activities were watch-ing movies or listening to heavy metal music while smok- ing marijuana. Some explanations of using of marijuana to feel better were further bolstered with a focus on use for described\"health\" reasons. As one 16-year old female indicated, herdaily use of marijuana was \"more of a health thing, than to get high.\" She reflected on her history of \"mild depres- sion\" and her difficulties with antidepressants that hadresulted in insomnia and a loss of appetite. She suggestedthat these health issues would re-surface in the absence ofmarijuana, thereby providing solid rationale for her con- tinued use of marijuana. One male situated his marijuana use within a perspective that medications are used to helpdeal with problems. I bet you if I had never been put on Ritalin at a younger age, I might not have had the same opinion of drugs growing up, you know, because I was taught growing up that you take drugs to help you out with your prob-lems, you know. [18 years, non-daily use] Often, marijuana was compared to other substances in a way that suggested marijuana was the best option, further supporting ongoing use of marijuana for relief purposes. Some constructed marijuana as a \"natural\" substance thatwas preferable and considered \"safer\" than many pharma-ceutical alternatives. One 14-year old female discoveredthat marijuana was a better option than dealing with theside effects of pharmaceuticals stating, \"Well, my body, Ihave to be careful what pills I take. I have bad reactions to some medications. My body rejects it and I get really sick.\" Interestingly, one 18-year old who smoked twice a day on21 days during the last month, went as far to describehimself as a \"healthy marijuana user\" adding, \"It's notgood for you, but then again, neither is MacDonald's anda lot of other things.\" The health claims in these descrip- tions served to explain the ongoing use of marijuana for relief. Painful Lives: Types of Symp toms and Distress Requiring Relief In the interviews the teens directly linked their use of mar- ijuana with the management of difficult feelings (includ- ing depression, anxiety and stress), sleep problems,problems with concentration and physical pain. Each ofthese will be described in the following sections. Difficult Feelings Although some teens described using marijuana to dealwith instances of being angry, experiencing a significantdisappointment (e.g., with exam results), being afraid, orto forget the past, the most frequent uses were associatedwith dealing with depression, and managing stress andanxiety. Depression Six participants indicated they were using marijuana spe-cifically to deal with depression and several othersreported knowing teens that were doing the same. Dealingwith difficult personal circumstances was a commontheme for this group of teens and was linked to the loss of significant people in their lives, a family history of depres- sion, financial worries at home, \"fights\" with parents,abuse, and too much \"shit\" in their lives. Several reportedreceiving treatment for depression in the form of antide-Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 6 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)pressants and counseling, sometimes over extended peri- ods, yet with little relief. For others, these options were not available in part because \"nobody wanted to listen\" tothem. As a last resort, these teens had opted to try smokingmarijuana. In a relatively short time, marijuana helpedthem to feel better about themselves, happier and morelike the person they \"wanted to be\" as well as alleviate other problems associated with depression (poor appe- tite, difficulty concentrating, poor sleep). Not all participants agreed about the use of marijuana for depression. One 16-year old male used marijuana to dealwith his unhappiness surrounding the conflict between his mother and father, and worried that he might be using pot too frequently. He reasoned that being happy all ofthe time was not natural, and that there was nothingwrong with being sad and confused sometimes. As aresult, he tried to limit using marijuana to weekends withfriends. Others believed that marijuana should only beused for certain types of depression because of the possi- bility of becoming more depressed by smoking pot: I think it depends on the level of depression that you have. If it's like depressed because you are sick, thenpot is helping you. It's making you happier. But ifyou're depressed about killing yourself, I don't think that it's a good idea to smoke pot just because it could bring you down more. It's hard to say, though, it's dif-ferent for every person, right? That just how it makesme feel. [Female, 17 years, daily use] Stress and anxiety The use of marijuana to manage stress and anxiety wasdescribed by 12 teens in our sample. Dealing with bully-ing at school, heavy demands of school work, taxing shiftsat work, and just \"giving as much as you can\" along sidedifficult relationships with parents or guardians, andreceiving threats from neighbors all took its toll on these youth. For some, these experiences contributed to high levels of stress and anxiety, and for others uncomfortablelevels of anger - both were difficult to manage. Althoughsome had friends they could turn to, marijuana providedan additional source of stress relief that was ready at hand. Lots of people know me, know I do pot and they think that I'm a pot head but really the thing they don't real- ize is that I have a reason for it. It's for my stress andan antidepressant. I get really upset. It [pot] helps mefeel better about myself, because you know peopledon't do that [help me], like my friend [name] can, butnobody else can. [Female, 14 years, non-daily use] There was general agreement among the teens that mari- juana calmed them down, and helped them feel \"not sonervous\" and \"not so uptight about everything.\" One teenrecognized, however, that despite the fact that marijuana could be a very effective stress reliever, it might not work for everyone: Well as far as pot goes, the good thing is that it's defi- nitely a stress reliever, hands down. I know lots of peo-ple who would be just a complete wreck if they weren't smoking pot but then there's also people who are a complete wreck because they do smoke pot, so it'skind of a hard thing. [Male, 16 years, non-daily use] Sleep problems Nine teens in our sample described using marijuana to help them sleep. The \"trouble\" they had with sleeping was a constant problem that many had experienced for years.One 16-year old, who also experienced mild depression,indicated that she \"stopped sleeping for two years.\" Notonly did the problem affect their school performance, butit was deeply disturbing to them. As another femaledescribed, I have a really hard time sleeping. I can lay there for about four to five hours, just laying there. And I justfinally had it, and I just feel like screaming I don't wantto wake anyone up. So I go downstairs and ask mygran or my brother [for some marijuana] or I have a roach or two sitting around. [16 years, non-daily use] Although one teen indicated that she had spoken to her mother about her problems sleeping, others indicatedthat the adults in their lives did not offer any support. I have trouble going to sleep and waking up...My mum wanted to get the doctor to put me on sleeping pillsbut he said at such a young age it would cause like anaddiction to them...I've had these problems since ele-mentary school...I just, I can't go to sleep at night andthen I like to sleep during the day. [Female, 14 years, non-daily use] Many teens turned to pot and found almost immediate benefits in helping them sleep. Likened to a \"magic sleep-ing pill\" by one young male, the teens found it calmedtheir \"busy minds,\" helped them relax and fall asleepquickly. Focus/concentration Three teens reported using marijuana to improve theirconcentration. They explained that they had difficultyfocusing at school and that this affected their school per-formance. As one male explained: Personally, I'm a very fast paced guy and my mind is always rushing, hard to gather my thoughts. I think alot faster than I can speak. I get distracted very easily.Substance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 7 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)In social studies last year, I would talk and wouldn't do any work. But if I had just a little bit of pot, I could really focus my work. I could sit there and I'd work allday and finish everything and have no homework andbe done by the end of class. [16 years, non-daily use] These young people believed they could \"think better\" when they used marijuana because it allowed them to focus their thinking, and, slow it down in a way that waspreferable. All suggested that these cognitive changes werelinked to improved school performance. One teen, whoself-identified as a having \"attention deficit, hyperactivedisorder\" shared the difficulties he experienced on Ritalin. He began smoking pot when he was 12 years of age and still on Ritalin. Usually my mind is in over gear, right? I'm usually going about a mile a minute and my hands are movingway too fast, and I'm really fidgety. But if I have a puffof marijuana in a moderate use, by moderate I mean one to three to four puffs, depending on the qual- ity....being toned down a bit I find really helps me....If Itry to do homework at home without smoking pot, Ijust can't focus. I'll be looking at my schoolwork and forme with my ADHD this is how it's always been for me.Like school was just a constant story of this scenario before I smoked marijuana. [17 years, non-daily use] Physical Pain Five teens indicated they used marijuana to obtain pain relief, and several others shared similar stories about otheryouth. One male used marijuana to deal with pain associ- ated with rehabilitation after a muscle injury, another used marijuana following an accident where he sustained3 rd degree burns and yet another because of plates in his back due to a car injury. Others suggested that marijuanareduced muscle pain after a hard day of skiing and helpedwith headaches, and that girls used marijuana for men- strual cramps. One 17-year old male used it daily and explained that marijuana \"numbs your systems or senses[and] relaxes your muscles.\" Considering the Risks of Using Marijuana for Relief In spite of experiencing personal benefits from using mar-ijuana for relief, some participants wrestled with their use of marijuana. One girl noted her own problematic use of marijuana that had quickly evolved into relying on it todeal with the regular stress in her life. As she pondered,she commented knowingly that it would be preferable touse it only when her stress level was \"really\" high. I mean I started it, and I'm doing it for the wrong rea- sons...I think if I cut back and only did it when I wasreally stressed out or something, then, you know, really cut back, I think it would be okay. [14 years,non-daily use]Although knowing that it was \"harmful\" to her body, she added that she found it difficult to quit using marijuana. Most youth were aware of the health consequences associ-ated with marijuana use in general and their own use inparticular. They noticed physical symptoms such asdecreased stamina and shortness of breath with physicalactivities, while others worried about weakened immune systems and how it affected their energy level. Some rec- ognized that they were addicted to marijuana. One malewho had been using marijuana for six years framed it assomething that he would address at a later date. \"I'm try-ing to get through school and then worry about mydependency issue with marijuana.\" Others noted that their marijuana use was linked to diffi- culties that they were having at school. One male con-cluded, \"I think it brings marks down in one way andsometimes you don't understand things maybe as easily.\"Others recognized how their use had affected their mem-ory. For a number of the participants, their knowledge of the risks of smoking marijuana was limited and, at times, incorrect. For example, as one 14-year old male who hadstarted smoking marijuana in the past year to relieve mus-cle pain noted, \"It's bad for your lungs, just it's 400 timeslower than tobacco.\" In what appeared to be an effort to minimize their use in the face of health risks, the teens emphasized that theywere not using marijuana \"in excess.\" One 18-year oldsummed up six years of using marijuana by saying, \"Idon't feel that I have a problem,\" adding that \"it doesn'treally have that many side effects.\" Some suggested that the benefits of smoking marijuana outweighed the risks. As noted, for those with difficulties sleeping at night, notbeing able to function the following day when sleepdeprived was agonizing; marijuana use at night was pref-erable and provided a solution to that quandary. How-ever, one male pondered both sides of his use of marijuana in dealing with his depression and was less optimistic: Well, in some ways, it's helped me and some ways it hasn't. It's good when it's there, but when it's not, itkind of makes me sad. So it's hard like to try to keepup with staying happy all the time.[18 years, daily use] Several participants made reference to the contradictions that they saw in their world regarding other licit sub-stances and used that argument to make sense of andpraise the benefits of marijuana over the risks. And the thing is that if it's already used, they're already growing it for people that need it for medical help,then like why not.... Like no one has ever overdosedon marijuana, but people die everyday from alcohol,everyday from cigarettes and everyday from vastSubstance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 8 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)amounts of things that the government has legalized, but they just won't legalize marijuana for some reason. It's never killed anyone, never really hurt anyone, itsaves people's lives and they could make a goodamount of money from it and drop crime rates, whydon't they do it? [Male, 14 years, non-daily use] Discussion The findings of this study provide one of the first in-depthdescriptions of youths' use of marijuana for non-recrea-tional purposes, adding to the growing body of researchon the use of drugs to self-medicate among young people.Teens involved in regular and long-term use of marijuana for relief constructed their use of marijuana as essential to feeling better or \"normal\" in situations where they per-ceived there were few other options available to them.Unlike the spontaneity typically involved in recreationaluse, these youth were thoughtful and prescriptive withtheir marijuana use - carefully monitoring and titratingtheir use to optimize its therapeutic effect. The findings also point to important contextual factors that further support youth's use of marijuana for relief that extendbeyond the availability of marijuana and dominant dis-courses that construct marijuana as a natural product withmedicinal properties. Of key importance in the findings are the unmet health needs of these youth. Health issues such as depression,insomnia, and anxiety were significant problems thatinterfered with these youths' ability to function at school,maintain relationships with family and friends, and feelthat they could live a normal life. The level of distress associated with these health concerns, along with the lack of effective interventions by heath care providers and fam-ily members appeared to leave them with few alternatives.Researchers have reported that when adolescents in ruralcommunities experience barriers to seeking health care,they think they can take care of the problems themselves [30]. Similarly, our study participants believed that their best option was to assume responsibility for treating theirproblems by using marijuana. Unpleasant side effectswith prescribed medications and long, ineffective thera-pies resulted in little hope that the medical system couldbe counted on as beneficial. In contrast, marijuana pro-vided these youth with immediate relief for a variety of health concerns. Nevertheless, the regular use of mari- juana put youth at risk. Cannabis use has been identifiedas a risk factor for mental illness such as psychosis, schiz-ophrenia [21,31,32] and psychiatric symptoms such aspanic attacks [33]. Teens who smoked marijuana at leastonce per month in the past year were found to be three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts than non- users [34], and there is evidence that exposure to cannabismay worsen depression in youth [35]. Marijuana useamong youth has also been associated with other sub-stance use and school failure [36]. What is interesting is that the findings of this study suggest that youth have little awareness of some of these risks; rather, some are usingmarijuana to counteract these very problems (e.g., depres-sion, school failure). Teens' perceptions that their healthconcerns were not addressed suggest that more attentionis needed to assess these issues and ensure that other options are available to them. Parents and health care pro- viders need to make a concerted effort to not only under-stand the pressures and influences on youth [37], but alsogain a better understanding of the effect of youths' healthproblems on their ability to engage in healthy lifestylechoices. Underlying problems related to youth health concerns also need to be addressed. In many situations, the partici-pants' symptoms appeared to be directly related to theirlife circumstances. Along with the challenges inherent inbeing an adolescent in today's complex world, some teenswere also trying to deal with significant losses (death of a close friend or family member), extremely difficult family relationships, disappointments with friends, school andsports, and a fragile family and peer support network. Therisk of substance use increases substantially when youthare attempting to deal with these kinds of situations inisolation. Although marijuana provided the youth with temporary relief, the underlying situation often went unattended - leading the teens into a regular pattern ofuse. Appropriate guidance and targeted support fromcounselors and health care providers must be sensitive tomeeting the needs of youth as they work through such sit-uations and life altering events. In addition, adults work- ing with youth must find better ways to talk with young people about how they are coping with their health issues,including their marijuana use. Based on the experiences ofyouth in this study, there is a wide range of support thatmay benefit youth including counseling, stress manage-ment, social skills training, anger management, study skills, pain management, and sleep hygiene. The youth in this study had minimal access to these types of resources. The influence of the policy environment in Canada related to medical marijuana cannot be dismissed. The youth in thisstudy were familiar with medical marijuana and its sanc-tioned use among those with serious illnesses; some knew individuals in their social network who were medical mari- juana users. In addition, we acknowledge that the availabilityof marijuana in the study settings provided teens with oppor-tunities to try marijuana to relieve symptoms. In localeswhere it is more difficult to access marijuana and penaltiesfor possession of marijuana are harsh, teens with similar symptoms may use other approaches. Despite presenting themselves as being sophisticated users of marijuana, with a rich knowledge of marijuanaSubstance Abuse Treatment , Prevention, and Policy 2009, 4:7 http://www.substanceabus epolicy.com/content/4/1/7 Page 9 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)acquired through direct experience, conversations and observations of others, the youth in our study did not appear to be well informed about the therapeutic use ofmarijuana. Targeted education for youth regarding therisks of marijuana and its appropriate use as a therapeuticagent is warranted, including the risks of legal sanctions.However, as Tupper [38] has suggested regarding drug education, fear-based approaches are unlikely to be effec- tive when the reality of youths' observations and experi-ences suggest that few serious consequences stand indirect contrast to the \"facts\" teachers often provide. Alter-native approaches are required that acknowledge the com-plexity of the issues that inform understandings of marijuana. Tupper suggests that drug education be framed using the metaphor of \"drugs as tools\" to allow \"morenuanced understandings of the benefits and harms ofdrugs, depending on who is using them, in what circum-stances, and for what purpose\" (p. 235). This approachmay be useful in education focused on marijuana. This study was conducted in three locations in the prov- ince of British Columbia (BC) Canada and as such maynot be generalized to other contexts. The province of BC isknown for its illicit marijuana production [39]. And, ingeneral the BC public is tolerant of marijuana use andsupport decriminalizing recreational use. In other con- texts, teens might turn to other substances such as alcohol. The findings of this study provide a snapshot of theseteens' use of marijuana. Further research is required toexamine how this therapeutic use evolves over time. Conclusion In summary, this study highlights youths' efforts toaddress their health problems and their experiences inusing marijuana for relief. Marijuana may be perceived bysome teens to be the only available alternative for thoseexperiencing difficult physical or emotional problemswhen medical treatments have failed or when they lack access to appropriate health care. As has been noted in other studies of substance use [40], understanding whyadolescents use particular substances is key in developingappropriate educational and intervention programs.

Webb RN, BSN Abstract Clinical research regarding the therapeutic benefits of cannabis (\"marijuana\") has been almost non-existent in the United States since cannabis was given Schedule I status in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. In order to discover the benefits and adverse effects perceived by medical cannabis patients, especially with regards to chronic pain, we hand-delivered surveys to one hundred consecutive patients who were returning for yearly re-certification for medical cannabis use in Hawai'i. The response rate was 94%. Mean and median ages were 49.3 and 51 years respectively. Ninety-seven per cent of respondents used cannabis primarily for chronic pain. Average pain improvement on a 0-10 pain scale was 5.0 (from 7.8 to 2.8), which translates to a 64% relative decrease in average pain. Half of all respondents also noted relief from stress/anxiety, and nearly half (45%) reported relief from insomnia. Most patients (71%) reported no adverse effects, while 6% reported a cough or throat irritation and 5% feared arrest even though medical cannabis is legal in Hawai'i. No serious adverse effects were reported. These results suggest that Cannabis is an extremely safe and effective medication for many chronic pain patients. Cannabis appears to alleviate pain, insomnia, and may be helpful in relieving anxiety. Cannabis has shown extreme promise in the treatment of numerous medical problems and deserves to be released from the current Schedule I federal prohibition against research and prescription. Introduction Research into the therapeutic benefits of cannabis has been severely limited by the federal Schedule I classification, which essentially prohibits any ability to acquire or to provide cannabis for studies investigating possible therapeutic effects. Limited studies have been done in Canada and in Europe, as well as several in California. Hawai'i is one of twenty states (plus the District of Colum - bia) which allow certifications for use of medical cannabis. The authors have been certifying patients for use of medical cannabis in Hawai'i for more than four years. In an attempt to discover the perceived benefits and adverse effects of medical cannabis, we conducted a survey of medical cannabis patients. Methods Sample Selection Between July of 2010 and February of 2011, we hand-delivered questionnaires to one hundred consecutive patients who had been certified for the medical use of cannabis for a minimum of one year and were currently re-applying for certification. Survey Design and Administration The subjects were verbally instructed to complete the questionnaire in the office at the time of re-certification or were provided a stamped and addressed envelope so they could complete the questionnaire at home. All patients were instructed to remain anonymous and to answer the questions as honestly as possible. A universal pain scale was used to assess pain before and after treatment (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain ever). Open-ended questions were asked to ascertain the following: (1) \"Any adverse effects you have had from using medical cannabis?\" (2) \"Does medical cannabis help you with any other problems? If so, what?\" The purpose of the last question was to explore benefits out - side the parameters of the state of Hawai'i's medical cannabis qualifying conditions. Results The overall response rate was 94%. The mean age was 49.3 years and the median age was 51. No data was collected on sex or race/ethnicity. Almost all respondents (97%) used medical cannabis primarily for relief of chronic pain. Average reported pain relief from medical cannabis was substantial. Average pre-treatment pain on a zero to ten scale was 7.8, whereas average post-treatment pain was 2.8, giving a reported average improvement of 5 points. This translates to a 64% average relative decrease in pain. Other reported therapeutic benefits included relief from stress/anxiety (50% of respondents), relief of insomnia (45%), improved appetite (12%), decreased nausea (10%), increased focus/concentration (9%), and relief from depression (7%). Several patients wrote notes (see below) relating that cannabis helped them to decrease or discontinue medications for pain, anxiety, and insomnia. Other reported benefits did not extend to 5% or more of respondents. Six patients (6%) wrote brief notes relating how cannabis helped them to decrease or to discontinue other medications. Comments included the following: \"Medical cannabis replaced my need for oxycodone. Now I don't need them at all.\" \"I do not need Xanax anymore.\" \"In the last two years I have been able to drop meds for anxiety, sleep, and depression.\" \"I've cut back 18 pills on my morphine dosage.\" A majority (71%) reported no adverse effects, while 6% reported a cough and/or throat irritation and 5% reported a fear of arrest. All other adverse effects were less than 5%. No serious adverse effects were reported. Discussion According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain afflicts 116 million Americans and costs the nation over $600 billion every year in medical treatment and lost productivity.1 Chronic pain is a devastating disease that frequently leads to major depression and even suicide.2 Unfortunately, the therapeutic options for chronic pain are limited and extremely risky.HAWAI'I JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & PUBLIC HEALTH, APRIL 2014, VOL 73, NO 4 110 Spurred by efforts to encourage physicians to become more pro-active in treating chronic pain, US prescription opioids (synthetic derivatives of opium) have increased ten-fold since 1990.3 By 2009 prescription opioids were responsible for almost half a million emergency department visits per year.4 In 2010 prescription opioid overdoses were responsible for well over 16,000 deaths.5 A 2010 article in the New England Journal of Medicine addressing this problem is aptly titled \"A Flood of Opioids, a Rising Tide of Deaths.\"3 Drugs such as OxyContinR are so dangerous that the manufacturer's boxed warning states that \"respiratory depression, including fatal cases, may occur with use of OxyContin, even when the drug has been used as recommended and not misused or abused.\"6 Clearly safer analgesics are needed. The Hippocratic Oath reminds to \"first, do no harm.\" It can - not be over-emphasized that there has never been a death from overdose attributed to cannabis.7 In fact, no deaths whatsoever have been attributed to the direct effects of cannabis.7 Canna - bis has a safety record that is vastly superior to all other pain medications. Many physicians worry that cannabis smoke might be as dan - gerous as cigarette smoke; however, epidemiologic studies have found no increase in oropharyngeal or pulmonary malignancies attributable to marijuana.8-10 Still, since smoke is something best avoided, medical cannabis patients are encouraged to use smokeless vaporizers which can be purchased on-line or at local \"smoke-shops.\" In states that (unlike Hawai'i) allow cannabis dispensaries, patients can purchase \"vapor pens,\" analogous to e-cigarettes and fully labeled regarding doses of THC and other relevant cannabinoids. Tests have proven that smoke-free vaporizers deliver THC as well or even more efficiently than smoking, and that most patients prefer vaporizers over smoking.11 Like smoking, vapor - izers allow patients to slowly titrate their medicine just to effect, analogous to IV patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) that has been so successful in hospital-based pain control. This avoids the unwanted psychoactive side-effects often associated with oral medication such as prescription MarinolR (100% THC in oil) capsules which tend to be slowly and erratically absorbed and are often either ineffectually weak or overpoweringly strong.12,13 Because inhaled cannabis is rapid, reliable, and titratable, most patients strongly prefer inhaled cannabis over MarinolR capsules.14 While the relative safety of cannabis as medication is easily established, the degree of efficacy is still being established. The reported pain relief by patients in this survey is enormous. One reason for this is that patients were already self-selected for suc - cess: they had already tried cannabis and found that it worked for them. For this sample, the benefits of cannabis outweighed any negative effects. The study design may therefore lend itself to over-estimating the benefits and under-estimating the nega - tive side-effects if extrapolated to the general population. Another reason that the reported pain relief is so significant is that cannabis has been proven effective for many forms of recalcitrant chronic pain. A University of Toronto systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT's) examining cannabinoids in the treatment of chronic pain found that fifteen of eighteen trials demonstrated significant analgesic effect of cannabinoids and that there were no serious adverse effects.15 While opioids are generally considered to have little benefit in chronic neuropathic pain, several RCT's have shown that cannabinoids can relieve general neuropathic pain,16 as well as neuropathic pain associated with HIV and with multiple scle - rosis (MS). 17,18 One study found that cannabis had continuing efficacy at the same dose for at least two years. 19 Even low dose inhaled cannabis has been proven to reduce neuropathic pain. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled crossover trial involving patients with refractory neuropathic pain, Ware, et al, found that therapeutic blood levels of THC (mean 45 ng/ml achieved by a single inhalation three times a day) were much lower than those necessary to produce a cannabis euphoria or \"high\"(> 100 ng/ml). 19 Cannabis is relatively non-addicting, and patients who stop using it (eg, while traveling) report no withdrawal symptoms. One author (Webb C.) worked for 26 years in a high volume emergency department where he never witnessed a single visit for cannabis withdrawal symptoms, whereas dramatic symptoms from alcohol, benzodiazepine, and/or opioid withdrawal were a daily occurrence. So why is cannabis still held hostage by the DEA as a Schedule I substance? On June 18, 2010, the Hawai'i Medical Association passed a resolution stating in part that: \"Whereas, 1) Cannabis has little or no known withdrawal syndrome and is therefore considered to be minimally or non-addicting; and Whereas, 2) Cannabis has many well-known medical benefits (including efficacy for anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pain, muscle spasms, and glaucoma) and is currently recommended by thou - sands of physicians; and Whereas 3) Cannabis has been used by millions of people for many centuries with no history of recorded fatalities and with no lethal dosage ever discovered; and Whereas, Cannabis therefore fulfills none of the required three criteria (all of which are required) to maintain its current restric - tion as a Schedule I substance... The Hawai'i Medical Association recommends that Medical Cannabis be re-scheduled to a status that is either equal to or less restrictive than the Schedule III status of synthetic THC (MarinolR), so as to reduce barriers to needed research and to humanely increase availability of cannabinoid medications to patients who may benefit.\"20 Medical cannabis remains controversial mainly because the federal government refuses to recognize cannabis as an ac - cepted medication. To this we would echo the words of Melanie Thernstrom in her excellent book The Pain Chronicles ,2 \"How could treating pain be controversial?\" one might ask, \" Why wouldn't it be treated? Who are the opponents of relief?\"HAWAI'I JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & PUBLIC HEALTH, APRIL 2014, VOL 73, NO 4 111Conclusions Cannabis is an extremely safe and effective medication for many patients with chronic pain. In stark contrast to opioids and other available pain medications, cannabis is relatively non-addicting and has the best safety record of any known pain medication (no deaths attributed to overdose or direct effects of medication). Adverse reactions are mild and can be avoided by titration of dosage using smokeless vaporizers. More research needs to be pursued to discover degrees of efficacy in other areas of promise such as in treating anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, autism, nausea, vomiting, muscle spasms, seizures, and many neurologic disorders. Patients deserve to have cannabis released from its current federal prohibition so that scientific research can proceed and so that physicians can prescribe cannabis with the same freedom ac - corded any other safe and effective medications.
