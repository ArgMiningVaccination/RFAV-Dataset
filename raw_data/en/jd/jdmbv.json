UW SEIU 925 (Effective 11/18/20 - 12/31/23) Article 1 - Preamble and Purpose 1.1 This Agreement is made by and between the Board of Regents of the University of Washington, hereinafter referred to as the Employer, and the Service Employees International Union, Local 925, hereinafter referred to as the Union. The Employer is the Board of Regents of the University of Washington acting through its agents, administrators, and supervisors as determined by the Board of Regents. Provisions of this Agreement apply to all full-time and regular part-time professional employees of the University of Washington within the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), excluding employees of the University of Washington within the Client Services Unit organization, Post-Bachelor Fellows, confidential employees, internal auditors, employees covered by Chapter 41.76 RCW, employees covered by Chapter 41.80 RCW, supervisors, and employees covered by any other bargaining unit. Regular Temporary employees shall be covered per Article 51. The purpose of this Agreement is to set forth certain terms and conditions of employment and to promote orderly and peaceful labor relations between the parties. The parties agree that is has been and will be their mutual aim to promote systematic and effective employee-management cooperation; fair and reasonable working conditions, effective methods for the prompt adjustment of differences, misunderstandings, and disputes; and dignified and fair treatment of employees in the implementation of all polices and procedures. 1.2 Union Recognition. The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative in all matters establishing and pertaining to wages and salaries, hours, and working conditions for all covered employees of the University of Washington as certified by and under the Public Employment Relations Commission under the 41.56. The Agreement covers the employees in the bargaining unit described in Appendix I, entitled \"Bargaining Unit Represented by the Service Employees International Union Local 925 at the University of Washington\" but does not cover any positions excluded by the statute, regulation, or other common law. The titles of the jobs listed in Appendix I are listed for descriptive purposes only. 1.3 The Employer recognizes the exclusivity of the Union as bargaining representative for employees in the bargaining unit. The Employer agrees not to enter into any agreement or contract with bargaining unit employees, individually or collectively, which conflicts with the terms of this Agreement unless the employee(s), Union and Employer specifically agree to such Agreement. Article 2 - Non-Discrimination 2.1 The parties individually agree that they will not engage in any act or practice or pursue any policy which is discriminatory against any employee who may be a qualified disabled individual, has status as a protected veteran, who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, nor because of their military status, age, sex *except where sex or age is a bona fide occupational qualification), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, pregnancy, political affiliation, political belief, marital status, race, national origin, color, creed, religion, or membership or non-membership in a union. Unlawful harassment is included as a form of prohibited discrimination. 2.2 Sexual Harassment. No employee shall be subjected to discrimination in the form of sexual harassment as defined in University of Washington Executive Order 31 on Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action. 2.3 Complaints. Employees who feel they have been the subject of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation are encouraged to discuss such issues with their supervisors, administrator, or Human Resource Consultant for local resolution. The goal of local resolution is to address and resolve problems as quickly as possible and to stop any inappropriate behavior for which a University employee is responsible. A formal complaint may be filed with the University Complaint Investigation and Resolution Office (UCIRO). Employees may also file discrimination, harassment or retaliation complaints with appropriate federal or state agencies or through the grievance process in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement. In cases where an employee files both a grievance and an internal complaint regarding the alleged discrimination, harassment or retaliation the grievance will be suspended until the internal complaint process has been completed. In accordance with Executive Order 31, retaliation against any individual who reports concerns regarding discrimination or harassment, or who cooperates with or participates in any investigation of allegations of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation is prohibited 2.4 The parties also agree that they will not engage in any act or practice or pursue any policy which is discriminatory against any employee based on political affiliation, political belief or because of the participation or lack of participation in union activities. 2.5 Both parties agree that nothing in this Agreement will prevent the implementation of an approved affirmative action plan. 2.6 A grievance alleging a violation of this article must be submitted within 180 days of an alleged occurrence. 2.7 When a grievance or complaint is filed, the University will implement interim measures as appropriate. Article 3 - Workplace Behavior 3.1 The Employer and the Union agree that all employees should work in an environment that fosters mutual respect and professionalism. The parties agree that inappropriate behavior in the workplace does not promote the University's business, employee well-being, or productivity. All employees are responsible for contributing to such an environment and are expected to treat others with courtesy and respect. In accordance with the UW Medicine Policy on Professional Conduct, inappropriate workplace behavior by employees, supervisors and/or managers will not be tolerated. At no time will bullying be accepted as appropriate workplace behavior. Bullying is defined as unprofessional behavior that misuses power to control or harm others. If an employee and/or the employee's union representative believes the employee has been subjected to inappropriate workplace behavior, the employee and/or the employee's representative is encouraged to report this behavior to the employee's supervisor, a manager in the employee's chain of command and/or the Human Resources Office. An employee or the employee's representative should identify complaints as inappropriate workplace behavior. The Employer will investigate the reported behavior and take appropriate action as necessary. The employee and/or union representative will be notified upon conclusion of the investigation. Retaliation against employees who make a workplace behavior complaint will not be tolerated. Grievances may only be filed up to Step 3 Mediation. Article 4 - Affirmative Action 4.1 Policies. In conjunction with Federal and State Executive Orders, the Employer and the Union agree on the need for an affirmative action approach to correct and review any inequities in the employment process. The Employer shall have and implement an affirmative action plan which requires the Employer to make special efforts to recruit, employ, retain, train, promote, encourage career development, and transfer qualified members of groups formerly excluded, even if that exclusion cannot be traced to particular discriminatory actions on the part of the Employer, and to develop, implement, and monitor affirmative action goals and timetables for hiring and/or promoting members of protected groups into job classes/categories where it has been determined that under-utilization exists. 4.2 Group included in the affirmative action program are those covered by federal and state regulations. 4.3 Goals and Timetables.

Article 5 - Grievance Procedure The Union and the Employer agree that it is in their best interest to resolve disputes at the earliest opportunity and at the lowest level. Whenever possible, disputes should be resolved informally prior to filing a formal written grievance. To that end, all supervisors and employees are encouraged to engage in free and open discussions about disputes. 5.1 Definition. A grievance, within the meaning of this Agreement, shall be defined as any dispute between the University and the Union, an employee, or a group of employees as to alleged misapplication or misinterpretation of the terms of this Agreement or the Employer's written personnel rules, policies or practices. 5.2 Employee Grievance Rights. Any employee who believes they have been aggrieved may personally seek relief from that condition by filing a grievance, irrespective of any supervisor's opinion of the grievance's validity. In the presentation of grievances, the employees shall be safe from restraint, interference, discrimination, or reprisal. 5.3 Employee Representation. The Union as exclusive representative of bargaining unit employees is responsible representative of said employees in grievance matters. 5.4 Time Limitations.

For the purpose of calculating time requirements, the first day shall be the day following the day on which the employee was aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the issue giving rise to the grievance.

If the requested time off cannot be granted, the parties shall arrange for time off at the earliest possible time thereafter. 5.7 Grievance Withdrawal. A grievance may be withdrawn by the Union in writing at any time, and if withdrawn shall not be resubmitted. 5.8 Resolution.

Any expenses and fees of alternative methods will be shared equally by the parties. - Processing. The Union and the Employer agree that in-person meetings are preferred at all steps of the grievance process and will make efforts to schedule in-person meetings, if possible. 5.11 Steps of the Grievance Procedure. All grievances shall be processed in accordance with the following procedure. Upon mutual agreement, Step One, Two or Three may be skipped. Grievances over final counseling or dismissal will begin at Step Two. Step One: Supervisor, Manager or Designee. If the issue is not resolved informally, the Union may file a written grievance to the supervisor or designee, and the Labor Relations office (laborrel@uw.edu). The Employer will designate a supervisor, manager or designee who will meet in person or confer by telephone with a union steward and/or staff representative and the grievant. The date of the meeting will be mutually agreed upon within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the grievance and when possible the meeting will take place within the aforementioned fifteen (15) calendar days. The format (face to face or by telephone) for the meeting will be by mutual agreement. The employer will respond in writing to the Union within fifteen (15) calendar days after the meeting. The Human Resources Consultant may also attend, if desired by the University. If the grievance is directed against the employee's immediate supervisor, the grievance may be presented to the next higher level of supervision. In the event the employee's immediate supervisor does not have authority to resolve the grievance, the grievance will be presented at the level having authority to act as determined by the Employer. Step Two. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step One, said grievance may be moved to the Step Two by filing the written grievance, including a copy of the Step One decision to department head, designee, or to the next appropriate level of management and the Office of Labor Relations within fifteen (15) calendar days after the decision from Step One. The date of the meeting will be mutually agreed upon within fifteen (15) calendar days after notice of the filing at Step Two and when possible the meeting will take place within the aforementioned fifteen (15) calendar days. The grievant may be represented by a steward and a Union staff representative. The University will be represented by the appropriate management official(s) or designee(s), a representative from the Office of Labor Relations, and a Human Resources Consultant, if desired by the University. The University will respond in writing within thirty (30) calendar days after the meeting. Step Three: Grievance Mediation. If the grievance is not resolved at the Step Two, the Union may file a request for mediation with the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) in accordance with WAC 391-55-020, with a copy to the Labor Relations Office within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Step Two decision. In addition to all other filing requirements, the request must include a copy of the grievance and all previous responses. The Employer will inform the Union, in writing, and PERC within thirty (30) days of receipt of Mediation request if they are not in agreement. If those services are unavailable on a timely basis, the parties may request a list of grievance mediators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) or other agreed upon mediation provider. The cost of the mediation shall be borne equally by both parties. Step Four: Arbitration. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached at the prior step, or the step was skipped, either of the signatory parties to this Agreement may submit the grievance to binding arbitration. Such submittal must be made within thirty (30) calendar days following the written notice that the employer does not agree to Step Three Mediation or the conclusion of the prior step. Panel of Arbitrators. - Within sixty (60) calendar days of the execution of the Agreement, the parties, SEIU 925 and the Employer, agree to meet to establish a permanent panel of six (6) arbitrators. If the parties do not meet or if there is no agreement on the panel, the current panel will remain. - These arbitrators shall be assigned cases by the parties on a rotating basis. If the arbitrator is not available to hear the case within sixty (60) calendar days of being contacted to request available arbitration dates either party may elect to go to the next arbitrator in the rotation. If no arbitrator can hear the case within sixty (60) calendar days of being contacted, the case will be assigned to the arbitrator who can hear the case on the earliest date. - The appointment to the panel will be for the life of the Agreement. If an arbitrator decides to remove their name from the panel the parties will meet to decide whether to substitute an additional name(s). No later than seven (7) working days prior to the scheduled arbitration meeting, the parties will submit questions of arbitration eligibility to the arbitrator for preliminary determination, share the name of each witness intending to testify at the hearing, and attempt to agree upon the issue statement. A copy of written materials submitted to the arbitrator will be provided to the opposing party. If either party raises an issue of procedural arbitrability, i.e. that any step of the grievance process or movement to arbitration was not pursued within the time limits prescribed in this article, the arbitrator shall make a determination on the arbitrability issue prior to proceeding to a hearing on the merits of the grievance. If the arbitrator determines the grievance is not arbitrable, then no hearing on the merits of the grievance will be held. Authority of the Arbitrator. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that adds to, subtracts from, alters or modifies in any way the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The parties further agree that the decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon all parties. The Union or the Employer will have the right to request the arbitrator to require the presence of witnesses and/or documents. The arbitrator's decision shall be made in writing and the arbitrator shall be encouraged to render the decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the close of the arbitration. In cases where a grievance is moved to arbitration and the Employer did not agree to Step Three: Grievance Mediation, either party may request a pre-arbitration settlement conference. These conferences shall not delay the arbitration process, and may be held with or without the presence of the arbitrator, at the option of the moving party. In the event that an arbitrator is present, the cost of the arbitrator's participation shall be borne equally by the parties. 5.12 Arbitration Costs. - The fees and costs of the arbitrator, and the cost (if any) of the hearing room, will be shared equally by the parties. - If the arbitration hearing is postponed or canceled because of one party, that party will bear the cost of the postponement or cancellation. The costs of any mutually agreed upon postponements or cancellations will be shared equally by the parties. - If either party desires a record of the arbitration, a court reporter may be used. If that party purchases a transcript, a copy will be provided to the arbitrator free of charge. If the other party desires a copy of the transcript, it will pay for half of the costs of the fee for the court reporter, the original transcript and a copy. - Each party is responsible for all fees and costs of its staff representatives, attorneys, experts, witnesses -and all other costs related to the development and presentation of their case. Every effort will be made to avoid the presentation of repetitive witnesses. 5.13 Files. Grievance documents shall be maintained separately from employee personnel files.

Every effort will be made to avoid the presentation of repetitive witnesses. 6.4 Notification. An employee will obtain prior approval from their supervisor before attending any meeting or hearing. All requests must include the approximate amount of time the employee expects the activity to take.

Employees' work schedules and FTEs may be changed, temporarily or permanently, at the employee's request and with the Employer's approval, provided the Employer's needs are met and no overtime expense is incurred. Article 11 - Overtime 11.1 Overtime Exempt Employees. Overtime-exempt employees are not covered by federal or state overtime laws and do not receive overtime compensation or compensatory time off. These employees are accountable for their work product, and for meeting the objectives of the institution for which they work. The Employer's policy for all overtime-exempt employees is as follows. - The Employer determines the products, services, and standards that must be met by overtime-exempt employees. - Full time schedules are assumed to be forty (40) hours, however employees are expected to work to complete job responsibilities. Overtime-exempt employees may be required to work specific hours to provide services, including nights and weekends, when deemed necessary by the Employer. - Part time schedules are assumed to be any schedule that is at least twenty (20) hours in a workweek but less than full time. Employees are expected to work beyond their normal schedule when necessary. The supervisor may establish a regular work schedule, but part-time employees are expected to remain flexible to accommodate the unit's goals and mission. - No employee will typically be required to work more than five (5) consecutive days in a seven (7) day period. The typical IHME operating hours are Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Seattle time (PST) or alternative flexible time frames. Employees will consult with their supervisors to adjust work hours to accommodate the appropriate balance between extended work time and offsetting time. 11.2 Overtime Eligible Employees - Work in excess of forty (40) hours in one (1) standard work week constitutes overtime for over-time eligible employees. Use of paid time off does not count as time worked when calculating overtime. Overtime work must be requested by the employee and pre-approved by the Employer prior to working overtime. - Overtime worked by eligible employees shall be compensated at a rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the employee's straight time hourly rate. - Overtime-eligible employees shall receive monetary payment as compensation for overtime worked; however, at the employee's request, compensatory time off at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the overtime hours worked may be granted in lieu of monetary payment. - Compensation paid to an employee for accrued compensatory time shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the employee at the time the employee receives such payment. Upon termination of employment, an employee will be paid for any unused compensatory time in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act. - Use of accrued compensatory time shall be approved by the employing official with consideration being given to the work requirements of the department and the wishes of the employee. Compensatory time off may be scheduled by the employing official during the final sixty (60) days of a biennium. - Compensatory time must be used or paid for by June 30th of each fiscal year. The employee's unused compensatory time balance will be cashed out every June 30th or when the employee leaves University employment for any reason. The employee's compensatory time balance may also be cashed out when the employee: - Transfers within their department to a position with different funding sources, or - Transfers to a position in another department. Article 12 - Professional Development 12.1 To support a culture of learning, IHME sets professional development funds aside each fiscal year (July 1 to June 30) for non-temporary employees with 50% FTE or higher, appointments and who have completed six (6) full months of service. Employees who are still on probation are not eligible for professional development funds. Professional Development benefits both the employer and the employee. Professional Development is the responsibility of the employee with the support and encouragement of their supervisor. It is encouraged that employees wishing to request utilization of these funds, discuss potential opportunities with their supervisors during annual goal setting and bi-annual goal check-ins. IHME strives to fund as many professional development opportunities as we can, however, resources are limited and requests that best align with the employee's team's work and overall IHME aims will be more likely to be fulfilled. A record of requests, both approved and denied, will be made available on IHME's professional development HUB page. Requests for professional development funds will be gathered twice yearly in December and June. Requests may include, but are not limited to, UW POD courses, online subscriptions (six (6) months' max approval at a time, unless annual subscription would be cheaper), workshops, research conferences where the employee has an accepted paper and is presenting, and language or coding courses, as funds are available. Requests require documented supervisor support. Supervisors may make requests for use of professional development funds on behalf of their employees when there is a professional development opportunity needed to support the work the team is doing or when and employee's performance needs improvement. Employees will not be required to take leave to attend events with professional development funds, if such events take place during work days. 12.2 Supervisors will have annual career conversations with their employees meant to identify their employees' professional goals and the possible opportunities, mentors, and/or training that may help them achieve these goals. Career conversations will happen outside the annual review and goal cycle and are not tied to an employee's performance. It is up to the employee to determine if they would like to participate and engage in the career conversations and associated opportunities identified with their supervisor. 12.3 Bargaining unit employees who have received outside funding or scholarships for professional development opportunities may request paid release time to attend provided the opportunity aligns with IHME's mission. IHME will make every effort to allow the Employee to participate in the training or conference on paid release time. 12.4 Professional Leave with Pay - Eligibility. Employees eligible to apply for a professional leave not earlier than their seventh year of service in their SEIU 925 - IHME covered positions, or not earlier than in the seventh year after return from a previous UW professional leave with pay.Evaluation of a professional leave with pay request takes into consideration how fulfillment of the plan is anticipated to enhance the value of the individual's service to the university and both the employing unit's and the employee's ability to fulfill the plan as described. - Request Process.

If the applicant secures grant support that is designated for salary, the funds can be applied to bring the professional staff employee's pay up to full salary during the leave. Any grant funds in excess of those necessary to achieve full salary payment, are used to reduce the University's contribution from other fund sources. Except in unusual circumstances, the combined compensation for an individual on professional leave may not exceed the individual's regular salary. If the leave will be spent in a particularly high cost-of-living area, or where the work to be performed requires extraordinary expense, the HR Operations Office serving the unit may approve a combined salary that exceeds the employee's regular salary. - Other Employment. An employee on professional leave with pay may not accept paid employment during the period of the leave except where the purpose of the leave is for professional practice or experience that cannot be obtained otherwise.
