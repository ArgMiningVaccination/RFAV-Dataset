I play a huge role in my own health based on the choices I make, just as you do. The human body can, of course, be broken down into segments or regions (face, arm, foot, brain, heart, cells, et cetera), but it doesn't mean that what's happening in one area isn't related to another. This is the philosophy behind holistic approaches in general (reflexology, acupuncture, and Ayurveda to name a few). This doesn't mean that I don't also have a respect for Western (a.k.a allopathic) medicine, only that I believe we should find the root source of our physical (and mental/emotional) problems and try to treat from the source rather than only treat the symptoms as Western medicine often does. I believe in integrative medicine\u2014wherein Western medicine is used to complement \"alternative\" and holistic practices. Skincare, bodywork, and aromatherapy are all part of integrative healing. These beliefs that I have are why I brought in the Osmosis Beauty Skincare and Wellness lines in November 2021. Some of the services I provide are undeniably \"regional\" in nature because of the integrity and intention of the service, but it doesn't change the fact that I believe that soothing even a small portion of the body helps the mind and vice versa. Modern day humans are often stuck in an almost constant loop of stress and an overactive sympathetic nervous system (which is your \"fight or flight\" response). My intention is to soothe you enough to activate your parasympathetic nervous system (which is your \"rest and digest\" response). It actually doesn't take a lot to activate that parasympathetic response if you'll arrive for your session being willing to surrender to my touch and to some quiet time for yourself. Just as what we use topically (lotions, lip balms, cosmetics) affects our wellness or illness, so do the products we use in our household. Just as what we ingest (food, drink, substances) contributes to our wellness or illness, so does what we breathe (air, aromatherapy, smoke, fumes). I read a lot. Health and self-help books come in all shapes and sizes and most of them offer nuggets of wisdom that I take away from them. Some things hit home more than others\u2014and not because it's what I want to hear, but because some things make sense TO me and FOR me. And then\u2014especially with health books\u2014I go down a rabbit hole of researching and learn more about the claims. I urge you to do the same but I am also happy to make suggestions. Some suggestions are going to work better for my body, mind, and overall health whereas others are going to work better for yours. "}
