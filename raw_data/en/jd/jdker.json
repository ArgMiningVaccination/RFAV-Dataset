This report is an over-view of systematic reviews that have ex amined the effects of interventions for at-risk families with children aged 0-6 years. We included nine systematic re-views. The results of our systematic review shows that: Psychotherapy for mothers with depression leads to better interaction be- tween mother and child and better mental health of both mother and child. The documentation is of low quality. Psychotherapy for mother and infant ha s a positive effect on the child's at- tachment to the mother. The documentation is of low quality. Parent training/guidance to parents st ruggling with parenting has a positive effect on the parent-child relationship . The documentation is of low quality. Home visits for mothers with substance abuse problems have little or no ef-fect on maternal substance abuse, behavioral problems in the child or out- comes related to child abuse/neglect. The documentation is of low quality. Small financial interventions have little or no effect on whether children are exposed to physical harm in the family. The intervention shows no effect on the child's behavior or development. The documentation is of medium to low quality. Both psychotherapy for mothers, psychotherapy for mothers and infants, and parent training/guidance improve interaction and attachment between mother and child. Parental training/guidance that is well adapted to the group receiving the intervention seems to have a better effect on child out- comes than more general parenting interventions. Home visits seem to have better effect on outcomes for the child and parents if it's started early, the provider is well trained to assist the re levant families, the intervention is de- livered over a period of time and focus on a few challenges rather than a range of challenges. Small financial interventions do not seem promising. A larger amount of money could perhaps have better effect. Title: Effect of interventions for at- risk families with children 0-6 years ------------------------------------------ Type of publication: Systematic for the Health Services ------------------------------------------ Updated: Last search for systematic reviews conducted in March 2015 ------------------------------------------ Peer review: og Unges Psykiske helse. 7 Executive summary (English) Executive summary (English) Background The number of children under six years old who receive assistance from the child welfare system because of neglect and abuse has been steadily increasing over the period 1995-2008. This is clear from a repo rt of the extent of neglect of infants and young children in Norway. In 2008, there were 8256 children under six years who received child-welfare. The increase has been greatest for children under one year. The report reveals that failure to provide care is the most common reason why kids come under official supervision. Substa nce abuse and mental disorders are other frequent reasons for the initiation of inte rventions. We need more knowledge about which interventions are effective for ch ildren in so-called risk families. Method We searched for systematic reviews in 13 international databases. The search was completed in March 2015. Two people independently screened all titles and ab- stracts and assessed relevant publications in full text. We included all systematic re- views that we rated as having high meth odological quality and that met our inclu- sion criteria for the population, interven tion, and outcomes. We used the authors' assessment of risk of bias. Quality of th e evidence was rated either high quality ( ), medium quality ( ), low quality ( ), or very low quality ( ). Results We included nine systematic reviews of high methodologic al quality. The population in the systematic reviews have in common th at they are in various ways vulnerable families with young children. The interventions that have been investigated in the included systematic reviews are partially overlapping and partially different. We grouped the results in five categories of similar interventions: 1) Psychological, psy- choeducational and psychosocial interventi ons (3 reviews), 2) Parenting interven- tions/training/guidence (2 reviews), 3) Ho me visits (2 reviews), 4) Mother- child units (1 review), 5) Financ ial assistance (1 review). 8 Executive summary (English) One systematic review looked at the effectiveness of psychotherapy for mothers with depression. The authors found a positive effe ct on the mental heal th of as well as a positive effect on co-play between mother and child (SMD 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17 - 0.52) ( ). One review looked at the effectiveness of community-based interv entions provided families with parental depression. The authors found no effect on the child's emotional ). A systematic review looked at the effectiveness of psychotherapy for mothers and infants. The authors found a strong positive effect on the attachment style in the infant (RR 3.30, 95% CI: 1.82 - 6.00) ( ). One systematic review looked at the effectiveness of parenting interventions given families who are in contact with the child welfare system because of abuse/neglect. The authors found that the interventions have a positive effect on parent-child rela- tionship (effect sizes and conf idence intervals are ( ), while the re- sults for the child's behavior and mental health varies ( ). One systematic re- view looked at the effectiveness of parental training for parents with mental retarda- tion. The authors found that the interventions have a positive effect on the ability to handle dangerous situations (MD 1.95, 95% CI: 0.46 to 3.44 ( ). But they found no effect on outcomes related to health understanding (MD -0.7, 95% CI: - 1.29 to 0.11) ( ). They found, however, an e ffect of the intervention on mother-child interaction, but here we lack effect size and confidence intervals ( ). One systematic review looked at the effectiven ess of home visits given to families de- fined as being at risk of neglect and ab use of children. The authors found incon- sistent results for outcomes related to abus e and neglect. This was also the case for outcomes such as child behavior and chil d's cognitive and linguistic development (we lack effect sizes and confidence intervals) ( ). One systematic review looked at the effectiveness of home visits for mothers with drug problems. The au- thors found that the interventions have no effect on maternal drug use (RR 1.18, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.46) ( ). They found no on outcomes related to abuse/neglect (RR 0.36, 95% CI: 0.02 to 8.77) ( ) or behavioral problems in the child ( RR 0.46, 95 % CI: 0.21 to 1.01) ( ). One systematic review looked at the effectiveness of small financial interventions provided families with low socioeconomic status. The authors found that the inter-vention have no effect on whether the ch ild is exposed to physical harm (OR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.35) ( ). They also found no effect of the intervention on positive behavior in the child (O R 0.96, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.17) ( ). When it comes to outcomes related to child psycho motor- and cognitive development, results are somewhat inconsistent (we lack effe ct sizes and confidence intervals) ( ). 9 Executive summary (English) Discussion Because of risk of bias, drop out of partic ipants from the studies, and small sample sizes we generally have low confidence in the documentation. This does not mean that the interventions don't work, but that the documentation is too limited for us to draw solid conclusions. Specific issues for ea ch of the five categories of interventions worth highlighting are: Psychological interventions seem to have a better effect on parents and children's mental health than psychoeducational and psychosocial interventions. Psychother- apy for mother and infant appears to have a strong positive effect on attachment style in the child, compared to standard treatment. Compared to another active par- enting intervention this intervention shows as good effect. Parenting interventions may have as good an effect on attachment style in the child. Parenting interventions seem to have a positive effect on the parent-child relation- ship, but the intervention shows mixed resu lts for other outcomes. The effect of the interventions might be better if th e intervention is more tailered. Home visits seem to have little effect for families at great risk. The intervention could possibly work better if it is started earl y (in the child's life), the provider is well trained to meet the challenges of the famili es, the intervention is delivered over a pe- riod of time and focus on a few challeng es rather than a range of challenges. Small financial interventions appears to have little effect on matters concerning abuse or behavioral problems in children. This intervention al one is probably not enough to change the life co nditions of families with lo w socioeconomic status, espe- cially not if the amount of money is to small to make a real change in the family's budget. For mother- and child units we have no documentation. The studies we have summarized results from here are largely conducted in the USA, Great Britain or other countries with fa r greater poverty and socioeconomic chal- lenges than we have in Norway. Perhaps Norwegian families - living in a welfare state - to a greater extent could benefit fr om some of the interventions because the amount of stress associated with socioeconomic challenges in families may be less. Conclusion We found nine systematic reviews of high methodological quality that met our inclu- sion criteria. We grouped the intervetnions in five categories. Of these, three main categories of interventions showed a possibl e effect on at least one outcome: Psycho- logical, psychoeducative and psychosocial interventions, pare nting interventions and home visit. There were no reports of negative outcomes. Small financial inter- ventions probably have no effect. No studies were included in the review of mother- child units, so for this interventi on we cannot draw any conclusions. 10 Innhold Innhold HOVEDFUNN 2 SAMMENDRAG 3 Diskusjon 5 Konklusjon 5 KEY MESSAGES (ENGLISH) 6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (ENGLISH) 7 Background 7 Method 7 Results 7 Discussion 9 Conclusion 9 INNHOLD 10 FORORD 13 PROBLEMSTILLING for familier som er i kontakt med barnevernet pga mishandling og omsorgssvikt 60 Foreldretrening Jensen faglige (4).

Intervention(s) Parent-infant psychotherapy Comparisons Comparison 1. Parent-infant psychotherapy versus control. Comparison 2. Parent-infant psychotherapy versus alternative (non-parent-infant psychother-apy) intervention. Latest search 13 January 2014 Study designs Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) Included trials Eight studies with 846 randomised participants. Three studies were conducted in the USA two in the UK, and one each in Canada, Switzerland and Sweden. Outcomes The included studies reported a range of outcomes relating to parental mental health, parent-infant interactions and infant development (i.e. attachment, behaviour, cognitive, and mental development). Authors conclusions Although the findings of the current review suggest that PIP is a promising model in terms of improving infant attachment security in high-risk families, there were no significant differences compared with no treatment or treatment-as-usual for other parent-based or relationship- based outcomes, and no evidence that PIP is more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants. Further rigorous research is needed to establish the impact of PIP on potentially important mediating factors such as parental mental health, reflective functioning, and parent-infant interaction.

The capacity to recomend evidence-based approaches is limited. Rigorous develop- ment work is needed to establish feasible and acceptable child-and family-based interven- tions, prior to evaluating clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness via a randomised con-troled trail (RCT). A substantial programme of pilot work is recommended to underpin the de- velopment of feasible and acceptable interventions for this population. Evaluations should in- corporate validated, child-centred QoL outcome measures, high-quality cost data and nested, in-depth acceptability studies. New age-appropriate instruments that better reflect the life pri- orities and unique challenges faced by children of parents with SMI may need to be devoped.

Home illustrations - Dangers : Parents asked to identify dangers in pictures of six areas of the home. Scores represent total number of dangers correctly identified out of a possible 104. Home illustrations - Precautions: Parents asked to identify precautions for dangers depicted in series of six pictures. Scores represent total num- ber of precautions identified. Home precautions : Home observation checklist completed by assessor with parent identify- ing dangers in parents home and precautions taken by parent. Scores represent total number of precautions taken to deal with total of 114 possible dangers e.g., edibles, suffocation, sharp objects etc. Authors conclusions The results of this review offer some encouraging evidence in relation to the potential of par-enting interventions designed for parents with intellectual disabilities to support and improve parenting knowledge and skills in some such parents. However, the studies included are small with risk of bias, and some of the results equivocal, so relevance to local populations should always be assessed before implementing interventions based on this review with the included data as it stands. Implications for research Much more evidence of effectiveness is needed in this area. The evidence base would benefit from larger possibly multi-centre randomized controlled trials with more detailed inclusion in- formation with which to assess generalisability. From the evidence at hand it is not clear what elements of the interventions produce the effect e.g., the manner of delivery, whether home or centre based, whether group or individual, and what frequency or duration might be optimal. As such, the evidence base would benefitfrom the conduct of process evaluations in order to unpack the different elements of effectiveness more specifically.

However, our central findig was that comparative research remains relatively nascent in the child maltreatment arena, with striking substantive and methodological gaps in the liter- ature. These gaps reflect the relatively brief history of clinical trials focused on child maltreat-ment and the Herculean demands on researchers involved in conducting high quality clinical studies with this highly vulnerable population. A multisite research network is a powerful plat- form that could facilitate the conduct of large, methodologically rigorous comparative efficacy and effectiveness trials needed to move the field forward. More broadly, a paradigm shift is required on the part of researchers and funders alike to galvanize the commitment and re- sources necessary for conducting colaborative clinical trials with these particulary vulnerable children and families. Irving CB, Saylan M, Mother and baby units for schizophrenia. Cochrane Database of S ystematic Reviews. 2007. Population Mothers with schizophrenia, irrespective of criteria used for diagnosis, assessed as needing admission along with their child, in the first year after child-birth. Intervention(s) Mother and baby units for schizophrenia Comparisons Standard care or other care than mother and baby units Latest search Juni 2006 Study designs RCT Included trials No trials met the inclusion criteria Outcomes Authors conclusions Mother and bay units are reportedly common in the UK but less common in other countries and rare or non-existent in the developing world. However, there does not appear to be any trial-based evidence for the effectiveness of these units. This lack of data is of concern as de- scriptive studies have found poor outcomes such as anxious attachment and poor develop-ment for children of mothers with schizophrenia and a greater risk of the children being placed under supervised or foster care. Effective care of both mothers and babies during this critical time may be crucial to prevent poor clinical and parenting outcomes. Good, relevant research is urgently needed. 137 Lucas P, McIntoch K, Petticrew M, Roberts HM, Shiell A. Financial benefits for child health and well-being in low income or socially disadvantged families in developed world countries. Cochrane Database of Systematic Re- views. 2008 Population Socially disadvantaged famiies/ low-income families Intervention(s) Financial benefits Comparisons No financial benefits Latest search June 2006 Study designs RCT or quasi-RCT Included trials Nine trials with more than 25,ooo participants Outcomes Child behavior, child development, family violence, child abuse Authors conclusions The review set out to examine the potential of financial support to poor families to improve cir- cumstances for children. However, on the basis of current evidence we cannot state unequiv-ocally whether financial benefits delivered as an intervention are effective at improving child health or well-being in the short term. Our conclusions are limited by the fact that most of the studies had small effects on total household income and that, while no conditions were at-tached to how money was spent, all studies included strict conditions for receipt of payments. We note particular concerns by som authors that sanctions and conditions (such as working hours) placed on families may increase family stress. Peacock S, Konrad S, Watson E, Nickel D, Muhajarine N. Effectiveness of home visiting programs on child out- comes: a systematic review. BMC Public Health 2013, 13 (17) Population Disadvantaged families/ At risk families (low income, substance abuse etc) Intervention(s) Home visits Comparisons Standard care/No home visits Latest search May 2012 Study designs RCT Included trials 21 trials (RCTS) from USA (14), Ireland (2), United Kingdom, South Africa, Banladesh, Ja- maica, Chile Outcomes Child abuse and neglect Child development: cognitive; psychom otor; language Child behavior, Child health. Authors conclusions This systematic review begins to address a current gap in the research literature by evaluating the effectiveness of paraprofessional HV programs. While this systematic review has shown that HV programs that utilize paraprofessionals often do not have significant effects on disad- vantaged families, it does show that young children in these programs show modest improve- ments in some circumstances. The included studies found that HV intervention programs were associated with decreases in harsh parenting, improved cognition and language development in young children, reductions in low birth weight, weight-for-age in young children, and reduc- tion in child health problems. However, findings that were not statistically significant were 138 much more common than significant ones. As discussed, addressing the dose of interven- tions, approaching women prenatally, focusing programs on improving specific outcomes, making sure paraprofessionals receive adequate training and support, and improving the re- tention of families all may improve the impacts of HV programs.
