Glossary of DAWN Terms, 2010 Update Attachment B. Drug Abuse Warning Network Methodology Report, 2010 Update Attachment C. Guide to Drug Abuse Warning Network Trend Tables, 2010 Update 8 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES HIGHLIGHTS This publication presents national estimates of drug-related visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) for the calendar year 2010 , based on data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). Also presented are comparisons of 2010 estimates with those for 2004, 200 8, and 200 9. DAWN is a public health surveillance system that monitors drug-related ED visits for the Nation and for selected metropolitan areas. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the agency responsible for DAWN. SAMHSA is required to collect data on drug -related ED visits under section 505 of the Public Health Service Act. DAWN relies on a nationally representative sample of general, non-Federal hospitals operating 24-hour EDs , with oversampling of hospitals in selected metropolitan areas. In each participating hospital, ED medical records are reviewed retrospectively to find the ED visits that involved recent drug use. All types of drugs \u2014illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals (e.g., dietary supplements, cough medicine), and substances inhaled for their psychoactive effects \u2014are included. Alcohol is considered an illic it drug when consumed by patients aged 20 or younger. For patients aged 21 or older, though, alcohol is reported only when it is used in conjunction with other drugs. Marked findings of this report are (a) a 94 percent increase in the number of drug -related ED visits overall between 2004 and 2010, and (b) large increase s in the involvement of a wide range of pharmaceuticals (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter medications, supplements ) over that period. It is likely that there are multiple causes contributing to these increases. Some portion of these increases may be associated with the greater number of prescriptions being written and with more people taking multiple prescription drugs, often in combination with over -the-counter preparations, as part of their long- term medical care. The greater availability of prescription drugs also facilitates their diversion for intentional misuse as well as accidental ingestion. It is beyond the scope of this report, though, to explore more fully the causes behind the growing numbers of ED visits involving pharmaceuticals, and further analysis is needed . All D rug-Related ED Visits In 2010, over 125 million visits were made to EDs in general -purpose, non -Federal hospitals operating 24- hour EDs in the United States. DAWN estimates that just under 5 million of these visits, or 1,589.0 ED visits per 100,000 population, were related to drugs, a 94 percent increase since 2004. In 2010, drug -related visits range from a high of 2,478.3 visits per 100,000 population aged 18 to 20 to a low of 263.3 visits per 100,000 population aged 6 to 11 (Figure 1) . DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 9 Figure 1. Rates of drug-related ED visits per 100,000 population, by age group, 2010 SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2010. Overall Drug Misuse or Abuse In 20 10, DAWN estimates that about 2.3 million ED visits resulted from medical emergencies involving drug misuse or abuse , the equivalent of 743.7 ED visits per 100,000 population. For those aged 20 or younger , the rate is 476.1 visits; for those aged 21 or older, the rate is 849.4 visits. Understanding that a visit may appear in more than one group, DAWN found that out of all drug misuse or abuse ED visits , 1,173,654 ED visits, or 51.0 percent, involved nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals ; 1,171,024 ED visits, or 50.9 percent, involv ed illicit drugs ; and 687,574 ED visits, or 29.9 percent, involv ed alcohol . Although the overall number of ED visits attributable to drug misuse or abuse was stable from 2004 to 2010 , ED visits related to the use of pharmaceuticals with no other drug involvement rose substantially (132% increase), as did the use of pharmaceuticals with illicit drugs (139% increase), pharmaceuticals with alcohol (63% increase), and pharmaceuticals combined with both illicit drugs and alcohol (94% increase). 10 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Illicit D rugs DAWN estimates that 1,171,024 ED visits in 2010 involved an illicit drug. That is, 50.9 percent of all the drug misuse or abuse ED visits during the year involved one or more illicit drugs taken alone or in combination with pharmaceuticals, alcohol, or both. Among all visits involving illicit drugs, cocaine was involved in 488,101 visits, or 41.7 percent ; m arijuana was involved in 461,028 visits, or 39.4 percent ; heroin was involved in 224,706 visits, or 19.2 percent ; amphetamine s/methamphetamine were involved in 137,947 visits , or 11.8 percent ; PCP was involved in 53,542 visits, or 4.6 percent; and other illicit drugs in fewer than 2.0 percent . Synthetic cannabinoids, also known as \"Spice\" or \"K2, \" appeared for the first time at reportable levels in DAWN in 2010; they were involved in 11,406 ED visits (1.0 %). In 20 10, there were 378.5 ED visits that involved illicit drugs for each 100,000 persons in the U.S. population . The highest rates were found for cocaine involvement (157.8 ED visits per 100,000 population) and marijuana (149.0 visits) , followed by heroin (72.6 visits ), (44.6 visits), PCP (17.3 visits), Ecstasy (7.1 visits), inhalants (3.7 visits), and synthetic cannabinoids (3.7 visits). Lower -incidence drugs had rates below 2 visits per 100,000 population. For most illicit drugs, including cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and amphetamines/methamphetamine, the rate was higher for males than for females. Looking across age categories, the rate of marijuana involvement was highest for patients aged 18 to 20 (529.3 visits per 100,000 population) , and cocaine was highest for those aged 35 to 44 (327.6 visits). Heroin and amphetamine s/methamphetamine involvement was highest for those aged 25 to 29 (186.9 and 124.3 vis its per 100,000 population, respectively). Overall, 40.9 percent of visits involving illicit drugs resulted in some form of follow- up, including admission to the hospital (23.9%), transfer to another health care facility (10.8%), or referral to a detox/dependency program (6.3%). Most other patients (48.1%) were treated and released to home, with the remainder (11.0%) experiencing other outcomes . While t he overall level of ED visits involving illicit drugs from 2004 t o 2008 was stable , DAWN observed an 18 percent increase in illicit drug- related visits between 2008 and 2010. Contributing to that rise were visits involving cannabinoids (including marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids) , which increased 26 percent between 200 8 and 2010, and visits involving amphetamine s/methamphetamine , which increased 50 percent. The balance of amphetamines versus methamphetamine visits has shifted over the period from 2004 to 2010. In 2004, there were DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 11 almost four methamphetamine -involved visits for every amphetamines -related visit; in 2010, there were fewer than two. Drugs and A lcohol Taken Together In 20 10, over half a million ED visits , or 24.5 percent of all drug misuse or abuse ED visits, involved drugs combined with alcohol . The rate of alcohol -related ED visits per 100,000 population for males (240.1 visits ) was higher than that for females ( 126.7 visits ). The highest level was seen for patients aged 21 to 24 (35 4.6 visits). Almost half ( 46.2%) of patients received some sort of follow- up care: 28.6 percent were admitted to the hospital, 11.7 percent were transferred to another facility, and 5.9 percent were referred to detox. The remaining patients were treated and released to home (44.9%) or had other outcomes (8.9%). Illicit drugs were involved in over half ( 59.8%) of ED visits involving alcohol and other drugs, with cocaine or marijuana representing the greatest proportion of such visits ( 30.2% and 2 6.7%, respectively). One or more pharmaceuticals were also involved in over half (55.8%) of these v isits. Pain relievers were observed in 23.0 percent of visits, with narcotic pain relievers accounting for over half of that (14. 0%). Drugs for insomnia and anxiety were involved in 2 3.1 percent of visits, with the largest part of that being benzodiazepines (19.7 %). Psychothe rapeutic agents (antidepressants and antipsychotic s) were involved in less than 8 percent of visits involving alcohol -drug combinations . Between 2004 and 20 10, involvement of alcohol in drug misuse or abuse ED visits remained stable. Underage Drinking There were over 189,060 medical emergencies involving alcohol for patients aged 20 or younger in 2010, representing almost half (45.2%) of all drug misuse or abuse ED visits made by patients aged 20 or younger. The rate of medical emergencies involving the abuse of alcohol by youths was 291.0 visits per 100,000 population aged 12 to 17 and 848.7 visits per 100,000 population aged 18 to 20, almost a threefold di fference . The pattern is similar when looking at ED visits for either alcohol alone or alcohol used in combination with other drugs. Between 2004 and 20 10, levels of ED visits involving underage drinking remained constant for youth aged 12 to 17 and young adults aged 18 to 20. Nonmedical U se of Pharmaceuticals There is growing concern in the public health community about the misuse of pharmaceuticals. For 2010, DAWN estimates that 1,173,654 ED visits involved nonmedical use of prescription medicines, over -the-counter drugs, or other types of pharmaceuticals. This represents about a quarter (23.9%) of all drug -related ED visits and over half (51.0%) of ED visits for drug misuse or 12 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES abuse. Over half (5 4.7%) of ED visits resulting from nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals involved multiple drugs , and about one in five ( 17.4%) involved alcohol. Visits for nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals did not differ significantly between males and females (374.2 and 383.9 visits per 100,000 population, respectively) . On the other hand, notable differences were seen between age categories: rates for patients aged 21 to 34 were over 600 visits per 100,000 population, with lower levels observed for younger and older patients. Almost 40 percent ( 37.4%) of patients misusing pharmaceuticals received some form of follow- up care, including referral to detox/treatment (2.4%), admission to the hospital (25.5%), or transfer to another facility (9.5%). Of the remaining patients, most were treated and released to home (54. 0%) or had other outcomes (8.6%). The most common type of drug involved in ED visits for the nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals was pain relievers (48.3 %), with the highest levels seen for relievers oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone (12.5%, 8.2%, and 5.6%, respectively). Drugs used to treat anxiety and insomnia were also seen frequently (34.0%) in visits related to the misuse of pharmaceuticals . Of these, benzodiazepines accounted for the majority (29.5%) of these ED visits , specifically alprazolam (e.g., Xanax \u00ae), which was indicated in about a third (10.6%) of visits involving benzodiazepines . From 2004 to 2010, medical emergencies related to the nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals increased 11 9 percent. Contributing to this rise was the 149 percent increase in the number of visits involving narcotic pain reli evers . Specific narcotic drugs that more than doubled their involvement in ED visits between 2004 and 2 010 were fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromo rphone, opiate agonist used for moderate -to-severe pain, increased 235 percent. Between 2004 and 2010, the number of visits involving drugs for anxiety and insomnia increased 125 percent. Involvement of drugs in the benzodiazepine family experienced a 141 percent increase . Zolpidem (e.g., Ambien \u00ae), a sleeping aid with benzodiazepine-like increased 150 percent. M uscle relaxants (e.g., carisprodol, cyclobenzaprine) increased 107 percent. The attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drug amphetamine -dextroamphetamine (e.g., Adderall\u00ae) saw a 392 percent increase between 2004 and 2010. Drug -Related Suicide Attempts Substance abuse is strongly associated with suic ide attempts. DAWN estimates that there were 212,736 medical emergencies resulting in ED visits for drug -related suicide attempts in 2010. Almost all (94. 7%) of these ED visits involved a prescription drug or over -the-counter medication ; about two thirds (62.6%) involved multiple drugs ; about a quarter (25.3%) involved alcohol ; and about a fifth ( 17.8%) involved illicit drugs. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 13 Pharmaceuticals were much more common than illicit drugs in ED visits for drug -related suicide attempts. More than a third ( 37.1%) of these visits involved pain relievers, with narcotic pain relievers accounting for almost half that number (15.5%). Benzodiazepines were involved in more than a quarter (28.4%) of visits, with alprazolam accounting for about a third of that number (10.6%). A ntidepressants were involved in 19.9 percent of ED visits for drug-related suicide attempts, with about half (10.5%) of these involv SSRI suicide -attempt visits for females ( 80.8 visits per 100,000 population) was higher than that for males ( 56.3 visits per 100,000). With regard to age, rates ranged from 13.4 visits per 100,000 population for those aged 65 or older to 160.1 visits per 100,000 population for those aged 18 to 20. Following the ED visit, 77.8 percent of patients who attempted suicide received some form of follow- up care . About half (49.9%) were admitted for inpatient hospital care, with 17.9 percent admitted to intensive or critical care unit s (ICUs) and 12.7 percent admitted to psychiatric units. A quarter (24.8%) of patients were transferred to another health care facility , and 3.0 percent were discharged with a referral to detox or substance abuse treatment services. The remaining patients (22.2 %) were treated and released to home or had other dispositions. The number of drug -related suicide attempts remained stable from 2004 to 20 10. However, the involvement of narcotic pain reliever s increased 95 percent during this time. Specifically, hydrocodone (e.g., Vicodin \u00ae) and oxycodone (e.g., OxyContin \u00ae) increased 83 percent and 147 percent, respectively. There was also a 53 percent rise observed between 2004 and 2010 for drugs used to treat anxiety and insomnia. Benzodiazepine involvement, in general, rose 63 percent, with substantial increases observed for alprazolam (e.g., Xanax), Ambien). Seeking Detox Services The category of visits referred to as \"seeking detox \" includes nonemergency requests for admission for detox ification, visits to obtain medical clearance before entry to a detox progra m, and acute emergencies in which an individual who is experiencing withdrawal symptoms is seeking detox. DAWN estimates that there were 232,542 drug-related ED visits for patients seeking detox or substance abuse treatment services during 2010. Visits for more than two thirds (67.8 %) of patients seeking detox involved multiple drugs , and 29.8 percent involved alcohol. Males were more likely than females to seek detox services ( 99.2 and 51.9 visits per 100,000 population, respectively). Rates of visits for patients seeking detox peaked at 206.7 visits per 100,000 population for those aged 21 to 24. 14 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES More than half (58.1%) of ED patients seeking detox obtained some form of follow- up: 32.2 percent were admitted to the hospital, 17.3 percent were referred to detox /treatment services, and 8.6 percen t were transferre d to another facility. The remaining patients were treated and released to home (31. 1%) or had other outcome s. As to the types of drugs involved, cocaine was observed in 27.6 percent of visits by patients seeking detox, heroin in 26.7 percent, marijuana in 18. 5 percent, and amphetamines/methamphetamine in 5.9 percent. Among pharmaceuticals, narcotic pain relievers were observed in 45.4 percent of visits, including oxycodone at 28.8 percent. Benzodiazepines were observed in 23. 1 percent of v isits, with alprazolam at 12.2 percent. The overall number of ED visits by patients seeking detox has not grown significantly since 2004 , though pharmaceutical involvement has become more common in recent years. There was a 22 percent increase between 2009 and 2010 in pharmaceutical involvement overall, a 35 percent increase in narcotic pain relievers, and a 47 percent increase in oxycodone. Adverse Reactions to Pharmaceuticals Adverse reactions among ambulatory populations are a growing public health c oncern in the United States because people are being prescribed more drugs and the number of older persons who typically take more medications has increased . In 20 10, DAWN estimates that 2,329,221 ED visits involved adverse reactions to prescription medicines, over -the-counter drugs, or other therapeutic substances used as prescribed or indicated. This represents just under half (47.4%) of all drug- related ED visits . The drugs most commonly involved in adverse reactions , anti -infectives (e.g., antibiotics) , were involved in 21.7 percent of visits. As a general category, pain relievers were involved in 16.3 percent of visits , with narcotic pain relievers accounting for 8.9 percent. Cardiovascular agents appeared in 10. 4 percent of visits. Coagulation modifiers were involved in 7.9 percent , and metabolic agents , such as insulin and lipid-lowering drugs , were found in 7.6 percent of visits. When population size and sampling error were taken into account, women had notably more visits than men (909.3 and 590.2 visits per 100,000 population, respectively) involving drug-related adverse reactions . For children aged 5 and under, the rate of ED visits for adverse reaction s was 736.0 visits per 100,000 population. The rate dropped to a low of 231.8 visits for children aged 6 to 11 and then rose consistently to reach a high of 1,678.9 visits for patients aged 65 or older . About three quarters (75.6%) of patients were treated and released , a fifth (20.7%) were admitted to the hospital, and the remainder (3.7%) had other outcomes. Overall, ED visits resulting from adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals increased 86 percent in the period from 2005 to 2010, rising from about 1.3 million visits to over 2.3 million. Noteworthy trends and heavily involved drugs include the following: DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 15 anti -anxiety drugs and sleeping aids - 108 percent increase (e.g., zolpidem, alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam) ; antidepressants - 119 percent increase ; anticonvulsants - 85 percent increase; antidiabetic drugs - 87 percent increase (e.g., insulin, biguanides, sulfonylureas) ; anti -infectives - 65 percent - 157 percent increase ; antipsychotics - 110 percent increase (e.g., quetiapine s); cardiovascular agents - 108 percent (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics ); hormone -based drugs - 148 percent increase (e.g., adrenal cortical steroids , sex hormones , thyroid hormones ); immunological drugs (bacterial and viral vaccines) - 157 percent increase; nutritional products - 185 percent increase (e.g., minerals and electrolytes products, oral nutritional supplements, vitamins) ; and pain relievers - 70 percent increase (e.g., hydrocodone and oxycodone products ). Accidental Ingestion of Drugs Accidental ingestion of drugs by children is an eminent ly preventable health risk. Nonetheless, poison control centers find that over half of human exposure calls involve children aged 5 and under , and the majority of substances involved in pediatric exposure s are drugs. The danger of accidental ingestion of drugs by children is even more apparent in the 2010 DAWN findings , where over two thirds (6 7.9%) of the 107,632 accidental ingestion ED visits involved children aged 5 and under. DAWN found the rate of ED visits for accidental ingestion by children aged 5 and under to be almost 25 times higher than for adults: 300.2 ED visits per 100,000 children aged 5 and under compared with 12.7 ED visits per 100,000 for adults aged 21 and older. Two-year -olds are at greatest risk , with a rate of 701.1 v isits. Pain reliever s, cardiac medications, aspirin antidiabetic camphor , and nasal sprays are recognized as being particularly dangerous when accidentally ingested by children. For ED patients aged 5 and under , DAWN found that pain relief medication was the most common class of drugs involved in accidental ingestion , with 28.0 percent of visits. Cardiovascular agents were involved in 13.1 percent of visits, a ntidepressants in 6.4 percent of visits, and a ntidiabetic drugs in 2.5 percent . Other drugs DAWN found involved in pediatric poisonings included respiratory agents (e.g., antihistamines, bronchodilators, and a broad range of combination products used to treat upper respiratory conditions ; 11.6%); acetaminophen products (10.5%); anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics (drugs to treat insomnia and anxiety ; 9.9%); antipsychotics (5.3%); and t opical agents (5.3%). 16 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES The large majority (83.9%) of accidental ingestio n ED patients aged 5 and under were treated and discharged home. About 15 percent received more extensive follow- up care: either admi ssion to the hospital (10.4%), or transfer to another facility (4.2%). Medical emergencies related to accidental ingestions by patients aged 5 and under were stable from 2004 to 20 10, though increases were observed for particular drug groups. Involvement of pain relievers in general saw a 70 percent increase since 2004, and involvement of antihistamines rose 162 percent . DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 17 1. INTRODUCTION This publication presents estimates of drug -related emergency department (ED) visits from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) for 2010 , with comparison of estimates for 2004, 200 8, and 2009. DAWN is a public health surveillance system that monitors patients' medical records of ED visits for the Nation to identify those visits that are related to drug use, misuse, and abuse . The Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHS Q) of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been responsible for DAWN operations since 1992. This introduction provides a brief description of the major features of DAWN and the statistics presented in this report. Survey findings , as well as comparisons to earlier years' data , are organized in eight following sections , with each section focus ing on a specific type of ED visit (as listed in Table 1) . Additional detail s on DAWN terminology and methodology are provided as attachments to this document. Detailed tables of DAWN estimates, this document, its attachments, other reports using DAWN data, and other methodology reports are available at the DAWN Web site.1 As they become available, DAWN data are accessible through SAMHSA's Data Archive (SAMHDA).2 Table 1. DAWN analytic groups Analytic group Description All Visits This group includes all visits that are reportable to DAWN without regard for the reason for the visit or the specific drugs involved. It includes visits involving all forms of drug misuse or abuse plus visits resulting from adverse reaction, accidental ingestion, suicide attempts, and visits seeking detoxification services. These estimates are useful for looking at overall levels of drug involvement in ED visits. Drug-related ED visits that involve drug misuse or abuse All M isuse and Abuse This analytic category includes ED visits that involve all forms of drug misbuse or ab use, as defined by DAWN. This category is the combination of visits from the following four analytic groups: illicit drug visits, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, alcohol -related visits, and underage drinking. A visit may appear in more than one of those subgroups , but it will appear only once in this overall group. Suicide -attempt visits and seeking detox visits will be included in this category if illicit drugs were involved. 1 DAWN documents can be found on the DAWN Web site at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx . 2 DAWN data can be found on the SAMHDA Web site at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/studies/31264?q=DAWN. 18 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Table 1. DAWN analytic groups (continued) Analytic group Description Illicits (excluding alcohol) This analytic category includes ED visits that involve the use of drugs that have limited or no therapeutic value and are generally illegal if taken without a prescription. These substances include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids, the inhalation of substances for their psychoactive properties (e.g., sniffing model airplane glue) are included. Nonmedical Use of Pharmaceuticals This analytic category includes ED visits that involve nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals: patients who took a higher than prescribed or recommended dose of their own medication, patients who took a pharmaceutical prescribed for another person, malicious poisoning of the patient by another individual, and documented substance abuse involving pharmaceuticals. All Alcohol This analytic category includes ED visits involving alcohol. For adults aged 21 and older, the alcohol was found in combination with other drugs. For patients under the age of 21, the visit may involve alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs. Underage Drinking This analytic category includes ED visits that involve alcohol use (alone or with other drugs) for patients under the age of 21. Underage drinking is an important barometer of adolescent drinking patterns and a predictor of more serious substance abuse problems in young adults. Suicide Attempts This analytic category includes ED visits that involve drug -related suicide attempts. It includes visits for drug overdoses and for suicide attempts by other means (e.g., using a firearm) if drugs were involved or related to the suicide attempt. Inclusion in this analytic category has no restrictions on the type of drug used. Seeking Detox This analytic category includes nonemergency requests made through the ED for admission to detoxification unit, visits to obtain medical clearance before being incarcer ated, and acute emergencies where an individual is experiencing withdrawal symptoms and requests detox. These estimates do not include patients who seek or enter the hospital's detox unit through other avenues. Drug-related ED visits that do NOT involve drug misuse or abuse Adverse Reactions This analytic category includes ED visits in which an adverse health consequence (e.g., side effects or an allergic reaction) resulted when taking prescription drugs, over -the-counter medications, or dietary supplements as prescribed or recommended. Accidental I ngestions This analytic category includes ED visits in which an individual accidentally or unknowingly used or was administered a prescription drug, over -the- counter medication, or dietary supplement. Drug -related accidental ingestions typicall y involve patients aged 5 and under. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 19 1.1 Major Features of DAWN 1.1.1 What Is a DAWN Case? A DAWN case is any ED visit involving recent drug use that is implicated in the ED visit . The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related . Therefore, DAWN includes ED visits resulting from accidental ingestion s and adverse reaction s as well as explicit drug abuse. 1.1.2 What Drugs A re Included in DAWN? DAWN captures drugs that are explicitly named in the medical record as being involved in the ED visit. The relationship between the ED visit and the drug use need not be causal. That is, an implicated drug may or may not have directly caused the condition generating the ED visit ; the E D staff simply named it as being involved. Conversely, DAWN does not report medications or pharmaceuticals that the ED medical records mention as having been taken by the patient but that are unrelated to the ED visit . Within those guidelines, DAWN collects data on all types of drugs, including the following: illegal drugs, e.g., heroin, cocaine, marijuana (including s ynthetic ), MDMA (Ecstasy ), drugs, have for behavior disorders , e.g., Xanax, Ritalin \u00ae, Prozac ; prescription drugs used in the treatment of other medical conditions, e.g., antibiotics , anti - coagulants, insulin, chemotherapy drugs ; anesthetic gases; over-the-counter medications, e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, multi -ingredient cough and cold remedies; dietary supplements, e.g., vitamins, herbal remedies, nutritional products; alcohol when used in combination with other drugs; and alcohol alone, in patients aged 20 or younger . 1.1.3 What Is Covered in T his Publication? This report provides detailed information on ED v isits involving drug use, misuse, or abuse for the years 2004 through 20 10. The types of ED visits (referred to as analytic groups ) highlighted in this publication are listed in Table 1. The analytic groups are defined by the reason for the visit and the types of drugs involved. Because a visit may involve multiple types of drugs (e.g., an illicit drug, such as marijuana, and a pharmaceutical , such as hydrocodone) , a single visit may appea r in multiple analytic groups. 20 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 1.2 Hospital Participation in 20 10 DAWN relies on a nationally representative sample of hospitals with oversampling of hospitals in selected metropolitan areas. The universe of hospitals eligible for DAWN includes non -Federal, short-stay, general medical and surgical facilities in the United States that operate 24-hour EDs. DAWN excludes specialty hospitals (e.g., pediatric hospitals), long -term care facilities, and Federal facilities (e.g., Veteran s Health Administration hospital s). The American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database (ASDB) was used to identify the original frame members. Subsequent ASDB surveys are used annually to identify \"births\" of new hospitals that open and \"deaths\" of hospitals that close or merge with other hospitals. For 20 10, 7.2 million charts out of a universe of 11.6 million charts were reviewed to determine if a visit was drug related. Data on 304,110 drug-related ED visits submitted by 237 hospitals were used for estimation. The overall visit weighted response rate was 34.2 percent. 1.3 Estimates of ED Visits This publication reports nationally representative estimates of drug -related ED visits for the United States. Estimates are calculated by applying weights and adjustments to the data provided by the sampled hospitals participating in DAWN. The primary sampling weights reflect the probability of hospital selection, and separate adjustment factors are included to account for sampling of ED visits, nonresponse, data quality, and the known total of ED visits delivered by the universe of eligible hospitals, as reported by the most current ASDB survey. Many of the tables in this report provide estimates of visits , by drug. DAWN is able to identify more than 3,300 individual drugs (which map to more than 19,000 individual brands and street names).3 The more commonly involved drugs and drug categories were selected for inclusion in the drug detail tables appearing in this report. Because (a) a single ED visit may involve multiple drugs , or (b) the same drug may be reported both under its specific drug name and under its drug category, the sum of ED visits from different rows in the drug detail tables will be greater than the total number of visits. For the same reason, percentages will add to more than 100. 1.4 Rates of ED Visits per 100,000 Population Standardized measures are helpful when comparing levels of drug-related ED visits for different age and sex groups. This publication reports rates of ED visits per 100,000 population by age groups and sex groups per year , e.g., visits in 2010 per 100,000 population aged 12 to 17 ; visits in 2004 per 100,000 male population . Population estimates are based on counts provided by the U.S. 3 The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon, \u00a9 2011 Lexi-Comp, Inc. and/or Cerner Multum, Inc. The classification was modified to meet DAWN's unique requirements (2010). The Multum Licensing Agreement governing use of the Lexicon can be found on the DAWN Web site at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/dawn/MultumLicenseAgreement.pdf . DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 21 Census Bureau.4 Population -based rates for race/ethnicity categories are not reported because race/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records; a dash ( \u2014) is displayed instead. 1.5 Sampling Error Because DAWN relies on a sample of hospitals, each estimate produced from the DAWN ED data is subject to sampling variability , the variation in estimates that would be observed naturally if different samples were drawn from the same population using the same procedures. One measure of sampling variability of an estimate used in this publication is the relative standard error (RSE). The precision of an estimate is inversely related to its RSE. That is, the greater the RSE, the lower the precision. A second measure of sampling error used in this publication is the 95 percent confidence interval (CI). A 95 percent CI means that if repeated samples were drawn from the same population of hospitals using the same sampling and data collection procedures, the true population value would fall within the CI 95 percent of the time. A CI, which is expressed as a range of values, is useful because the interval reflects both the estimate and its particular margin of error. For example, in 2010 , there were 2,301,050 ED visits associated with drug misuse or abuse with a CI of 1,987,721 to 2,614,380 . The CI indicates with a high degree of confidence that the actual number was within this range. 1.6 Suppression An asterisk (*) is displayed in the place of suppressed estimates and rates. Data may be suppressed to protect patient confidentiality or to ensure that published findings meet statistical standa rds of reliability for survey results. In all DAWN published materials, estimates are suppressed according to the following rules: The RSE of the estimate is greater than 50 percent . The RSE is a measure of the relative precision and is calculated by dividing the estimate's standard error by the estimate itself. When the RSE is greater than 50 percent , the lower bound of the 95 percent CI approaches or includes the value zero. A CI that includes zero means that the estimate is not statistically different from zero at this precision level. The estimate is based on fewer than 30 ED visits . Estimates based on a small number of cases are typically suppressed because the RSE is greater than 50 percent . Estimates that do meet RSE criteria for publication but are based on fewer than 30 ED visits (weighted or unweighted) are deemed too unreliable for publication. Such estimates are also suppressed to protect patient privacy. Ratios (percentages or rates per 100,000 population) based on suppressed estimates are likewise suppressed. 4 For 2010, population counts were drawn from the 2010 United States Resident Population Census files (available from the U.S. Census Bureau at http://www2.census.gov/census_2010/03- Demographic_Profile/ ). 22 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 1.7 Comparisons Across Years In this publication, between -year changes are assessed by comparing estimates for 20 10 with those for 2004, 200 8, and 200 9.5 This publication reports only those between-year changes that are statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. The p-value is a measure of the probability ( p) that the difference between two estimates could have occurred by chance, if the estimates being compared were really the same. The larger the p-value, the more likely the difference could have occurred by chance. For example, if the difference between two DAWN estimates has a p-value of 0.01, it means that there is a 1 percent probability that the difference observed could be due to chance alone. The redesign of DAWN in 2003 altered most of DAWN's core features. Changes were made to the design of the hospital sample, the protocol for selecting charts to review, the eligibility criteria for being a DAWN case , and the data items submitted on these cases . These changes created a permanent disruption in trends. As a result, comparisons cannot be made between old DAWN (2003 and prior years) and the redesigned DAWN (2004 and forward). 1.8 Limitations of the Data Readers are advised to consider the following limitations to the DAWN dat a when interpreting results: DAWN data collectors attempt to identify , with a high degree of specificity , the exact drugs involved in an ED visit , but extant medical records vary in specificity and detail. If extant medical records include only a general description of a drug (e.g., \"benzodiazepines \"), the drug is grouped in a general category (e.g., \"benzodiazepines not otherwise specified\"). DAWN relies on the assessment made by ED medical staff to determine which drugs are relate d to the visit and records only those drugs indicated as being related. DAWN does not assess the medical reasons for the visit , and it cannot be assumed that a drug was the direct cause of the medical emergency. For example, a soporific may have caused the patient to fall asleep while driving and then to have an accident. Use of illicit drugs is assumed to constitute drug abuse. The determination of n onmedical use of pharmaceuticals, though, must be supported by information provided by medical personnel in the ED records. In cases where multiple pharmaceuticals are involved, it is not necessary that both drugs are misused. The medical emergency might stem from the interaction between two pharmaceuticals, one of which was used nonmedically , and the other of which was taken as prescribed. While DAWN seeks to report only the drugs that are related to the ED visit, some unrelated drugs may be included if ED records fail to indicate that they were obtained through a legitimate prescription, were taken as prescribed or indicated, and were unrelated to the 5 Due to data limitations in 2004, long-term comparisons for ED visits resulting from adverse reactions are made between 2005 and the current year. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 23 ED visit. For example, anecdotal evidence suggests that ED records may mention methadone but fail to indicate that the patient was enrolled in a methadone treatment program and that the methadone was unrelated to the medical emergency leading to the ED visit . Information on race and ethnicity is often poorly documented in extant ED records. In addition, some hospitals consider race/ethnicity to be private information and will not make it available to DAWN Field Reporter s. Overall, about 15 percent of visits each year do not contain race/ethnicity information. DAWN does not produce rates (visits per 100,000 population) for race/ethnicity groups because t hese missing data will result in the understatement of visit s by race/ethnicity category. This might affect racial/ethnic groups differentially and produce misleading findings. Although DAWN documents whether a drug was positively confirmed by toxicology testing, DAWN does not require that drugs reported for the ED visit be confirmed by laboratory testing . Toxicology tests are not used consistently across EDs, and some toxicology tests are not specific enough to identify particular drugs. Furthermore, a positive toxicology test is not necessarily evidence of recent drug involvement in an ED visit if it is a current medication or a drug that persists in the system long after it was used. For this reason, DAWN requires that the involvement of drugs be mentioned in the ED record, not just in the toxicology testing results, for the visit to be considered a DAWN case. Information on drug -related visits is based on a sample and is therefore subject to sampling variability. Standard error measurements are provided in many tables to reflect the sampling var iability that occurs (a ) by chance because only a sample rather than the entire universe is surveyed , and (b) due to nonresponse. As in any survey, a low response rate is of concern because it creates larger -than- expected sampling errors plus the opportunity for unpredictable biases. DAWN addresses these issues for the short term by always reporting standard errors based on the actual sample of respondents and for the long term by continuing its efforts to raise the hospital participation rate. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 25 2. OVERALL DRUG MISUSE OR ABUSE 2.1 ED Visits Involving Overall Drug Misuse or Abuse, 20 10 For 20 10, DAWN estimates that there were over 4.9 million drug-related ED visits . Of these , over 2.3 million ED visits were associated with drug misuse or abuse ( Table 2). That is the equivalent of 743.7 ED visits for each 100,000 persons in the Nation; for those aged 20 or younger, the rate is 476.1 visits; for those aged 21 or older, the rate is 849.4 visits.

SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2010. Of the ED visits in 20 10 that involved drug misuse or abuse, nearly two thirds ( 64.6%) were associa ted with a single drug type (illicit drugs, alcohol, or pharmaceuticals). Illicit drugs alone were involved in 25.3 percent of drug misuse or abuse visits, pharmaceuticals alone were involved in 33.9 percent, and alcohol with no other drug (aged 20 or youn ger only) was involved in 5.3 percent. The remaining visits (35.4%) involved some combination of illicit drugs, alcohol, and pharmaceuticals. Understanding that a visit may appear in more than one group, DAWN found, that out of all drug misuse or abuse ED visits, 26 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 1,173,654 ED visits, or 51.0 percent of drug misuse or abuse ED visits, invol ved nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals ; 1,171,024 ED visits, or 50.9 percent, involv ed illicit drugs ; and 687,574 ED visits, or 29.9 percent, involv ed alcohol . 2.2 Trends in ED Visits Involving Drug Misuse or Abuse , 2004 -2010 This section presents the trends in the estimates of ED visits involving drug misuse or abuse for the period from 2004 through 2010 (Table 3). Differences between years are presented in terms of the percentage increase or decrease in visits in 2010 compared with the estimates for 2004 (long -term trends) and for 200 8 and 200 9 (short -term trends). Only statistically significant changes are discussed and displayed in the table. Between 2004 and 2010, the overall number of ED visits attributable to drug misuse or abuse has not increased significantly , though there was a 15 percent increase over the past two year s (2008 - 2010). ED visits related to the use of pharmaceuticals with no other drug involvement rose substantially (132 %), as did the use of pharmaceuticals with illicit drugs (139 %), pharmaceuticals with alcohol ( 63%), and pharmaceuticals combined with both illicit drugs and alcohol ( 94%). The increases reflect over 440,000 more ED visits related to pharmaceuticals alone in 2010 compared with 2004, over 145,000 more ED visits related to pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, almost 90,000 more ED visits related to pharmaceuticals and alcohol , and over 40,000 more visits related to all three types of substances.

ILLICIT DRUGS 3.1 ED Visits Involving Illicit Drugs, 2010 For analysis, DAWN groups together ED visits that involve illicit drugs. These substances include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids, of nonmedical substances for their psychoactive properties (e.g., sniffing model airplane glue) are also included.6 Of the approximately 2. 3 million drug misuse or abuse ED visits that occurred during 20 10, a total of 1,171,024 , or just over half , involved illicit drugs (Table 4). A majority (58.8 %) of illicit drug ED visits involved multip le drugs. Overall, 28.8 percent of visits involving illicit drugs also involved alcohol. Cocaine and marijuana were the most commonly involved drugs , with 488,101 ED visits (41.7 %) and 461,028 ED visits (39.4%), respectively. Cocaine and marijuana were followed by h eroin, at 224,706 ED visits, or 19.2 percent , and then by amphetamines /methamphetamine, at 137,947 visits, or 11.8 percent.7 Other illicit drugs involved in ED visits occurred at levels under 5 percent and included the following: PCP, in 53,542 visits ; MDMA visits ; GHB, in 1,787 visits ; ketamine, in 915 visits ; and flunitrazapam (R ohypnol) , in 657 visits. 6 Drugs that DAWN considers to be illicit yet have legitimate medicinal uses include amphetamines; ketamine; and anesthetic gases, such as nitrous oxide (\"laughing gas ). DAWN Field Reporters are careful to distinguish abuse from adverse reactions when classifying visits involving these drugs. 7 Heroin- related ED visits may be slightly underestimated. When drugs related to an ED visit are determined through toxicology tests, heroin metabolites are indistinguishable from other opiates. If there is no evidence in the written record that heroin, specifically, was involved, the visit will be grouped with pharmaceuticals labeled \"unspecified opiate\" and not classified as heroin, an illicit drug. The number of drug misuse or abuse ED visits involving unspecified opiates is estimated at 135,965 visits, and about 60 percent of these ( 78,660 visits) were determined through toxicology testing.

Synthetic cannabinoids, also known as \"Spice\" or \"K2, \" appeared for the first time at reportable levels in DAWN in 2010; they were involved in 11,406 ED visits (1.0% ). While there appears to be a number of different chemical compositions , synthetic cannabinoids are functionally similar DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 31 to 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) , the active ingredient in cannabis.8 Users report effects similar to those produced by marijuana, and regular users may experience withdrawal and addiction symptoms.9 According to the Monitoring the Future survey, almost one in nine, or 11.4 percent , of high school seniors reported using synthetic cannabinoids in 2011.10,11 In 2010, there were 378.5 ED visits that involved illicit drugs for each 100,000 persons in the U.S. population (Table 5) . The highest rates were found for c ocaine involvement (157.8 ED visits per 100,000 population ) and marijuana ( 149.0 visits) (Figure 2). These were followed by heroin (72.6 visits per 100,000 population), amphetamines/methamphetamine (44.6 visits), PCP (17.3 visits), MDMA (Ecstasy) (7.1 visits) , inhal ants (3.7 visits), and synthetic cannabinoids (3.7 visits) . Lower -incidence drugs had rates below 2.0 visits per 100,000 population. Table 6 presents estimates of the number of ED visits in 2010 involving illicit drugs, by sex, age, and race/ethnicity categories. To facilitate comparisons between demographic groups (e.g., compare males to females), Table 7 and Figure 3 present the rates of ED visits per 100,000 population. For most illicit drugs, the rates were higher for males than for females. The commonly found drugs varied by age: 18- to 20 -year -olds had the highest rate of medical emergencies involving marijuana ( 516.2 visits per 100,000 population aged 18 to 20), 25- to 29-year -olds had the highest rates for heroin (186.9 visits per 100,000 population aged 25 to 29) and amphetamines/methamphetamine (124.3 visits), and 35- to 44 -year -olds had the highest rates for cocaine (327.6 visi ts per 100,000 population aged 35 to 44). Considering race/ethnicity, 50.1 percent of patients were White, 30.4 percent were Black, 11.6 percent were Hispanic, 1.1 percent were of other or multiple race/ethnic groups, and 6.8 percent were of unknown race/ethnicity. DAWN does not produce population -based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records. Overall, 40.9 percent of visits involving illicit drugs resulted in some form of follow- up, including admission to the hospital (23.9%), transfer to another health care facility (10.8%), or referral to a drug detox/dependency program (6.3%) (Table 8). Most other patients (48.1%) were treated and released to home, with the remainder (11.0%) experiencing other outcomes. 8 European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA ). (2009).

DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 39 The overall level of ED visits involving illicit drugs was stable between 2004 and 20 08. From 2008 to 2010, though, there was a significant uptick (18% increase). Marijuana involvement has seen a steady increase between 2004 and 2009, with a notable uptick (22% increase) between 2009 and 2010. This rise echoes the increase in the rate of marijuana use between 2007 and 2010 found by the 2010 National Survey of Drug Use and Health ( NSDUH ) (5.8% to 6.9%).12 Amphetamines/methamphetamine involvement declined between 2004 and 2009 but saw a 47 percent increase between 2009 and 2010 that returned this usage to its 2005 level. Looked at separately, however, the ratio of amphetamine s-involved visits to methamphetamine- involved visits is quite different between 200 4 and 2010. In 200 4, there were almost four methamphetamine - involved visits for every amphetamine s-related visit; in 2010, there were fewer than two. MDMA (Ecstasy) involvement also increased gradually between 2004 and 2009 but appeared to stabilize betwee n 2009 and 2010. 12 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

ALCOHOL 4.1 ED Visits Involving Drugs and A lcohol Taken Together , 2010 According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), more than 150 medications have harmful additive or interactive effects when combined with alcohol . The harmful effects of combining drugs with alcohol are heightened by drugs that depress the central nervous system, such as heroin, opiate pain relievers, These drug-alcohol interactions may result in increased risk of illness, injury, and even death. Medications for certain disorders \u2014including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease \u2014also can have harmful interactions with alcohol .13 In 2010 , over 500,000 ED visits involved drugs combined with alcohol (Table 10). This represents nearly a quarter of all ED visits associated with drug misuse or abuse . Table 10.

Pharmaceuticals were involved in over half (55.8%) of such visits. Anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics (drugs to treat insomnia and anxiety ) were involved in 23.1 percent of visits, with the lar gest part of that category being benzodiazepines (19.7 %). Pain relievers were involved in a similar number of visits ( 23.0%), with narcotic pain relievers accounting over number (14.0%).

Above -average levels of alcohol involvement were found for visits involving (40.2%) , marijuana (32.7%). Among visits involving pharmaceuticals, 23.4 percent of visits also involved alcohol . Above -average levels of alcohol involvement were found for visits involving central nervous system stimulants (e.g., benzodiazepines (27.2%). The rate of ED visits involving alcohol was higher for males ( 240.1 visits) than for females (126.7 visits ) (Table 13, Figure 4). By age, the highest rate was found for patients aged 21 to 24 (354.6 visits ). Considering race/ethnicity, 58.8 percent of patients were White , 22.8 percent were Black , 10.7 percent were Hispanic, 1.3 percent were of other or multiple race/ethnic groups , and 6.4 percent were of unknown race/ethnicity. DAWN does not produce population-based rates for race/ethnicity categories because r ace/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records . Just under half ( 46.2%) of patients seen for alcohol -related ED visits received follow- up care: 28.6 percent were admitted to the hospital , 11.7 percent were transferred to another facility , and the balance (5.9%) was referred to detox/ treatment (Table 1 4).

DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 47 4.2 Underage Drinking The use of alcohol by those under the age of 21 is of substantial concern to substance abuse professionals and public health agencies. Alcohol abuse can have many immediate adverse consequences for youth and also lead to dangerous patterns of alcohol abuse in adulthood. Intervention at an early age is critical to preventing these patterns from developing. Intervention during an ED visit may be a n efficient way to identify those youth at higher risk. In 2010, of the nearly 460,000 drug abuse -related ED visits made by patients aged 20 or younger, almost half ( 189,060 , or 45.2 %) involved alcohol (Table 15). Table 15.

Of these ED visits involving underage drinking, 73,716 visits were made by patients aged 12 to 17 , and 114,722 visits were made by patients aged 18 to 20 (Table 16). For both age groups, about two thirds of these visits involved just alcohol, with the remainder involving alcohol taken with other drugs . The rate of medical emergencies involving use of alcohol was 291.0 visits per 100,000 population aged 12 to 17 and 848.7 per 100,000 population aged 18 to 20, almost a threefold difference. The pattern is similar when looking at ED visits for either alcohol alone or alcohol used in combination with other drugs ( Figure 5). 48 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Table 16.

NONMEDICAL USE OF PHARMACEUTICALS 5.1 ED V isits Involving Nonmedical Use of Pharmaceuticals, 20 10 There is growing concern in the public health community about the misuse or abuse of pharmaceuticals. When taken as directed for legitimate medical purposes, pharmaceuticals are usually safe and effective. However, when misused, pharmaceuticals can be just as dangerous and debilitating as illegal drugs .14 Furtherm ore, as documented by the 2010 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), misuse of pharmaceuticals appears to be widespread. In 2010, NSDUH estimated that 7.0 million persons aged 12 or older used prescription -type pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, or sedatives nonmedically in the past month. Initiation rates for nonmedical pain reliever use continue to be second only to marijuana rates, with 2 million or more new nonmedical pain reliever users each year since 2002, including over 500,000 who initiate use without ever having used another illicit drug. The number of persons receiving substance use treatment within the past year for misuse of pain relievers more than doubled between 2002 and 2010, from 199,000 to 406,000. 15 DAWN defines nonmedical use to include misuse or abuse of any therapeutic substance. While use of any illicit drug is assumed to constitute drug abuse, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals must be substantiated in the patient's ED medical records. Evidence supporting nonmedical use includes the following : taking more than the prescribed dose of a prescription drug; taking more than the recommended dose of an over -the-counter pharmaceutical or supplement; takin g a drug prescribed for another individual; taking a drug obtained illegally or without a legitimate prescription; deliberate poisoning with a pharmaceutical by another person; and any use of a prescription drug, an over -the-counter pharmaceutical, or a dietary supplement that ED medical staff document in the patient's medical record as misuse or abuse . Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals may involve a single pharmaceutical , multiple pharmaceuticals, or pharmaceuticals in combination with illicit drugs or alcohol.

This represents about a quarter (23.9%) of all drug-related ED visits and over half (51.0%) of ED visits for drug abuse or misuse. Over half (54.7%) of medical emergencies seen in the ED resulting from nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals involved multiple drugs.17 About one in five (17.4%) of ED visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals also involved alcohol. At 48.3 percent, pain reli evers were the most common type of drugs involved in medical emergencies associated with nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals , with narcotic pa in relievers accounting for 30.7 percent . Specific n arcotic pain relievers seen more commonly wer e oxycodone , hydrocodone , and methadone at 12. , tively.18 , and aspirin \u2014were seen at lower levels of between 1 and 4 percent. Anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics (drugs to treat anxiety and insomnia) were found in 34.0 percent of visits related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. B enzodiazepines (anti -anxiety drugs) were involved in 29.5 percent of ED visits, with al prazolam (e.g., Xanax) indicated in about a third ( 10.6%) of such visits. Among other major categories of drugs, p sychotherapeutic agents (antidepressants and antipsychotics) were involved in 11.2 percent of ED visits related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals . Respiratory agents , cardiovascular agents, muscle relaxants , and anticonvulsants each were involved in about 3 to 5 percent of ED visits. When population size and sampling error are taken into account, visits for nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals did not differ between males and females ( 374.2 and 3 83.9 visits per 100,000 population , respectively ; Table 1 9, Figure 6). The rate of ED visits for patients in age categories 16 DAWN tries to capture only pharmaceuticals that are related to the ED visit and actively discourages reporting of current medications that are unrelated to the visit. Given the limitations of medical record documentat ion, though, it is not always possible to distinguish and exclude current medications that are unrelated to the visit. This limitation may have the effect of overstating the variety of pharmaceuticals involved in ED visits. 17 Multiple drugs may not all be taken for the same reason; a patient may misuse one type of prescription medication while taking another medication as prescribed. To be counted as a DAWN case involving multiple drugs, though, both drugs must be involved as a reason for the ED visit (e.g., the drugs' interaction caused or worsened the medical emergency). 18 ED records frequently do not distinguish methadone used properly for the treatment of opiate addiction (and not specifically related to the ED visit) from nonmedical methadone use ( related to the ED visit). This could result in overreporting the estimated number of ED visits related to methadone, but the extent of the overreporting is unknown. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 53 between 21 and 34 were all over 600 visits per 100,000 population , with lower levels observed for younger and older patients . Table 18.

In terms of race and ethnicity, 71.3 percent of visits related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals involved patients who were White, 12.6 percent were Black, and 8.4 percent were Hispanic. DAWN does not produce population-based rates for race/ethnicity categories because r ace/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records . Some form of follow-up was observed for 37.4 percent of patients whose visits involved nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals (Table 20). Follow- up included admission to the hospital ( 25.5%), transfer to another fa cility (9. 5%), and referral to detox/treatment (2.4%). Of the remainder , 54.0 percent of patients were treated and released to home , and 8.6 percent had other outcomes.

DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 61 Large increases in the number of ED visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals were observed between 2004 and 20 10. It is likely that there are multiple causes contributing to these increases. Some portion may be associated with the greater number of prescriptions being written , making prescription drugs more accessible and able to be diverted. Also, as more people are taking prescription medications as part of their regular health care, there is more risk that drugs taken as prescribed will interact with other drugs that are being used nonmedically. It is beyond the scope of this report to explore the causes behind the growing numbers of ED visits involving misuse or abuse of pharmaceuticals, and further research is needed. Medical emergencies related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals increased 119 percent in the period from 2004 to 2010, rising from about a half million visits (535,449 visits) to over one million visits ( 1,173,654 visits). Contributing to this rise were s ignificant long-term increases in the number of visits involving narcotic pain relievers, which increased 149 percent, or 215,271 visits, beyond its 2004 level of 144,6 50 visits. ED visits for narcotic pain relievers that more than doubled during this period were fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, -like opiate agonist used for moderate to severe pain, increased 235 percent, reaching 16,251 visits in 2010. Between 2004 and 2010, the number of visits involving drugs for anxiety and insomnia increased 125 percent overall\u2014a jump of more than 221,000 visits over the 2004 level of 177,394 visits . Benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam) have shown a regular upward trend, with 202,145 more visits in 2010 than in 2004 . Visits involving zolpidem (e.g., Ambien), a sleeping aid with benzodiazepine -like properties, increased 1 50 percent , reaching 31,994 visits in 2010. Muscle relaxants (e.g., carisprodol, cyclobenzaprine) increase d 107 percent, reaching 53, 708 visits in 2010. One of the drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), amphetamine -dextroamphetamine (e.g., Adderall ), saw a 392 percent increase between 2004 and 2010 for a total of 11,327 visits in 2010 . A 59 percent increase was seen for visits involving cardiovascular agents for a total of 43,698 visits in 2010. While part of the increase in visits involving cardiovascular agents may signal an increase in their misuse, part may be due to the interaction of cardiovascular agents taken as prescribed with other drugs and therapeutic substances used medically and nonmedically. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 63 6. DRUG -RELATED SUICIDE ATTEMPTS 6.1 ED Visits Involving Drug-Related Suicide Attempt s, 2010 In 200 8, more than 36,000 suicides occurred in the United States , and suicide was the second leading cause of death for adults aged 25 to 34.19 This is the equivalent of 1 suicide every 15 minutes , or 11. 6 suicides per 100,000 population. Substance abuse is strongly associated with suicide attempts . Evidence suggests that one third of those who died by suicide were positive for alcohol at the time of death and that nearly one in five had evidence of opiates.20 Highlighting the relevance of drugs to the overall problem of life-threatening suicide attempts, the Centers for Disease C ontrol and Prevention 's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System estimated that overall there were about 325,000 ED visits in 2008 for suicide attempts by all methods by patients aged 18 or older that resulted in ED visits; f or the same year and age range, DAWN estimated there were about 175,000 ED visits for suicide attempts involving drugs. DAWN data provide a unique window to study life-threatening suicide attempts that involve drugs in respect to the types of drugs involved, the characteristics of the patients, and the follow- up treatments provided . DAWN reports on suicide attempts involving all types of illicit drugs and prescription drugs as well as over -the-counter products and attempts involving alcohol alone for patients aged 20 or younger. DAWN cases are not limited to drug overdoses. Suicide attempts involving firearm s, for example, are included as DAWN cases if drugs are noted as being involved at the time of the suicide attempt.21 DAWN estimated there were 212,736 ED visits resulting from drug -related suicide attempts in 2010 (Table 22). Almost all (94.7%) involved a prescription drug or over -the-counter medication , about two thirds ( 62.6%) involved multiple drugs , and about one quarter (25.3%) involved alcoho l. About a fifth (17.6 %) involved illicit drugs. Marijuana and cocaine were the more commonly involved illicit drugs , appearing in 8.1 and 7.4 percent of visits, respectively. 19 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC).

Pharmaceuticals were much more common than illicit drugs i n suicide attempts : Pain relievers were found to be involved in 37.1 percent of drug-relate d suicide attempts . Narcotic pain relievers accounted for almost half that number (15.5%) , and acetaminophen products accounted for about a third ( 13.5%). Benzodiazepines (anti -anxiety drugs) were found to be involved in 28.4 percent of drug- related suicide attempts. Alprazolam (e.g., Xanax) and clonazepam (e.g., Klonopin) each accounted about a third (10.6% and 9. 4%, respectively). Antidepressants appear ed in 19. 9 percent of visits . About half (10.5%) of those visits involved SSRI antidepressants as Desyr accounted for about a quarter (5.1%). 66 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Antipsychotics, as a whole, appeared in 13.5 percent of visits. At 11.0 percent, the newer types of atypical antipsychotics accounted for most of those visits. Quetiapine (e.g., Seroquel \u00ae) was the most common atypical antipsychotic (6.5 %). After population size and sampling error are taken into account, the rate of drug-related suicide - attempt visits for females ( 80.8 visits per 100,000 population) was higher than that for males (56.3 visits per 100,000) (Table 23, Figure 7). In respect to age, rates ranged from 13.4 visits per 100,0 00 population for those aged 65 or older to 160.1 visits for those aged 18 to 20. Considering race/ethnicity, 63.6 percent of the suicide attempts involved patients who were White, 15.8 percent were Black, 11.1 percent were Hispanic, 2.6 percent were of other or multiple race/ethnic groups, and 6.9 percent were of unknown race/ethnicity. DAWN does not produce population -based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records. Overall, 77.8 percent of patients attempting drug -related suicide had some form of follow- up. About half ( 49.9%) were admitted for inpatient hospital care (17.9% were admitted to an intensive or critical care unit [ICU], 12.7 % went to a psychiatric unit, and 19.1% went to other units ); a quarter (24.8 %) were transferred to another health care facility; and 3.0 percent were discharged with a referral to detox/treatment (Table 24). The remainder of patients were either treated and discharged to home (16.0%) or had other outcomes (6.2%). DAWN only records death as the outcome if the patient died in the ED after admission. DAWN does not record deaths for patients who died prior to admission to the ED or after admission to inpatient units of the hospital or transfer to another facility . Therefore, death as an ED disposition is rarely observed by DAWN. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 67 Table 23.

DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 69 6.2 Trends in ED Visits Involving Drug-Related Suicide Attempts, 2004- 2010 This section presents the trends in the estimates of drug-related ED visits involving suicide attempts for the period from 2004 through 20 10. Differences between years are presented in terms of the percentage increase or decrease in visits in 20 10 compared with the estimates for 2004 (long -term trends) and for 200 8 and 200 9 (short -term trends). Only statistically significant changes are discussed and displayed in the tables. With 212,736 visits in 20 10, the number of drug -related suicide attempts has been stable from 2004 to 2010 (Table 2 5). There have been changes , however, in the types of drugs involved. A 95 percent rise in involvement of narcotic pain relievers occurred between 2004 and 2010. Hydroc odone (e.g., Vicodin) and oxycodone (e.g., OxyContin) increased 83 percent and 147 percent, respectively. A large rise (53%) was also observed between 2004 and 2010 for drugs used to treat anxiety and insomnia. Benzodiazepine involvement in general rose 63 percent, with large increases observed for each of the following drugs: alprazolam (e.g., Ambien). 70 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Table 25.

SEEKING DETOX SERVIC ES 7.1 ED V isits Involving Seeking Detox Services, 2010 The category of visits referred to as \"seeking detox \" includes nonemergency requests for admission for detoxification and visits to obtain medical clearance before entry to a detox progra m as well as acute emergencies in which an individual is experiencing withdrawal symptoms and seeking detox.22 Because detox may be sought through other avenues (e.g., direct admission to a hospital, services provided through private clinics, entry into programs outside the community), the overall demand for detox services is most likely higher than suggested by DAWN estimates . DAWN estimates that there were 232,542 drug-related ED visits for patients seeking detox or substance abuse treatment services during 2009 (Table 2 6). Visits for almost three quarters (67.8%) of patients seeking detox involved multiple drugs. On average, 29.8 percent of visits associated with seeking detox involved alcohol. 23 Cocaine was observed in 27.6 percent of visits, heroin in 26.7 percent, marijuana in 18.5 percent, and amphetamines/methamphetamine in 5.9 percent. Other illicit drugs were seen at lower levels. Among pharmaceuticals, narcotic pain relievers were observed in 45.4 percent of visits, including oxycodone at 28.8 percent. Benzodiazepines (anti -anxiety drugs) were observed in 23.1 percent of visits, with alprazolam (e.g., Xanax) at 12.2 percent and clonazepam (e.g., Klonopin) at 2.8 percent. When population size and sampling error are taken into account, the rate of seeking detox visits for males ( 99.2 per 100,000 population) was higher than that for females (51.9 per 100,000 population) (Table 27, Figure 8). Rates of seeking detox visits were over 100 visits per 100,000 population for those aged 18 to 44, peaking at 2 06.7 for those aged 21 to 24. In terms of race/ethnicity, the majority (76.8%) of seeking detox v isits involved patients who were White, and 14.3 percent were Black. DAWN does not produce population -based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information is often missing in ED records. Nearly 60 percent (58.1%) of ED patients classified as seeking detox obtained some follow- up: 32.2 percent were admitted to the hospital, 17.3 percent were referred to detox /treatment services, and 8.6 percent were transferred to another facility (Table 28). The plurality of those admitted to the hospital were sent to the chemical dependency/detox unit. The remaining patients were treated and discharged home (3 1.1%) or had other outcomes. 22 Some detox programs, in the hospital or the community, require medical clearance before a person can be admitted to a program. Medical clearance establishes whether a person has any special medical needs (e.g., person is diabetic and needs insulin) or is not suitable to mingle with other patients in the program (e.g., person has an infectious disease or is mentally unstable). 23 The role of alcohol may be underrepresented here because, for patients aged 21 and older, DAWN captures alcohol use only when it is combined with the use of other drugs. 74 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Table 26.

While ED visits by patients seeking detox for illicit drugs did not change significantly either in the long t erm or short term, a short -term increase of 22 percent between 2009 and 2010 was observed for pharmaceutical involvement . A major contributor to the increase were pain relievers , which saw a 34 percent increase ; specific ally, oxycodone-related ED visits increased 47 percent between 2009 and 2010.

ADVERSE REACTIONS TO PHARMACEUTICALS 8.1 ED Visits Involving Adverse R eactions to Pharmaceuticals, 20 10 Adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals are a growing problem in the United States. It is likely that there are multiple causes contributing to increases in adverse reactions . Some portion may be associated with the greater number of prescriptions being written and more people taking prescription drugs as part of their medical care. Additionally, people of all ages are increasingly being prescribed multiple drugs simultaneously , which, in turn, increase s the possibility for unintended interactions. This is particularly common among older populations who are placed on long-term medication for chronic conditions, and the number of older persons in the nation is growing. 24 While it is beyond the scope of this report to assess the precise impact of these different causes, DAWN data provide insight concerning the number and characteristics of medical emergencies resulting from the recent use of prescription drugs, over -the-counter pharmaceuticals, or other therapeutic substances used as prescribed or indicated. Included in DAWN are ED visits related to side effects, drug -drug interactions, and drug-alcohol interactions . Visits involving illicit drug abuse, alcohol abuse, or documented misuse of pharmaceuticals are excluded from this grouping. 25 As with all ED visits that DAWN considers to be drug related, the involvement of a drug must be documented in the ED records. If the relationship between a drug and an adverse reaction is not recognized , a visit will not be considered drug related and will not be captured by DAWN. Also, adverse reactions that are identified in different medical settings (e.g., during a visit to the doctor's office or while a patient is already hospitalized ) will not be captured by DAWN. Therefore, the total number of people experiencing adver se drug reactions is greater than reported by DAWN. For 2010, DAWN estimates that 2,329,221 ED visits (Table 30), or 752.8 visits per 100,000 population (Table 31 ), involved adverse reactions to prescription medicines, over -the-counter drugs, or other types of pharmaceuticals. This represents just under half (47.4%) of all drug-related ED visits. About one in five (18.8%) involved multiple drugs. Alcohol was a contributing factor in just 1.3 percent of adverse reaction visits. 24 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). (2011). The DAWN Report: Emergency d epartment visits i nvolving adverse reactions to medications among older adults. Rockville, MD. 25 While adverse reactions are typically limited to pharmaceuticals, a small number involve drugs classified as illicit by DAWN for which there are legitimate medicinal uses (e.g., nitrous oxide when used by a dentist for sedation; cocaine when used as a topical anesthetic for eye surgery). 82 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Table 30.

SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2010. With reference to the specific types of drugs involved, adverse reactions show a very different pattern from nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Whereas nonmedical use clusters around certain types of drugs ( e.g., 30. 7% of nonmedical use visits involve a narcotic pain re liever , with oxycodone being the most commonly involved at 12.5%), adverse reactions involve a wider variety of drugs found at lower level s. For example, narcotic pain relievers accounted for only 8.9 percent of adverse reaction visits , and while oxycodone is still one of the more commonly found narcotic pain relievers, it was involved in just 2.5 percent of visits . Drugs more often involved in adverse reaction visits are therapeutic medications used to treat common medical conditions. For example, anti-infectives (e.g., antibiotics ) were found in 84 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 21.7 percent of adverse reaction visits , cardiovascular agents in 10.4 percent, coagulation modifiers in 7.9 percent, metabolic agents in 7.6 percent , antidiabetic agents in 6.2 percent , and antineoplastics (chemotherapy drugs) in 5.3 percent . Among anti -infectives, penicillins were involved in 5.9 percent of adverse reaction visits, followed by sulfonamides ( e.g., sulfa drugs) at 3.7 percent, quinolones \u00ae) at 3.0 percent, cephalosporins (e.g., at 2.3 percent, and macrolides (e.g., Zithromax \u00ae) at 2.2 percent. Cardiovascular agents appearing most often were angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 2.6 commonly seen were blood thinners , such as coumarins (e.g., Coumadin \u00ae), at 6.5 Insulin was the most common antidiabetic agent . Antidepressants and antipsychotics were observed in 4.4 and 3.6 percent of visits, respectively. Drugs used to treat insomnia and anxiety were evident in 4.4 percent of adverse reaction visits, with benzodiazepines being the most common among those drugs (2.5%). Among non- narcotic pain relievers, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatories (e.g., ibuprofen and naproxen products) were in evidence in 3.4 percent of adverse reaction visits, aspirin in 1.7 percent, and acetaminophen in 1.1 percent . When population size and sampling error were taken into account, women had notably more visits than men ( 909.3 and 590.2 visits per 100,000 population, respectively; Table 3 1, Figure 9). For children aged 5 and under, the rate of ED visits for adverse reaction s was 736.0 visits per 100,000 population. The rate dropped to a low of 231.8 visits for children aged 6 to 11 and then rose consistently to reach a high of 1,678.9 visits for patients aged 65 or older . In terms of race and ethnicity, 65.5 percent of visits related to adverse reaction to pharmaceuticals involved patients who were Wh ite, 14.1 percent were Black, and 10.2 percent were Hispanic. DAWN does not produce population -based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information is often missing from ED records. About three quarters (75.6%) of patients were treated and released (Table 3 2). About a fifth (20.7 %) of patients were admitted to the hospital, and the remainder (3.7%) had other outcomes.

DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 87 8.2 Trends in ED Visits Involving Adverse R eaction to Pharmaceuticals, 2005- 2010 This section presents the trends in the estimates of ED visits involving adverse reactions for the period from 200 5 through 2010 (Table 33). Differences between years are presented in terms of the percentage increase or decrease in visits in 2010 compared with the estimates for 2005 (long - term trends) and for 200 8 and 2010 (short -term trends).26 Only statistically significant chan ges are discussed and displayed in the table. ED visits resulting from adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals increased 86 percent in the period from 2005 to 2010, rising from about 1.3 million visits to over 2.3 million visits . Noteworthy drugs and trends include the following: Anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping aids saw a 108 percent increase since 2005 for a total of 102,125 ED visits in 2010. Zolpidem (e.g., Ambien) saw the largest rate of increase (219%) and a high level of involvement (19,487 visits). With 13,000 to 18,000 visits, other drugs with significant increases included alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam. Antidepressants saw a 119 percent increase for a total of 102,369 ED visits. Anticonvulsants saw an 85 percent increase for a total of 81,954 ED visits. Antidiabetic drugs (e.g., insulin, biguanides, sulfonylureas) saw a n 87 percent increase for a total of 145,530 ED visits. Anti-infectives (e.g., antibiotics) saw a 65 percent increase for a total of 506,119 ED visits. The m ost commonly involved anti -infectives in 2010 were visits). Antibiotics with increasing involvement include sulfonamides , whose involvement rose 133 percent , reaching 85,905 visits. Other anti-infectives experiencing smaller yet significant increases in involvement were amebicides, lincomycin derivatives, and tetracyclines. Antineoplastics (chemotherapy drugs) saw a 157 percent increase for a total of 124,589 ED visits. Antipsychotics saw a 110 percent increase for a total of 84,842 ED visits; atypical antipsychotics \u2014in particular, quetiapine \u2014contributed to that rise. Cardiovascular agents rose 10 8 percent for a total of 2 42,190 visits. Drugs that had significant increases and appeared at higher levels included ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics . Hormone-based drugs saw a 14 8 percent increase for a total of 123,709 ED visits; adrenal cortical steroids (e.g., anti-inflammatory drugs ), sex hormones (e.g., contraceptives), and thyroid hormones were contributors to the rise. Immunological drugs (e.g., bacterial and viral vaccines) saw a 15 7 percent increase for a total of 9 4,537 ED visits. 26 Due to data limitations in 2004, long-term trends for adverse reaction visits are assessed for the period from 2005 through 2010, not 2004 through 2010. 88 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Nutritional products \u2014including minerals and electrolytes products, oral nutritional supplements, and vitamins \u2014saw a 185 percent increase for a total of 76,679 ED vis its. Pain relievers, as a general category, saw a 70 percent increase for a total of 379,260 ED visits. Narcotic pain relievers in general rose 78 percent, with hydrocodone products rising 98 percent and oxycodone products rising 101 percent. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 89 Table 33.

ACCIDENTAL INGESTION OF D RUGS 9.1 ED Visits Involving Accidental Ingestion of D rugs , 2010 To be classified by DAWN as an accidental ingestion ED visit , a drug must have been taken unintentionally or without it being known which drug was actually taken. The drug may be taken by the patient or given to the patient by someone else (e.g., a parent giving medication to a child).27 Because of accidental ingestion's significance as an entirely preventable health risk, this chapter focuses on the characteristics of accidental ingestion ED visits for children aged 5 and under. As soon as infants learn to crawl and especially once they learn to walk, their mobility, curiosity, and tendency to put things in their mouths make many substances in the home a potential danger.28 Pharmac eutical products belonging to other household members present a particularly critical danger to children because, due to their physiology and smaller size, children's unintended ingestions of even small amounts can lead to medical emergencies requiring care in an ED.29 This combination of propensity, accessibility , and susceptibility is evidenced in poison contro l centers, where over half (51.0%) of human exposure calls involve children aged 5 and under and where 14 of the top 25 substances involved in pediatric exposure are drugs and therapeutic substances .30 The danger of accidental ingestion of drugs by children is even more apparent in the 20 10 DAWN findings , where over two thirds ( 67.9%) of the 107,632 accidental ingestion ED visits involved children aged 5 and under. The rate of these ED visits was almost 25 times higher for children aged 5 and under than for adults: 300.2 visits per 100,000 children aged 5 and under compared with 12.7 visits per 100,000 for the general adult population aged 21 or old er (Figure 10). Two- year-olds are at greatest risk , with a rate of 701.1 visits (not shown). DAWN's findings are echoed in Centers for D isease Control and Prevention reports from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). For 2010, NEISS reported a rate of 338.8 drug poisoning injuries treated in an ED per 100,000 population aged 0 to 4, exceeding the rate of injuries related to any other product , including playground equipment .31 27 A visit is not considered as resulting from accidental ingestion if a patient took too much of his or her own medications because he or she forgot having taken a dose earlier. 28 Ma, D.

Rates of ED visits per 100,000 population involving accidental ingestion of pharmaceuticals, by age, 20 10 SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2010. Drugs recognized as being particularly dangerous when accidentally ingested by children include pain medications , such as narcotic pain relievers (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone) ; medications , such as calcium channel blockers (\"heart pills\") and blood pressure medicines (e.g., eye drops (e.g., Clear Eyes \u00ae); and nasal sprays (e.g., Afrin \u00ae).32 Considering only these particularly dangerous drugs, DAWN found the following: Pain relief medication was the most common class of drugs involved in accidental ingestion among chi ldren aged 5 and under , with 28. 0 percent of visits (Table 34). Among pain relievers, acetaminophen products were involved in 10. 5 percent of accidental ingestion visits, narcotic pain relievers in 7.0 percent, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatories (e.g., ibuprofen and naproxen products) in 6. 0 percent, and aspirin products in 2. 6 percent. 32 Eldridge, D.

DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 95 Cardiovascular agents were involved in 13.1 percent of visits. Of these, ACE inhibitors , beta blockers, blood pressure drugs , calcium channel blocking agents, and diuretics each accounted for between 1 and 4 percent of visits . Antidepressants were involved in 6.4 percent of visits , and antipsychotics were involved in 5.3 percent. Antidiabetic medications were found in 2.5 percent of visits. Counts of accidental ingestion of eye drops, nasal sprays, and camphor -containing salves were not observed at reportable levels. Table 34.

Other drugs found at measureable levels included the following: Respiratory agents \u2014e.g., antihistamines, bronchodilators, and a broad range of combination pr oducts used to treat upper respiratory conditions \u2014were found in 11.6 percent of visits. Anxiolytics, sedatives , and hypnotics (drugs to treat insomnia and anxiety) were found in 9.9 percent of visits, with well over half (5. 4%) of those being some type o f benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, clonazepam) and a third (3. 2%) being the anti -allergy drug d iphenhydramine (e.g., Benadryl\u00ae). DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 97 Topical agents were found in 5. 3 percent of visits; these include anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine) that are found in gels for teething pain (e.g., Orajel\u00ae), antihistamines (e.g., calamine lotion), and anti -infectives (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) . Other types of drugs involved in under 5 percent of visits include d nutritional products (e.g., vitamins; 4.3%); anticonvulsants (4.0%) ; central nervous system muscle relaxants (2.1 thyroid medications (1.5%) . A negligible number of visits involved alcohol or illic it drugs. DAWN found no sex differences for accidental ingestion among patients aged 5 and under (Table 35). In terms of race and ethnicity, 63.3 percent of visits related to accidental ingestion of drugs by patients aged 5 and under involved patients who were White, 9.2 percent who were Black, and 14.5 percent who were Hispanic.

DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 99 9.2 Trends in ED Visits Involving Accidental Ingestion of Drugs by Patients Aged 5 and U nder , 2004- 2010 This section presents the trends in the estimates of ED visits involving accidental ingestion of drugs by patients aged 5 and under for the period from 2004 through 2010 (Table 3 7). Differences between years are presented in terms of the percentage increase or decrease in visits in 2010 compared with the estimates for 2004 (long -term trends) and for 200 8 and 200 9 (short -term trends). Only statistically significant changes are discussed and displayed in the table. Medical emergencies related to accidental ingestions by patients aged 5 and under were stable from 2004 to 2010, though increases were observed for particular drug groups. Involvement of pain relievers in general saw a 70 percent increase since 2004 . Antihistamines to treat respiratory conditions rose 162 percent. 100 DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Table 37.

DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES Attachment A Glossary of DAWN Terms, 2010 Update DAWN GLOSSARY, 2010 UPDATE 1 DAWN GLOSSARY, 2010 UPDATE This glossary defines terms used in data collection activities, analyses, and publications associated with the emergency department (ED) component of the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). The glossary is updated to reflect terms and conventions applicable in the 2010 data collection year. Accidental ingestion: This category of drug- related ED visits includes those involving the accidental ingestion of a drug, for example, childhood drug poisonings and individuals who take the wrong medication by mistake. It includes a caregiver administering the wrong medicine by mistake. It does not include a patient taking more medicine than directed because the patient forgot to take it earlier . (See Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, Overmedication. ) Adverse reaction: This category of drug- related ED visits represents the use of a prescription or over-the-counter pharmaceutical for therapeutic purposes that results in an ED visit due to adverse drug reactions, side effects, drug- drug interactions, and drug- alcohol inter actions. Although adverse reactions are typically limited to pharmaceuticals, a small number of adverse reaction visits involve (a) illicit drugs for which there are legitimate pharmaceutical versions , and (b) pharmaceutical inhalants (such as anesthetic gases ). Alcohol use: DAWN notes whether alcohol was involved in addition to other drug(s) for patients of all ages. Because alcohol is considered an illicit drug for minors, alcohol without the involvement of other drugs is considered a drug- related ED vi sit for patients under the age of 21. (See Drug misuse or abuse and Underage drinking .) Case description: A description of how the drug(s) were related to the patient 's ED visit. The case description, in conjunction with other documentation in the ED medic al record, is used to determine whether the ED visit is reportable to DAWN. It is copied verbatim from the patient 's chart when possible. Case type: See Type of case. Case type other: See Drug misuse or abuse. Confidence interval (CI): An interval estimate, that is, a range of values around a point estimate that takes sampling error into account. A broadly accepted standard of confidence is 95 percent. If repeated samples were drawn from the same population of hospitals using the same sampling and data collection procedures, the true population value would fall within the CI 95 percent of the time. A 95 percent CI is a straightforward way to summarizes both the estimate and its margin of error. Diagnosis: The condition(s) for which the patient was treated as determined by the clinician after evaluation. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 2 Disposition: The location or facility to which an ED patient was referred, transferred, or released. Treated and released includes three categories: Discharged home\u2014In this context, \"ho me\" refers to the patient's residence at the time of the ED visit. This could be a personal residence; for students residing at nearby universities, home means their university; for travelers , it may mean their hotel or wherever they are staying. Released to police/jail \u2014Patients that are released to police/jail were usually brought to the ED by the police for treatment of an acute medical problem or for medical clearance before being placed in the jail population. Referred to detox/treatment \u2014The chart indi cates that the patient was referred to a substance abuse treatment or detox program, facility, or provider other than the chemical dependency/detox unit maintained at the hospital. Admitted to this hospital includes five categories of inpatient units: intensive or critical care unit (ICU) , surgical unit, chemical dependency/detox unit, psychiatric unit, and other inpatient units (the inpatient unit was not specified or does not match one of the preceding units). Other disposition includes five categories: Transferred \u2014The patient was transferred to another health care facility. Left against medical advice\u2014The patient left the treatment setting without a physician's approval. Died\u2014The patient died after being admitted to the ED but before being discharged, admitted, or transferred. Other \u2014The discharge status is documented in the patient's chart but does not fit into any of the preceding categories. Not documented\u2014 The patient's discharge status was not documented in the medical chart. Drug: A substance that is (a) used as a medication or in the preparation of medication; (b) an illicit substance that causes addiction, habituation, or a marked change in consciousness; or (c) both. Substances reportable to DAWN include alcohol ; illicit drugs (e.g., club drugs, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids, amphetamines/methamphetamine) ; nonpharmaceutical inhalants ; prescription drugs (e.g., drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , antibiotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticoagulants, beta blockers, birth control pills, hormone replacement, insulin, muscle relaxants, pain relievers, sleeping aids) ; drugs used in treatment of medical conditions (e.g., respiratory therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) ; vaccines ; dietary DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 3 supplements ; vitamins ; and other over -the-counter pharmaceutical products. DAWN publications use the term \"drug\" to refer to any of these substances. Multiple substances can be reported for each DAWN case. Therefore, the total number of drugs exceeds the total number of DAWN cases reported. Drug category: A generic grouping of related pharmaceuticals or other substances reported to DAWN, based on the classification system developed by Multum Information Services, a subsidiary of the Cerner Corporation, and modified for use with DAWN. The Multum Lexicon is available at http://www.multum.com /. In general, the Multum drug categories reflect the therapeutic uses for prescription and over -the-counter pharmaceuticals. Additional clarification is provided for the following drug categories, because these are unique to DAWN: Alcohol alone\u2014DAWN treats alcohol as an illicit drug for minors. Therefore, DAWN collects data on ED visits involving alcohol and no other drugs if the patient is under the age of 21. Alcohol -in-combination\u2014DAWN records whether alcohol was involved in all drug- related ED visits for patients of all ages. Drug misuse or abuse: A group of ED visits defined broadly to include all visits associated with illicit drugs, alcohol use in combination with other drugs, alcohol use alone among those younger than 21 years, and nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. (See also Alcohol use, Illicit drug use, Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, and Underage drinking. ) Drug -related ED visit: This category includes any ED visit related to recent drug use. To be a DAWN case, the ED visit must have involved a drug, either as the direct cause of the visit or as a contributing factor. (See also Single -drug case. ) One patient may make repeated visits to an ED or to several EDs, thus producing a number of visits. The number of unique patients involv ed in the reported drug- related ED visits cannot be estimated because no direct patient identifiers are collected by DAWN. There are some circumstances in which ED visits are not reviewed for DAWN. These include persons who left before being seen by a phy sician, visits for suture removal, and direct admission to the hospital through the ED for women in labor. Estimate: A statistical estimate is the value of a parameter (such as the number of drug -related ED visits) for the universe that is derived by applying sampling weights and other adjustments to data from a sample. Estimates of drug -related ED visits are calculated by applying weights and adjustments to the data provided by the sampled hospitals participating in DAWN. The sampling weights reflect the probability of selection; separate adjustment factors account for nonresponse, data quality, and the known total of ED visits delivered by the universe of eligible hospitals as identified by the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database (A SDB) for the relevant time period. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 4 GHB: Gamma hydroxybutyrate, a hallucinogen and depressant frequently combined with alcohol and other beverages. Also used by bodybuilders to aid in fat reduction and muscle building. For further information, see http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html . Hospital emergency department (ED): An emergency department (ED) (also known as an emergency room) is a medical treatment facility, specializing in acute care of patients who present without prior appointment, either by their own means or by ambulance. EDs are usually found in hospitals or other primary care centers. Only EDs in hospitals that meet DAWN's eligibility criteria may participate in DAWN. For information on drug- related ED visits, DAWN relies exclusively on medical records maintained by EDs. No patients, ED staff, or other records are consulted. DAWN is based on a sample of hospitals; in the cases where there are multiple EDs in a hospital, records from all the EDs are reviewed to identify drug -related cases. (See Universe. ) Illicit drug use: This category of drug- related ED visi ts includes all visits related to the use of illicit or illegal drugs. Illicit drugs include cocaine, heroin, of illicit drugs, and alcohol when used by patients under the age of 21. Additional clarification is provided for the following drug categories: Synthetic cannabinoids \u2014This drug category was introduced in 2010 to reflect the emergence of synthetic cannabinoids in drug- related ED visits. Synthetic cannabinoids are substances that are designed to be chemically similar to the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). (See category includes amphetamines, methamphetamine, and piperazines. These drugs are often combined for analysis because medical records and toxicology tests often fail to distinguish among them, referring to them simply as \"amphetamines.\" The category excludes central nervous system stimulant medications , such as amphetamine- dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate (drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), and products containing caffeine. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 5 Inhalants \u2014This category includes (a) anesthetic gases, and (b) any nonpharmaceutical substance that has psychoactive effects when inhaled, sniffed, or snorted. Excluded from the inhalant categor y are carbon monoxide and nonpharmaceutical inhalants , if the exposure was accidental (e.g., inhaling paint fumes while painting a closet). (a) Anesthetic gases \u2014Anesthetic gases are presumed to have been inhaled. Included i n this category are, for example, nitrous oxide, ether, and chloroform. (b) Nonpharmaceuticals \u2014The route of administration for psychoactive nonpharmaceuticals is not assumed and must be documented in ED records specifically as inhalation. Psychoactive nonpharmaceuticals, when inhaled, fall into three main categories: volatile solvents, nitrites, and chlorofluorohydrocarbons. Examples of substances in each of these three categories include the following: - Volatile solvents \u2014This category of inhalants includes adhesives (model airplane glue, rubber cement, household glue) ; aerosols (spray paint, hairspray, air freshener, deodorant, fabric protector) ; solvents and gases (nail polish remover, paint thinner, correction fluid and thinner, toxic markers, pure toluene, lighter fluid, gasoline, carburetor cleaner, octane booster) ; cleaning agents (dry cleaning fluid, spot remover, degreaser) ; food products (vegetable cooking spray , dessert topping spray such as whipped cream or \"whippets\") ; and gases (butane, propane, helium). - \u2014Freons are an example of this category of inhalants. Combinations not tabulated above (NTA) \u2014This category includes combinations composed of two or more major substances of abuse that are mixed and taken together. For example, \"speedball,\" which usually refers to the combination of heroin and cocaine taken at once, would be classified as a \"Combination NTA,\" whereas heroin and cocaine used separately would be classified separately in the categories heroin and cocaine. Combinations consisting of a major substance of abuse and another substance are classified in the category of the major substance (e.g., heroin with scopolamine is classified as heroin). LSD: d-lysergic acid diethylamide, a hallucinogen usually taken orally. For further information, see http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html . Malicious poisoning: See Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. MDMA: Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a hallucinogen with stimulant effects, usually taken orally. For further information, see http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html . Metropolitan area: An area comprising a relatively large core city or cities and the adjacent geographic areas. Conceptually, these areas are integrated economic and social units with a large DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 6 population center. Unless otherwise noted, DAWN metropolitan areas correspond to Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) based on the 2000 decennial census and updated in 2003. DAWN also prepares estimates for subsections of three of the large MSAs that correspond to MSA Divisions; in a fourth MSA, subsections were established by local users of DAWN data. Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals: Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals includes taking more than the prescribed dose of a prescription pharmaceutical or more than the recommended dose of an over -the-counter pharmaceutical or supplement; taking a pharmaceutical prescribed for another individual; deliberate poisoning with a pharmaceutical by another person; and documented misuse or abuse of a prescription drug, an over -the-counter pharmaceutical, or a dietary supplement. Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals may involve pharmaceuticals alone or pharmaceuticals in combination with illicit drugs or alcohol. Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals includes prescription and over -the-counter pharmaceuticals in ED visits that are of the following types of cases: Overmedication\u2014Patient took too much of his/her prescription medication or over -the- counter medication/dietary supplement. Malicious poisoning\u2014Drug use in which the patient was administered a drug by another person for a malicious purpose (drug- facilitated sexual assault is one type of malicious poisoning, but other types of malicious poisonings, such as product tampering, would be classified in this category as well). Case type other \u2014All drug -related ED visits that could not be assigned to any of the other seven types (by design, most cases of documented drug abuse will fall into this category). (See also Drug misuse or abuse and Type of case. ) Not otherwise specified (NOS): This is the catchall category for substances that are not specifically named but are known to be reportable to DAWN. Terms are classified into an NOS category only when assignment to a more specific category is not possible based on the information in the source documentation (ED patient charts). Not tabulated above (NTA): This designation is used when drugs or drug categories are not explicitly listed in a table. Low -incidence drugs (or drug categories) falling under a broader drug classification may be summarized into a single row under that classification and labeled as NTA. Overmedication: See Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Oversampling: Without oversampling, one would expect a sample to resemble the population from which it was drawn. Oversampling implies the deliberate selection of a much higher proportion of certain types of sampling units than would normally be obtained in a simple, random sample. The deliberate selection of certain types of sample units is done to improve the precision of estimates of the properties of these types of sampling units. This is a form of stratified sampling. (See also Sampling , Sample frame , and Sampling unit .) In DAWN, selected metropolitan areas are oversampled so that estimates can be produced for those areas. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 7 p-value : A measure of the probability ( p) that the difference between two estimates could have occurred by chance, if the estimates being compared were really the same. The larger the p-value, the more likely the difference could have occurred by chance. For example, if the difference between two DAWN estimates has a p-value of 0.05, it means that there is no more than a 5 percent probability that the difference observed could be due to chance alone. PCP: Phencyclidine, a hallucinogenic white crystalline powder that is readily soluble in water or alcohol or may be snorted or smoked. For further information, see http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/infofactsindex.html . Population: See Universe. Precision: The extent to which an estimate agrees with its mean value in repeated sampling. The precision of an estimate is measured inversely by its standard error (SE) or relative standard error (RSE). In DAWN publications, estimates with RSEs greater than 50 percent are regarded as too imprecise to be published. ED table cells where such estimates would have appeared contain the asterisk symbol (*). (See also Relative standard error. ) Race/ethnicity: Race/ethnicity data in DAWN are collected retrospectively from the medical record. This approach involves a single question listing six race/ethnicity groups (plus not documented) and allows for multiple responses . 1 For published reports, DAWN collapses the reported race/ethnicity information into four mutually exclusive categories, plus an unknown category, as follows: White \u2014A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. Those who are identified as White and Hispanic are classified as Hispanic. Black \u2014A person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa. Those who are identified as Black or African American and Hispanic are classified as Hispanic. Hispanic \u2014A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. Those who are identified as Hispanic are classified as Hispanic, regardless of any other race/ethnicity designations. Race/ethnicity not tabulated above\u2014A person who is an American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or a person of two or more race/ethnicities. Unknown\u2014Race/ethnicity is unknown. Race/ethnicity is missing from ED patient records about 10 to 20 percent of the time, although this varies widely by hospital. In some cases, the race information is ambiguous (e.g., \"European\"), and detail about multiple races/ethnicities is often missing. Rates of ED visits per 100,000 are not calculated for race/ethnicity categories because of these data limitations. 1 See Office of Management and Budget, Revisions to the standards for the classification of Federal data on race and ethnicity, 62 Fed. Reg. 58,782 (October 30, 1997). DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 8 Rate: A measure of the incidence of drug- related ED visits per 100,000 population. A rate can be calculated for the total population or for any subset defined by characteristics such as age and sex. Relative standard error (RSE): A measure of an estimate's relative precision. The RSE of an estimate is equal to the estimate's standard error (SE) divided by the estimate itself. For example, an estimate of 2,000 cocaine visits with an SE of 200 visits has an RSE of 0.1 and is multiplied by 100 to change it to a percentage. This resulting RSE percent value is 10 percent. The larger the RSE, the less precise the estimate. Estimates with an RSE of 50 percent or greater are not published by D AWN. (Se e also Precision .) Sample frame: A list of units from which a sample is drawn. In DAWN, the hospital is the unit used for the ED sample. All members of the sampling frame have a known probability of being selected. A sampling frame is constructed such that there is no duplication and each unit is identifiable. Ideally, the sampling frame and the universe are the same. The sampling frame for the DAWN hospital ED sample is derived from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database (ASDB). (S ee also Universe. ) Sampling: Sampling is the process of selecting a proper subset of elements from the full population so that the subset can be used to make inference to the population as a whole. A probability sample is one in which each element has a known and positive chance (probability) of selection. A simple random sample is one in which each member has the same chance of selection. In DAWN, a sample of hospitals is selected to make inference to all hospitals; DAWN uses simple random sampling within strata. Sampling unit: A member of a sample selected from a sampling frame. For the DAWN sample, the units are hospitals, and data are collected for drug- related ED visits at the responding hospitals selected for the sample. Sampling weights: Numeric coefficients used to derive population estimates from a sample by adjusting for deviations from the original sample design due to unequal probability sampling, variable nonresponse, and other potential sources of bias. Seeking detox: This category of drug- related ED visits reflects patients seeking substance abuse treatment, drug rehabilitation, or medical clearance for admission to a drug treatment or detoxification unit. They are classified separately because they often reflect administrative practices that vary across hospitals and ma y vary over time within the same hospital. Seeking detox visits tend to be concentrated in those facilities that operate specialized inpatient units providing substance abuse treatment or detoxification services, and the largest numbers are found in facili ties that require medical clearance for entry into such treatment to be granted in their EDs. Single -drug case: An ED visit in which only one drug was involved. The single drug may be the direct cause of the visit or a contributing factor as determined by the medical evaluation done in the ED. Because DAWN considers alcohol to be an illicit drug for minors, DAWN includes visits where alcohol is the single drug if the patient is younger than 21 years of age. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 9 Statistically significant: A difference between two estimates is said to be statistically significant if the value of the statistic used to test the difference is larger or smaller than would be expected by chance alone. For DAWN ED estimates, a difference is considered statistically significant if the p-value is less than 0.05. (See also p-value .) Strata (plural), stratum (singular): Subgroups of a universe within which separate ED samples are drawn. Stratification is used to increase the precision of estimates for a given sample size or, conversely, to reduce the sample size required to achieve the desired level of precision. The DAWN ED sample is stratified into metropolitan area cells plus an additional cell for the remainder of the United States. To ensure thorough coverage within metropolitan areas, the universe of hospitals in each is allocated into substrata identified by ( a) two types of hospital ownership (public, private) , and ( b) up to four size categories (measured in terms of the number of ED visits annually). This allocation creates up to eight substrata in each metropolitan area stratum. Hospitals in the stratum that covers the rest of the United States are stratified first by census region, type of ownership, and size (also measured in terms of ED visits). A systematic sample is selected fr om each of the geographic strata. Suicide attempt: This type of drug- related ED visit captures suicide attempts that are documented in the medical record and in which a drug was involved. Suicidal gestures, thoughts, or ideation, including attempts to harm oneself, are not included in this category. Synthetic cannabinoids: Synthetic cannabinoids are substances that are designed to be chemically similar to the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). They were initially developed over the past 40 years as therapeutic agents but more recently have been packaged as herbal smoking mixtures or \"herbal incense\" and marketed with claims that their effects mimic those of marijuana. Even though certain synthetic cannabinoids and/or specific chemicals contained in these preparations were made illegal in some states, a comprehensive national ban was not enacted until July 2012. Therefore, products containing synthetic cannabinoids were frequently marketed as \"legal\" and \"not for human consumption\" and could be purchased online and in legal retail outlets such as convenience stores. Leading brands were marketed under the names \"Spice\" and \"K2, \" but many other brands appeared later; these are specified in the DAWN Drug Reference Vocabulary. For further information, see http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/spice -synthetic-marijuana. (See also Illicit drug use .) Type of case: A classification used to define similar DAWN cases for analysis. Each case must be assigned a type and may not be assigned more than one type. Cases are classified into one of the following eight categories: suicide attempt, seeking detox, alcohol only (age younger than 21), adverse reaction, overmedication, malicious poisoning, accidental ingestion, and other. The case is coded into the first group that meets the inclusion criteria for that group. Underage drinking: An ED visit where the patient is under the age of 21 and alcohol is involved. Because DAWN considers alcohol to be an illicit drug for minors, DAWN includes visits where alcohol is the only drug involved and visits where alcohol is present with other drugs. DAWN, 2010: NATIONAL ED ESTIMATES 10 Universe: The entire set of units for which generalizations are drawn. The universe for the DAWN ED sample is all non -Federal, short -stay, general medical and surgical hospitals in the United States that operate one or more EDs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Specialty hospitals, hospital units of institutions, long -term care facilities, pediatric hospitals, hospitals operating part -time EDs, and hospitals operated by the Veterans Health Administration and the Indian Health Service are excluded.

An understanding of the methodology behind the collection and processing of DAWN data allows data users to better evaluate the validity, representativeness, and meaning of the findings. The methods described here were initiated in 2004 and are current as of 2010. Comparisons across data collection years can only be made for 2004 -2010. Due to changes in troduced to core sur vey features \u2014such as the design of the sample, protocol for selecting char ts to review, and the eligibility criteria for being a DAWN case in 2004 \u2014DAWN data for 2004 and forward are not comparable to data for earlier years (2003 and earlier). This report is organized into eight parts: 1. Summary of DAWN Methodology, 2010 Update \u2014Methodological highlights of the 2010 data collection year. 2. Overview of the DAWN data program \u2014Brief summary of DAWN and its purpose. 3. Information collected by DAWN \u2014What constitutes a drug-related ED visit and the data items collected for each visit . 4. Development of the ED component of DAWN \u2014How DAWN data on drug-related ED visits are collected and processed to make representative national and metropolitan area estimates using survey data . 5. DAWN publications and data dissemination \u2014How DAWN data are organized, summarized, and presented to address different statistical and analytic goals . 6. Quality assurance/quality control \u2014Methods and procedures used to ensure that DAWN data are as accurate, precise, and reliable as possible . 7. Data limitations \u2014DAWN collects data on ED visits from a sample of hospitals and relies solely on existing medical records maintained by the se hospitals; as a result, there are some limitations to consider when interpreting results . 8. History of DAWN , 1970- 2011 \u2014How DAWN came into existence and has been maintained for 40 years . For convenience, the 2010 DAWN ED Annual Report includes as attachments all methodological documents related to the 2010 data collection year. Th ese attachments include the following : DAWN Glossary, 2010 Update , DAWN Methodology Report 2010 Update (this report) , Guide to DAWN Trend Tables, 2010 Update (including link to 2010 Trend Tables), and 2007- 2011 ED Reference Guide (instructions for DAWN Field Reporters) . 8 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE These items individually as well as additional information about DAWN are provided on the DAWN Web site.1 Available at the site are annual reports for 2004 through 2010 that summarize overall DAWN ED findings; short reports that highlight DAWN findings on specialized topics for the nation and select metropolitan areas; detailed tables of DAWN estimates f or the Nation and select metropolitan areas for the years 2004 through 2010 ; additional, more detailed methodology and design reports; background information on SAMHSA, CBHSQ, and the contractors responsible for DAWN data collection and analysis; Multum Lexicon Licens ing Agreement (terms for use of the Multum Lexicon , \u00a9 2011 ); Details on the Drug Reference Vocabular y (DRV, drug name coding system used by DAWN); and links to other materials on the SAMHSA Web site . 1 DAWN documents can be found on the DAWN Web site (http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx ). DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT , 2010 UPDATE 9 1. SUMMARY OF DAWN METHODOLOGY, 2010 UPDATE This section documents the participation of sampled hospitals in 2010 and other survey methodology information relevant for the Drug Abuse Warning Network ( DAWN) data collection year 2010. Additional detail on the basic DAWN data collection and survey methodology is provided in subsequent sections. 1.1 2010 hospital participation and response rates DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Fed eral, short -stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24 -hour emergency department (ED). For data collection year 2010, data were collected from a representative sample of hospitals in the Nation and selec t metropolitan areas. Data submitted by 237 participating hospitals were used for estimation . 2 About 7.2 million ED visit charts out of a universe of 11.6 million charts at participating hospitals were reviewed, and a total of 304,110 drug -related ED visits w as identified for use in estimation ( Table 1 ). With about 62 percent of all charts reviewed, the average number of drug - related cases per hospital was 1,104 visits , with a median of 957 visits and a range of 21 to 6,797 visits.3 Estimates for the entire universe of DAWN- eligible hospitals in the United States are produced by applying poststratified weights to the data received from the participating sampled hospitals. Thus, for 2010, a total of 304,110 submitted cases was extrapolated to an estima te of 4,916,328 drug - related ED visits. Considering the margin of error, this estimate may range from 4, 520,835 to 5,311,821 drug-related ED visits out of approximately 125 million total ED visits estimated for the United States. Of these approximately 5 million drug-related visits, 2,301,050 were considered to involve drug misuse or abuse, with the balance involving adverse reactions and accidental ingestions. 2 Not all hospitals participating in DAWN are part of the current sample. These hospitals' data are provided to them for local use. Therefore, the number of drug-related ED visits used in estimation is smaller than the total number identified. 3 DAWN draws a systematic sample of eligible charts to review. 10 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE Table 1 .

DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 11 Table 2 lists hospital, design, and visit response rates for the Nation and the 1 2 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that had sufficient participation in 2010 to warrant separate estimates .4 The national hospital response rate was 42.6 percent; the design weight response rate was 29.6 percent ; and the visits weighted response rate was 34.2 percent . At the metropolitan area level, the hospital response rate ranged from 31.8 percent to 86.4 percent ; the design weight response rate ranged from 3 3.3 percent to 86.4 percent ; and the visit weighted response rate ranged from 21.0 percent to 92.2 percent . 4 In 2010, data for Houston MSA were considered of sufficient quality to support separate estimates for the purpose of weighting but not publication. Therefore, there are 12 MSAs included in the weighting process but only 11 sets of published estimates at the MSA level. 12 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE Table 2.

SOURCE: Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, SAMHSA, Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2010. 1.2 Determination of sample size for response rate calculation In 2010, the initial DAWN sample included 1,279 hospitals divided among 48 metropolitan areas, 9 submetropolitan areas, and 1 area representing hospitals located outside those metropolitan DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 13 areas. Response rates and nonresponse bias were assessed to determine which of these areas had sufficient participation to warrant separate estimates. In 2010, a total of 1 2 areas (9 metropolitan areas and 3 submetropolitan areas) was determined to be able to support separate estimates. Oversampled hospitals in the areas that could not support separate estimates were treated as if they were not sampled. For 2010, this has the effect of reducing the sample from 1,279 hospitals to 556 hospitals, the number used for purposes of computing the overall response rates. 1.3 Population estimates Population estimates used to generate rates (visits per 100,000 population) for 2010 are provided in Table 3. Table 3 . U.S. po pulation, by age and sex, 2010 Age Total United States Males Females Total 40,453,356 17,456,775 22,996,581 SOURCE : U.S. Census Bureau, United States Resident Population Estimates by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin (Vintage 2010) . 1.4 Analytic groups DAWN produces e stimates of ED visits for different types of visits, referred to as DAWN analytic groups . The analytic groups are defined by the reason for the visit and the types of drugs involved (see Section 5.1). Unlike the type of case categories, DAWN analytic groups are not mutually exclusive. For example, a visit that involves cocaine and oxycodone will be counted in both the illicits analytic group and the nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals analytic group. 14 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE The total number of ED visits for the s even analytic groups related to drug misuse or abuse are as follows : ED visits resulting from medical emergencies involving drug misuse or abuse - 2,301,050 visits: - ED visits involving illicit drugs - 1,171,024 visits ; - ED visits involving use of alcohol in combination with other drugs - 564,796 visits ; - ED visits involving underage drinking - 189,060 visits ; - ED visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals - 1,173,654 visits ; - ED visits resulting from drug -related suicide attempts - 212,736 visits ; and - ED visits for the purpose of seeking detox services - 232,542 visits . Estimates for ED visits related to adverse reactions to and accidental ingestions of pharmaceuticals, medications, and other health -related products available over the counter are also produced. These groups are not related to drug abuse or misuse and are as follows: ED visits resulting from an adverse reaction to a drug - 2,273,844 visits ; and ED visits resulting from accidental ingestion of a drug - 106,041 visits (of these, 72,839 visits were by patients aged 5 and under ). DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT , 2010 UPDATE 15 2. OVERVIEW OF DAWN DAT A PROGRAM 2.1 Overview of DAWN DAWN is a public health surveillance system that reports on drug-related visits to hospital EDs.5 DAWN is used to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse , identify the emergence of new substances and drug combinations , assess health hazards associated with drug use and abuse , and estimate the impact of drug use, misuse, and abuse on the Nation's health care system. 2.2 Hospitals eligible to participate in DAWN DAWN 's target sample frame consists of all non -Federal, short -stay, general medical and surgi cal hospitals in the United States that have one or more EDs open 24 hours a day. DAWN employs a multistage sampling design for the selection of EDs for analysis. Stratified simple random sampling with oversampling in selected metropolitan areas is used to select the hospitals. 2.3 ED visits eligible for inclusion in DAWN A DAWN case is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN cases are identified through the review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. These criteria encompass all types of drug -related events, including accidental ingestion and adverse reaction, as well as drug misuse or abuse . Within each hospital, 50 percent to 100 percent of the days of the month are systematica lly selected , and a census of ED visits is selected for review for these days. 2.4 Drugs reported for DAWN ED visits DAWN collects data on all types of drugs \u2014illega l drugs, prescription and over -the-counter medications, dietary supplements, and both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical inhalants. DAWN notes whether alcohol is involved in addition to drug(s) for patients of all ages. Because alcohol is considered an illicit drug for minors, alcohol abuse without the involvement of other drugs is considered a drug -related ED visit for patients under the age of 21. DAWN does not report current medications (i.e., medications and pharmaceuticals taken regularly by the patient as prescribed or indicated) that are deemed by the ED medical staff to be unrelated to the ED visit. DAWN classifies drugs using a modified version of the Multum Lexicon , \u00a9 2011, a drug vocabulary and classification tool originated by Multum Informati on Services, Inc . DAWN has adapted the Lexicon to allow for the inclusion of illegal drug s, inhalants, and alternative medicines that are reported to DAWN. 5 Drug-related visits are defined by DAWN as any ED visit related to recent drug use. Additional detail on DAWN's definition of drug-related visits is provided in Section 3.2. 16 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 2.5 DAWN estimates of ED visits Annually, DAWN produces estimates of drug -related visits to hospital EDs for the Nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas. DAWN Trend Tables contain weighted estimates of drug-related ED visits that are the result of drug misuse or abuse, adverse reactions to drugs , and accidental ingestion of drugs. Among visit s resulting from drug misuse or abuse, separate estimates are made of visits involving illicit drugs, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals , and alcohol. Estimates are also made of ED visits resulting from drug-related suicide attempts, ED visits made by patien ts seeking detoxification services, and visits involving alcohol (with or without other drugs) for patients under the age of 21. For each of these types of visits, estimates are available by patient sex , age group, and race/ethnicity . Estimates are also provided for each visit's disposition (e.g., treated and released, admitted to the hospital intensive or critical care unit [ICU] , died) . Estimates are made of the different types of drugs involved in each of these categories of visits. These sets of estimates are prepared for the Nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas where hospital participation was high enough to produce reliable results. DAWN Trend Tables containing ED estimates are available at the DAWN Web site.6 The document Guide to the DAWN Trend Tables provides guidance on accessing these tables, understanding their content, and locating data items of interest.7 2.6 DAWN public use f iles The DAWN public use file (PUF) containing ED visit -level data is available through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA).8 The SAMHDA site offers a query capacity to build tables online using the DAWN PUF data as well as the means to download data files. The presentation Analyzing the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) Data available at the DAWN Web site provides guidance on accessing, interpreting, and analyzing DAWN PUF data. Additional detailed documentation for the DAWN PUF is also available at the SAMHDA site. The weights needed to produce estimates representative of the Nation and select metropolitan areas are provided in the DAWN PUF. A lengthier description of SAMHDA 's services is provided in Section 5.9 of this document. 2.7 Uses of DAWN data DAWN is a major component of the Nation 's capacity to monitor trends in the morbidity and mortality associated with drug misuse and abuse. DAWN is the only national data system providing estimates of the number of ED admissions associated with drug misuse and abuse and the particular drugs involved both for the United States as a whole and also for selected metropolitan areas. Additionally, DAWN is the only national data collection system on drug abuse 6 DAWN documents can be found on the DAWN Web site at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx . 7 Guide t o the DAWN Trend Tables is available as an attachment to the DAWN ED Annual Reports and as a freestanding document at the DAWN Web site. 8 DAWN data can be found on the SAMHDA Web site at http://w ww.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/ . DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 17 with the capacity to monitor specific and relatively infrequently used substances of abuse ( e.g., club drugs, phencyclidine [ PCP] , or medications used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] ) as they emerge and diffuse across population groups and geographic areas. Within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA), DAWN data help SAMHSA to target program resources to areas of greatest need and to assess program impact. For example, as part of its intervention programming, SAMHSA uses DAWN data to monitor adverse events associated with buprenorphine treatment for opiate addiction. Additionally, DAWN data are used by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality ( CBHSQ) to prepare reports on topics of interest to the public health community, to provide regular updates to SAMHSA and other federal agencies on trends in drug involvement, and to respond to ad hoc inquiries from public health researchers. DAWN estimates are used to monitor trends in major substances of abuse (e.g., heroin, cocaine, marijuana) ; to assess alcohol use by minors that results in ED visits ; to identify emerging new drugs of abuse (e.g., synthetic cannabinoids , \"bath salts\"); and to identify the misuse and abuse potential of prescription and over -the-counter drugs . The DAWN W eb site provides a complete listing of all publicly available reports developed by SAMHSA using DAWN data. Outside of SAMHSA, DAWN is used by national, state, and local health professionals , policymakers, law enforcement officers, and pharmacologists to understand the consequences of drug use and abuse and to identify emerging trends and changing patterns of drug use. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy uses DAWN data to monitor national trends; the Drug Enforcement Administration uses it for surveillance, diversion control, and intelligence; and , at the direction of the Food and Drug Administration, the pharmaceutical industry uses it to conduct post-marketing surveillance of prescription and over -the-counter pharmaceuticals, monitor adverse events associated with medications, and assess the abuse potential that drives labeling and scheduling decisions. State and local professionals, including law enforcement and the Community Epidemiology Work Group, use DAWN to assess changes in local trends and patterns of drug use. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 19 3. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY DAWN 3.1 Approach to DAWN data collection DAWN data are collected through a retrospective review of ED medical records for patients treated in the ED. Patients or families are never interviewed. The review of source records is performed by a trained DAWN Reporter in each member facility. Depending on the needs of the facility, the DAWN Reporter may be an employee of the hospital or an employee of the DAWN operations contractor. For each facility that participates in DAWN, the designated DAWN Reporter reviews all medical records to find ED visits related to drug use. The DAWN Reporter submits an electronic case report to the DAWN system for each ED visit that meets the specific case selection criteria. DAWN Reporters also track, on a copy of the ED registration log, their progress in reviewing the universe of ED visits. Because of the volume in some EDs, a sample of medical records is obtained rather than reviewing a census . This subsampling introduces another component of variance that is accounted for in the weighting and estimation process. 3.2 ED visits eligible for DAWN A DAWN case is any ED visit where the patient was treated in the ED for a condition that was induced by or related to recent drug use. The patient chart is reviewed by the DAWN Reporter to determine if there is evidence that a drug(s) is involved. The patient ED chart has three key areas , and this evidence may come from any one of these areas: patient 's chief complaint; physician 's, nurse' s, and/or other appropriate clinician 's assessment; and/or diagnosis detail. The drug use must be implicated in the ED visit, but it does not need to be the direct cause . The reason a patient used a drug is not a factor in determining whether the ED visit is a DAWN case . Only drugs that are determined to be involved are recorded in the DAWN system. Unrelated drugs that are simply \"on board\" are not recorded. As a result of these criteria and approaches, DAWN includes ED visits associated with substance abuse and misuse, both intentional and acc idental , as well as ED visits related to the use of drugs for legitimate therapeutic purposes and under a doctor 's direction . The DAWN visit eligibility criteria are intended to be broad and inclusive and to have few exceptions. They take into account the fact that documentation in medical records varies in clarity and completeness across hospitals and among clinicians within hospitals. The criteria are designed to minimize the potential for DAWN Reporter judgments that could cause data to vary systematically and unexpectedly across different data collectors and hospitals. In addition, the criteria allow for the capture of a diverse set of drug-related visits that can be aggregated or disaggregated to serve a variety of analytical purposes and the interests of multiple audiences. 20 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE There are a few clearly delineated exceptions to the DAWN eligibility criteria. An ED visit is not a DAWN visit if there is no evidence of recent drug use; the patient left the ED without being treated; the patient consumed a nonpharmaceutical substance but did not inhale it; the patient has a history of drug use but no recent use; alcohol is the only substance involved , and the patient is an adult (aged 21 or older); all the drugs mentioned in the ED record are not related to the ED visit (e.g., list of current medications); drugs identified in toxicology testing are not related to the visit, and the medical record does not contain any additional drug -related information that would make the visit a DAWN case; or the patient is being treated as a consequence of undermedication (i.e., taking too little of a drug). 3.3 Case types in DAWN By design, DAWN 's broad case criteria yield a diverse set of visits. To bring order to this heterogeneous mix of ED visits, DAWN Field Reporters assign each visit to one of eight case types .9 The eight case types are as follows: drug-related suicide attempt ; patient seeking detoxification; alcohol use only, in patients younger than 21 ; adverse reaction; overmedication ; malicious poisoning ( e.g., drug-f acilitated sexual assault, product tampering); accidental ingestion; and other. Each ED visit is assigned to a single case type. Because many ED visits meet the criteria for more than one case type, the case types are assigned based on an algorithm depicted in the DAWN Decision Tree ( Figure 1). Each ED visit is assigned to the first applicable case type. To assist DAWN Reporters with case assignment, a series of questions and decision rules is included with the DAWN Decision Tree; detailed instructions are included in the 2007 -2011 ED Reference Guide. 10 9 DAWN Reporters are responsible for reviewing ED visit records, deciding if a visit is eligible for DAWN, and, if so, recording select data items for the visit. Additional information on collection of DAWN data is provided in Section 3.2. 10 The 2007- 2011 ED Reference Guide is available as an attachment to the DAWN ED Annual Reports and as a freestanding document at the DAWN Web site ( http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx ). DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 21 The final category in the decision tree, Other, is reserved for DAWN visits that do not meet any of the rules for classification into one of the first seven types. Most cases of drug abuse are classified as Other . This approach, which never directly identifies drug abuse, comes from the recognition that medical records frequently lack explicit documentation of substance abuse. This lack of documentation may occur for several reasons. First, the distinctions a mong use, misuse, and abuse are often subjective. Second, if there is a low index of suspicion for drug abuse in some types of patients (e.g., older adults) , ED physicians may be unlikely to label those types of patients as drug abusers. Third, ED staff may be concerned that the patient 's insurance company will disallow coverage if the visit is related to substance abuse. The case type of a visit, in combination with the types of drugs involved, is used to construct groupings of visits that have similar ch aracteristics \u2014for example, visits for drug abuse involving illicit drugs. Section 5.1 provides additional detail s on how visits are grouped for the purpose of analyses. 22 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE Figure 1. Type of case decision tree DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 23 3.4 Key data items Figure 2 depicts the data items collected by DAWN. Additional detail on key items is provided in the following sections. Figure 2. DAWN ED case form 24 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 3.4.1 Patient demographics DAWN collects information on basic patient demographics: sex, age, race/ethnicity, and patient home ZIP code. The ZIP code variable has space to indicate if the patient was homeless, institutionalized, or from outside the United States and, therefore , has no home ZIP code. ED records vary in the level and type of detail provided. Although sex, age, and ZIP code are usually present in patients ' ED records, race/ethnicity is often missing or insufficient (e.g., \"European\"). Although it is possible to record multiple race/ethnicities, for reporting purposes race/ethnicity is collapsed into a single variable with five levels: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic , race/ethnicity not tabulated above, and race/ethnicity undocumented . 3.4.2 Visit characteristics DAWN collects detailed information about each visit. The data items include date and time of visit; type of vi sit (e.g., suicide attempt, seeking detox, adverse reaction); up to 22 drugs or substances for every visit; diagnoses reflecting one or more conditions for which the patient was treated , as determin ed by the clinician after evaluation in the ED; and disposition, or the location or facility to which an ED patient was referred, transferred, or released at the conclusion of the ED visit. DAWN Reporters also provide a brief description of the visit, drawn directly from the ED record, which includes the reason for the visit and any other information necessary to document that the visit is a DAWN case. 3.4.3 Drugs and drug categories For the purpose of DAWN, a drug is any substance that is (a) used as a medication or in the preparation of medication; (b) an illicit substance that causes addiction, habituation, or a marked change in consciousness; or (c) both. Substances reportable to DAWN include illicit drugs (e.g., club drugs, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, stimulants, and alcohol when used by a minor 11), 11 Alcohol use by a minor with no other drug involvement is eligible for DAWN. Alcohol use by an adult must be accompanied by another drug to be eligible for DAWN. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 25 nonpharmac eutical inhalants ,12 prescription drugs (e.g., drugs for ADHD , antibiotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticoagulants, beta blockers, birth control pills, hormone replacement, insulin, muscle relaxants, pain relievers, sleeping aids), drugs used in treatment of medical conditions (e .g., respiratory therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy), vaccines, dietary supplements, vitamins, and other over -the-counter pharmaceutical products. Using the DAWN Drug Reference Vocabulary (DAWN DRV) , DAWN is able to identify more than 3,300 individual drugs (which map to more than 19,000 individual brands and street names). The DAWN DRV is a comprehensive drug vocabulary and classification system based on the Multum Lexicon , \u00a9 2011, that has been modified to meet DAWN 's unique requirements. The DRV includes codes for brand (trade) names , generic names , chemical names , metabolites , nonspecific drug terms , and street terms for legal and illegal substances, including prescription and over -the- counter pharmaceuticals and selected nonpharmaceuticals that are abused by inhalation. DAWN Reporters collect the most specific information about each drug that is available in the ED record. Up to 22 drugs implicated in a visit are assigned a code using the DRV . Because multiple substances can be reported for each DAWN case , the total number of drugs exceeds the total number of DAWN cases reported. The DRV provides the flexibility needed to accommodate the varying level of drug detail provided in ED records. A drug might be record ed in the ED records by its brand name (e.g., OxyContin \u00ae), a generic name (e.g., oxycodone), or by the class to which it belongs (e.g., an unspecified narcotic pain reliever). Each of these has a code in the DRV. Narcotic pain relievers are mapped to the larger grouping \"Opioid/opiate Pain Relievers, \" which is part of the broader category \"Pain Relievers, \" which is one of the categories among \"Central Nervous System Agents. \" Illicit drugs and other DAWN-reportable substances are maintained in a similar tiered structure in the DRV . The Multum Lexicon , \u00a9 2011, is updated every 2 months to incorporate new products and , occasionally , to introduce new drug categories; the DAWN DRV is updated at the same time. In addition, DAWN continually modifies the DRV to include any drugs reported by EDs that are not in the Multum Lexicon (e.g., imported drugs, new combinations of illicit drugs). At the end of each data year, all the drug data received from EDs \u2014the current year 's data and data from all previous years \u2014are coded using the most recent DRV. This process ensures that estimates of visits by drug across years are comparable. 12 To be reportable as an illicit drug, a nonpharmaceutical substance must be intentionally consumed by inhalation, sniffing, or snorting, and it must have a psychoactive effect when inhaled. Carbon monoxide is excluded from the inhalants. Cases involving accidental exposures to inhalants (e.g., exposure to paint fumes while one is painting a closet) are excluded. 26 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE Additional information on the Multum Lexicon , \u00a9 2011, the DAWN DRV, and the Multum Licensing Agreement governing use of the Lexicon can be found on the DAWN Web site .13 Readers interested in exploring the DRV and the manner in which it classifies drugs may obtain the full set of DAWN DRV tables in the relational database named \"DAWN_DRV.mdb.\"14 Queries are used to join tables and display relationships between different drugs and drug groupings. The DRV is also available as a spreadsheet named \"DAWN__Final_Table.xls .\" 3.4.4 Visit disposition The visit disposition records where the patient went after leaving the ED. There are three major categories: treated and released, admitted to this hospital, and other dispositions. Additional detail is provided with subcategories. Treated and released includes three categories: Discharged home \u2014In this context, \"home\" refers to the patient 's personal residence. For students residing at nearby universities, home means their university; for travelers who get sick on the road, it may mean their hotel or wherever they are staying. Released to police/jail \u2014Patients who are released to police/jail were usual ly brought to the ED by the police for treatment of an acute medical problem or for medical clearance before being placed in the jail population. Referred to detox/treatment \u2014The chart indicates that the patient was referred to a substance abuse treatment or detox program, facility, or provider other than the chemical dependency/detox unit maintained at the hospital. Admitted to this hospital includes five categories of inpatient units: intensive or critical care unit (ICU) , surgical unit, chemical dependency/detox unit, psychiatric unit, and other inpatient units. 15 Other disposition includes five categories: Transferred \u2014The patient was transferred to another health care facility. Left against medical advice \u2014The patient left the treatment setting without a physician's approval. 13 DAWN documents can be found on the DAWN Web site (http://www.samhsa.gov/data/dawn/MultumLicenseAgreement.pdf ). 14 These files and DRV documentation are available at the DAWN Web site at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/dawn/DRV/Drug%20Reference%20Vocabulary.zip. 15 This code may be applied if the inpatient unit was not specified or does not match one of the preceding units. Also included herein are \"combo\" units, e.g., a unit that offers both psychiatric and detox services. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 27 Died\u2014 The patient died after being admitted to the ED but before being discharged, admitted, or transferred. Other \u2014The discharge status is documented in the patient 's chart but does not fit into any of the preceding categories. Not documented\u2014The patient 's discharge status was not documented in the medical chart. Visit dispositions may be reported using the three major categories or 13 subcategories , as noted above. A third way of reporting disposition that often appears in DAWN reports and tables groups ED visits based on whether there is any indication in the ED record that the patient received some type of follow -up treatment. \"Evidence of follow-up\" includes patients who were referred to detox/treatment , admitted to the hospital (any unit), or transferred. \"No evidence of follow- up\" includes patients with any other disposition. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 29 4. DEVELOPMENT OF THE ED COMPONENT OF DAWN 4.1 DAWN ED sample design overview The statistical and methodological design of the current DAWN system was introduced in data collection year 2004 . A new stratified simple random sampl e of hospitals was drawn at that time from among the universe of eligible hospitals in the Nation; oversampling was conducted in selected metropolitan areas.16 For each participating sampled hospital and for each month of the year, days of the month are systematically selected and all ED visits for these days are reviewed for eligibility as DAWN cases. Data collection following the new sampling plan was fully implemented for the first time in the 2004 data collection year, and the original sample of hospitals has been followed longitudinally since then. That is, each year since 2004, new hospitals are given the opportunity to be sampled into the longitudinal panel of hospitals. 4.1.1 Sample frame of hospitals The DAWN sampling frame was built from among all hospitals meeting the DAWN criteria for eligible hospitals (i.e., non-Federal, short -stay, general medical and surgical hospitals in the United States that have one or more EDs open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) that appeared on the 2001 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database (ASDB) .17 A probability sample proportionate to the number of ED visits in each facility was drawn from among eligible hospitals. 4.1.2 Metropolitan areas represented in DAWN Samples were drawn from the initial frame to provide the capability to make estimates for the Nation as well as selected metropolitan areas. The metropolitan areas are referred to as oversampled areas (OS areas) or DAWN metropolitan areas. Two goals guided the selection of the DAWN metropolitan areas. The first was to preserve the ability to represent the 21 areas that had been part of DAWN since its inception. The second was to improve population and geographic coverage beyond the se 21 legacy areas. Accordingly, the design ensured representation of the original 21 legacy areas plus the 5 most populous MSAs in each of the 9 census divisions. Oversamples were selected in a total of 48 MSAs; in 4 of those 48 MSAs, additional oversamples were drawn to allow reporting for subareas within tho se MSAs. Resources available to DAWN have allowed for data collection in only a portion of the OS areas. 16 The redesign of the DAWN ED component is described in detail in DAWN: Development of a New Design, which is available at the DAWN Web site ( http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx ). 17 The 24-hour status of hospitals is not contained on the AHA file and is determined by contacting otherwise eligible hospitals directly. 30 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT , 2010 UPDATE 4.1.3 Metropolitan- level stratification The DAWN sample design was conceived to provide the statistical infrastructure to produc e reliable and representative estimates for the Nation and a portion of DAWN metropolitan areas (OS areas), depending on available resources and interest. To accomplish this objective, a subset of the hospitals within each OS area was identified a priori as having a dual purpose in estimation. Referred to as dual -purpose hospitals, these designated hospitals can contribute either to an estimate for the OS area in which they are located or to the estimate for the remainder area outside of OS areas. Dual -purpose hospitals carry two probabilities of selection (POS) and two stratum identifiers. One POS/stratum is associated with membership in an OS area oversample, and the other is associated with membership in the remainder area sample. 18 Each data year , the response rates and nonresponse patterns for each OS area are reviewed to determine data quality. Those OS areas with acceptable data quality are allowed to stand on their own as the basis for separate estimates; they are referred to as stand -alone OS areas. If it is determined on the basis of response rates and bias analyses that an OS area cannot stand alone, the design provides that the OS area is eliminated as a separate area but becomes part of the remainder area. DAWN national -level estimates are the sum of the estimates for stand -alone OS areas plus the remainder area. The formula for the national estimate is where a i is the estimate for stand -alone OS area i, N is the number of stand-alone OS areas, and b is the remainder area estimate inclusive of dual -purpose hospitals in OS areas that do not stand alone. 4.1.4 Hospital size and ownership stratification Sampled hospitals in each of the OS areas were stratified by hospital size (up to four categories, on the basis of the number of ED visits19) and ownership type (public and private). The stratification plan included an additional geographic construct to represent the remainder of the United States outside the OS areas. Hospitals in the remainder area were divided into 24 strata on 18 Hospitals in the four MSAs with submetropolitan area oversampling can have up to three nonzero POS/strata: (1) POS/stratum for membership in the MSA, (2) POS/stratum for membership in the submetropolitan area, and (3) POS/stratum for membership in the remainder area. 19 In DAWN metropolitan areas, size categories were determined independently for each OS area. The number of hospitals determined the unique size categories: fewer than four hospitals were placed in one size category; four to seven hospitals were placed in two size categories; and eight or more hospitals were placed in four size categories. Areas outside of DAWN metropolitan areas were organized into three size categories. b a 1 ii+ =N DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 31 the basis of four regio ns (Northeast, South, Midwest, West), three size categories, and ownership type. 4.1.5 Sample size and sample allocation Each hospital in the DAWN sample was selected through a random process, which theoretically could have been repeated many times, resulting in many hypothetical samples. Sampling variance, or the margin of error, refers to the extent to which these samples were likely to have varied . Two measures of this variability are the standard error (SE) and the relative standard error (RSE), which is defined as the SE of the estimate divided by the estimate itself. The precision of an estimate is inversely related to the sampling variance, as measured by the RSE. The greater the RSE value, the lower the precision. DAWN is designed to have estimates for major drug categories (i.e., all drug-related ED visits plus ED visits for cocaine , heroin, and marijuana) , wherein the RSEs are less than or equal to 10 percent for metropolitan area estimates and less than or equal to 15 percent for national estimates . Sample sizes for each metropolitan area and the Nation were set using these targeted precision level s in combination with the theory of optimal allocation for stratified samples. 4.2 Data collection procedures This section documents the methodologies used to collect DAWN data. The DAWN operations contractor (DOC) is responsible for collecting DAWN data. Additional detail on data collection methodology is available in the 2007 -2011 ED Reference Guide . 20 4.2.1 Review of ED medical records DAWN ED data are collected directly from the medical records of patients treated in the ED. The review is done after the ED visit is completed. Patients , their families , and clinical staff are never interviewed. The data are collected by trained DAWN Reporters who review ED medical re cords to identify ED visits related to recent drug use. For each DAWN case, an electronic case report is completed ( Figure 2, in Section 3, depicts the data elements collected). Case reports are submitted electronically using the Electronic Hospital Emergency Reporting System (eHERS), a customized system developed specifically for DAWN. DAWN Reporters also submit an activity report detailing their progress in reviewing the ED charts, and they report the monthly census of all ED visits made to the hospital. Data collection is performed on an ongoing basis as soon after the ED visit as possible. The majority of DAWN ED data are collected on site at hospitals by a DAWN Reporter who reviews paper or electronic records. A growing number of hospitals have centralized electronic medical records systems that can be accessed from the outside. In these cases, DAWN Reporters 20 The 2007- 2011 ED Reference Guide is available as an attachment to the DAWN ED Annual Report s and as a freestanding document at the DAWN Web site ( http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx ). 32 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT , 2010 UPDATE access the systems via remote access from the DOC's headquarters. A secured transmission line is maintained for this purpose by the DOC. 4.2.2 Selection of ED medical records The original DAWN redesign protocol called for direct review of all available ED records. After careful review and testing, however, it was established that a sample of ED visits could be used to produce sufficiently precise estimates in comparison to a census of visits provided that the cost savings be redirected toward recruiting additional hospitals. In 2008, a protocol was developed for drawing a systematic sample of each ED's medical records based on the date of the ED v isit. In those EDs with sampling, the DAWN Reporter is sent a list each month of designated dates for chart review, and the charts for all the ED visits occurring on the designated dates are reviewed for drug -related visits. By 2010, sampling of ED records had been introduced in all larger hospitals and many smaller ones. A vast majority of sampled records are reviewed , but there are some instances when they are not. Unintentional gaps in chart review may occur due to such factors as a DAWN Reporter 's unex pected absence or circumstances at the hospital that preclude review of some ED records (e.g., limitations on the hours or days that a DAWN Reporter may access ED records, removal of records from facility ). A similar method of within -hospital visit weighti ng is used to compensate for both intentional sampling of ED records as well as unintentional gaps in record review (see Section 4.4.3). 4.3 Data preparation The DOC performs numerous reviews that begin at the point of entry and continue through the final deli very of the data to SAMHSA. Automated systems check DAWN case data to confirm eligibility of cases submitted and for case type discrepancies. In addition, edit programs are run to identify range and consistency errors. \"Unknown \" drugs entered by the DAWN Reporter are reviewed by CBHSQ; when possible, they are upcoded to extant codes or new drug code s are added to the DRV, when appropriate. At the end of every data collection year, an extensive data review is conducted . Statistical process control (SPC) is used to evaluate the monthly counts of ED visits, charts reviewed, and cases reported for each ED. If any monthly count of visits, charts , or cases is identified as inconsistent by SPC, that count is investigated via communication with contacts from the ED. The results of the investigation are documented and sent along with the final delivery. As a final step, the SPC results and monthly counts for each ED are reviewed by the DOC, the Data Analysis Contractor (DAC), and representatives from CBHSQ . 4.4 ED data a nd statistical processing The DOC prepares the database as described in Section 4.3, at which point the annual data files and the current DRV are transferred to the DAC. The DAC performs a number of data quality and data processing steps to prepare the file for weighting and for developing estimates (see DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 33 Section 4.4.1). Sample maintenance is then performed ( see Section 4.4.2). Weights and adjustments are then developed ( see Section 4.4.3). Section 4.4.4 describes the sequential processing steps for developing and applying weights and adjustments. 4.4.1 ED data processing Because up to 22 drugs may be reported for each visit, the DAC begins its processing by ensuring that no duplicate drugs are recorded for a visit. The DRV, the database that defines how drugs are classified and map ped to drugs , is applied to the microdata received from the DOC to derive drug IDs and the standard drug list (SDL) classification associated with each drug.21 The resulting drug IDs for a visit are compared with one another to ensure that a drug appears only once for a visit.22 After the initial deduplication, codes for mouthwash and alcohol are deduplicated. Last ly, a check is run to ensure there are no cases that involve only alcohol for respondents aged 21 or older. The data are classified originally on a brand level and then are processed to a drug ID level; a final step is to flatten the data file to a visit level . Discrepancies or irregularities are resolved through discussion among the DOC, the DAC, and the DAWN team at CBHSQ. 4.4.2 DAWN sample maintenance As noted above, the initial DAWN sample was selected from a sampling frame created from the 2001 AHA ASDB. Because DAWN is a longitudinal survey, maintenance is conducted every year to ensure that the sample remains representative of the target population of eligible hospitals . Over time , new hospitals will be opened, some will close, some will merge with other hospitals, and some will \"demerge\" to form two or more smaller hospitals. Some hospitals no longer maintain 24-hour EDs and become ineligible; others open them and become eligible. Each year the sampling frame is updated to reflect new, closed, merged, and demerged hospitals on the basis of information in the most current AHA ASDB. Since 2004, a master file has been maintained of the changes to the frame and originally sampled hospitals , plus information on all new frame and sampled hospitals. All variables in the AHA master file are assigned consistent names from year to year , even if there are variable name changes in later AHA ASDBs. Conversely, documentation accompanying the AHA ASDB each year is carefully reviewed to ensure that variables with the same name still mean what they did in earlier years. Newly eligible hospitals identified on the most current ASA ASDB, and confirmed for having a 24-hour ED, are provided the opportunity to be selected into the sample on the basis of the sampling fraction of the stratum in which each newly eligible hospital is located. 21 This version of the annual data is referred to as the \"microdata\" because it includes one record for every brand of drug mentioned in a visit. There are up to 22 records for each visit. 22 Identical drug IDs can result when different brand codes map to the same drug ID. When the duplicate drug ID is removed, the brand code associated with it will be lost because only one brand is retained for each unique drug ID in the visit -level file. The detailed information on all brands is retained in the brand- level file and can be retrieved, if needed. 34 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT , 2010 UPDATE 4.4.3 Weights and adjustments Each year , weights and adjustments are calculated and applied to the collected data to ensure that the survey results represent the target population. Sampling weights are first calculated as the inverse of the probability of selection and then adjusted for variable nonresponse by a procedure known as poststratification, or benchmark adjustment. For steps involving within -hospital adjustments, the processing is carried out at the facility/month level; that is, adjustments are made to data for each month within each facility within each hospital. The derivation of weights to adjust for unequal POS, nonresponse, and other sources of bias is processed at the hospital/stratum/region level. Probabilities of selection. DAWN hospitals are selected using stratified simple random sampling with oversampling in DAWN metropolitan areas. A hospital can have up to three POSs: a remainder -level POS, a division -level POS, and an OS area-level POS (see Section 4.1. 3). Decisions about which POS to use are made after an analysis of response rate and nonresponse bias is conducted for each OS area. Within -hospital weighting adjustment. Charts may be intentionally sampled , or there may be unintentional gaps due to problems in collecting data or obtaining access to records (see Section 4.2.2 ). To compensate for within -hospital nonresponse, the DAWN weighting plan includes a nonresponse adjustment factor for each month of data collection within each facility ; it is equal to the number of ED visits divided by the number of charts reviewed for each of 12 months in the data collection year. The within-hospital weights are applied to the by-month count of visits. That is, the visit counts for a given facility /month are first summed for each drug and then multiplied by the corresponding within -hospi tal adjustment factor for that facility /month. The weighted totals are then summed over all facilities and months to give a total weighted visit count for each drug for each hospital. Weighting adjustment for hospital nonresponse. Hospital -level nonresponse occurs when hospitals fail to provide valid data for at least 3 months of the data collection year. To minimize the impact of hospital nonresponse, the DAWN weighting plan includes nonresponse adjustment factors that are developed and applied within each weighting class. Weighting classes are formed on the basis of the aforementioned sampling stratification schemes. Within each weighting class, the nonresponse adjustment factor is calculated as the sum of the sampled hospital weights divided by the sum of the weights of the responding hospitals. The hospital nonresponse adjustment factors are checked to make sure the adjustments are within reasonable bounds. If a nonresponse adjustment factor is too large, adjacent weighting classes are collapsed , and new nonresponse adjustment factors are calculated. When the hospital -level nonresponse adjustment factors are finalized, a nonresponse -adjusted sampling weight is then calculated as the product of the nonresponse adjustment factor and the sampling weight. For each weighting class, a verification check is conducted to ensure that the DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 35 sum of the nonresponse -adjusted sampling weights is equal to the sum of the sampled hospital weights. Weighting adjustment for population benchmarks (poststratification). The DAWN weighting plan also includes a poststratification adjustment factor that reconciles the weighted number of total visits for responding hospitals with the number of total visits from the most recent AHA ASDB. DAWN use s a ratio adjustment within strata to implement this adjustment. Within each stratum, the adjustment factor is calculated as the ratio of the AHA count of total visits to the weighted sum of total visits for responding hospitals. The factors are verified to ensure they are within reasonable bounds. If they are out of bounds (either too small or too large), adjacent poststratification strata are collapsed , and new poststratification adjustment factors are calculated. When the poststrati fication adjustment factors are finalized, a poststratified weight is then calculated. The final weight is calculated as the product of the poststratification adjustment factor and the nonresponse-adjusted sampling weight. For each poststratification stratum, a validity check is conducted to ensure that the sum of the poststra tified weighted total visits is equal to the corresponding AHA count of total visits from each stratum. Estimates for the entire universe of DAWN- eligible hospitals in the United States are produced by applying poststratified weights to the data received from the sampled hospitals. 4.4.4 Sequential process of developing and applying weights and adjustments The order of processing the weights and adjustments is as follows: 1. Identify the design strata. Variance estimation strata are formed on the same basis as the design strata, where selected strata are collapsed to ensure that there are at least two hospitals in each estimation stratum. 2. Compute hospital-level, design -based weights on the basis of design-based s election probabilities. 3. Apply an initial weight adjustment to correct for minor discrepancies in the selection probabilities. 4. Define variance estimation strata. 5. Define weighting classes that are sufficiently large and internally homogeneous for nonresponse adjustment. These usually are combinations of variance estimation strata. 6. Compute nonresponse adjustments within weighting class. 7. Define poststratification classes (may be similar to nonresponse weighting classes). 8. Compute poststratification adjustment f actors on the basis of reported visits for responding hospitals and poststratum totals from the AHA frame. 9. Prepare an output file with each of the hospital -level weights and weight adjustment factors listed individually for quality control (QC) review. 10. Compute the final case weights. 36 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT , 2010 UPDATE 11. Conduct QC of weights. 12. Perform QC review. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 37 5. DAWN PUBLICATIONS AND DATA DISSEMINATION DAWN issues both regular and ad hoc reports, tables, and related data products. In addition, DAWN PUFs are available on the SAMHDA Web site. This section describes the characteristics of these data products and the standards DAWN uses to compile data, present estimates, and produce data files . 5.1 Analytic groups For the purpose of analysis, DAWN developed a set of categories to use when reporting on ED visits. Referred to as \"analytic groups, \" these categories combine visits with similar ch aracteristics to produce summary statistics. The DAWN analytic groups and their definitions are provided in Table 4. The analytic groups fall into one of three types: all visits (regardless of intent), visits where there is an indication of some type of drug misuse or abuse, and visits where there is no indication of misuse or abuse. Because of DAWN 's focus on drug misuse and abuse, this topic is addressed by several analytic groups, including all drug misuse or abuse, all visits involving illicit drugs, v isits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, visits involving alcohol for patients of all ages, and visits involving alcohol for patients under the age of 21. Also isolated for analysis are visits involving drug-related suicide attempts and visits made by patients seeking detoxification services. The subgroups under \"All M isuse and Abuse \" in Table 4 are not mutually exclusive because a single visit can involve multiple types of drugs. For example, an ED visit involving marijuana and oxycodone would be grouped with other visits involving illicit drugs, as well as with visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Annually, DAWN produces comprehensive sets of tables, the DAWN Trend Tables , that provide estimates and rates of drug-related ED visits by type of drug, patient sex and age, visit disposition, and other characteristics; each table includes estimates and rates for the current year and all prior years . A complete set of tables is produced for each analytic group listed in Table 4. Each set is reproduced for the Nation and for metropolitan areas with sufficiently high level s of participatio n (see Table 1 ). A more detailed description of the DAWN Trend Tables is provided in the Guide to the DAWN Trend Tables . 23 23 The Guide to the DAWN Trend Tables is available as an attachment to the DAWN ED Annual Reports and as a freestanding document at the DAWN Web site ( http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx ). 38 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT , 2010 UPDATE Table 4. DAWN analytic groups Analytic group Description All Visits This group includes all visits that are reportable to DAWN without regard for the reason for the visit or the specific drugs involved. It includes visits involving all forms of drug misuse or abuse plus visits resulting from adverse reaction, accidental ingestion, suicide attempts, and visits seeking detoxification services. These estimates are useful for looking at overall levels of drug involvement in ED visits. Drug -related ED visits that involve drug misuse or abuse All Misuse and Abuse This analytic category includes visits that involve all forms of drug mis use or abuse as defined by DAWN. This is the combination of visits from the following four analytic groups: illicit drug visits, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, alcohol- related visits, and underage drinking. A visit may appear in more than one of tho se subgroups , but it will appear only once in this overall group. Suicide- attempt visits and seeking detox visits will be included in this category if illicit drugs were involved. Illicits (excluding alcohol) This analytic category includes visits that involve the use of drugs that have limited or no therapeutic value and are generally illegal if taken without a prescription. These substances include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic inhalation of substances for their psychotherapeutic properties (e.g., sniffing model airplane glue) are included. Nonmedical Use of Pharmaceuticals This analytic category includes visits that involve nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals : patients who took a higher than prescribed or recommended dose of their own medication, patients who took a pharmaceutical prescribed for another person, malicious poisoning of the patient by another individual, and documented substance abuse involving pharmaceuticals. All Alcohol This analytic category includes ED visits involving alcohol. For adults aged 21 and older, the alcohol was found in combination with other drugs. For patients under the age of 21, the visit may involve alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs . Underage Drinking This analytic category includes ED visits that involve alcohol us e (alone or with other drugs) for patients under the age of 21. Underage drinking is an important barometer of adolescent drinking patterns and a predictor of more serious substance abuse problems in young adults. Suicide Attempts This analytic category includes ED visits that involve drug-related suicide attempts. It includes visits for drug overdoses, as well as suicide attempts by other means (e.g., using a firearm ) if drugs were involved or related to the suicide attempt. Inclusion in this analytic category has no restrictions on the type of drug used. Seeking Detox This analytic category includes nonemergency requests made through the ED for admission to detoxification unit, visits to obtain medical clearance before being incarcerated, and acute emer gencies where an individual is experiencing withdrawal symptoms and requests detox. These estimates do not include patients who seek or enter the hospital' s detox unit through other avenues. Drug-related ED visits that do NOT involve drug misuse or abuse Adverse R eaction s This analytic category includes ED visits in which an adverse health consequence (e.g., side effects or an allergic reaction) resulted when taking prescription drugs, over -the-counter medications, or dietary supplements as prescribed or recommended. Accidental Ingestions This analytic category includes ED visits in which an individual accidentally or unknowingly used a prescription drug, over -the-counter medication, or dietary supplement . Drug-related accidental ingestion typically involves patients aged 5 and under. 5.2 Drug lists In addition to being a coding system that accommodates different levels of drug detail, the DAWN DRV provides a method for aggregating drugs into meaningful , higher -level groupings. DAWN currently collects dru g information on thousands of individual products. The individual products are mapped to their generic drug name; currently, DAWN reports on approximately 3,300 generic DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 39 drugs. The DAWN Trend Tables provid e estimates and rates using a shorter list of approximately 500 drugs, known as the \"standard drug list. \" The tables in the DAWN ED Annual Reports highlight approximately 100 drugs selected from the standard drug list. 5.3 Estimates of visits versus drugs All estimates provided in DAWN publications and tables are calculated using data that have been weighted as described in Section 4.4. Estimates for any variable of interest are determined by first summing the case totals within facility /month, applying the wi thin-hospital weight, summing to the hospital level, applying the final hospital weight, and summing over all hospitals. The DAWN ED Annual Reports , short reports, and the DAWN Trend Tables include predominantly estimates at the ED visit level \u2014that is, how many visits involved a certain drug. Another measure is the total number of drugs reported. Because most ED visits involve more than one drug, the total drug reports will always exceed the total drug-related ED visits. To illustrate the difference, consider a visit involving oxycodone and aspirin. Both drugs are pain relievers. This visit will count as one visit involving oxycodone and one visit involving aspirin. When reporting the number of visits involving pain relievers in general, this visit will be counted just once even though two types of pain relievers were involved. 5.4 Standardized rates DAWN ED Annual Reports and the DAWN Trend Tables include population -based rates as well as estimates. Rates are s tandardized measures that are helpful when comparing levels of drug - related ED visits for different years and drug groups. DAWN rates for years and drug groups are based on the whole population ; for example , there were 636.9 ED visits invol ving drug misuse or abuse per 100,000 population in 2010 compared with 440.5 visits in 2004. For specific age groups and sexes, the denominator is limited to the population in that age group or sex ; for example , there were 1,744.4 ED visits involving drug misuse or abuse per 100,000 persons aged 18 to 20 in 2010 compared with 1,056.0 visits per 100,000 persons aged 35 to 44. For age in particular, the size of the underlying population differs considerably across DAWN age groups; for example, the number of individuals aged 18 to 20 in the United States is much lower than the number of individuals aged 35 to 44. All other factors being the same, a higher estimate of the number of ED visits would be expected to occur naturally for the larger group . To adjust fo r that, rates are standardized to be equal to the number of ED visits per 100,000 persons in that age group. The rate is calculated by dividing the estimate for a particular group by the population of that group and then multiplying by 100,000. Because they are reported as percentages, the RSEs provided in DAWN tables apply equally to the estimates and the rates. 5.5 Population estimates used to calculate rates Every reporting year, DAWN recalculates estimates and rates for all years (2004 through current data collection year) using the current DAWN DRV and the U.S. Census Bureau 's most recent 40 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT , 2010 UPDATE population estimates for all years.24 For DAWN reporting years 2004 through 2009, rates were calculated using population data from the U.S. Census Bureau based on the 2000 decennial census. Population estimates used to generate rates are as of July in the data collection year. National -level population estimates for these intercensal years were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau Postcensal Resident Population National Population Dataset, National Estimates by Demographic Characteristics \u2014Single Year of Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin, Monthly Population Estimates. Estimates at the metropolitan area level were drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau Postcensal Resident Popul ation County Population Datasets, County Estimates by Demographic Characteristics \u2014Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin, State Datasets. For the 2010 data year, the methodology was adjusted to take advantage of the newly available 2010 decennial census data. The 2010 decennial census data, though, had an effective date of April 1, 2010 . It was necessary to roll it forward to July 1 to be consistent with previous DAWN reports. To that end, the national census counts were adjusted by a factor equivalent to one quarter of the annual growth as shown in the difference between the vintage 2009 counts for 2009 and the 2009 vintage projection for 2010. 25 National counts for the 36 age -by-sex (18 age and 2 sex categories) categories used for DAWN were likewise adjusted. National counts for the years 2004- 2009, including the age -by-sex categories, were brought into line with the decennial estimate by multiplying by an appropriate factor to reflect the difference between the vintage 2009 projection of 2010 and the adjusted (for July 1) actual census count. Overall, these adjustments used the most current data available for 2010 while preserving the existing relationship among the counts for the years 2004 -2009. In 2010, an extra step was required to make age -by-sex counts for metropolitan areas as the U.S. Census Bureau had not produced age -by-sex counts at the county level at the time the DAWN 2010 data were processed. A vintage 2009 projection for 2010 was created using the growth of 2009 over 2008 as a best estimate of the growth of 2010 over 2009. A ratio adjustment was created that took into account projected county growth for 2009 versus actual growth experienced as reported in the 2010 Census, an adjustment that was proportionately reduced as applied to the previous years 2004-2009. That is, 2009 received 90 percent of the total adjustment, 2008 received 80 percent , and 2004 received only 40 percent , where over the 10 -year intercensal span, an incremental 10 percent of the adjustment is reflected each year until the entire adjustment is reflect in the tenth year, 2010. The ratio adjustments were developed and applied at the age-by - sex category level within each county and were applied to the vintage 2009 county counts for 24 The U.S. Census Bureau issues population estimates for each year between decennial censuses. Each year, the estimates for the current year are issued, and estimates for all years since the decennial are reissued. Each year's estimates are referred to as \"Vintage 20xx.\" DAWN uses the most current vintage estimates. 25 Each vintage year includes a projection of the population count for the next year. For instance, Vintage 2007 includes a projection of the population counts for 2008. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 41 2009, yielding the counts needed to produce rates for the DAWN Trend Tables at the metropolitan area level. 5.6 Measures of precision and error Each hospital in the DAWN sample was selected through a random process, which theoretically could have been repeated many times, resulting in many hypothetical samples. Sampling error refers to the extent to which these samples vary. Two measures of this variability are the SE and the RSE, which is defined as the SE of the estimate divided by the estimate itself. The precision of an estimate is inversely related to the sampling variance, as measured by the RSE. The greater the RSE value, the lower the precision. For example, if 10,000 estimated visits involve a given drug, and this estimate has an SE of 500 visits, then the RSE value is 5 percent: RSE = SE/Estimate RSE = 500/10,000 \u00d7 100%) . In addition to RSEs, confidence intervals (CIs) are often included in tables published by DAWN. The 95 percent CI is calculated as CI = Estimat e \u00b1 (1.96 \u00d7 RSE \u00d7 Estimate), where 1.96 comes from the table of normal distribution z-values and means that 95 percent of the normal distribution lies within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Applying the formula to the example above, the 95 percent CI would be 10,000 \u00b1 (1.96 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 10,000) = 10,000 limit: 10,000 980 = 9,020 980 = 10,980 95% CI: 9,020 to 10,980. If repeated samples were drawn from the same population of hospitals, using the same sampling and data collection procedures, then 95 percent of the time the true population values would fall between 9,020 and 10,980 . Both between - and within -hospital variance components are accounted for in the variance estimation process. Within -hospital variance is estimated using a replication strategy by which two random replic ates are created within each hospital , and the variance between the two replicates 42 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT , 2010 UPDATE represent s the within -hospital contribution. Typically, this component i s considerably smaller than the bet ween- hospital variance, which is calculated as the variance between weighted hospital totals within each stratum. Variance estimates reported in the DAWN Trend Tables are determined using the Taylor series linearization variance estimation method available in SUDAAN \u00ae software. This method is particularly appropriate for analyzing cluster data, such as those that are generated by the DAWN sampling plan. 5.7 Suppression DAWN uses a set of criteria to determine whether estimates can be released to the public. Data may be suppressed to protect patient confidentiality or to ensure that published findings meet statistical standards of reliability for survey results. In all published materials, e stimates are suppressed according to the following rules: The RSE of the estimate is greater than 50 percent \u2014When the RSE is greater than 50 percent , the lower bound of the 95 percent CI approaches or includes the value zero. A CI that includes zero means that the estimate is not statistically different from zero at this precision level. The estimate is based on fewer than 30 ED visits \u2014Estimates based on a small number of cases are typically suppressed because the RSE is greater than 50 percent . Estimates that do meet RSE criteria for publication but are based on fewer than 30 ED visits (weighted or unweighted) are deemed too unreliable for publication. Such estimates are also suppressed to protect patient privacy. It is mathematically possible that an estimate could have no sampling error and an RSE of zero. This occurs when the number of ED visits being estimated is small, all the hospitals contributing to that estimate were selected with certainty, and the absence of any sampled hospital is due to nonresponse. In most cases, an estimate with an RSE of zero is suppressed on the basis of the small number of cases. In the unlikely event that an estimate is published with an RSE of zero, it is most appropriate to interpret the RSE as signifying that the necessary data were not available to approximate the sampling error. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 43 5.8 Cross-y ear comparisons In DAWN ED Annual Reports and the DAWN Trend Tables , comparisons in the estimates of ED visits between years are presented in the form of percentage differences, calculated as the current estimate minus an earlier year 's estimate divided by that estimate. For shorter -term comparisons, percent changes are calculated for the current year compared with last year and the current year compared with 2 years ago. For longer -term comparisons, estimates for the current year are compared with those for 2004.26 The percent change is reported only if the difference is statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. Tests for the significance of differences between two years ' estimates consider the variance of each year 's estimate and the covariance between the two. Hospitals that appear in both samples and provide data in both years will contribute to the covariance and thus decrease the overall sampling variance beyond the combined contribution of the two samples. That is, th e variance estimation process used to establish significance takes into account any overlap between hospitals that participated in both years. 5.9 DAWN public use f iles SAMHDA has primary responsibility for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of behavioral health data collected by SAMHSA . SAMHDA promotes the access and use of SAMHSA's substance abuse and mental health data by providing public -use data files and documentation for download and online analysis tools to support a better understanding of this critical area of public health. DAWN data are made available at the SAMHDA site as soon as the data are released by SAMHSA. Data are available in the following formats: SPSS, SAS, Stata, ASCII, and tab delimited. PDF and HTML codebooks are available online for all years. Activities and services SAMHDA performs in support of public -use versions of data and documentation include the following: disclosure analysis to ensure that respondents remain anonymous , standardiz ation of documentation and data formats , development of customized Web page for data system, online analysis tools to query restricted -use versions of data, searchable bibliography of publications based on SAMHDA dat a, and staff participation at approved outreach functions . The SAMHDA Web site was first published on December 3, 1997. The University of Michigan's Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research is under contract to CBHSQ to disseminate data and to maintain the SAMHDA Web site and bibliography of publications. 26 Due to data limitations in 2004, long-term comparisons for ED visits re sulting from adverse reactions are made between 2005 and the current year. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 45 6. QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL Survey error, also referred to as bias, is the extent to which findings from the survey sample differ from those of the population of interest. Error can be introduced at any stage in the survey process , from building the sample frame to reporting estimates. This section documents methodologies employed by DAWN to help ensure that published estimates are representative, accurate, and reliable. 6.1 Minimization of nonsampling error To control the nonsampling error components and produce data of high quality, DAWN has a well - defined and ongoing data quality assurance (QA) and data quality control ( QC) program. The two primary components of the data QA/QC program are (1) the extensive and continuous monitoring of data quality during data collection and processing , and (2) annually, an intensive review of the monthly data for each ED in relation to other months for the current and all prior reporting years. 6.1.1 Maintaining data quality during data collection and data preparation Measures used to monitor data quality during data collection include but are not limited to onsite quality audit reviews and quarterly standardized error feedback reports. In addition to those measures, DAWN employs a custom- built software system (eHERS) to collect DAWN data. eHERS , which provides automated prompts to ensure that DAWN Reporters collect complete data, is populated with the most current detailed codes for drugs, race/ethnicity, visit disposition, and other categorical variables . It performs real-time data validation checks to ensure that the data are within valid ranges and consistent with other information collected for the visit. eHERS also checks across visits to ensure that visits are not entered multiple times and follows a procedure to resolve conflicts if multiple entries are detected. 6.1.2 End-of-year data quality review Before data are weighted, researchers responsible for the collection (the DAWN operations contractor) and analysis (data analysis contractor) of DAWN data meet with staff from CBHSQ to review the quality of the data. This process is referred to as the data quality review (DQR). Before the DQR meeting, the DAWN operations contractor prepar es an electronic file that summarizes what is known about the quality of the data that was collected in the prior year. The DQR spreadsheet contains descriptive information including facility ID, facility name, oversampled area name, stratum, eligibility, subsampling information, and participation status. In addition, the DQR spreadsheet includes summary data for each of the fields for each ED by month, as shown in Table 5. Review of these data items reveals what portion of ED visits in each hospital for ea ch month were evaluated for inclusion in DAWN. Depending on the pattern of missing data for an ED, the review committee comes to a consensus about whether to delete, adjust, or impute the count of eligible ED visits, the count of medical charts reviewed, and the count of identified DAWN cases 46 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE in each ED for each month of the reporting year. These counts are vital to developing accurate within -facility adjustment factors for each month for each facility. Table 5.

For example, the DAWN statistical methodology provides for clearly defined criteria to construct the initial hospital sampling frame. Coverage error is minimized by using a sampling frame that has virtually 100 percent coverage of the target population. Weighting is introduced to account for the probability of selection, within-hospital nonresponse, hospital -level nonresponse, and the total number of visits in the sample frame as independently established by the AHA ASDB. Validity checks are made at each stage of weighting to ensure that the sum of weights at that stage equaled the relevant reference p oint. 6.3 Quality control on released reports and tables All publications and tables issued by DAWN are subject to multitiered data QC measures. Tables are produced and independently verified by a separate statistician/programmer. Estimates are verified against other tables to ensure cross -table consistencies. Estimates for different years are verified against each other to ensure cross -year consistencies. Tables in reports are verified against source files. Text descriptions of findings are verified against report tables by three separate and independent readers. All observations in respect to the similarity or differences between estimates are established through statistical testing that is independently recomputed and verified. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 47 7. DATA LIMITATIONS 7.1 Limitations of survey data Information on drug -related ED visits in DAWN is based on a sample and is, therefore, subject to sampling variability. The SE measurements and CIs provided for all estimates reflect the sampling variability that occurs (1) by chance because only a sample rather than the entire universe is surveyed, and (2) by nonresponse. As in any survey, nonresponse is of concern because it creates larger -than -expected sampling errors plus the opportunity for unpredictable biases. DAWN addresses these issues in the short term by always reporting SEs based on the actual sample of respondents and for the long term by continuing its efforts to raise the hospital participation rate. 7.2 Limitations of using extant medical records Although every effort is made during the data collection phase to collect data accurately and precisely, extant medical records vary in specificity and detail. Factors that may affect the reliability and accuracy of the findings include the following: DAWN data collectors attempt to identify , with a high degree of specificity , the exact drugs involved in an ED visit, but extant medical records vary in specificity and detail. If extant medical records include only a general description of a drug (e.g., \"benzodiazepines \"), the drug is grouped in a general category (e.g., \"benzodi azepines not otherwise specified \"). DAWN relies on the assessment made by ED medical staff to determine which drugs are related to the visit and records only those drugs indicated as being related. DAWN does not assess the medical reasons for the visit, and it cannot be assumed that a drug was the direct cause of the medical emergency. For example, a soporific may have caused the patient to fall asleep while driving and have an accident. Use of illicit drugs is assumed to constitute drug abuse. The determination of nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, though, must be supported by information provided by medical personnel in the ED records. In cases where multiple pharmaceuticals are involved, it is not necessary that both drugs are misused. The medical emergency might stem from the interaction between two pharmaceuticals, one of which was used nonmedically and the other of which was taken as prescribed. While DAWN seeks to report only the drugs that are related to the ED visit, some unrelated drugs may be included if ED records fail to indicate that they were obtained through a legitimate prescription, were taken as prescribed or indicated, and were unrelated to the ED visit. For example, anecdotal evidence suggests that ED records may mention methadone but fail to indicate that the patient was enrolled in a methadone treatment program and that the methadone was unrelated to the medical emergency leading to the ED visit . Information on race and ethnicity is often poorly documented in extant ED records. In addition, some hospitals consider race/ethnicity to be private information and will not 48 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE make it available to DAWN Field Reporters. Overall, about 15 percent of visits each year do not contain race/ethnicity information. DAWN does not produce rates (visits p er 100,000 population) for race/ethnicity groups because these missing data will result in the understatement of visit s by race/ethnicity category. This might affect racial/ethnic groups differentially and produce misleading findings. 7.3 Limitations on toxicology test finding Although DAWN documents whether a drug was positively confirmed by toxicology testing, DAWN does not require that all drugs reported for the ED visit be confirmed by laboratory testing . Toxicology tests are not used consistently across ED s, and some toxicology tests are not specific enough to identify particular drugs. Furthermore, a positive toxicology test is not necessarily evidence of recent drug involvement in an ED visit if it is a current medication or a drug that persists in the sy stem long after it was used. For this reason, DAWN requires that the involvement of drugs be mentioned in the ED record, not just in the toxicology testing results, for the visit to be considered a DAWN case. DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE 49 8. HISTORY OF D AWN , 1970- 2011 DAWN is a public health surveillance system that has monitored drug -related ED visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. DAWN was initially established by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. DAWN was transferred to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 1980. Within HHS, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) conducted DAWN from 1980 to 1992. For the period 1992 through 2011 , CBHSQ (formerly the Office of Applied Studies) of SAMHSA was responsible for DAWN operations and reporting. CBHSQ ceased performing DAWN data collection as of the end of calendar year 2011 , and the responsibility for collection of data on drug -related ED visits was passed to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS incorporated DAWN data elements into the National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS ). NCHS is observing DAWN conventions and methodologies to the greatest extent possible so that data collected via DAWN for the years 2004 -2011 can be compared with the data collected by the NHCS for later years. For example, given its sample design and size, the drug-related ED visits data collecte d through NHCS will be representative of the nation but not the DAWN metropolitan areas. Additional information on NHCS and its collection of information on drug -related ED visits is available at the NHCS Web site . 27 Since its inception, DAWN has relied on data collected from a sample of hospitals. However, over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. When NIDA assumed responsibility for DAWN in 1980, implementation of a sample of hospitals to produce representative estimates for the Nation and for selected metropolitan areas became a priority. This sample, refreshed with annual maintenance, continued to support DAWN estimates for the contiguous United States and 21 metropolitan areas until 2002. Major population shifts and changes in the hospital industry between 1980 and 2002 made apparent the need for a redesign of the sample of hospitals. Many other features of DAWN (e.g., definition of a DAWN visit to include all drug -related medical emergencies and not merely those involving misuse or abuse) were also introduced at that time. 28 In the redesign in 2003, DAWN's goal remained to produce national as well as metropolitan area- level estimates. Retent ion of the original 21 metropolitan areas was important because of the ongoing demand for DAWN estimates by public health professionals in those areas . In addition, inclusion of major population centers in each of the nine census divisions was deemed impor tant to improve DAWN's geographic and population coverage. A total of 48 metropolitan areas was identified for inclusion in DAWN. The composition of these metropolitan areas was based on the 27 Further information on NHCS and its data are available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhcs.htm . 28 Additional detail on the 2003 redesign is available in the following publication: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. (2002). Drug Abuse Warning Network: Development of a new design ( methodology report ) (DAWN Series M-4, DHHS Publication No. SMA 02-3754). Rockville, MD: Author. 50 DAWN METHODOLOGY REPORT, 2010 UPDATE definitions issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in June 2003 . For consistency, DAWN has maintained the 2003 definitions, even if counties were added in subsequent years. Between 1980 and 2003, OMB had substantially enlarged the coverage areas for 4 of the original 21 metropolitan areas. Users of DAWN s tatistics in these 4 areas \u2014Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and San Francisco \u2014remained interested in obtaining estimates for the areas covered by the original 21 metropolitan areas. To address the needs of these users, DAWN subdivided these metropolitan areas according to their earlier composition and planned oversamples in the subdivided portions. That is, for each of these areas, there were a n oversample for the metropolitan area as defined in 2003 and also additional over sampl ing in the submetropolitan areas. When participation is high enough, separate estimates are made for the sub metropolitan areas as well as the entire metropolitan area. In 2000, DAWN adopted the Multum Lexicon , \u00a9 2011, a drug vocabulary and classification tool developed and maintained by Lexi-Comp, Inc., a private firm that distributes the Lexicon and regular updates through its Web site . While the use of the Lexicon is free of charge, a licens ing agreement specifies the terms required of users. In accordance with the licens ing agreement, DAWN publications, tabulations, and software applications cite the Multum Lexicon as the source and basis for the system DAWN uses to code drugs. The DAWN survey relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non - Federal, short -stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24- hour ED. This sampling strategy was first implemented in the 2004 data collection year and has been followed since that year .

MAJOR FEATURES OF DA WN TREND TABLES , 2010 UPDATE Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) Trend Tables provide estimates of drug -related visits to hospital emergency department s (EDs) for different groups of patients, different years, and different geographic locations . Each year DAWN produces an updated set of DAWN Trend Tables that includes data for 2004 through the current year. The DAWN Trend Tables, 2010 Update, includes 120 Microsoft Excel workbooks: 10 workbooks contain estimates for the Nation , and the same 10 workbooks are repeated for each of 1 1 metropolitan areas . Each workbook contains 56 tables ( 1 table per worksheet ). Each table presents data for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. This document is intended to help DAWN user s find the workbooks, tables, and estimates of interest to them.1 General information about DAWN is available at http:// www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx , including detail on the DAWN data program and the methodologies used to collect, process, and report data. Information on other sources of data on substance abuse and mental health from the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality is located at http:// www.samhsa.gov/data/. 1.1 Analytic groups DAWN analytic groups represent different groupings of visits that were developed to meet the data needs of a range of audiences . The DAWN analytic groups and their definitions are provided in Table 1 . 1.2 Workbooks containing national estimates Workbook names have three parts: a prefix that describes the geographic coverage of the workbook, a middle term that reflects the latest year of the data, and a suffix that describes the analytic group. Table 2 lists the workbook names for the 10 workbooks containing estimates for the Nation. Each worksheet contains data for 2004 through 2010 .2 1 Links to the DAWN Trend Tables, 2010 Update, for the Nation are located at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx#DAWN 2010 ED Excel Files - National Tables ; links for metropolitan tables are at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN.aspx#DAWN 2010 ED Excel Files - Metro Tables . 2 Major changes to DAWN were instituted in 2004 as the result of a redesign that altered most of DAWN's core features. Changes were made in the design of the hospital sample, the drug-related cases eligible for DAWN, the data items submitted on these cases, and the protocol for case finding and quality assurance. These improvements created a permanent disruption in trends. As a result, the base year for comparison to later years is 2004. 6 GUIDE TO DAWN TREND TABLES, 2010 UPDATE Table 1. DAWN analytic groups Analytic group Description All Visits This group includes all visits that are reportable to DAWN without regard for the reason for the visit or the specific drugs involved. It includes visits involving all forms of drug misuse or abuse plus visits resulting from adverse reaction, accidental ingestion, suicide attempts, and visits seeking detoxification services. These estimates are useful for looking at overall levels of drug involvement in ED visits. \u2014 Drug -related ED visits that involve drug misuse or abuse All Misuse and Abuse This analytic category includes visits that involve all forms of drug misuse or abuse, as defined by DAWN. This category is the combination of visits from the following four analytic groups: illicit drug visits, nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, alcohol-related visits, and underage drinking. A visit may appear in more than one of the subgroups listed below, but it will appear only once in this overall group. Suicide-attempt visits and seeking detox visits will be included in this category if illicit drugs were involved. Illicits (excluding alcohol) This analytic category includes visits that involve the use of drugs that have limited or no therapeutic value and are generally illegal if taken without a prescription. These substances include cocaine, heroin, marijuana, synthetic inhalation of substances for their psychoactive properties (e.g., sniffing model airplane glue) are included. Nonmedical Use of Pharmaceuticals This analytic category includes ED visits that involve nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals: patients who took a higher than prescribed or recommended dose of their own medication, patients who took a pharmaceutical prescribed for another person, malicious poisoning of the patient by another individual, and documented substance abuse involving pharmaceuticals. All Alcohol This analytic category includes ED visits involving alcohol. For adults aged 21 and older, the alcohol was found in combination with other drugs. For patients under the age of 21, the visit may involve alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs. Underage Drinking This analytic category includes ED visits that involve alcohol use (alone or with other drugs) for patients under the age of 21. Underage drinking is an important barometer of adolescent drinking patterns and a predictor of more serious substance abuse problems in young adults. Suicide Attempts This analytic category includes ED visits that involve drug-related suicide attempts. It includes visits for drug overdoses and for suicide attempts by other means (e.g., using a firearm) if drugs were involved or related to the suicide attempt. Inclusion in this analytic category has no restrictions on the type of drug used. Seeking Detox This analytic category includes nonemergency requests made through the ED for admission to detoxification unit, visits to obtain medical clearance before being incarcerated, and acute emergencies where an individual is experiencing withdrawal symptoms and requests detox. These estimates do not include patients who seek or enter the hospital's detox unit through other avenues. \u2014 Drug -related ED visits that do NOT involve drug misuse or abuse Adverse Reactions This analytic category includes ED visits in which an adverse health consequence (e.g., side effects or an allergic reaction) resulted when taking prescription drugs, over - the-counter medications, or dietary supplements as prescribed or recommended. Accidental Ingestions This analytic category includes ED visits in which an individual accidentally or unknowingly used or was administered a prescription drug, over -the-counter medication, or dietary supplement. Drug-related accidental ingestion typically involves patients aged 5 and under. GUIDE TO DAWN TREND TABLES, 2010 UPDATE 7 Table 2.

Table 3 lists the names of workbooks containing estimates for metropolitan areas and divisions. For example, the workbook containing national estimates for ED visits involving all drug misuse or abuse is named \"Nation_2010 _AllMA.xls.\" The workbook with parallel estimates for Boston is named \"Boston_ 2010_AllMA.xls.\" Each of the 11 geographic areas listed in Table 3 has a set of 10 Ex cel workbooks, one workbook for each analytic group listed in Table 2 . 8 GUIDE TO DAWN TREND TABLES, 2010 UPDATE Table 3. W orkbook names f or metropolitan areas and divisions Metropolitan Statistical A reas (MSAs) and WA Seattle_20XX_{analytic group}.xls (1) Unless otherwise noted, DAWN defines metropolitan areas using the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and Division definitions issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in June 2003 (available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/b03-04.html). For consistency, DAWN uses these names and definitions even if they were subsequently changed by OMB. (2) Miami- Miami Beach-Kendall, FL, Division. (3) Fort FL, D ivisions . (4) Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, and Richmond Counties, NY . 1.4 Information organization and format Workbooks and worksheets With minor exception s, each Excel workbook in the DAWN Trend Tables is organized the same way. Each workbook represents one geographic area and one analytic group. Each workbook contains 56 tables ( worksheets ), with each table representing visits for a single demographic or visit characteristic. Examples of a demographic characteristic are \"male patient s\" or \"patients age d 0 to 5.\" An example of a visit characteristic is \"the patient was discharged home.\" Table 4 lists the tables that appear in each workbook. Unless otherwise noted in Table 4 , each table in each workbook has the same arrangement of rows and columns. GUIDE TO DAWN TREND TABLES, 2010 UPDATE 9 Table 4.

GUIDE TO DAWN TREND TABLES, 2010 UPDATE 11 Table 4. Tables in each workbook of the DAWN Trend Tables (continued) Sheet tab label Description of visits included in table Drug Combinations This table reports ED visits for major and mutually exclusive drug combination groups. That is, each visit is counted in one and only one drug combination group. The rows in this table do not conform to the standard template, but the columns do. Drug Frequency This table reports counts of drugs, not ED visits. Each ED visit can involve up to 22 drugs. The estimates in this table reflect how often each drug was involved in ED visits. The rows and columns conform to the standard format. Tox Confirmed Drugs This table reports counts of drugs, not ED visits. Each ED visit can involve up to 22 drugs. The estimates in this table reflect how often each drug involved was confirmed through toxicology testing. The rows and columns conform to the standard format. Illicit Drugs This table reports ED visits for more detailed drugs and drug categories than are found in the standard format. The rows in this table do not conform to the standard template, but the columns do. Psych Drugs Similar to expanded listing of illicit drugs but provides estimates for psychotherapeutic drugs. Cen Nerv System Drugs Similar to expanded listing of illicit drugs but provides estimates for central nervous system drugs. Respiratory Drugs Similar to expanded listing of illicit drugs but provides estimates for respiratory drugs. Cardiovascular Drugs Similar to expanded listing of illicit drugs but provides estimates for cardiovascular drugs. Rows The rows of the tables represent drug categories and drugs. Each drug and each drug category appear on the same row in each table (e.g., the estimates of ED visits involving cocaine appear on row 15 in every table). The classification of drugs used in DAWN is derived from the Multum Lexicon , \u00a9 2011 Lexi -Comp, Inc., and/or Cerner Multum, Inc. The Lexicon was slightly modified to meet DAWN's need to report on illicit drugs using street names. Columns The 39 columns in each table provide the following information: drug/drug group name; weighted annual estimates of ED visits for 2004 through 2010; rates of ED visits per 100,000 population for 2004 through 2010; relative standard error (RSE) of estimate and rate, expressed as a percentage, of the visit estimates for 2004 through 2010; tests for statistically significant differences between visit estimates for select years (e.g., in the DAWN Trend Tables, 2010 Update, estimates for 2010 are compared with those for 2004, 2008, and 2009);3 and 3 Because of data limitations in 2004, the 2010 data for visits involving adverse reactions are compared with 2005, not 2004. 12 GUIDE TO DAWN TREND TABLES, 2010 UPDATE lower and upper 95 percent confidence interval s (CIs) for visit estimates for 2004 through 2010. 1.5 Special note on age categories The age categories used for reporting ED visits in the DAWN Trend Tables reflect critical junctures in drug use. For example, patients aged 5 and under are reported separately to facilitate study of visits involving accidental ingestion. Patients aged 12 to 17 are considered to be in their formative years, and understanding the nature of their drug use is important for prevention efforts. Patients under the age of 21 are reported separately to facilitate study of topics such as underage drinking. Patients aged 18 to 20 are reported separately from those aged 21 to 24 to isolate drug-taking behaviors before and after the critical age of 21. Older patients are grouped in wider c ategories where age differences are not as critical to intervention and treatment. As a consequence, the age categories are not evenly sized \u2014for example, the age group 30 to 34 covers 5 years, whereas the age group 35 to 44 covers 10 years. The size of an age group is an important consideration when comparing estimates of ED visits for different age categories. GUIDE TO DAWN TREND TABLES, 2010 UPDATE 13 2. VALUES REPORTED IN D AWN TREND TABLES The following values appear in the cells of the DAWN Trend Tables . The order in which values are listed here corresponds to the order in which they appear in the standard table format , going from left to right across the table . The section headings below match the overarching headings that appear in row 6 of the standard table format. 2.1 Weighted annual estimates Estimates of drug-related ED visits are calculated by applying weights and adjustments to the data provided by the sampled hospitals participating in DAWN. The primary sampling weights reflect the probability of selection, whereas separate adjustment factors are included to account for nonresponse, data quality, and the known total of ED visits delivered by the universe of eligible hospitals , as reported by the most current American Hospital Association survey. Estimates of the number of visits are reported to the fifth decimal place, though they are formatted to appear as whole n umbers . An asterisk (*) appears if a value is suppressed (see Section 2.6). All estimate fields are populated with a value or an asterisk; blanks do not appear and are not valid. 2.2 Rates per 100,000 population All rates in the DAWN Trend Tables are visits per 100,000 persons. Standardized measures are helpful when comparing levels of drug-related ED visits for different drug groups or years ; e.g., there were 552.9 ED visits per 100,000 population involving drug misuse or abuse in 2004 compared with 743.7 in 2010. These rates are based on the whole population. Rates are also important when comparing age and sex groups ; e.g., there were 853.1 ED visits per 100,000 males in 2010 compared to 636.9 visits for females. Rates for age and sex groups are based on the population for the specific age or sex group ; e.g., there were 12.3 visits per 100,000 persons aged 18 to 20 and 45.6 visits per 100,000 male persons. Rates are reported to the ninth decimal place , though they are formatted to display only the first decimal (e.g., 123.4). Rates based on suppressed estimates are likewise suppressed, with an asterisk (*) appearing instead of a value (see Section 2.6) . DAWN does not produce population - based rates for race/ethnicity categories because race/ethnicity information in ED records is often missing or is very limited. Three dots (...) appear in the rate fields in the race/ethnicity tables. All rate fields are populated with a value, asterisk, or three dots; blanks do not appear and are not valid. 2.3 Relative standard error (%) Because DAWN relies on a sample of hospitals, each estimate produced from the DAWN ED data is subject to sampling variability, the variation in the estimate that would be observed naturally if 14 GUIDE TO DAWN TREND TABLES, 2010 UPDATE different samples were drawn from the same population using the same procedures. The sampling variability of an estimate in this publication is measured by its relative standard error (RSE) . The precision of an estimate or rate is inversely related to its RSE. That is, the greater the RSE, the lower the precision. RSEs are reported to the ninth decimal place , though they are formatted to display only the first decimal (e.g., 12.3). The RSE values reported are percentages (e.g., 12.3 = 12.3%). Because it is reported as a percentage , an RSE measure applies to both the estimate and the rate. RSEs based on suppressed estimates are likewise suppressed, with an asterisk (*) appearing instead of a value (see Section 2.6) . All RSE fields are populated with a value or an asterisk; blanks do not appear and are not valid. 2.4 Percent change (p < 0.05) The DAWN Trend Tables assess between -year changes by comparing estimates as follows: most current year to first year , most current year to year before last , and most current year to last year. In the DAWN Trend Tables, 2010 Update, 2010 estimates are compared with those for 2004 (first year), 2008 (year before last), and 2009 (last year). The underlying formula is of the form: ((estimate for earlier year estimate for later year) / estimate for earlier year). The resulting values are reported to the seventh decimal place, though they are formatted to display a whole number that represents a percentage difference (e.g., 12 = 12% increase in the number of visits). Declines in percentage difference appear as negative numbers (e.g. , 12 = 12% decrease in the number of visits ). The tables report percentage differences between years only if they are statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level; otherwise, a blank appears. A blank also appears if either estimate in the percentage difference formula is suppressed (see Section 2.6). Percent change measures for rates are not provided. 2.5 Lower and upper 95 percent confidence limit on w eighted annual estimate The DAWN Trend Tables include the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence intervals (CI s) for all estimates at the 95 percent confidence level. For example, the estimate of the number of ED visits involving any type of drug misuse or abuse in 2010 was 2,301,050 visits . A 95 percent CI means that if repeated samples were drawn from the same population of hospitals using the same sampling and data collection procedures, the number of ED visits reported (2,301,050 visits ) will fall between the lower boundaries (1,987,721 visits ) and up per boundaries (2,614,380 visits ) 95 percent of the time. GUIDE TO DAWN TREND TABLES, 2010 UPDATE 15 The confidence limit estimates are reported to the eighth decimal place, though they are formatted to appear as whole numbers. An asterisk (*) appears if a value is suppressed (see Section 2.6). All CI fields are populated with a value or an asterisk; blanks do not appear and are not valid. 2.6 Suppression DAWN estimates with RSE values greater than 50 percent or estimates based on fewer than 30 ED visits (weighted or unweighted) are considered too imprecise for publication and are not shown. An asterisk (*) is displayed in the place of a suppressed estimate or any value based on a suppressed estimate (i.e., rate, RSE, percent change, lower CI, upper CI). "}
