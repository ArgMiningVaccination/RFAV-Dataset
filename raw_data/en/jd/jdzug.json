When they come together, they create a multi-sensory healing experience that can be done in the comfort of your own home. AromaPoint Therapy (APT) is a simple yet powerful practice to enhance emotional well-being. APT utilizes high quality essential oils applied to specific acupuncture points. Using a foundational knowledge of Chinese Herbal Medicine, hand-selected oils are used in conjunction with certain acupuncture points for added impact. A number of aspects are taken into consideration in this pairing. For example, using the root of a plant (which is very descending and grounding in nature) on an acu point that also shares those characteristics, reinforces one another to create a doubly-effective treatment. APT is especially effective in treating trauma, grief, anxiety, and emotional imbalances. It can be used as a beautiful self-care practice but is also a great way to connect with a partner or family member. Try incorporating some deep breathing or meditation/prayer while applying the oils for enhanced benefit. Please note: Essential oils are extremely potent and concentrated. When using essential oils, it's important to be informed of the quality and to choose pure, unadulterated oils with proper dilution when necessary. I like Monara's high quality oils which can be purchased [here](https://www.monara.org/oils). Or, you can buy locally from [SoBotanical](https://www.sobotanical.com/). If using a non-Monara brand of oils, it's best to dilute the oil prior to applying. To dilute, choose a carrier oil such as jojoba, avocado, coconut, or grapeseed. Mix 9 drops of essential oil per 1 TBSP of oil. For children, dilution must be adjusted accordingly. High quality pediatric essential oils that are already diluted can be found [here](https://www.bluedolphineo.com/). Encouraging Emotional Balance with APT The following is a 5-point protocol to assist with balancing emotions during this uncertain time. When choosing the oils and points that best fit your needs, you can opt to start with one or two oil/point pairings that resonate the most, or you can apply the entire series for a more well-rounded general treatment. Instructions: - Place 1 drop of oil on the designated finger. - Lightly place the finger on the acupuncture point. The idea is to have a very light amount of pressure, almost as if your finger is grazing the point, rather than pressing into it. - As you hold your finger on the point, close your eyes and take several deep breaths. You can do this for 30-45 seconds or until you feel a subtle shift in your body's energy or your emotions.
