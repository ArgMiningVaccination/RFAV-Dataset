Get detailed information about cancer therapy interactions with different foods and dietary supplements in this clinician summary. Cancer Therapy Interactions With Foods and Dietary Supplements Overview This [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English) information summary provides an overview on cancer [therapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044737&version=Patient&language=English) interactions with different foods and [dietary supplements](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000373932&version=Patient&language=English). This summary contains the following key information: - The combination of cancer [drugs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English)taken by patients and the [complementary and alternative medicine](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044964&version=Patient&language=English)used may interact, causing [adverse outcomes](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044922&version=Patient&language=English). - Research on dietary supplement and cancer drug [pharmacokinetics](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044324&version=Patient&language=English)(PK) [interactions](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454754&version=Patient&language=English)is limited, but there is evidence for several possible interactions and adverse reactions. - For many specific [antioxidant](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000043997&version=Patient&language=English)supplements, there is insufficient information available to determine if they are safe and effective as a complementary therapy to [standard](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044930&version=Patient&language=English)cancer treatment. - Certain constituents of foods and dietary supplements (e.g., [St. John's wort](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044957&version=Patient&language=English), grapefruit juice, and [epigallocatechin gallate](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000687277&version=Patient&language=English)from green tea) can alter the PK of specific types of drugs. - Some research has shown a dietary supplement/food and drug PK interaction between grapefruit juice and [imatinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044893&version=Patient&language=English). General Information For adult [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English) patients in the United States, the frequency of [complementary and alternative medicine](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044964&version=Patient&language=English) (CAM) use is approximately 36%. It is possible that the combination of cancer [drugs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English) taken by these patients and the CAM they use may interact, causing [adverse outcomes](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044922&version=Patient&language=English). When [dietary supplements](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000373932&version=Patient&language=English)/herbs and cancer drugs are taken together, there is always a risk of the supplement having an impact on the [pharmacokinetics](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044324&version=Patient&language=English) (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) of the drug. Many [drug interactions](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454754&version=Patient&language=English) occur from the effects of the supplement on specific [enzymes](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046081&version=Patient&language=English) or on components involved in the PK of the drug, such as how the drug is metabolized and transported. Reporting and studying these interactions is important, so health care professionals can help patients navigate CAM usage with [standard](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044930&version=Patient&language=English) cancer [therapies](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044737&version=Patient&language=English), thus avoiding preventable adverse outcomes. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs. Therefore, premarket evaluation and approval of such supplements by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454785&version=Patient&language=English) (FDA) are not required unless specific disease [prevention](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000439419&version=Patient&language=English) or treatment claims are made. Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of dietary supplements as a treatment for cancer patients. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors/Inducers One of the main group of enzymes involved in the [metabolism](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046173&version=Patient&language=English) of many cancer drugs is the [cytochrome P450](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000390266&version=Patient&language=English) (CYP) superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes play an important role in the [activation](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000043976&version=Patient&language=English) and inactivation of various drugs. Another component involved in the metabolism and [excretion](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000476338&version=Patient&language=English) of many drugs is the transport [protein](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046092&version=Patient&language=English), [P-glycoprotein](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000643067&version=Patient&language=English) (P-gp). P-gp works in the [intestine](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046335&version=Patient&language=English) as a drug efflux pump regulating the [bioavailability](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044225&version=Patient&language=English) of the drug. Various anticancer drugs are substrates of P-gp; thus, if P-gp or any CYP enzyme is impacted, the drug it is processing will also be impacted. The PK of a drug predicts [therapeutic](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000043985&version=Patient&language=English) outcomes for the patient. Various [herbs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000463714&version=Patient&language=English) and dietary supplements are known to influence the PK of certain drugs, such as [St. John's wort](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044957&version=Patient&language=English). Currently, research on dietary supplement and cancer drug PK interactions is limited, but there is evidence for several possible interactions and adverse reactions.

Antioxidants levels antioxidants, [deoxyribonucleic acid](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044393&version=Patient&language=English) damage, and [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English) [cell](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046476&version=Patient&language=English) death. Antioxidants are taken by many cancer patients because it is thought that the substances will protect and repair healthy cells damaged by cancer [therapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044737&version=Patient&language=English). There is insufficient information for many specific antioxidant supplements to determine if they are safe and effective as a complementary therapy to [standard](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044930&version=Patient&language=English) cancer treatment. Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies A study published in 2018 examined the pharmacokinetic interactions between [imatinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044893&version=Patient&language=English) (25 [mg](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044213&version=Patient&language=English)/ [kg](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044576&version=Patient&language=English) [orally](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044068&version=Patient&language=English)) and (400 [IU](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454523&version=Patient&language=English)/kg orally), [vitamin D3](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000427252&version=Patient&language=English) (100 IU/kg orally), and vitamin C (500 mg/kg orally) when coadministered in rat [animal models](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000043996&version=Patient&language=English). The results showed that there was an increase in the [bioavailability](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044225&version=Patient&language=English) of imatinib with vitamins A, E , and D, and a decrease in the bioavailability of imatinib with vitamin C. A study that examined the oxidized form of ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, as a complementary supplement [vincristine](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000615324&version=Patient&language=English), that dehydroascorbate before doxorubicin treatment caused a reduction of in mice lymphoma (RL) cell-derived xenogeneic [tumors](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046634&version=Patient&language=English), This form of ascorbate is not generally available as a [dietary supplement](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000373932&version=Patient&language=English) and is not used clinically, and it has different properties and [pharmacology](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000463167&version=Patient&language=English) from unoxidized or reduced ascorbate; thus, the potential [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044168&version=Patient&language=English) implications of these findings are unknown. An [in vivo](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046352&version=Patient&language=English) [mouse model](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000561606&version=Patient&language=English) study observed a possible interaction between vitamin C (40 mg/kg/d) and [bortezomib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000269133&version=Patient&language=English). There was a significant reduction in bortezomib's anticancer activities with consumption of vitamin C. Human/Clinical Studies A study examined pre- and post- [diagnosis](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046450&version=Patient&language=English) antioxidant dietary supplement ( [selenium](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045113&version=Patient&language=English); multivitamins; zinc; and E) use in [postmenopausal](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045269&version=Patient&language=English) [breast cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000444971&version=Patient&language=English) [survivors.](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000450125&version=Patient&language=English) The results showed an increased risk of total [mortality](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000496502&version=Patient&language=English) and worsened [recurrence](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045861&version=Patient&language=English)-free survival with antioxidant dietary supplement use during [chemotherapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045214&version=Patient&language=English) or [radiation therapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044971&version=Patient&language=English). A similar study investigated the outcomes for breast cancer patients using antioxidant supplements (vitamins A, C, and E; [carotenoids](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046132&version=Patient&language=English); and [coenzyme Q10)](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000346488&version=Patient&language=English) before and during treatment with [cyclophosphamide](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045253&version=Patient&language=English), doxorubicin, and [paclitaxel](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045258&version=Patient&language=English). The results showed an increase in hazards of recurrence and death in these patients. Though these [hazard ratios](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000618612&version=Patient&language=English) are not [statistically significant](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044167&version=Patient&language=English), they both trended in the same direction as those seen in the previous study. This evidence does give reason to use these supplements with caution and indicates that more research on this topic is needed. [Alpha-tocopherol](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000691423&version=Patient&language=English), one of eight vitamin E [compounds](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000422394&version=Patient&language=English), was investigated in a [clinical trial](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045961&version=Patient&language=English) for its impact on [adverse effects](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044922&version=Patient&language=English) from chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Initially, some research suggested that alpha-tocopherol may reduce [toxicity](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000445093&version=Patient&language=English) caused by radiation therapy for [head and neck cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000257519&version=Patient&language=English). Two [randomized](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045858&version=Patient&language=English), [controlled clinical trials](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044014&version=Patient&language=English) of patients with head and neck cancer who received vitamin E supplementation at a [dose](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044664&version=Patient&language=English) of 400 IU/day have shown an association with a higher risk of tumor [relapse](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045866&version=Patient&language=English) and a decrease in cancer-free survival.

Herbs Ginseng General information [Ginseng](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044151&version=Patient&language=English) root has commonly been used as a [dietary supplement](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000373932&version=Patient&language=English) in [traditional Asian medicine](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000449722&version=Patient&language=English). There are several types of ginsengs. While there is no conclusive evidence for the health benefits of ginseng, people currently use it for the following reasons: - To increase overall well-being and concentration. - To strengthen the [immune system](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046356&version=Patient&language=English). - To improve health [conditions](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000651193&version=Patient&language=English), such [pharmacokinetic](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044324&version=Patient&language=English) (PK) [interactions](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454754&version=Patient&language=English) found little evidence of any effects, a low risk of [cytochrome P450](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000390266&version=Patient&language=English) (CYP)-dependent [herb](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000463714&version=Patient&language=English)- [drug](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English) reactions. Overall, the evidence is mixed and inconclusive. Case study Ginseng was suspected of being responsible for an incident of hepatotoxicity that occurred in a 26-year-old male taking [imatinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044893&version=Patient&language=English). The [hypothesized](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044209&version=Patient&language=English) [mechanism](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000797426&version=Patient&language=English) for this interaction was inhibition CYP3A4, the [enzyme](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046081&version=Patient&language=English) primarily responsible for [metabolizing](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046173&version=Patient&language=English) imatinib. The ginseng was [ingested](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044100&version=Patient&language=English) through a ginseng energy drink, which creates uncertainty about whether the ginseng or the other ingredients in the drink caused the [adverse effect](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044922&version=Patient&language=English). [Clinical research](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000774488&version=Patient&language=English) is needed to confirm if there are any PK interactions between imatinib and ginseng. Scutellaria baicalensis/wogonin General information Scutellaria baicalensis, also known as wogonin, Chinese skullcap, or Huang Qin, is a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat various medical [conditions](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000651193&version=Patient&language=English), such as the following: In traditional Chinese medicine, there are some [herbal](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000463714&version=Patient&language=English) mixtures that contain Scutellaria baicalensis, one being Huang Qin Tang. PHY906, a patented formula derived from Huang Qin Tang, is being studied as a potential adjuvant for [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English) [therapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044737&version=Patient&language=English); there is some evidence that this herbal mixture potentiates the anticancer effects of certain cancer [drugs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English) such as [sorafenib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000509041&version=Patient&language=English). Some research has shown the inhibitory effect of wogonin on the activity of CYP, but more research is needed to determine [interactions](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454754&version=Patient&language=English) with specific drugs. Laboratory/animal/preclinical studies A 2016 study investigated the effects of a Scutellariae radix decoction on methotrexate pharmacokinetics in rats. The study revealed an increased [systemic](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045921&version=Patient&language=English) methotrexate exposure when given together with the Scutellariae radix decoction. Giving them together is thought to have effects on [multidrug resistance](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045790&version=Patient&language=English)-associated [proteins](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046092&version=Patient&language=English) and [breast cancer resistance protein](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000791448&version=Patient&language=English). A 2018 study examined the PK profile and herb-drug interactions of [oral](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044068&version=Patient&language=English) wogonin and [intravenous](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046682&version=Patient&language=English) [docetaxel](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045382&version=Patient&language=English) in rats with mammary tumors. The investigators found that in rats receiving oral wogonin and docetaxel, the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), initial peak serum concentration (Cmax), and half-life for docetaxel increased. The investigators speculated that these increases resulted from the inhibitory effect of wogonin on CYP3A and [P-glycoprotein](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000643067&version=Patient&language=English) (P-gp). More research is needed with human [clinical trials](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045961&version=Patient&language=English), but these results suggest a possible interaction between wogonin and docetaxel. St. John's Wort General information The flower of the St. John's wort (SJW) ( [Hypericum perforatum](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044462&version=Patient&language=English)) plant is [wound](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000441269&version=Patient&language=English) healing, [insomnia](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044043&version=Patient&language=English), and [kidney](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046325&version=Patient&language=English) and [lung](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000270740&version=Patient&language=English) problems, and most commonly today for [depression](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000430479&version=Patient&language=English). This flower can be taken through teas, tablets, [capsules](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000455334&version=Patient&language=English), and [extracts](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000407760&version=Patient&language=English). Currently, the evidence for the [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044168&version=Patient&language=English) [efficacy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000346517&version=Patient&language=English) of SJW is varied, but there have been reports of [interactions](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454754&version=Patient&language=English) and adverse effects with several [drugs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English). Laboratory/animal/preclinical studies A 2012 study observed the effects of SJW on the PK of [methotrexate](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045393&version=Patient&language=English) in a [mg](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044213&version=Patient&language=English)/ [kg](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044576&version=Patient&language=English) and methotrexate, animals that received 300 mg/kg of SJW had a 163% increase in AUC and a 60% increase in Cmax for methotrexate. For animals that received 150 mg/kg of SJW, an increase in AUC (55%) for methotrexate was observed. Overall, the [mortality](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000496502&version=Patient&language=English) of the rats treated with SJW combined with methotrexate was higher. The researchers suggested using extreme caution if coadministering these two substances. Human/clinical studies There are two well-known examples of herb-drug interactions impacting drug PK that have clinical evidence. These two interactions are between SJW and both [irinotecan](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000635811&version=Patient&language=English) and [imatinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044893&version=Patient&language=English). After patients were treated with both irinotecan (350 mg/m2) and SJW (900 mg/d), one study found a 42% decrease in [plasma](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045839&version=Patient&language=English) levels of SN-38, the active [metabolite](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000462687&version=Patient&language=English) of irinotecan. The researchers hypothesized that components of SJW pseudohypericin and hyperforin, interacted with CYP3A4 isoform and P-gp, causing reduction in SN-38. This interaction may cause a loss of irinotecan efficacy. A similar [outcome](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000467853&version=Patient&language=English) occurred in two studies that examined treatment with imatinib (400 mg) and SJW (300 mg 3 times a day). In one study, SJW caused a 32% decrease in AUC, a 29% decrease in Cmax, and a 21% decrease in half-life after two weeks of combined treatment with SJW and imatinib. The second study found that SJW use caused a 43% increase in the clearance of imatinib and a 30% decrease in AUC. This interaction is also thought to be caused by the impact of SJW on CYP3A4, the major [enzyme](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046081&version=Patient&language=English) that metabolizes imatinib. Another CYP3A4 substrate that may be impacted by SJW is [docetaxel](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045382&version=Patient&language=English). A 2014 study with ten [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English) patients investigated the PK interactions of docetaxel (135 mg [IV](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046326&version=Patient&language=English) for 60 min) in combination with SJW (300 mg [orally](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044068&version=Patient&language=English) for 14 days). The results showed a [statistically significant](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044167&version=Patient&language=English) decrease of 12% in [mean](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000285973&version=Patient&language=English) AUC and an increased clearance of docetaxel. Although there is a lack of published research, the use of SJW in patients undergoing treatment with [ixabepilone](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000367463&version=Patient&language=English) is not recommended. SJW may cause a decrease in plasma concentrations of ixabepilone. The drug label for ixabepilone states a warning for this possible interaction. Thunder God Vine General information Thunder god vine, also known as Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f, is an herb traditionally used in Chinese medicine for its possible [anti-inflammatory](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044187&version=Patient&language=English), immunosuppressant, and anticancer effects. Studies have found that triptolide and celastrol, the active components of thunder god vine, are responsible for these possible effects. Clinical observations, mostly from China, reported significant multiorgan [toxicities](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000445093&version=Patient&language=English) from the traditional raw material or the extracts. Deaths associated with ingesting these materials have been frequently reported. Frequency of severe-grade adverse events from the extracts ranged from 5% to 8%, with the global [incidence](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046145&version=Patient&language=English) of adverse events at 30.8% (95% confidence interval, 21.2-40.3). The most frequently reported adverse varies for herb-drug interactions and toxicity, which are potentially caused by inhibiting effects on the activity of the CYP450 enzyme system. CYP3A4) in In addition, a study also found that the coadministration of the CYP3A4 inhibitor, [ritonavir](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045535&version=Patient&language=English), or the inducer, [dexamethasone](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045262&version=Patient&language=English), leads to a significant increase or decrease of the plasma concentration levels of triptolide. Laboratory/animal/preclinical studies A 2017 study investigated the effects of triptolide (10 mg/kg) on the PKs of three different sorafenib [doses](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044664&version=Patient&language=English) (20, 50, and 100 mg/kg) in rats. The results showed an increase in Cmax and AUC for each sorafenib dose and a decrease in clearance with pretreatment of triptolide. It is hypothesized that this interaction occurred due to triptolide's possible inhibiting effects on P-gp and CYP3A4 enzymatic activity. References - Wang CZ, Ginseng, American.

Foods Grapefruit General information Grapefruit and other similar fruits, such as Seville orange, pomelo, and lime, have been known to [interact](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454754&version=Patient&language=English) with a variety of [drugs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English), including some anticancer drugs. These [pharmacokinetic](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044324&version=Patient&language=English) interactions may be caused by the furanocoumarin components found in the seeds of grapefruit. These components have been observed impacting the [metabolism](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046173&version=Patient&language=English) of substrates of CYP3A4. Laboratory/animal/preclinical studies Grapefruit and its furanocoumarin components have been studied for their potential [antioxidative](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000043997&version=Patient&language=English), [anti-inflammatory](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044187&version=Patient&language=English), and anticancer effects in [in vitro](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045733&version=Patient&language=English) and [in vivo](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046352&version=Patient&language=English) studies. Human/clinical studies Some research has shown a dietary supplement/food and drug PK interaction between grapefruit juice and [imatinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044893&version=Patient&language=English). Grapefruit juice may cause [plasma](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045839&version=Patient&language=English) levels of imatinib to increase by inhibiting CYP3A4, in turn triggering [organ](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000257523&version=Patient&language=English) [toxicity](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000445093&version=Patient&language=English). An interaction has been observed between grapefruit juice and [etoposide](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045189&version=Patient&language=English). A [randomized](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045858&version=Patient&language=English), [crossover](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000797424&version=Patient&language=English), [pilot study](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045838&version=Patient&language=English) of six the [oral chemotherapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000689103&version=Patient&language=English) drug etoposide after coadministration of grapefruit juice. The data showed a decrease in bioavailability between the [control group](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044149&version=Patient&language=English) and the [experimental group](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000774371&version=Patient&language=English), who were treated with etoposide and grapefruit juice. The bioavailability of etoposide (50 mg [orally](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044068&version=Patient&language=English)) reduced from approximately 73% to 52% after pretreatment with grapefruit juice (100 [mL](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044214&version=Patient&language=English)). This resulted in a decrease in the area under the [concentration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000683342&version=Patient&language=English) versus time curve (AUC) by 26% for etoposide with grapefruit juice, compared with etoposide alone. Other studies have found an increase in the bioavailability of [sunitinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000468779&version=Patient&language=English) with grapefruit juice exposure, and an increase in AUC by 29% and an increase in peak [serum](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044088&version=Patient&language=English) concentration (Cmax) by 60% for [nilotinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000575396&version=Patient&language=English) (400 mg orally) was also observed when combined with grapefruit juice (240 mL). Green Tea General information Green tea, [green tea extract](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000389271&version=Patient&language=English), and products of green tea components are commonly taken as foods, [dietary supplements](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000373932&version=Patient&language=English), and [herbal](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000463714&version=Patient&language=English) [therapies](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044737&version=Patient&language=English). Some of the traditional and modern uses of green tea include the following: - Preventing and treating [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English). - Lowering [cholesterol](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000407756&version=Patient&language=English). - Promoting weight loss. - Improving mental alertness. - Helping with [digestive](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046446&version=Patient&language=English) [symptoms](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045022&version=Patient&language=English). Research has been mixed on whether green tea is safe or effective for these uses as well as for coadministration with anticancer [drugs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English). Current research shows that green tea and the [polyphenol](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000256573&version=Patient&language=English) [epigallocatechin gallate](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000687277&version=Patient&language=English) (EGCG), an [antioxidant](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000043997&version=Patient&language=English) component of green tea, impact the PK or pharmacodynamics (PD) of certain [drugs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English), thus impacting the metabolism and effectiveness of these drugs. Laboratory/animal/preclinical studies As seen in the literature, green tea and its constituent EGCG may be involved in both PK and PD interactions. An interaction between green tea and [bortezomib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000269133&version=Patient&language=English) was examined in an in vitro study with human the boronic [acid](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000642987&version=Patient&language=English) structure in bortezomib, causing the inability to induce cancer [cell](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046476&version=Patient&language=English) death and consequently blocking its anticancer abilities. The second portion of this study investigated this interaction within a [plasmacytoma](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046231&version=Patient&language=English) [xenograft](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044095&version=Patient&language=English) nude [mouse model](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000561606&version=Patient&language=English). Bortezomib's cancer prevented with intragastric EGCG [administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000478733&version=Patient&language=English) (50 mg/kg). This interaction was also reported another [animal study](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454774&version=Patient&language=English) that examined human [prostate cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000445079&version=Patient&language=English) xenografts models. High [intravenous](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046682&version=Patient&language=English) of EGCG along with the coadministration of bortezomib resulted in the abrogation of bortezomib's anticancer effects. Human studies should be conducted to determine [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044168&version=Patient&language=English) significance. The impact of green tea and EGCG on [fluorouracil](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046090&version=Patient&language=English) PK was studied in rats. The results of these studies showed a 151% increase in Cmax and a 425% increase in AUC for fluorouracil. The researchers concluded that green tea greatly impacted the PK of fluorouracil. A similar study examined the PK of [irinotecan](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000635811&version=Patient&language=English) (10 mg/kg IV) given in combination with EGCG (20 mg/kg IV) in rats and found that EGCG caused elevated [plasma](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045839&version=Patient&language=English) levels and reduced [hepatobiliary](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000415544&version=Patient&language=English) excretion of irinotecan and its [metabolite](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000462687&version=Patient&language=English) SN-38. This because of EGCG's inhibitory effects on [P-glycoprotein](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000643067&version=Patient&language=English) (Pgp). A 2019 study evaluated the effects of green tea extract on the PK of [palbociclib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000768872&version=Patient&language=English) in a rat [animal model](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000043996&version=Patient&language=English). The data showed a decrease in the [oral](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044068&version=Patient&language=English) [bioavailability](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044225&version=Patient&language=English) of palbociclib when it was coadministered with green tea extract, but there was no impact on the elimination of palbociclib. The [altered](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044643&version=Patient&language=English) PK was thought to be the result of interference in the [absorption](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000463702&version=Patient&language=English) of palbociclib. The authors recommended against the coadministration of these [compounds](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000422394&version=Patient&language=English). Research on rat animal models investigated the impact of green tea extract on the oral bioavailability of [erlotinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000508929&version=Patient&language=English) and [lapatinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000539453&version=Patient&language=English). A decrease in the oral bioavailability for erlotinib and lapatinib was observed after consumption of green tea extract (200 mg/kg). There was a decrease in AUC by 68% for erlotinib and 70% for lapatinib with short-term administration of green tea extract, and a decrease in AUC by 16% for erlotinib and 14% for lapatinib with long-term administration of green tea extract. An in vivo and in vitro study examined the impacts of intragastric coadministration of [sunitinib](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000468779&version=Patient&language=English) with EGCG. Coadministration of these two solutions resulted in the formation of a precipitate in the [stomachs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046604&version=Patient&language=English) of the mice, thus decreasing its bioavailability. It was also reported that a decrease in the AUC and Cmax of plasma sunitinib with EGCG administration in rats resulted in reduced sunitinib absorption. A possible interaction was also found between EGCG and tamoxifen. A 2009 study assessed the bioavailability and PK of [tamoxifen](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000509341&version=Patient&language=English) (2 mg/kg) mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats. The coadministration of EGCG at doses of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg caused a 49% to 78% increase in the bioavailability of tamoxifen. In addition, EGCG significantly impacted the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. It is believed that this reaction was caused by EGCG's inhibitory effect on Pgp and CYP3A. However, a subsequent study analyzed the effect of a green tea extract (1 g twice daily, 300 mg EGCG) on endoxifen (active metabolite of tamoxifen) levels. The study did not demonstrate a PK interaction between the green tea supplement and endoxifen levels. The findings of the [preclinical studies](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044517&version=Patient&language=English) provide a justification and motivation for human studies to determine appropriate clinical recommendations. Case study In addition to the in vitro and in vivo EGCG and sunitinib study mentioned above, the same researchers published a case study that might demonstrate a possible [adverse effect](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044922&version=Patient&language=English) of green tea consumption with sunitinib treatment. A male patient with [metastatic](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044058&version=Patient&language=English) [renal cell carcinoma](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000661352&version=Patient&language=English) who received sunitinib reported worsened symptoms of hyperemia and eye swelling near the site of a metastatic [lesion](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046324&version=Patient&language=English) when drinking green tea; the symptoms improved when he stopped taking green tea. The authors hypothesized that the lack of [symptom control](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000269453&version=Patient&language=English) may result from EGCG's effects on sunitinib's anticancer abilities.

Summary of the Evidence for Cancer Therapy Interactions With Foods and Dietary Supplements To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English), the strength of the evidence (i.e., the [levels of evidence](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000446533&version=Patient&language=English)) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever possible. To qualify for a level of evidence [analysis](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000390238&version=Patient&language=English), a study must: - Be published in a [peer-reviewed scientific journal](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000537399&version=Patient&language=English). - Report on a [therapeutic](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000043985&version=Patient&language=English) [outcome](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000467853&version=Patient&language=English)or outcomes, such as [tumor](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046634&version=Patient&language=English) [response](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044085&version=Patient&language=English), improvement in survival, or measured improvement in [quality of life](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045417&version=Patient&language=English). - Describe [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044168&version=Patient&language=English)findings in sufficient detail that a meaningful evaluation can be made. Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and [scientific](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044724&version=Patient&language=English) strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., [endpoints](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000346519&version=Patient&language=English)) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For an explanation of the scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies. Changes to This Summary (05/26/2022) The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available. This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. Herbs Added text to state that a 2016 study investigated the effects of a Scutellariae radix decoction on methotrexate pharmacokinetics in rats. The study revealed an increased systemic methotrexate exposure when given together with the Scutellariae radix decoction. Giving them together is thought to have effects on multidrug resistance-associated proteins and breast cancer resistance protein (cited Yu et al. as reference 10). This summary is written and maintained by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam), which is editorially independent of NCI. The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or NIH. More information about summary policies and the role of the PDQ Editorial Boards in maintaining the PDQ summaries can be found on the About This PDQ Summary and [PDQ\u00ae - NCI's Comprehensive Cancer Database](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq) pages. About This PDQ Summary Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about cancer therapy interactions with foods and dietary supplements in people with cancer.. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions. Reviewers and Updates This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam), which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should: - be discussed at a meeting, - be cited with text, or - replace or update an existing article that is already cited. Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary. Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's [Email Us](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us). Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries. Levels of Evidence Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board uses a formal evidence ranking system in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
