Here's an article about how to recognize those signs. Cloudy thinking - A mental fog makes it difficult to think clearly, obscuring opportunities and solutions. Procrastination - Postponing a needed action is often a sign you're off-purpose or unsure what it is. Lack of concentration - Succumbing to the distraction of the Internet, email and other shiny objects can be an effective tactic. Worry - Rehearsing what you don't want is not only counterproductive, it squelches your creativity and problem-solving abilities. Fear - A spiritual oppression that can only exist without faith, seducing you to live in a future that hasn't happened. And probably won't. Depression - Anger (without enthusiasm) is a gold mine for drug companies, allowing the anger to go unforgiven. A common deception is that spiritual oppression doesn't exist. While chiropractic care is a good start, addressing spiritual subluxations requires spiritual tools such as prayer, fasting, gratitude and forgiveness. "}
