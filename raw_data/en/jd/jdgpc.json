In 2012 and 2013, coverage for DTaP4+, PCV4+, and the full series of Hib remained at similar levels (81% -83%) These vaccines require a booster dose during the second year of life, when the opportunities for catch -up doses with these vaccines are fewer because of declining frequency of well -child visits. MMWR 2014;63(34):741 -8 Why Does Coverage Fall For The Full Series? Patients do not return don't know they were supposed to come back knew but forgot, too busy, no appointment, other reasons Patients return but insufficient interval since prior dose (not eligible for the dose) vaccines not offered vaccines offered but refused Recommendations and Reinforcement For all: reinforce the need to return verbal written reminder link to calendar event For those who return: recommend the vaccine clinician recommendation is a powerful motivator likely to follow recommendation of the provider A health care encounter in which a person is eligible to receive vaccination but is not vaccinated completely Missed Opportunity Causes of Missed Opportunities Lack of simultaneous administration Unaware child needs additional vaccines Invalid contraindications Avoidance of accelerated schedule Inappropriate clinic policies How To Improve Full Series Coverage CDC recommends the use of clinician and system -based interventions to increase opportunities for vaccination, including use of immunization information systems (IIS ) clinician assessment and feedback clinician reminders standing orders MMWR 2014;63(34):741 -8 http://health.mo.gov/living/wellness/immunizations/ You Cannot Fix What You Do Not Recognize as a Problem Immunization providers often do not know the vaccination levels in their practices Providers overestimate coverage in their office by 10% or more Knowledge of actual vaccination coverage level leads to positive interventions Bordeley et al.

Presented before Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting, 1999 Office Coverage Assessment and Feedback Immunization level in your practice is determined by reviewing a sample of charts Provides helpful diagnostic information is your coverage as high as you think it is? what can you do to improve your practice? Reminder and Recall Systems Reminders inform that vaccines are due Recalls inform that vaccines are overdue Do no need to be computerized or complicated post card, telephone, autodialer centralized registry Reminder/recall conducted in practice settings shown to increase rates by 5%- 20% Recall card Reminder card Reminders and Recall to Providers Communication to health care providers that an individual client's immunizations are due soon or past due Examples computer -generated list stamped note in the chart \"Immunization Due\" clip on chart Standing Orders Definition a written order stipulating that all persons meeting certain criteria (such as age or underlying medical condition) should be vaccinated eliminates the need for individual physician's orders for each patient Advantage consistently effective method for increasing vaccination rates and the easiest to implement Disadvantage only reach people already contacting the health care system Standing Orders Implementation Steps The clinician: decides on the criteria that will be used to indicate patient eligibility for vaccination and for specific vaccines writes (or signs) the standing order meets with staff to discuss implementation of the standing order strategy Impact of Standing Orders on Adolescent Immunization Rates, Denver Health, 2013 Kempe A, unpublished data, 2014 www.immunize.org www.immunize.org Summary Pertussis is still a threat Inadequate full series coverage puts children at risk Immunity from DTaP wanes in the months following the last dose The 4th dose of DTaP is critical to protect children until the last dose at 4 -6 years of age Many strategies can improve vaccination levels especially reminder/recall and standing orders "}
