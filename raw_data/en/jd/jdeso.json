Most people say they feel better if they eat a nutritious and balanced diet. On the other hand, for some people, poor nutrition may contribute to the onset or severity of depression. One of the most common mental disorders, depression affects about [322 million people](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-2455-2) It's a serious but highly treatable mental health condition characterized by: - increased sadness - loss of appetite - low mood - loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities - significant changes in sleep - increases or decreases in appetite, weight, or both [psychomotor agitation](https://psychcentral.com/bipolar/psychomotor-agitation)or retardation (i.e., your mental and physical activities either hightened or slowed down) - frequent [fatigue](https://psychcentral.com/depression/depression-and-fatigue)or low energy - feelings of [worthlessness](https://psychcentral.com/depression/worthlessness-and-depression) - difficulty concentrating - thoughts of death or [suicide](https://psychcentral.com/lib/suicide-prevention-hotline-number) While depression treatment typically entails medication, therapy, or both, [self-help strategies](https://psychcentral.com/depression/natural-remedies-for-depression), including dietary supplements, may work as an addendum to traditional treatment to help reduce symptoms. To keep in mind It's generally recommended to get your vitamins and other nutrients through the foods you eat. Research on the effectiveness of vitamin supplements for depression is often mixed, and what works for one person may not work for another. Therefore, it's vital to speak with your treatment team before trying a supplement to discuss safety, ideal dosage, and possible medication interactions.

Depression has been linked to low levels of certain neurotransmitters (chemical messengers in your body), including: In some cases, nutritional deficiencies can alter or worsen these important mood-boosting chemicals. Keep in mind that research is often mixed or lacking on whether taking a vitamin supplement is effective in increasing the production of neurotransmitters and reducing [symptoms of depression](https://psychcentral.com/depression/top-signs-symptoms-of-depression). Vitamin D Vitamin D is often low in people with depression and other mental disorders. For example, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908269/) Exposure to sunlight accounts for more than [90%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908269/) Good [sources of vitamin D](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-foods-for-vegetarians) include: - exposure to sunlight (5-30 minutes at least twice a week) [cod liver oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-benefits-of-cod-liver-oil) - flesh of fatty fish like trout, salmon, or tuna - mushrooms - fortified milk - egg yolk - fortified cereals Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, so taking excessive amounts can be [toxic](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-vitamin-d-is-too-much). In extreme cases, vitamin D toxicity may lead to kidney failure or an [irregular heartbeat](https://www.healthline.com/health/arrhythmia/arrhythmia-diagnosis). Medications that [may interfere](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) [statins](https://www.healthline.com/health/high-cholesterol/statins-uses-side-effects)(to diuretics](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diuretics#types) Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin required for a healthy central nervous system, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. A deficiency in B12 has been linked to psychiatric symptoms, such as: - irritability - personality change [depression](https://psychcentral.com/depression/depression) - dementia [psychosis](https://psychcentral.com/lib/psychosis-overview)(in rare cases) In one [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856388/) Participants with low levels of vitamin B12, as well as some with lower standard levels, were given prescriptions for B12 replacement therapy along with antidepressants. At a 3-months follow-up, all participants in the treatment group showed at least a 20% reduction in depressive symptoms. Good food [sources of vitamin B12](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-b12-foods) include: - beef liver - clams - tuna - fortified yeast - milk - yogurt - fortified cereals Vitamin B12 has a low risk of toxicity because it's water-soluble and the body doesn't store it in excess amounts. Medications that [can interfere](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/) - medications to reduce stomach the generic term for naturally occurring food folates as well as folates found in supplements and fortified foods. While some people use the terms [folate and folic acid](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate) interchangeably, folic acid (pteroylmonoglutamic acid) refers to the synthetic form of vitamin B9. Low levels of folate have been linked to depression, and in some cases, a poor response to antidepressants. In a [2003 U.S. population study](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/68692) of 2,948 people, ages 15 to 39, folate concentrations were significantly lower in people with major depression, compared to those who did not have depression. Plus, a [2020 study](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-2455-2) Good [sources of vitamin B9](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-high-in-folate-folic-acid) include: - spinach and other dark leafy green vegetables - liver - asparagus - Brussels sprouts - black-eyed peas Medications that [can interfere](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-HealthProfessional/) [methotrexate](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323500)(to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases) - antiepileptic medications [sulfasalazine](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/sulfasalazine-oral-tablet)(to treat ulcerative colitis) Vitamin C Vitamin C, or L-ascorbic acid, is a critical vitamin required for several functions in the body, including immune function and the production of collagen and neurotransmitters. It also helps reduce chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, which [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4316245/) Good [sources of vitamin C](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-foods) include: - oranges and orange juice - grapefruit and grapefruit juice - bell peppers - kiwi - broccoli - strawberries - Brussels sprouts Vitamin C has a very low risk for toxicity. Medication and treatment that [may interfere](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#h20) - chemotherapy and radiation - statins Niacin (B3) [Niacin](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/niacin-benefits), or nicotinic acid (NA), is a water-soluble B vitamin critical for many functions in the body, including mood. Although the average adult needs only about [14 to 16 mg](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Niacin-HealthProfessional/) Several case studies have shown that niacin can lead to significant benefits in people with severe psychiatric disorders, including [schizophrenia](https://psychcentral.com/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-overview) and [bipolar disorder depression](https://psychcentral.com/bipolar/what-bipolar-depression-looks-like-and-what-can-help). In one [2018 case study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852710/) To treat his anxiety, he was prescribed [Niaspan](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/niacin-oral-tablet) (nicotinic acid extended-release) at 1,000 mg twice a day. After 6 weeks, he reported: - better sleep - feelings of positivity - normalized blood pressure - no [suicidal thoughts](https://psychcentral.com/health/coping-with-suicidal-thoughts-like-i-want-to-die) At the time of the case study, the man had been taking niacin for more than 11 years. He had been stable and in a good mental health condition all this time without any other psychiatric drugs (he had slowly weaned off his medications). It's essential to keep in mind that this was a single case study of bipolar disorder depression. It's unclear whether supplementing with vitamin B3 may also help people with other types of depression. Good sources of niacin include: - beef and beef liver - chicken - turkey - tuna - brown rice - fortified cereals Nicotinic acid, particularly in large doses, can cause [skin flushing](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/niacin-flush) \u2014 a result of the dilation of small blood vessels. This is a harmless \u2014 although somewhat uncomfortable \u2014 effect that leads to tingling, burning, and itching sensations. If you want to avoid flushing you can opt for nicotinamide \u2014 a niacin supplement with a slightly different chemical structure that does not cause flushing. Medications that [can interfere](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Niacin-HealthProfessional/) - isoniazid and pyrazinamide (together in Rifater; to treat tuberculosis) - antidiabetes medications Several minerals have been linked to depression. Still, as with vitamins, research is often lacking or mixed on whether supplementing with these minerals may help improve symptoms. Magnesium Most magnesium has been removed from the heavily processed Western diet. Only [16%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507265/) Low levels of magnesium can harm your brain and lead to mood problems. There is increasing evidence that severe magnesium deficiencies in the Western diet may be linked to an increased risk for major depression. One [2015 study](https://www.jabfm.org/content/28/2/249) found a significant link between very low magnesium intake and depression, especially in younger adults. Good [sources of magnesium](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-foods-high-in-magnesium) include: - spinach and other leafy green vegetables - nuts - legumes - seeds - whole grains Medications that [can interfere](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/) [bisphosphonates](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/osteoporosis-medication#antiresorptive-agents)(to treat osteoporosis) - antibiotics - diuretics - proton pump inhibitors Zinc Low levels of zinc [have been linked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5492454/) [research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5986464/) In addition, [older research indicates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584608002856?via%3Dihub) that oral zinc can enhance the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy.
