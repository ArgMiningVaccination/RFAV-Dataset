Likewise, non-physical aspects of life are also made of energy. Anyone who has used a mobile phone, watched t.v., listened to the radio or used a microwave will understand the incredible power of the various energetic frequencies that we cannot see, yet pass through our bodies everyday. Even more powerful, particularly in respect of the health of the human body, is the electromagnetic energy of thought and emotion which is constantly travelling throughout the body via the nervous system. From a naturopathic perspective, most states of 'dis-ease' begin at the frequency, or 'bioenergetic', level. The bioenergetic level is influenced by your mental and emotional state, nutritional deficiencies, electromagnetic radiations and toxins. As these bioenergetic pathways become more pronounced it is believed they begin to influence and affect the fluids of the body at the electromagnetic level - ie, the blood, urine, saliva, lymph, extra-cellular and intra-cellular fluids. This electromagnetic change effectively alters the biochemistry of the body's fluids, which in time impacts the solid structures in the body such as tissue and bones. This final, 'solid' stage (keeping in mind the scientific principle that all 'solid' matter is still vibrating energy) is normally where your 'dis-ease' can now be identified as an actual disease by standard medical tests. It's important to note that Western medicine recognizes we are electromagnetic beings and has a long-standing tradition of using diagnostic machines. MRI machines work with magnetic energy. Ultrasound machines use high frequency sound energy. EKGs are an electronic representation of what is in the heart. EEGs are an electronic representation of what is in the brain. However, despite this acceptance and use of electromagnetism in diagnosis, western pharmaceutical medicine is chemistry-based to the exclusion of all else. Pharmaceutical medicines are chemical medicines designed to impact chemical reactions in the body. Non-chemistry based treatments, which by their nature cannot be sold in a pharmacy, are often unfortunately often dismissed as being quackery. There is, however, an inextricable connection between physics and chemistry, which is common knowledge to chemists but is not currently utilised by medicine. Biochemistry is in essence the study of the chemistry - in other words, the atoms and their properties - that make up the body. The physics of how these atoms behave cannot be disassociated from this biochemistry. On an atomic level electrons are constantly moving from one atom to another, and the energy that moves these atoms is electromagnetic energy. The driving force of the biochemistry of your body is the movement of electrons due to electromagnetic energy. Frequency medicine essentially focuses on assessing and influencing this electromagnetic energy in order to bring about healing in the body. Electrodermal testing was first developed by Reinhold Voll in the 1950s and measures relative conductance at points on the body when a weak current is passed though it. Frequency scanning is the culmination of decades of research and experience, building upon the work of Dr. Voll over half a century ago. It combines the knowledge of homeopathy, physiology, and quantum physics. Read what our practitioner, Scott Hankinson, has to say. In my practice, I have found frequency testing to be very accurate when compared with the patient's own description of their health problems, and it has also been useful in pointing out health issues that the patient was not aware of, but which were later confirmed by physical tests. Frequency scanning devices uses the concept (which I agree with) that illness occurs first on an energetic level and then moves to the physical level as the energetic pathways become more pronounced. For this reason, this equipment should not be used to diagnose disease, as disease diagnosis requires actual physical confirmation of structural abnormalities. The value of this type of assessment is that it identifies how the patient's biochemistry is operating on an energetic level. So for example, it could return a result of 'fatty liver'. This does not mean you actually have a fatty liver (though it is possible you do) - we would need further tests to confirm or deny this - but what it does mean is that if you don't have a fatty liver, the biochemistry is moving this way at the moment, so in six months or a year a fatty liver may manifest. At the other end of the spectrum, sometimes a client may have a diagnosed illness which is not identified by the scanner. This does not mean the illness has disappeared or that the equipment is not working, but rather that the biochemistry of the body's internal environment is now in an aligned, healthy state on an electromagnetic level. As long as the client continues to follow the prescribed protocol, we would expect the body to heal on the physical level also. Please note there are limitations to this technology, as the frequencies of the body can be quite variable depending on daily food intake and activities. However, it's ideal for providing a snapshot of the energetic health of the body, and if the scan picks up similar problems again and again, this is a good indication of an overarching problem, which can then be further investigated with physical testing if required. Just as illness takes time to develop, true healing, from the inside-out, also takes time. Having insight into what is happening on an electromagnetic level in a patient's body gives us a powerful insight into whether treatment is moving in the right direction. "}
