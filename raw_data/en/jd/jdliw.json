As the substances are eradicated, you may experience unpleasant, uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous withdrawal symptoms. Some detox programs include supervision and other steps to minimize these symptoms, so you remain safe and comfortable throughout the process. Serenity Oaks Wellness Center is committed to supporting clients through the detox process, providing all necessary medical protocols, psychological therapies and holistic modalities to create a comprehensive detox that fully prepares you for the next step in your addiction treatment. Because we focus solely on detox, we are uniquely equipped to ensure all your needs are appropriately addressed during this initial - and sometimes challenging - treatment phase. With a variety of detox programs available today, it is vital to understand the various types of detox as you select the process that will work the best for you. SUBSTANCES REQUIRING DETOX Nearly any addictive substance may require a supervised detox process to safely rid the body of the toxins associated with the drug. At Serenity Oaks Wellness Center, we offer detox for the following substances: Detox will vary somewhat based on the specific drug that must be eliminated. Some of these substances involve more severe withdrawal symptoms than others. We will customize your treatment based on the precise drug you are addicted to, to ensure your detox is as safe and successful as possible. MEDICAL VS. NATURAL DETOX Detox can be either medical or natural. Natural detox is also referred to as \"cold turkey\" detox, a seemingly simple process where you stop using the substance. While it appears straightforward, this detox method often results in the onset of withdrawal symptoms within a matter of hours after stopping the drug or alcohol. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild to severe and might include: - Anxiety and panic - Depression - Hallucinations and paranoia - Excessive sweating - Stomach pain and nausea - Insomnia and sleep disturbances - Convulsions and seizures - Muscle aches - Intense cravings for the substance If you decide natural detox is the right approach for you, it should only be done under medical supervision to ensure it is both safe and tolerable. Medical detox, as the name suggests, is detox that uses different types of medications to ease you off the substance without the intense discomfort of withdrawal symptoms. Medications used during the process are non-addictive and may be used for a short period or an extended time to encourage a successful recovery. Some individuals remain on their medical detox for many months or even years. However, the goal is to wean people off these medications as quickly and safely as possible. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS Detox programs can also be inpatient, where the individual lives at the facility, or outpatient with daytime hours that allow clients to return to their homes in the evenings. There are pros and cons to each of these program structures, and the right one for you will be determined by different factors. Outpatient detox can be somewhat intense, even if it is not 24/7. It may take place for many hours during the day and be filled with different treatment modalities to meet the individual needs of each client. The primary advantage to an outpatient program is usually cost since these programs are typically less expensive than residential treatment. It also allows people to fulfill family and other obligations even while they are in the midst of the treatment process. Inpatient or residential treatment requires the individual to live at the facility for a prescribed period. There are numerous benefits to this treatment structure, including the ability to detox more rapidly in many cases. When you are at the center full-time, there is no possibility of a relapse during the detox process. You also have access to a full staff of experienced professional that can address every aspect of your addiction as you eliminate the toxins from your body. COMPONENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE DETOX PROGRAM Both inpatient and outpatient programs may offer a range of therapies and modalities that allow the facility to customize treatment to the unique needs of each client. Components of a successful detox program might include: - Medical supervision, particularly during the early days of detox - Psychological therapy to address the issues leading up to the addiction - Individual and group counseling sessions - Alternative therapies like meditation, yoga and nutrition to help clients remain on a healthy path Detox programs that offer a more extensive range of options are often able to better prepare clients for the next step of their treatment process. Serenity Oaks Wellness Center features a broad array of treatment modalities to ensure treatment reaches all our clients in a personal way. We are a residential treatment center because we believe this program provides clients with the best start to their treatment process and long-term recovery goals. "}
