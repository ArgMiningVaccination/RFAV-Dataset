It's something that not many people think about on a daily basis unless it is the thing that is really needed at the time. Protecting and guarding your body, mind, and spirit is just as important, if not equally as important as safeguarding your physical health. Certainly not a new concept, but one that may be somewhat unfamiliar to the modern person, is the idea that everything in your life is connected. Many Indigenous communities refer to this idea and perspective as the sacred medicine wheel. On a traditional medicine wheel, along with the 4 directions and seasons of the year, you will find 4 pieces of the wheel labeled spiritual, mental, emotional and physical. These refer to a person's whole health, wellbeing and general wellness related to these overarching topics. The idea of this wheel begins with balance and making sure that these 4 things are equally taken care of and nurtured. If just one of these parts of the wheel becomes imbalanced, another area will equally suffer. For example, if a person's mental wellness declines, chances are this will also manifest in the person's physical, emotional and spiritual wellness. It is all connected, which is why it is so important to nurture and care for all of these elements at the same time, without putting too much emphasis or focus on one over the other. Here we have created a simplified version, which we will call the Wheel of Wellness. Protect your health and your space with Banditos Natural Defense.
