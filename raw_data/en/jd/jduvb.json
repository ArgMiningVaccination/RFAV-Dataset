Learn more about: How exercise can help Why it is useful Research shows that exercise benefits most people both during and after cancer treatment. It increases energy levels, improves sleep, reduces treatment-related muscle loss, improves bone and muscle strength, improves mobility and balance, relieves stress, and decreases fatigue, anxiety and depression. What to expect The [Clinical Oncology Society of Australia](https://www.cosa.org.au/media/332757/cosa-position-statement-v3-dec2020-web-final.pdf) recommends that people with cancer do: - at least 150 minutes (2\u00bd hours) of moderate intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes (1\u00bc hours) of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise every week - 2-3 strength-training (resistance exercise) sessions a week to build muscle strength. How to exercise safely - Before taking part in any exercise program, it is important to talk to your cancer care team or GP about any precautions you should take. Ask about the amount and type of exercise that is right for you. - Exercise professionals, such as an accredited exercise physiologist or physiotherapist, can develop an exercise program to meet your specific needs and show you how to exercise safely. Some treatment centres have professionals who are specially trained in exercise interventions for people with cancer. More information - To find a physiotherapist, visit [choose.physio/find-a-physio](https://choose.physio/find-a-physio). - To find an accredited exercise physiologist, visit [Exercise and Sports Science Australia](https://www.essa.org.au/find-aep).

How a balanced diet can help Why it is useful Cancer and its treatment both place extra demands on the body. Research shows that eating well before, during and after treatment can help you cope better with treatment side effects and speed up recovery, increase energy and maintain wellbeing. What to expect Cancer Council recommends that most people with cancer follow the [Australian Dietary Guidelines](https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/), and: - eat a balanced diet from the 5 food groups - fruit, vegetables and legumes, wholegrains, meat (or alternatives) and dairy (or alternatives) - limit foods containing saturated fat, added salt and added sugars, avoid sugary drinks, and limit alcohol. How to eat well For some people, it is not always possible to eat well during cancer treatment. You may find it hard to eat enough or you may have trouble eating some foods. This may mean that [your food choices need to be different](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/nutrition-and-cancer/why-eat-well/eating-well-after-a-cancer-diagnosis/) from the Australian Dietary Guidelines. An accredited practising dietitian can: - help ensure you meet your nutritional needs - give you tailored advice on your food choices, nutrition and how to cope with any eating problems you may experience - assist in managing side effects. If you find swallowing food and drink difficult, a speech pathologist can help.
