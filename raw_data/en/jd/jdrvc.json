Accupuncture What to Expect Traditional Chinese Medicine includes acupuncture as well as other therapies such as herbal remedies, moxibustion, cupping, massage, mind-body therapy and dietary therapy. Needle Acupuncture Acupuncture uses fine needles; about the width of a hair. When properly inserted by a qualified acupuncturist, they do not hurt. Patients respond differently to acupuncture therapy, some feel relaxed while others feel energized. An acupuncture needle is inserted into acupuncture points near the surface of the skin. The depth of the insertion depends on the individual and the condition being treated, but ranges from 1/4 inch to 1 inch in depth. Electroacupuncture This technique is similar to traditional needle acupuncture, however, it uses an electrical current passed between two needles. Electoacupuncure is useful for treating a variety of conditions, including chronic pain, fatigue and depression. Auriculotherapy Auriculotherapy or auricular acupuncture, also known as ear acupuncture, is based on the principle that the ear is a microsystem for the entire body. This technique dates back to the 16th century. Moxibustion Moxibustion is a therapy that involves heating moxa (mugwort herb) near an acupuncture point to stimulate circulation and promote energy. "}
