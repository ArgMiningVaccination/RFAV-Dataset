It doesn't work and it's never been shown to have any beneficial effect. If it did, it'd be a billion dollar industry.<BR><BR>It's variously used for autoimmune disorders and to boost the immune system (which anyone could tell you, a drug that does one cannot do the other!).<BR><BR>In the laboratory (graviola has been EXTENSIVELY) studied, extracts of it were shown to kill cancer cells while not harming other cells (thousands of chemicals do this), however the results were not replicated in living systems (the same thousands of chemicals do this too) and no medicine as a result could be developed. <BR><BR>I know you feel like you have to do something to help, anything, but is lying to the guy the best thing? </div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>That's the stuff. <BR><BR>Thanks for the info...what I wanted to do was read up on it and see if it had any real effect beyond placebo. I'm a firm believer in real medicine and science. I just couldn't remember the name graviola.

He'd love that. <BR><BR><BR>Thanks to everyone for the support and info. My brother is the strongest, meanest, toughest son-of-a-bitch I've ever met. Two years ago, he was toting wheelbarrows full of landscaping rocks around his girlfriends back yard. He started to feel a little tired and dizzy. He kept going for another hour. Finally, his GF said he looked pale, and should take a break. He sat down and lit up a smoke and poured another glass of Jack Daniels. Finished those, and told his GF she should take him to the hospital. At the ER, they called in the flight-for-life helicopter, and had him transferred to another hospital for an emergency triple bypass.<BR><BR>Three weeks later, he was smoking and drinking like nothing had happened.<BR><BR>If anyone can beat it, it's him. (Not sure if anyone remembers me saying this, but my sister had ovarian cancer last year, had a tumor the size of a volleyball removed...along with several of her internal organs. She's completely cancer free now, but three weeks ago went back in for surgery to fix a hernia)<BR><BR>Finally, to reiterate...I was just looking for the name of the stuff. I have no actual belief in some miracle cure that the BigPharmaCorps are hiding from the public. (hence the quote marks in my OP) "}
