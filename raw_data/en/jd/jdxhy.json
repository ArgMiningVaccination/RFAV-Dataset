LEVATIN Janet Levatin, MD, is a pediatrician and homeopathic physician who was in private practice in the Boston, Massachusetts area from 1986 to 2011, when she moved to Cleveland to join the Tenpenny Integrative Medical Center (www.tenpennyimc.com). She now sees patients at Insight Learning & Wellness Center as well. Dr. Janet attended college at the University or Rochester (NY), medical school at George Washington University, and completed a pediatric internship and residency at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in 1986. Throughout her training Dr. Janet disagreed with much of what she observed in the conventional medical practice, such as the overuse of medications, unwholesome hospital nutrition, and virtually nonexistent methods for true prevention and health promotion. After seeing more than one case of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) after infant vaccination in the 1980s, she has been an outspoken physician against the over-vaccination of our children. Dr. Janet researched many integrative modalities and ultimately settled on homeopathy as her primary treatment modality. She has been certified as a Homeopathic Master Clinician for over 10 years, and also incorporates herbs, common-sense nutrition, and supplements into her therapeutic regimens. She has expertise in detoxing your diet and your personal care and household products, and is passionate about educating people on these subjects. As a board-certified pediatrician, Dr. Janet treats children with all types of conditions, including asthma, eczema, allergies, ADHD, ear infections, gastrointestinal disorders, sleep disorders, teething issues, psychological and behavioral imbalances and autism. She enjoys family dynamics and helping families raise healthy children through natural childbirth, breastfeeding, healthy nutrition, and limited use of pharmaceuticals. As a homeopath she has treated adults as well as children for many years. "}
