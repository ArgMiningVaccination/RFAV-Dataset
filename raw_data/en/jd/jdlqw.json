As in previous years, we have maintained a seminar programme at LSE and organised a number of symposia on our project work at international conferences while all the project mem bers have continued their own individual research. Research Personnel The project team this year has consisted of the following (post-doc fellows indicated by *), with their main research topics within the project noted beside them (Dr Ramsden continues to do research with the project though he has now joined Exeter University): Dr Jon Adams*: popularizations of sci ence in science writing and in fiction Dr Peter Howlett: the transfer of facts during the Green Revolution and in current agricultural extension work in India Dr Sabina Leonelli*: travelling of small facts in the development of bigger ontologies in biology Dr Erika Mansnerus (formerly Mattila)*: epi demiological models as a site where facts are transferred and transformed Professor Mary S. Morgan: travelling facts in social sciences, particularly economics Dr Ed Ramsden*: how facts about rat behaviour travel to discussions about human behaviour Dr Simona Valeriani*: transfer of technol ogical facts in building and architectural history Dr Patrick Wallis: tacit knowledge facts in assessing the quality of materials and in apprenticeship training in early modern period Four PhD students have continued to work in the group this year (* indicates funded by the project). Albane Forestier: knowledge transfer networks amongst merchants trading the Atlantic Julia Mensink*: the marketing and use of pov erty measures as facts that travel Ashley Millar: the European reception for fa cts about China's political economy in the early modern period Aashish Velkar: industrial standardization during the mid nineteenth century, and agricultural extension facts in modern India with P. Howlett The project has continued to benefit from the participation of academic visitors: Dr Rachel Ankeny, School of History and Polit ics, University of Adelaide, Australia Dr Ir Marcel Boumans, University of Amsterdam, Faculty of Economics 2Dr David Boyd Haycock, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich Professor Martina Merz, Department of Soci ology, University of Luzern, Switzerland Research Workshops Following the original project design and t he format established last year, we held three further workshops, each organised by one of the post-docs around their own research question. Each event involved not only members of the expert community in that researcher's field, but others - particularly our project visitors - whose expertise was complementary and whose papers and commentary had wider relevance to our project as a whole. The first of these three workshops during t he reporting year (the fourth workshop of the whole project) was held on Monday 17 and Tuesday 18 December 2007. It was designed and hosted by Dr Simona Valeriani under the title Facts and Artefacts: What Travels in Material Objects? with its main focus on material objects as vehicles for 'facts'. While the development, uptake, and transmission of aesthetic styles and figurative elements is well documented in the history of architecture - much less has been said about the technical skills related to the architectural language - and hence, how technical knowledge is transferred between different actors and through time and space, and in particular, how such facts are transferred through the materials of buildings. This is the main question for Dr Valeriani's research and she introduced the workshop by discussing a number of examples of such transfers of European building methods and designs in t he early modern period. A number of invited speakers at the workshop dealt explicit ly with these questions in the fields of building and architecture: Nicola Navone (Universita della Svizerra italiana) discussed the role of Swiss-Italian architec ts and craftsmen in building work for the Russian Tsars; Vaughn Hart (Bath Universi ty) spoke on the role of geometry in English architecture; David Yeomans on mistakes made in technology transfer in modern building work; and Edward Chaney (Southampton Solent University) on looting of obelisks from Egypt by both ancient and modern societies to make civic and political statements. Werner Oechslin (Institut f\u00fcr Geschichte und Theorie der Architekture, Zurich) gave a broad talk about the role of the material world in the world of ideas while Alison Wylie (Univers ity of Washington) used the example of North American archaeological sites to discu ss how material remains travelled from sites to museums and how facts drawn from such material objects were subject to re-interpretation as more materials were gathered. The discussion focussed not just on the travelling of such facts across both space and time but the nature of facts found embedded in materials. The second day of the workshop extended its reach through presentations from five specialists who work with objects by restoring them, or by analysing or caring for them in museums. Marta Ajmar-Wolhei m (V&A) discussed the various ways in which new forms of ceramics inspired both co mpetition and copying, the latter to the extent of various techniques used to falsify the identity of either materials or sources so that ceramics became both carriers of facts and of fakes. Frances Halahan (restoration consultant, Dar Al Athar Al-I slamiyah, Kuwait) discussed a project that involved sifting through the many small rema ins of a burnt house and the difficulty of establishing identity and ownership of these many little remains; Rick Steckel (Ohio 3State University) discussed how modern techniques extract information about diet and disease from ancient human bones; Susan La Niece (British Museum) showed us how she analysed the methods of production of ancient weapons to say something about their function and provenance; and Andrew Nahum (Science Museum) passed around some model engines to teach us how to draw facts (such as country of origin and tools of production) out of salient details of their design. Through this very unusual, but successful, series of presentations and interactions, the project team gained a strong sense of t he multiple ways that facts can be carried in and by artefacts, and the many differ ent expertises required to see, understand, and draw them out again. These issues were reflected in the final discussion lead by Harro Maas (University of Amsterdam) and Antoine Picon (Harvard). The second workshop was held on Thursday 27 and Friday 28 March 2008 and was organised by Dr Sabina Leonelli to focus on Making Small Facts Travel: Labels, Vehicles and Packages , those elements needed to make small facts (such as data) travel to, and be used in, new scientific domains as inputs to further research, thus supporting the development of bigger factual claims (such as \"smoking causes lung cancer - a big factual claim which rests upon many smaller facts both statistical and physiological). Despite this crucial impor tance of circulating small facts across research contexts - particularly in the modern biological sciences - the means and consequences of such travel are not we ll understood. On the one hand, travelling strategies need to be efficient, so as to make results available to any researcher who might be interested in them. On the other hand, the labels, packages and vehicles used for travel might compromise the content of small facts, insofar they involve the modification and re-interpretation of facts to fit the new research context in which they are received and used. Invited participants discussed and compared va rious ways of packaging small facts, including classification systems and tax onomies; standardisation procedures and modelling techniques; material artefacts such as digital databases and repositories; and various kinds of agency involved in the construction and maintenance of these packaging tools. The workshop opened with Dr Leonelli's discussion of databases in model organism research, and the workshop t hemes were taken up first by Steffan Mueller-Wille (Exeter), who discussed Linnaeus's attempts to classify, label and organise his information in order that he coul d retrieve such facts again, and Filippa Lentzos (LSE) who discussed security issues of facts in the context of life-sciences. More specific questions about the onward trav els of the small facts created in model organism research were taken up in terms of the packaging of such facts by Midori Harris (European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton) and Janet Higgins (John Innes Centre, Norwich) and the unpacking of those facts for use by Chris Taylor (European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton), (Chris Laminie's (GlaxoSmithKline) talk on extracting and integrating biological data wa s delayed to a later seminar). On the second, more general, day of discussions, James Griesemer (UC Davis) talked about the problem of colligating small fa cts and James McAllister (University of Leiden) about the issue of pattern finding in small facts; Joan Fujimura discussed political aspects of individual genomic information about disease, while Tom Stapleford talked about the commodification of small facts in marketing statistics; and finally Geoffrey Bowker (University of California, Santa Clara) gave a general talk about computers and information transfer. The final discussion was led by two 4further visitors: Stephen Turner (Universit y of Florida)) and Hasok Chang (UCL) who helped us to digest and otherwise parse the many different issues that had come into the discussion about labels and packaging of small facts. The third workshop was held on Monday 31 March and Tuesday 1 April 2008 and hosted by Erika Mansnerus (ex-Mattila) on Life Histories of Facts: Biographies, Cycles and Metamorphoses . Her opening paper explored how scientific facts \"live their lives\": both how facts progress th rough rather slow changes and through radical transformations as they travel and on the relative functions that such facts play at various stages of their life cycle. During the two days, in connection with this opening paper, there was a strong focus on m edical facts, with Kari Auranen and Tuija Leino (University of Helsinki) di scussing their use of facts in modelling infectious diseases, Alberto Cambrosio (McG ill) discussing facts in relation to clinical trials; Helen Lambert (Bristol) considering facts in relation to the spread of \"evidenced-based medicine\"; and Olga Amster damska (University of Amsterdam) on the attempts to pin down some facts about autism; (Brian Rappert (Exeter) on concealing facts as a way to get them to travel was delayed until a later seminar). These papers on the travels and functions of facts in various medical domains were interspersed with related papers on the life of facts and particularly in relation to experimental and modelling modes of doing sci ence. Thus Hans-Jorg Rheinberger (Max Plank Institute for History of Sc ience, Berlin) discussed the travelling relationships between the traces that come from experimental syst ems, the data that they produce and facts - in a paper which rela ted strongly to the previous workshop about the travels of small facts. Lenny Smith (LSE) discussed the issues of travelling facts that arise in simulations within climate science while Sarah Whatmore and Catharina Landstr\u00f6m outlined the very interesting history of \"Manning's n\", a measure of river-bed roughness as a way to understand the changing status of this object as a measure or fact about particular rivers versus a term in an equation to estimate such a measure. The discussion lead by Marcel Boumans (University of Amsterdam) enabled us to bring together t hese ideas about the intersection of life histories and functions fulfilled by facts that mapped the papers from such diverse fields together. In four out of five of our specialised wo rkshops over the last two years we had the benefit of interactions with practitioners in various fields - those whose jobs involved travelling facts either as senders, receivers, retrievers, and multiple kinds of uses - as well as academics studying such proc esses from the standpoint of history, philosophy, or sociology of science. T hese interactions have proved extremely fruitful in challenging our conceptual framew ork (discussed in last year's report) and helping us to push it further along. In gener al, our many visitors to the project have begun intrigued and sometimes sceptical, but have found our workshops extremely stimulating, and left with a positive view of the value of the research we are doing. From our point of view, they have not onl y alerted us to examples, cases, and surprising occurrences of travelling facts that have provided a depth and breadth of materials that we could not have gained from within the research team itself; but their willingness to argue with our ideas has been invaluable in enabling us to frame and communicate our project findings. 5The major public communication event of our grant was the British Academy Conference: Enquiry, Evidence and Facts: An Interdisciplinary Conference held 13- 14 December 2007, at the British Academy. This conference was jointly hosted and organised by ourselves, our UCL sister proj ect under the Nature of Evidence grant: \"Evidence, Inference and Enquiry\" and the Br itish Academy. Each project outlined its general findings in the introductory session, with our agenda focussing on two claims that facts needed \"good companions\" and a certain amount of \"character\" (as attested by the various adjectives that were used to describe them) before they could travel well. It is of course very difficult to assess the impact of such conferences on those who attend, but we know at least one outcome: we were surprised and delighted that Professor Susan Hunston (B irmingham) was prompted by the event to study our project's idea about the characte r of facts as denoted in adjectives by analysing various corpora of materials from the Bank of English. This heavily over-subscribed BA conference was designed to showcase the work of both grants and to communicate not only the main findings, but also the work of the individuals involved in the teams, along with a number of invited visitors who spoke to the themes of \"evidence\". All t he post-docs (as well as faculty) had the opportunity to present their own research at the meeting, and all projects under our grant, including our four PhD students, had poste r accounts of their work on display. These posters, constructed by Jon Adams fo r the group, have since featured in our communication materials, and are on display at the LSE. Full coverage of the BA meeting including l ong abstracts of the talks can be found at: http://www.britac.ac.uk/ev ents/2007/evidence/index.html Full details of all our workshops, includi ng programmes, participants and speakers' abstracts, and a link to the British Academ y conference can be found on our website http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/econom icHistory/Research/facts/Default.htm The project also received press att ention in the Guardian of April 15 th 2008 at http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/ 2008/apr/15/highereducation.research Other Research Activities The research group has been very active in dissemination this year, with a full programme of seminars and several mini- symposium at LSE, and have, as before, organised several conference sessions on the project.

My research time was largely divided between three projects, two of which (below) are linked to the Facts research group. The first of these was work on premodern apprenticeship and the intergenerational transmission of skills. This links to the agenda being developed by Dr Valeriani. The core research carried out in this regard focused on (1) information, mobility and opportunity in premodern English apprenticeshi p (2) structures of training and the transmission of knowledge. The project is based on a new, large dataset of apprenticeship records and has led to some significant findings about the movement of knowledge in the premodern economy. The second project was research on t he establishment and transmission of knowledge of goods in the premodern economy. Publications: In print Editor.
