The nonhuman primate model is essential for testing such approaches because it has predictive value for how vaccines elicit responses in humans. In this study, we used an aerosol vaccination strategy to administer AERAS-402, a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus (rAd) type 35 expressing Mycobacterium Ags BCG generated low purified protein derivative-specific CD4 T cell responses in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage. In contrast, aerosolized AERAS-402 alone or following potent and stable CD4 and CD8 effector T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage largely produced IFN-, as well as TNF and IL-2. Such responses induced by BCG, AERAS-402, or both failed to confer overall protection following challenge with 275 CFUs M. tuberculosis Erdman, although vaccine-induced responses associated with reduced pathology were observed in some animals. Anamnestic T cell responses to Ag85A/b were not detected in blood of immunized animals after challenge. Overall, our data suggest that a high M. tuberculosis challenge dose may be a critical factor in limiting vaccine efficacy in this model. However, the ability of aerosol rAd immunization to generate potent cellular immunity in the lung suggests that using different or more immunogens, alternative rAd serotypes with enhanced immunogenicity, and a physiological challenge dose may achieve protection against M. tuberculosis. Introduction With one third of the world's population infected, 8.6 million new cases of active tuberculosis (TB), and 1.3 million deaths per year, Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains one of the most deadly pathogens in human history ( [1](javascript:;)). Developing a vaccine that provides high-level protection against pulmonary TB, as for other infectious diseases requiring cellular immunity for protection (e.g., malaria, Leishmania major), remains elusive ( [2](javascript:;)). Optimally, vaccine-elicited immunity should eliminate the bacteria, or at least limit the progression to active TB disease during primary or latent infection ( [3](javascript:;)). Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), the only licensed vaccine against TB, is given at birth in endemic areas and protects infants from disseminated TB; however, BCG-elicited immunity wanes and fails to uniformly prevent pulmonary disease in adolescents and adults ( [4](javascript:;), [5](javascript:;)). Thus, vaccine approaches that enhance the long-term efficacy of BCG to protect against pulmonary TB are urgently needed. Heterologous prime-boost immunization is an important vaccine approach in which a viral or protein/adjuvant vaccine is given following BCG priming to enhance immunity and protection through several mechanisms ( [6](javascript:;), [7](javascript:;)). First, heterologous boosting can increase the magnitude and duration of BCG-elicited immunity by using Ags in the boosting vaccine that are expressed in BCG; second, it can broaden the immune response by including virulence-associated Ags expressed by M. tuberculosis but not BCG; third, boosting with viral vectors can elicit CD8 T cell responses not efficiently induced by BCG; and fourth, altering the route of vaccine delivery for the boost can enhance immunity at the site of infection (lung). A unique aspect of TB pathogenesis is a delayed onset of T cell responses in the lymph nodes (LNs) draining the lung, allowing establishment of infection and progression to active disease ( [8](javascript:;)- [11](javascript:;)). The arrival of effector T cells in the lung can take up to 20 d after primary TB infection, which is late compared with respiratory viral infections such as influenza ( [12](javascript:;), [13](javascript:;)). Mice immunized with M. tuberculosis (and cured with drug treatment) or BCG respond slightly earlier to reinfection, resulting in enhanced bacterial containment in the lung but not sterilizing immunity ( [13](javascript:;)- [16](javascript:;)). Populating the lung with increasing numbers of TB-specific transgenic Th1 cells, however, protects mice from challenge in a dose-dependent fashion ( [17](javascript:;)). Thus, a likely limitation of BCG and other vaccine strategies is an insufficient number of effector cells in the lung at the time of infection. In this regard, mucosal immunization to induce pulmonary cellular immune responses offers an advantage over parenteral immunization for protecting against respiratory and mucosal pathogens including TB ( [18](javascript:;)- [21](javascript:;)). Indeed, it has been long appreciated that mice, guinea pigs, and macaques are protected to a greater extent following intranasal (i.n.) or aerosol (AE) ( [22](javascript:;)- [27](javascript:;)). However, is administered by the intradermal (i.d.) route; therefore, in this study, we chose a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vaccine formulation and AE delivery strategy as a boost following i.d. BCG that would elicit potent Th1 and CD8 T cell responses in the lung. rAds have been widely used as vaccine delivery vectors and are particularly suited for respiratory mucosal vaccination owing to their natural tropism for the respiratory tract, their safety profile, and their capacity to promote potent immunogenicity of the Ag insert ( [21](javascript:;), [28](javascript:;)- [31](javascript:;)). In the mouse model of TB, mucosal (i.n.) immunization with an rAd serotype 5 expressing an immunogenic mycobacterial Ag, Ag85A (AdAg85A), resulted in a greater accumulation and retention of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells within the airway lumen compared with i.m. immunization that predominantly elicited responses in the peripheral tissues ( [32](javascript:;)). Furthermore, such T cell responses within the airway lumen correlated better with protection against TB challenge in mice than did peripheral responses against the same Ag, presumably because such cells are poised at the appropriate anatomical location to protect against respiratory infection ( [33](javascript:;)- [35](javascript:;)). In the setting of BCG priming, i.n. boosting of mice or guinea pigs with AdAg85A or modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing the same Ag (MVA85A) enhanced the level of BCG-mediated protection to a greater extent than did parenteral immunization ( [27](javascript:;), [36](javascript:;)- [38](javascript:;)). Additionally, both 35 (rAd35) vector expressing TB Ags (AERAS-402) elicited T cell responses in the lungs of macaques following AE administration ( [21](javascript:;), [39](javascript:;)). Although there is some immunogenicity and protection in mice or guinea pigs with these vectors, protection of nonhuman primates (NHPs) against TB following mucosal administration of such viral vectors has not been assessed. In this study, rhesus macaques were used to assess immunogenicity and protection against M. tuberculosis challenge following BCG and/or AE immunization with AERAS-402, an rAd35 vector expressing M. tuberculosis Ags Ag85A, Ag85B, and TB10.4 ( [40](javascript:;)). The primary goal of the study was to establish whether a high frequency of TB-specific T cells in the lung at the time of challenge confers protection against M. tuberculosis challenge. NHPs are a particularly relevant animal model for evaluating vaccine-elicited immune correlates of protection against human TB based on the immunological similarities between the species, and also because they are susceptible to pulmonary TB infection with strains of M. tuberculosis that are pathogenic in humans ( [41](javascript:;), [42](javascript:;)). AERAS-402 was chosen because it protects mice from lung challenge with M. tuberculosis following i.m. or i.n. immunization ( [43](javascript:;)) and elicits TB-specific, to BCG-vaccinated macaques and humans ( [44](javascript:;)- [46](javascript:;)). Overall, the data presented in this study provide insights into how to elicit robust pulmonary T cell responses and guide future studies for optimizing the NHP model for vaccine development against M. tuberculosis infection. Materials and Methods Animals Thirty-two healthy, specific pathogen-free, male Indian origin rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with a mean age and weight of 2.7 y (2.2-5.2 y) and 4.4 kg (2.5-7.7) were prescreened for prior mycobacterial exposure Switzerland) and for Ad35 neutralizing titers (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Vaccine Immune T-Cell and Antibody Laboratory, Gaithersburg, MD). Animals were housed in animal biosafety level 2 (immunization phase) and level 3 (challenge phase) facilities at the Tulane National Primate Research Center and were monitored throughout the study for physical health, food consumption, body weight, temperature, complete blood count, respiratory mechanics, thoracic radiographs, serum chemistry (including but not limited to C-reactive protein, albumin, and globulin), and Primagam. Peripheral blood samples were collected throughout the study (vaccination and challenge phases), whereas bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected only during the vaccination phase. Predefined humane endpoints were applied to alleviate discomfort, as described below. All animals were cared for in accordance with the standards of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Research Council. The Tulane National Primate Research Center is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and has an assurance filed with the National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Care. The Tulane Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Tulane Institutional Biosafety Committee approved all studies. Immunizations Thirty-two animals were divided into four vaccine groups (see [Fig. 1](javascript:;) and [8Results](#s8)). Randomization was done based on three criteria. First, animals with negative Ad35 neutralization titers were preferentially assigned to AERAS-402 immunization groups (G3 and G4). Second, following preimmune screening, \"background\" ICS responses (i.e., stimulation without Ag) were graded as low, medium, or high for each animal; equal numbers of each level were assigned to each group. Third, final randomization was by weight. Resulting groups did not significantly differ in average age. Animals were immunized i.d. at wk 0 with physiological Serum Institute; provided by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research/Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD), prepared and administered according to the manufacturer's instructions for human use. AE immunization with 3 \u00d7 1010 viral particles of Ad35-null (empty rAd35 vector) Holland, Leiden, the Netherlands), a (E1/E3-deleted) ( [40](javascript:;)), eFlow nebulizer system (PARI Pharma, Munich, Germany) was used to deliver 4.4-m-diameter AE droplets deep into the lung, as described previously ( [21](javascript:;)). All immunizations were performed in a biosafety cabinet with the animals under anesthesia M. tuberculosis Erdman lot K01 (Mycos Research, provided by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research/Food and Drug Administration) was diluted in saline and sonicated briefly. Animals were anesthetized and bacteria were delivered to the right caudal lung lobe using a bronchoscope in a volume of 2 ml. Four animals from each group were infected on 2 consecutive days using the same diluted stock of M. tuberculosis (stored at 4\u00b0C overnight). The actual number of bacteria delivered was 283 \u00b1 83 on day 1 and 263 \u00b1 22 on day 2. The following predetermined humane endpoint criteria were applied for euthanasia prior to the scheduled (fixed) endpoint: loss of 25% body weight, major organ failure or medical conditions unresponsive to treatment, severe respiratory distress, or complete anorexia for 4 d. At the humane or scheduled endpoint (24-26 wk after challenge), necropsy was performed that included gross pathologic scoring as well as histologic analysis and bacterial quantitation using a nonbiased stereologic sampling ( [47](javascript:;)). Gross of each lung lobe, thoracic LNs, and abdominal viscera were scored using a semiquantitative grading system such that granulomas were assigned a numeric point value (0-4) based on prevalence (0, none visible; 1, 4-10 visible; 3, mm; 2, 3-4 mm; 3, >4 mm). Approximately 15-20 samples per lung were evaluated for histology and bacterial burdens. Histologic analysis was done using SPOT imaging software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) on a Leica DM-LB photomicroscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) at \u00d767.5 The number of lesion points (granulomatous inflammation, necrosis, hemorrhage, and edema) within the total points counted was used to calculate the lesion percentage in each lung lobe. Bacterial burdens were quantified at necropsy; tissues were homogenized and decontaminated in MycoPrep (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), 3 and 5 wk later. T cell assays and flow cytometry Immune assays on BAL were conducted on freshly harvested samples. BAL was obtained by collecting three consecutive 20-ml washes with room temperature saline using a feeding tube. Samples were resuspended in warm (37\u00b0C) R10 medium (RPMI 1640 containing 2 U/ml DNase (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and filtered through a 70-m cell strainer. BAL cells were rested for 4 h before overnight ( [16 h](javascript:;)) stimulation with Ag. PBMCs were batch-analyzed from cryopreserved samples at the completion of the study. PBMCs were isolated from heparin anti-coagulated whole blood with lymphocyte separation medium (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) using standard methods. For immune analysis, PBMCs were thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath, washed twice in warm R10 containing 50 U/ml Benzonase (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), and rested at 37\u00b0C overnight before a 6-h stimulation with Ag. For in vitro T cell cytokine assays, cells were cultured with overlapping peptide pools (15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 aa) for Ag85A/b (peptides spanning the entire Ag85A sequence and regions of the Ag85B sequence that are not present in Ag85A) or early secreted antigenic target of 6 kDa (ESAT-6; obtained from Aeras) at 2 g/ml or tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) S-2 (provided by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research/Food and Drug Administration) at 20 g/ml, in the presence Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was added 2 h after Ags at a final concentration of 10 g/ml. For flow cytometric analysis ( [Supplemental Fig. 1](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/)), cells were first incubated with a Live/Dead fixable aqua dead cell stain (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and then immunostained for cell surface markers (CD4 (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm; or Alexa Fluor 700). Except where noted, Abs were purchased from BD Biosciences. As shown in [Supplemental Fig. 1](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/), cytokine frequencies of viable CD3+ memory T cell populations were assessed in PBMCs after gating out naive CD4+CD95CD28+ or CD8+CD45RA+CCR7+ cells; such memory gating was not necessary for BAL where nearly all T cells are memory phenotypes ( [48](javascript:;)). Flow cytometric data were acquired using a modified BD LSR II and analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) software; data processing and presentation were performed using Pestle (M. Roederer, National Institutes of Health) and SPICE software ( [49](javascript:;)). All Ag-specific cytokine frequencies are reported after background subtraction of the frequency of the identically gated population of cells from the same sample incubated without Ag. Background responses in BAL were typically greater than those observed in PBMCs. Statistical analysis For cytokine frequencies, statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test using SPICE (version 4.3) software ( [49](javascript:;)); for pie charts, significance was determined by a two-tailed Student t test. Survival curves were analyzed using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test in Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Clinical parameters, bacterial burdens, and immune correlates were evaluated by a Student t test or a Spearman rank correlation using either SPICE or JMP (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For all comparisons, p values 0.05 are noted. Results Experimental design: animals, immunizations, and challenge Thirty-two Indian origin rhesus macaques were randomized into four study groups based on Ad35 serology, baseline BAL T cell responses, and weight 1](javascript:;) and [2Materials with Ad35-null (Ctrl 14 priming. All were challenged 12 wk after Ad35-null or AERAS-402 (wk 26) with 275 CFUs M. tuberculosis Erdman, instilled by bronchoscope into the right lower lung. Euthanasia and necropsy for each animal was scheduled 24-26 wk after challenge, unless humane endpoint criteria were met at an earlier time point. Cellular immune responses in PBMCs and BAL as well as various clinical parameters were monitored throughout the pre- and/or postchallenge phases of the study. AE vaccination with AERAS-402 elicits transient cellular immune responses in PBMCs The primary objective of this study was to determine whether a vaccine delivered by the AE route would elicit robust and protective TB-specific T cell cytokine responses in the lung, the initial site of TB infection. We also investigated how the aerosolized AERAS-402 vaccine would affect the magnitude and quality of Ag-specific T cell responses in peripheral blood when administered alone or following a primary i.d. immunization with BCG. The magnitude of Ag-specific memory T cell responses was assessed as the total frequency of IFN--, IL-2-, or TNF-producing cells ( [Supplemental Fig. 1](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/)); these cytokines were chosen based on their importance in controlling TB infection (IFN-, TNF) and the ability to augment expansion (IL-2) ( [9](javascript:;), [50](javascript:;)- [52](javascript:;)). In PBMCs, the frequency cells gradually increased after BCG priming (G2 and G3), with the after BCG ( [Fig. after alone (G4), low but significant PPD-specific CD4 T cell responses were elicited; such responses are likely attributed to the presence of Ag85A and Ag85B in PPD ( [53](javascript:;)). However, all PPD responses in the blood decreased by 10 wk after the boost, the last measurement before challenge. For AERAS-402-induced immune responses, we focused on the Ag85A/b Ags because our previous studies had shown that T cell responses to TB10.4 were much lower than to Ag85A/b following AE AERAS-402 immunization in both ( [Supplemental Fig. 2A](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/) and consistent with prior reports in mice ( [40](javascript:;), CD4 CD8 T cells in vaccine groups that received AERAS-402 were readily detectable at 3 wk after the boost. By 10 wk after the boost, these responses waned to similar frequencies, irrespective of BCG priming, but remained significantly higher than Ctrl animals (G1) prior to challenge. Thus, AERAS-402 administered into the lung elicits a transient increase in Ag85A/b-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in the blood that were not significantly augmented or sustained by prior BCG immunization. [Close modal](javascript:;) The quality (cytokine expression profile) of the vaccine-elicited T cell response has implications for disease outcome in TB and other infections that require T cells for protection ( [36](javascript:;), [55](javascript:;)- [57](javascript:;)). Thus, we assessed the quality of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in PBMCs prior to challenge ( [Fig. 2D-F](javascript:;), [Supplemental Fig. 2B](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/), left). Approximately 50% of the memory CD4 T cell cytokine response in each vaccine group produced IFN-, IL-2, and TNF simultaneously, whereas CD8 T cell responses were far less multifunctional with >50% of responses producing only IFN-. A transient decrease in the proportion of multifunctional PPD-specific memory CD4 T cells was noted 3 wk after the Ad35-null or AERAS-402 boost (G2 and G3; [Supplemental Fig 2B](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/), left), suggesting that nonspecific innate factors induced by the Ad35 vector ( [58](javascript:;)- [60](javascript:;)) may alter the quality of the response. To explore the potential cytolytic capacity of TB-specific responses, the proportion of cytokine-positive T cells expressing granzyme B was assessed at the last time point before challenge ( [Fig. 2G-I](javascript:;)). Granzyme B expression was higher in cytokine-producing CD8 T cells compared with CD4 T cells, but it did not differ between vaccine groups. AE vaccination with AERAS-402 elicits robust and sustained cellular immune responses in BAL T cell responses in BAL were assessed before immunization, 3 and 9 wk after priming with BCG, and 3 and 10 with AERAS-402 or Ad35-null ( [Fig. 3](javascript:;)). In contrast to the relatively low and transient systemic PBMC responses after AE AERAS-402, CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were high and sustained in BAL. Median frequencies of Ag-specific CD4 T cells 3 wk after AERAS-402 immunization ranged between 4 and 7% to PPD or Ag85A/b ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;), [3B](javascript:;)), and such responses were maintained with a modest decrease at 10 wk after the boost. In contrast, low frequencies of PPD-specific CD4 responses were detected in BAL 17 wk after and 3 wk after Ad35-null boost (G2, [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)). There was no additional increase in PPD or Ag85A/b CD4 T cell responses after the AE AERAS-402 boost of BCG-primed animals (G3) compared with that in animals that received AERAS-402 without BCG priming (G4). Lastly, potent Ag85A/b-specific memory CD8 cell responses (median, 8.5-10.5%) were elicited by AE AERAS-402 at 3 wk after the boost and such responses were sustained or even increased (median, 15-20%) between 3 and 10 wk after the boost ( 3C](javascript:;)). Prior BCG priming T cells generated by AE AERAS-402 administration. Thus, at the final assessment prior to challenge, robust TB-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell cytokine responses were detected only in BAL of animals that received AE AERAS-402 (G3 and G4). [Close modal](javascript:;) We also examined the quality of the T cell responses in BAL prior to challenge and found no significant effect of BCG priming on the cytokine profile 3D-F](javascript:;)). Nearly all Ag-specific CD4 T cells in BAL produced IFN- and, compared with PBMCs, were comprised of fewer IFN-, IL-2, and TNF triple-positive cells and a IFN- and TNF double-positive and IFN- single-positive cells. This is consistent with effector sites such as the lung having a differentiated effector T cell cytokine profile and phenotype ( [48](javascript:;)). The proportion of memory CD4 T cells producing only IFN- in BAL increased following AERAS-402 boosting in BCG-primed animals ( [Supplemental Fig. 2B](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/), right). Similarly, rAd vaccines have previously been shown to alter the quality of primed CD4 T cell responses ( [61](javascript:;)). As noted above in the PBMCs, CD8 T cell responses in the BAL following AERAS-402 comprised of >50% IFN- cytokine-producing CD8 T cells was higher in BAL compared with PBMCs but did not differ between AERAS-402 groups. In contrast, granzyme B expression in PPD-specific CD4 T cells was lower in BCG/Ad35-null animals than in animals that received AERAS-402. Survival, bacterial burdens, and clinical response after M. tuberculosis challenge To determine whether the vaccine-elicited responses conferred protection against challenge, 275 CFUs M. tuberculosis Erdman were instilled by bronchoscope into the right lower lung at week 26 (12 wk after AERAS-402 or Ad35-null AE administration) and multiple clinical parameters were followed ( [41](javascript:;)). Between 4 and 8 wk postchallenge, all animals exhibited similar radiographic signs of disease (parenchymal abnormalities) at the site of infection (lower right lung lobe; data not shown). Additionally, beginning 10 wk after challenge and continuing through the fixed study endpoint (weeks 50-52), multiple animals in each group met humane endpoint criteria and required euthanasia. Such animals (two animals in G1, three animals in G2, three animals in G3, and four animals in G4) are henceforth referred to as \"rapid progressors\" to distinguish them from animals that survived until the fixed endpoint (survivors). There was no significant difference in the rate of survival between vaccinated groups and unvaccinated Ctrl animals after challenge ( [Fig. 4A](javascript:;)). Overall, considering all animals (rapid progressors and survivors), there was no reduction in bacterial CFUs cultured at necropsy from BAL, right lung (infection site), left lung, or bronchial LNs in any of the vaccine groups ( [Fig. 4B](javascript:;)). Furthermore, there were no differences in the severity of LN pathology (enlargement, granulomas, or necrosis) between vaccinated and unvaccinated macaques (data not shown). Thus, despite high frequencies of Ag-specific, cytokine-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells in BAL at the time of challenge, animals were not protected against M. tuberculosis with respect to survival rate or bacterial burdens. Furthermore, BCG vaccination (BCG/Ad35-null) also failed to elicit any protection compared with the Ctrl group. [Close modal](javascript:;) Progressive weight loss after M. tuberculosis challenge can occur during TB infection; however, in this study an overall increase in average weight was observed in each group, regardless of challenge, as the study progressed ( [Fig. 4C](javascript:;), [Supplemental Fig. 3](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/)). With respect to other disease-related clinical parameters, the nonspecific inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) is often elevated in the serum of animals with active tuberculosis; similarly, decreased serum albumin and increased serum globulin can be indicative of in the serum did not differ significantly between vaccinated groups and Ctrl animals. Thus, no differences in clinical outcome could be discerned between groups when rapid progressors and survivors were considered together. Gross pathology, histology, and correlation analyses of rapid progressors and survivors All animals underwent full necropsy procedures regardless of whether they were sacrificed early due to disease (rapid progressors) or survived until the scheduled study endpoint (survivors). Granuloma prevalence and size in each lung and the abdominal viscera ( scored grossly, using a scale of 0-4. Rapid progressors displayed similar granuloma severity throughout the lung lobes across the different vaccine groups ( [Fig. 5A](javascript:;), shaded area). In contrast, among the surviving animals, both granuloma prevalence and size scores were reduced in the Ctrl/AERAS-402-vaccinated animals (G4) compared with other vaccine groups; in these animals, only the right lower lobe (inoculation site) contained grossly visible granulomas, suggesting confinement of M. tuberculosis infection (G4, unshaded area). Concordant with lower granuloma scores observed in the group 4 survivors was a decrease in additional pulmonary findings (pleural adhesions, pleural thickening, and cavitation; data not shown). Furthermore, histopathologic analysis of lung sections confirmed that in the surviving animals that received Ctrl/AERAS-402, lesions were largely restricted to the right lower lobe ( [Supplemental Fig. 4A](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/)). These findings were notable because the same animals displayed higher serum albumin and lower serum globulin throughout the postchallenge phase, compared with survivors in other groups ( [Supplemental Fig. 4B](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/)). Taken together, these data suggested that AE AERAS-402 vaccination might be associated with mildly improved outcome. However, the confinement of granulomas to the right lower lobe in the group 4 surviving animals did not translate into decreases in bacterial burdens in the lung, as measured in this study. Although animals that survived until the fixed endpoint ( [Fig. 4B](javascript:;), closed symbols) had generally lower CFUs than did rapid progressors (open symbols) within the same group, there was no difference in bacterial burdens between groups when only surviving animals were considered (data not shown). Finally, abdominal granulomas (an indication of extrathoracic spread) were generally less abundant than in the lung but with no apparent difference between vaccine groups ( [Fig. 5B](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) Finally, we investigated potential immune correlates between the cellular immune response before challenge and survival after challenge. Prior to challenge, PPD- and Ag85A/b-specific CD4 T cell cytokine responses in BAL were similar among all animals immunized with AERAS-402 ( [Fig. 6A](javascript:;), left). However, Ag85A/b-specific CD8 T cell responses in BAL were higher in surviving animals compared with rapid progressors ( [Fig. 6A](javascript:;), lower right), whereas no correlation was observed in PBMCs (data not shown). Despite the comparatively low peak magnitude of CD4 PPD responses in the BAL following BCG/Ad35-null vaccination ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)), such responses were significantly higher in survivors compared with rapid progressors within the same vaccine group ( [Fig. 6A](javascript:;), upper right). Furthermore, there was a difference (p = 0. 04) in the cytokine expression pattern of the prechallenge PPD-specific CD4 T responses in survivors and rapid progressors vaccinated with BCG/Ad35-null ( [Fig. 6B](javascript:;)). Similarly, more than half of the Ag-specific CD8 T cells in the surviving Ctrl/AERAS-402-immunized animals (that confined granulomas to the site of inoculation) produced IFN- in addition to IL-2, TNF, or both, compared with rapid progressors ( [Fig. 6B](javascript:;)). When combined, these data suggest that both the magnitude and quality of the vaccine-induced lung T cell response present at the time of challenge may limit disease progression. [Close modal](javascript:;) To determine whether vaccination impacted granuloma formation in the lung, we studied the relationship between vaccine-induced BAL T cell responses and granuloma scores. The magnitude of the PPD-specific CD4 T cell response 3 wk after boosting inversely correlated with granuloma severity in the right lung lobe (inoculation site) among all AERAS-402-vaccinated animals, as well as in the right and left lobes of animals that received BCG/Ad35-null ( [Fig. 6C](javascript:;)). Ag85A/b-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in animals that received AERAS-402 were also associated with reduced granuloma scores in the right lobe. Analysis of the AERAS-402-elicited T cell responses 10 wk after the boost did not reveal significant correlations (data not shown). These data implicate local CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in constraining granuloma size and prevalence in the lungs. Vaccine-elicited cellular immune responses are not boosted by M. tuberculosis infection in PBMCs A critical aspect that will impact protective efficacy is whether the Ag-specific vaccine-elicited responses are rapidly expanded after the infectious challenge. Therefore, we assessed the kinetics of the anamnestic T cell responses in PBMCs to the vaccine Ags following M. tuberculosis infection ( [Fig. 7](javascript:;)). By 4 wk postinfection, all animals in vaccine and Ctrl groups had high and comparable frequencies (4%) of PPD-specific CD4 T cells that exceeded prechallenge levels ( [Fig. 7A](javascript:;)). In striking contrast, CD4 T cell responses to Ag85A/b in PBMCs were remarkably lower than responses to PPD (<0.1%). Low de novo CD4 T cell responses to Ag85A/b were generated in animals note, BCG- or AERAS-402-vaccinated animals showed neither an accelerated response nor enhanced magnitude of Ag85A/b-specific CD4 T cells compared with unvaccinated Ctrl animals at any time point postchallenge. Thus, the frequency of Ag85A/b-specific CD4 T cells in vaccinated animals was not increased from prechallenge levels. In contrast, Ag85A/b-specific CD8 T cells were neither generated de novo nor boosted in the blood after challenge ( [Fig. 7C](javascript:;)). Taken together, these data indicate that the low-level pre-existing Ag85A/b-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells generated by AERAS-402 immunization in the blood were not appreciably boosted by M. tuberculosis infection. [Close modal](javascript:;) Lastly, we measured postchallenge CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to the M. tuberculosis-specific Ag ESAT-6, which is expressed neither by BCG nor AERAS-402. Between 2 and 4 wk after challenge, nearly all Ctrl and vaccinated groups generated significant CD4 T cell responses against ESAT-6 ( [Fig. 7D](javascript:;)). At later time points, the frequency of ESAT-6-specific CD4 T cells in vaccine groups that received AERAS-402 (G3 and G4) trended higher but were not significantly the Ctrl group ( [Fig. 7D](javascript:;)). Similarly, ESAT-6-specific CD8 T cells were generated in each group after infection; however, only vaccinated groups reached significance with a trend toward AERAS-402-immunized animals having greater median frequencies at 8 and 12 wk postchallenge ( [Fig. 7E](javascript:;)). No significant correlations were found between ESAT-6-specific T cell responses after challenge and outcome (data not shown). Discussion In this study we used a vaccination strategy that induces strong cellular immune responses directly in the lung to assess the hypothesis that a high frequency of Ag-specific T cells at the site of infection would protect against TB. We show that aerosolized delivery of rAd35 and CD8 T cell responses in BAL. Nevertheless, these responses did not confer enhanced survival or decrease bacterial burdens among all animals following challenge with 275 CFUs M. tuberculosis Erdman in this fixed endpoint protocol. Overall, based on the results, we have identified several areas for improving possible protective efficacy using the NHP model. These include 1) Ag selection, 2) type of viral vector used for AE delivery, 3) species of macaque, and 4) dose of M. tuberculosis used for challenge. BCG protects infants from disseminated TB but has varying efficacy (0-80%) against pulmonary infection ( [4](javascript:;)), which is the principal target of current vaccine efforts ( [7](javascript:;)). To model a TB vaccine for humans, who are given BCG at birth, we immunized rhesus macaques with BCG i.d. AE administration of AERAS-402. We hypothesized that the AE route would most directly and effectively induce T cell immunity in the lung and thereby improve protection against pulmonary TB. A key variable in optimizing adaptive immunity to heterologous prime-boost immunization is the interval between the prime and boost. In this study, a longitudinal analysis of TB-specific T cell responses in PBMCs following BCG immunization showed that the CD4 responses to PPD continued to increase between week 11 ( 0.3%) and week 17 ( 0.6%; [Fig. 2](javascript:;)). Thus, in contrast to the peak of the response following an adjuvanted protein or viral vector vaccine that occurs between 10 and 21 d after immunization, T cell responses after BCG appear to peak much later. A similar prolonged kinetic of BCG-induced immunity has been documented in young adults where PPD-specific T cell responses gradually increase up to 1 y after immunization ( [62](javascript:;)). These data suggest that for optimizing T cell responses to a BCG prime, a systemic boost using the i.m., i.d., or s.c route should be administered after a prolonged interval (20 wk or later) to avoid boosting during the peak of the primary effector response. Indeed, longer intervals between a prime and boost with heterologous vaccines have been shown to optimize both Ab and T cell responses in NHPs and humans with a variety of vaccine platforms ( [63](javascript:;), [64](javascript:;)). Intradermal BCG immunization elicited PPD-specific CD4 T cells in BAL that waned from 1.5% at peak (week 17) to 0.5% before challenge ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)). These data raise questions as to whether the magnitude of the T cell response in BAL after BCG immunization is sufficient to mediate protection against TB in the lung. The low BAL responses may explain variability in the protection afforded by BCG in humans. Therefore, to enhance T cell responses at the site of infection, BCG-primed or naive animals were given AERAS-402 by the AE route. Prior studies by others and us have shown that lung delivery of rAd5 using TB or SIV Ags induces robust T cell responses in the lung that confer protection in mice and macaques, respectively ( [19](javascript:;), [32](javascript:;), [35](javascript:;), [65](javascript:;)). Consistent with these data, animals boosted with AERAS-402 AE generated robust and sustained CD4 and CD8 T cells responses to Ag85A/b in BAL. Importantly, BCG priming did not augment such responses ( [Fig. 3](javascript:;)), consistent with BCG inducing low to undetectable levels of Ag85A/b-specific T cells in the lung (as shown here) or in PBMCs ( [39](javascript:;), [45](javascript:;), [66](javascript:;)). Furthermore, AE delivery of AERAS-402 effect on the BCG-primed systemic response ( [Fig. 2A](javascript:;)). Taken together, these data show that the different prime and boost vaccination routes used for BCG and AERAS-402 direct immune responses to the periphery or lung mucosa, respectively, with limited boosting. Nevertheless, generating responses in both the lung and the periphery should be optimal for protection by having a high frequency of effectors present in the lung at the time of infection, as well as peripheral TB-specific cells that can migrate into the lung to enhance and sustain protection. Indeed, previous experiments in mice have shown that i.n. delivery of Ad5-85A maintains a high frequency of lung-resident effector cells that protect early after TB infection whereas systemic BCG immunization generates a reservoir of peripheral memory cells that can be recruited into lung by inflammation at later phases of infection ( [65](javascript:;), [67](javascript:;)). In this regard, boosting by both AE i.m., after i.d. BCG, would generate robust short-term effector responses in the lung as well as increase the magnitude of BCG-primed T cell responses in the periphery. Accordingly, prior studies demonstrated enhanced systemic responses following BCG priming in humans when AERAS-402 or Ad5-85A boosts of the Ag85 mycolyl transferase complex have been considered promising immune targets and have been widely used as vaccine immunogens to improve or extend the efficacy of BCG because they are abundantly secreted and recognized by BCG-vaccinated and TB patients ( [71](javascript:;)) and was included in the AERAS-402 construct to enhance the breadth of the T cell responses. However, we and others have demonstrated that AERAS-402 vaccination elicits comparatively lower responses immunodominance of Ag85A/b epitopes or the greater size of the Ag85A and Ag85B proteins. Thus, we focused our immune analysis on Ag85A/b responses. Ag85 proteins [68](javascript:;), [72](javascript:;)- [76](javascript:;)) and elicit protection either alone or when combined with other Ags in small animal models when administered in various vaccine formulations, including protein plus adjuvant ( [55](javascript:;), [77](javascript:;)- [82](javascript:;)), study, despite the robust T cell responses to Ag85A/b in the lung prior to challenge, there was no appreciable protection. Furthermore, the lack of a robust anamnestic response to Ag85A/b in AERAS-402-vaccinated animals in the blood after M. tuberculosis challenge is notable ( [Fig. 7](javascript:;)). Taken together, these data raise the concern as to whether Ag85A/B alone is a sufficiently effective target during early TB infection in vivo. Prior studies have evaluated prime-boost immunization with BCG followed by i.d. MVA85A in rhesus macaques. In one study, BCG/MVA85A did not significantly improve protection (bacterial burdens or pathology) compared with BCG alone following an intratracheal challenge with 1000 CFUs M. tuberculosis Erdman ( [66](javascript:;)). In a second study in which animals were challenged AE with a low dose (40-60 CFUs) of M. tuberculosis Erdman, Sharpe et al. ( [87](javascript:;)) reported that neither BCG nor BCG/MVA85A immunization enhanced survival despite each group displaying an equal reduction in pulmonary disease burden (lesion volume/lung volume) compared with unvaccinated Ctrls. In both studies, there were no significant anamnestic T cell responses to Ag85A after M. tuberculosis challenge. Finally, any protective effect of BCG/MVA85A immunization in NHPs as measured by various parameters ( [59](javascript:;)) did not translate into protection in a recent phase 2b trial in infants ( [88](javascript:;)). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that anamnestic responses to Ag85A/b occurred in BAL, which we did not assess to avoid disrupting the lung postinfection, experiments in mice have carefully demonstrated that Ag85B-specific cells in the lung are suboptimally activated after TB infection owing to limited expression of Ag85B that decreases further as the infection progresses ( [89](javascript:;)). Decreased expression of Ag85B relative to other TB Ags, such as ESAT-6, has been observed in macaques and mice after challenge ( [77](javascript:;), [90](javascript:;)) as the adaptive immune response begins to limit bacterial replication ( [91](javascript:;)). Taken together, these data suggest that using different or additional mycobacterial immunogens in vaccines to generate T cells that will respond to highly expressed M. tuberculosis Ags postchallenge may be more protective. Although no recall response to Ag85A/b was observed in the blood of vaccinated animals, unvaccinated animals generated CD4, but not CD8, T cells to Ag85A/b in response to infection. In contrast, several animals in each vaccine group generated de novo CD8 T cell responses to the M. tuberculosis-specific Ag ESAT-6 postchallenge ( [Fig. 7](javascript:;)). These data illustrate a fundamental difference in Ag presentation of M. tuberculosis proteins that may have important consequences for protection by vaccines. A protective vaccine against TB might require immune responses to different or more Ags, perhaps most importantly those that are rapidly recognized by the immune system following infection, as well as those that engage the CD8 T cell compartment through cross-presentation. Another important consideration for the lack of protection we observed in this study is the type of rAd vector used for AE delivery. AERAS-402 uses rAd35, which was developed as an alternative adenoviral vector to rAd5 because of its low global seroprevalance (that can impact systemic immunogenicity). However, rAd35 is the least immunogenic of all rAd vectors for priming T cell responses when given by the i.m. or s.c. route in mouse, NHP, and human studies ( [28](javascript:;), [29](javascript:;), [92](javascript:;)). Thus, although we observed potent effector T cell responses in the lung after AE AERAS-402 immunization, it remains possible that other rAd vectors would induce quantitatively and qualitatively different responses that may confer protection ( [29](javascript:;)). Indeed, the protective efficacy of rAd immunization with TB Ags in mice has been achieved in multiple studies using rAd5 ( [31](javascript:;), [65](javascript:;), [80](javascript:;)). A notable finding was the lack of significant protection in animals immunized with BCG/Ad35-null compared with unvaccinated animals. The level of BCG-induced protection against TB in NHPs is historically variable and may depend on multiple factors, including species or origin of macaque, the challenge dose, strain, and route, as well as the BCG vaccination route ( [22](javascript:;), [41](javascript:;), [66](javascript:;), [93](javascript:;), [94](javascript:;)). In the present study, as in other NHP studies, we were restricted by the number of animals we could infect (four groups of eight animals). Because the major experimental group in the study was BCG/AERAS-402, the most appropriate Ctrl to confirm Ag-specificity of a protective effect conferred by AERAS-402 was to use an empty rAd vector boost following BCG. Thus, we did not have a group that received only BCG; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Ad35-null boost may have interfered with BCG-elicited protection. Although BCG-primed CD4 T cell responses continued to increase following the Ad35-null boost ( [Figs. 2A](javascript:;), [3A](javascript:;)), it remains possible that innate factors elicited by the Ad35-null boost may have induced a qualitative change. Indeed, rAd35 elicits high levels of innate cytokines in mice, NHPs, and humans compared with other rAd ( [58](javascript:;)- [60](javascript:;)). Notwithstanding the Ad35-null boost, BCG-induced CD4 PPD responses in the BAL were found to correlate with better survival (compared with rapid progressors within the same group) and less severe lung pathology ( [Fig. 6](javascript:;)). These data indicate that BCG immunization did have some effect on disease outcome. The NHP model can be used to predict vaccine immunogenicity of viral vector and protein/adjuvant formulations in humans and to model protective efficacy for infections such as SIV/HIV, TB, and malaria. Consistent with prior vaccine studies in macaques, we delivered a high number of M. tuberculosis (275 CFUs) by bronchoscope to ensure infection of all animals. However, as shown in the present study, with this challenge dose, rhesus macaques are highly susceptible to TB with a rapid course of infection ( [22](javascript:;), [93](javascript:;)- [95](javascript:;)). These findings suggest that a (<10 CFUs) given by bronchoscope, AE ( [96](javascript:;)), or by natural exposure from another infected animal may be less overwhelming and thereby improve vaccine efficacy. Indeed, prior studies demonstrate that rhesus macaques will uniformly develop active TB infection following intrabronchial or AE challenge with doses of low 10-50 CFUs ( [87](javascript:;), [94](javascript:;), [97](javascript:;)). Note that the challenge dose required to induce active TB might differ in a less susceptible NHP cynomolgus macaques ( [93](javascript:;), [94](javascript:;), [98](javascript:;), [99](javascript:;)), or using a M. tuberculosis laboratory strain, such as H37Rv ( [97](javascript:;)). Notwithstanding the rigorous challenge used in this study, we identified immune responses in AERAS-402-vaccinated animals that may have been associated with mildly better outcome ( [Fig. 6](javascript:;)) as well as a trend toward reduced lung pathology in surviving animals that received AE AERAS-402 without a BCG prime ( [Fig. 4A](/jimmunol/article-supplement/97224/pdf/ji_1400676_supplemental_figures_1/)). Despite these findings, M. tuberculosis CFUs were not diminished in any vaccinated group, regardless of whether all animals or only surviving animals were considered. Future studies using real-time, advanced imaging by positron-emission tomography/computerized tomography may provide an additional noninvasive method for assessing protection that will extend what is obtained by pathology and CFU quantitation ( [100](javascript:;)). Identifying reliable clinical and immunological parameters that correlate with protection is critical to assessing vaccine efficacy in NHPs as well as in humans. In conclusion, our study shows that AE vaccination with AERAS-402 elicits robust and sustained T cell responses in the lung. Based on the absence of postchallenge anamnestic responses to Ag85A/b, the lack of cross-presentation of Ag85A and Ag85B following natural infection, and the lack of protection in vaccinated animals or humans, we conclude that these Ags alone are likely not sufficient to mediate overall protection, at least with this rAd vector serotype. Therefore, as with other infections (e.g., malaria, L. major) that require whole attenuated organisms for protective cellular immunity, vaccines against TB that incorporate many, rather than few or single, Ags might have a greater chance of efficacy. Furthermore, rAd5 vectors or newly characterized chimpanzee-derived Ads with potent immunogenicity may enhance the magnitude and quality of the responses compared with rAd35 used in the present study. Lastly, future NHP studies should use a much lower M. tuberculosis challenge dose to evaluate vaccine-mediated protection. Thus, although this study had limited efficacy, it provides critical insights into optimizing the NHP model for future TB vaccine development.
