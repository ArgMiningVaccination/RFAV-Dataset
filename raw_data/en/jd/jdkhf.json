From becoming bedridden to a sudden frequentness of hospital visits due to serious medical issues, there are signs that you should note when considering changing facilities. 1. Needing 24-hour care While assisted living communities can provide round-the-clock care, it is typically for minor assistance. Nursing homes, also known as [skilled nursing facilities](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/skilled-nursing-vs-nursing-homes), provide a high level of 24/7 care. This higher level of care is typically provided by staff including licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, and aides. When hospitalization is not required, but 24/7 medical care is needed, an assisted living community may not offer enough support for your loved one. However, a skilled nursing facility may be the answer. Beyond assisting with ADLs, these facilities help with both everyday and emergency medical needs. To name just a few specific kinds of care, staff at a [nursing home](https://www.aplaceformom.com/nursing-homes) can perform the following: - IV therapy - Catheters placement and maintenance - Blood pressure monitoring - Respiratory therapy [01] The majority of seniors in nursing homes need help with at least three ADLs, need assistance with walking, and struggle with incontinence.[01] Seniors in need of nursing home care may also experience trouble eating on their own. They may require a feeding tube or a pureed or liquid diet. A specialized care facility like a nursing home has access to the equipment needed for these special dietary needs. 2. Developing complex medical conditions When seniors start to develop complex medical conditions, it may be time to move into a nursing home. Complex medical conditions that may require skilled nursing care include: - Diabetes - Parkinson's disease - Huntington's disease - Multiple sclerosis These are just a few of the many medical conditions that require attention from caregivers round-the-clock. However, the level of care required depends on your loved one's needs and the progression of their condition. Consider whether your loved one needs specialized medical care, additional assistance, medication, or if there are complications with their condition. Nursing homes can also care for seniors with Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. However, [facilities geared specifically for memory care](https://www.aplaceformom.com/alzheimers-care) might be a better option to consider for those experiencing cognitive decline. 3. Requiring hospice or palliative care Seniors who are terminally ill with less than six months to live and who have chosen not to undergo or continue treatments to extend their life may consider [hospice care](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/hospice-care). In hospice care, the main concern is the patient's comfort. Palliative care is for people with serious medical conditions like cancer, stroke, dementia, and heart failure. Differing from hospice care, palliative care aims to reduce suffering while addressing a patient's underlying conditions.[02] Nursing homes typically offer both hospice and palliative care services. While some assisted living communities may collaborate with a hospice team, not all of them have that option. 4. Becoming bedridden or needing a wheelchair If your loved one has become bedridden or constantly needs assistance moving, [they may need a nursing home](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/when-is-it-time-for-a-nursing-home). Nursing home caregivers are experienced in patient transfers and are adept at moving individuals, often wheelchair users, to or from a bed, chair, or toilet. Additionally, seniors who must spend several hours a day in bed may get bedsores. Nursing home caregivers are typically trained to help [prevent and tend to bedsores](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/elderly-bedsores). 5. Frequent visits to the hospital Sometimes, when recovering after a hospital visit due to an injury, illness, or other medical event, seniors may need follow-up care. If your loved one is recovering from a hospital procedure, they might consider a temporary stay at a skilled nursing facility. To help seniors recover after a major medical event, nursing homes typically offer several therapy options, including: - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Speech therapy - Orthopedic rehabilitation Also, seniors who have been making repeated trips to the hospital, but who do not require ongoing hospitalization, could instead receive constant monitoring and any needed medical care at a nursing home. By transferring to a nursing home, your loved one could reduce the number of trips to the hospital and avoid risks like secondary infections, bedsores, falls, and more.[03] 6. Falling more often As people age, their risk for falling increases with approximately one in four seniors 65+ experiencing a fall each year.[04] A fall can result in injury and could potentially be fatal. Caregivers in a nursing home are experienced in helping seniors with mobility issues. And, if a fall injury occurs and hospitalization is not required, then a skilled nursing home is able to provide needed medical care around the clock. 7. Needing medication administration Seniors in nursing homes have access to licensed caregivers that can administer medications for complex conditions, such as giving injections for diabetes. Depending on the assisted living community, they may be qualified to distribute medications, though this is less common. Typically, assisted living caregivers [manage medications](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/medication-policy-and-procedure-for-assisted-living). 8. Wanting help with the cost of living While a skilled nursing facility may be more expensive than an assisted living community, many people qualify for government assistance. Depending on the state and the services needed, [Medicaid and other benefits](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/medicaid-long-term-care) may be applicable toward nursing home stays. Because Medicaid only covers medical assistance, assisted living costs are typically not covered. For temporary stays after a hospitalization, seniors may qualify for Medicare benefits at a certified Medicare skilled nursing facility. However, if continuous care is needed after the approved benefits time period, seniors will need to look at other payment options like Medicaid. In addition to the nursing home being certified as a Medicaid Nursing Facility, seniors must be eligible for Medicaid in order to use "}
