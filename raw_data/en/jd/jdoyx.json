If a potential conflict was noted, the work group member recused him orherself from discussion and drafting of recommen-dations pertinent to the topic area of the disclosedinterest. An evidence-based model was used and evidence was obtained for the clinical questions ( Table I ) using a systematic search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library database from May 2006 through September 2014 for clinical questions addressed inthe previous version of this guideline published in2007, and 1964 to 2014 for all newly identifiedclinical questions. Searches were prospectivelylimited to publications in the English language.MeSH terms and strings used in variouscombinations in the literature search included: acne or acne vulgaris combined with treatment, glycemic index, milk, antioxidants, probiotics, and fish oil.Additional studies were identified by hand-searchingbibliographies of publications, including reviewsand metaanalyses. A total of 1145 abstracts were initially assessed for possible inclusion; 242 were retained for nal reviewbased on relevancy and the highest level of available evidence for the outlined clinical questions. Evidence tables were generated for these studiesand used by the work group in developingrecommendations. In addition, the evidence tablesgenerated for the Academy's previous acne guidelinewere also used by the work group. The Academy'sprevious published guidelines on acne were alsoevaluated, as were other current published guidelines on acne. 1,2Relevant references published after September 2014 are provided solely assupplemental supporting text information forrecommendations as derived from the systematicsearch, and to address comments received during theguideline review and approval process. The available evidence was evaluated using a unied system called the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) developed by editors of the US family medicine and primarycare journals (ie, American Family Physician , Family Medicine ,Journal of Family Practice , and BMJ USA ). 3Evidence was graded using a 3-point scale based on the quality of methodology(eg, randomized control trial, case control, prospective/retrospective cohort, case series, etc) and the overall focus of the study (ie, diagnosis,treatment/prevention/screening, or prognosis) asfollows: I. Good-quality patient-oriented evidence (ie, evidence measuring outcomes that matter topatients: morbidity, mortality, symptomimprovement, cost reduction, and quality of life). II. Limited-quality patient-oriented evidence. III. Other evidence, including consensus guide- lines, opinion, case studies, or disease-oriented evidence (ie, evidence measuringintermediate, physiologic, or surrogate endpoints that may or may not reflect improve-ments in patient outcomes). Clinical recommendations were developed on the best available evidence tabled in the guideline. The strength of recommendation was ranked as follows: A. Recommendation based on consistent and good-quality patient-oriented evidence. B. Recommendation based on inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence. C. Recommendation based on consensus, opinion, case studies, or disease-oriented evidence. In those situations where documented evidence- based data were not available or were showinginconsistent or limited conclusions, expert opinionand medical consensus was used to generate clinicalrecommendations. This guideline has been developed in accordance with the American Academy of Dermatology/American Academy of Dermatology Association ''Administrative Regulations for Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines'' (version approvedAugust 2012), which include the opportunity forreview and comment by the entire AAD membershipand nal review and approval by the AAD Board ofDirectors. 4This guideline will be considered current for a period of 5 years from the date of publication,unless reaffirmed, updated, or retired at or before that time. DEFINITION AV is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis notable for open or closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and inflammatory lesions, including papules, pustules, or nodules (also known as cysts). INTRODUCTION Acne is a common skin disease, especially in adolescents and young adults. Approximately 50 million people in the United States have AV.5AcneJAMACADDERMATOL VOLUME 74, N UMBER 5Zaenglein et al 947affects approximately 85% of teenagers, but can occur in most age groups6and can persist into adulthood. The prevalence of acne in adult women is about 12%.7 There is no mortality associated with acne, but thereis often significant physical and psychologicalmorbidity, such as permanent scarring, poor self-image, depression, and anxiety. The direct cost ofthe disease is estimated to exceed $3 billion per year. 6Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory disease affecting the pilosebaceous follicles of the skin. Thecurrent understanding of acne pathogenesis is continuously evolving. Key pathogenic factors that play an important role in the development of acne arefollicular hyperkeratinization, microbial colonizationwith Propionibacterium acnes , sebum inflammatory mechanisms involving Fig 1.

Recommendations for grading and classification of acne Clinicians may find it helpful to use a consistent grading/classification scale (encompassing the numbers and types of acne lesions as well as disease severity, anatomic sites, and scarring) to facilitate therapeutic decisions and assess response to treatment. Currently, no universal acne grading/classifying system can be recommended.JAMACADDERMATOL MAY2016948 Zaenglein et alboth innate and acquired immunity. In addition, studies have suggested that neuroendocrine regula-tory mechanisms, diet, and genetic and nongeneticfactors all may contribute to the multifactorial processof acne pathogenesis. An algorithm for the treatmentand management of acne in adolescents and youngadults is shown in Fig 1 . SYSTEMS FOR THE GRADING AND CLASSIFICATION OF ACNE Acne grading systems may be useful in patient care. Such systems can assist in more specicclassication of disease, help determine appropriatetreatment options, and monitor improvement duringthe treatment course. Recommendations for gradingand classifying acne are shown in Table II , and the strength of recommendations for grading and classifying acne is shown in Table III .Numerous acne assessment tools have been described, taking into account various factors, suchas type of acne, severity of acne, number of acnelesions, anatomic location/extent of acne, metrics,9-13and scarring,14among other measures.15-24Recently, 18 of these grading scales were ranked based on avariety of characteristics. 25To date, there is no universally agreed-upon grading system, and systems can differ greatly between studies. Inaddition, interobserver reliability of these scalesvaries, but has been poor in some studies. 17,26,27 Methods such as photographic standards have beenused to improve reproducibility. Improvements in digital technology, photo- graphic equipment, and teledermatology may allow for accurate, remote assessment of acne in the near future. 28-30Scientific measures, such as ultraviolet-Table III.

Reproducibility, as well as ease of use and acceptance by dermatologists, will be essential forthe success of any grading system. MICROBIOLOGIC TESTING P acnes , a Gram-positive anaerobic rod, is the primary bacterium implicated in acne.40-42It has specific, nonstandard culture requirements that prohibit routine culture. Currently, microbiologic testing of acne lesions is largely unnecessary becauseit does not affect management, and successfulantibiotic treatment may not result from a reductionof bacterial numbers. 40The antibiotics typically used in the management of acne, tetracyclines, haveadditional antiinflammatory actions independent ofmicrobial killing. As additional information is learned about P acnes from a molecular and genetic perspective, and its role in inciting inflammation inacne, 43-48more targeted therapeutic interventions in the future may result. Recommendations formicrobiologic testing of acne are shown in Table IV and the strength of recommendations formicrobiologic testing is shown in Table III . The prime situation where microbiologic testing is useful in patients with acne is in evaluating for Gram-negative folliculitis. This uncommondisorder presents as uniform and eruptive pustules,with rare nodules, in the perioral and perinasalregions, typically in the setting of prolongedtetracycline use. It is caused by various bacteria,such as Klebsiella and Serratia, and is unresponsiveto many conventional acne treatments. Gram- negative folliculitis is typically diagnosed via culture of the lesions, and is generally treated withisotretinoin or an antibiotic to which the bacteriaare sensitive. In cases of acne unresponsive to typicaltreatments dparticularly with prominent truncal involvement or monomorphic appearance d pityrosporum folliculitis should be considered.Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infections may appear similar to acne, and should be considered in the differential, particularly in cases of acuteeruptions; a swab culture may be helpful in these cases. ENDOCRINOLOGIC TESTING While the role of androgens in acne pathogenesis is well known, endocrinologic evaluation is only warranted in certain cases, because most acnepatients will have normal hormone levels. Testingis primarily indicated for patients with clinicalfeatures or a history of hyperandrogenism. Inprepubertal children, these features include: acne,early-onset body odor, axillary or pubic hair,accelerated growth, advanced bone age, and genital maturation. Growth charts and a hand lm for bone age are good screening tools before specichormonal testing. 1,49In postpubertal females, clinical signs, such polycystic ovaries,clitoromegaly, and testing. 1,2,50-52,165Recalcitrant acne caused by androgen excess can also be seen in both men and women with nonclassical congenital adrenal acneare shown in Table IV , and the strength of recommendations for endocrinologic testing isshown in Table III . The most common cause of elevated androgens of ovarian origin is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). 53It has recently been proposed that diagnosis of PCOS in adult females requires 2 ofthe 3 following criteria: androgen excess (clinical orbiochemical), ovulatory dysfunction (oligo- oranovulation), or polycystic ovaries (based onultrasonographic findings). In adolescent females,the diagnosis of PCOS can be made based onhyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) in the presence of persistent oligomenorrhea. 168The differential diagnosis PCOS includes thyroiddisease, prolactin excess, and nonclassicalcongenital adrenal hyperplasia, among others. 168 Hormonal testing and interpretation of testing is complex. A typical hormone-screening panelincludes free and total testosterone, Recommendations for microbiologic and endocrinologic testing Routine microbiologic testing is not recommended in the evaluation and management of patients with acne Those who exhibit acne-like lesions suggestive of Gram-negative folliculitis may benefit from microbiologic testing Routine endocrinologic evaluation (eg, for androgen excess) is not recommended for the majority of patients with acneLaboratory evaluation is recommended for patients who have acne and additional signs of androgen excessJAMACADDERMATOL MAY2016950 Zaenglein et algrowth factor, lipid levels, insulin, sex hormone e binding globulin, free 17- b-hydroxysteroids, free androgen index, prolactin, estrogen, andprogesterone may also be abnormal in those withsevere acne. 52,54-56,165,169Insulin resistance may also represent a risk factor for acne in certain patients.170 Patients with abnormal test results, or in whom thereis a persistent concern for a hormonal disorder, should be further evaluated by an endocrinologist. TOPICAL THERAPIES The topical therapy of AV includes the usage of agents that are available over the counter or viaprescription. Therapy choice may be influenced byage of the patient, site of involvement, extent andseverity of disease, and patient preference. Topical therapies may be used as monotherapy, in combination with other topical agents or incombination with oral agents in both initial controland maintenance. Recommendations for use oftopical therapies are shown in Table V , and the strength of recommendations for treatment of acnewith topical therapies is shown in Table III . Prescribing information for all topical therapies is located in Supplementary Tables I-XIII .(Please note all Supplemental Tables can be found atwww.jaad.org .) Commonly used topical acne therapies include BP, salicylic acid, antibiotics, combination antibioticswith BP, retinoids, retinoid with BP, retinoid withantibiotic, physicians have anecdotal regimens they nd benecial, agents reviewed here are limited to those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) for use in the United States, and for which peer-reviewed literature has been published. BP is an antibacterial agent that kills P acnes through the release of free oxygen radicals and isalso mildly comedolytic. 171,172No resistance to this agent has been reported, and the addition of BP toregimens of antibiotic therapy enhances results andmay reduce resistance development. BP is available as topical washes, foams, creams, or gels, and can used as leave-on or wash-off agents. Strengthsavailable for acne therapy range from 2.5% to 10%.BP therapy is limited by concentration-dependentirritation, staining and bleaching of fabric, anduncommon contact allergy. Total skin contact timeand formulation can also affect efficacy. Lowerconcentrations (eg, 2.5-5%), water-based, and wash-off agents may be better tolerated in patients with more sensitive skin. 57,58Results can be noted in as soon as 5 days.59 Topical antibiotics for acne accumulate in the follicle and have been postulated to work throughantiinflammatory mechanisms and via antibacterialeffects. 60These agents are best used in combination with BP (wash-off or leave-on), which increases efficacy and decreases the development of resistant bacterial strains. Monotherapy with topicalantibiotics in the management of acne is notrecommended because of the development ofantibiotic resistance. Clindamycin 1% solution orgel is currently the preferred topical antibiotic foracne therapy. 173Topical erythromycin in 2% concentration is available as a cream, gel, lotion, or pledget,61,62but has reduced efficacy in comparison with clindamycin because of resistance of cutaneousTable V. Recommendations for topical therapies Benzoyl peroxide or combinations with erythromycin or clindamycin are effective acne treatments and are recommended as monotherapy for mild acne, or in conjunction with a topical retinoid, or systemic antibiotic therapy for moderate to severe acne Benzoyl peroxide is effective in the prevention of bacterial resistance and is recommended for patients on topical or systemic antibiotic therapy Topical antibiotics (eg, erythromycin and clindamycin) are effective acne treatments, but are not recommended as monotherapy because of the risk of bacterial resistance Topical retinoids are important in addressing the development and maintenance of acne and are recommended as monotherapy in primarily comedonal acne, or in combination with topical or oral antimicrobials in patients with mixed or primarily inflammatory acne lesions Using multiple topical agents that affect different aspects of acne pathogenesis can be useful. Combination therapy should be used in the majority of patients with acne Topical adapalene, tretinoin, and benzoyl peroxide can be safely used in the management of preadolescent acne in children Azelaic acid is a useful adjunctive acne treatment and is recommended in the treatment of postinflammatory dyspigmentation Topical dapsone 5% gel is recommended for inflammatory acne, particularly in adult females with acne There is limited evidence to support recommendations for sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sodium sulfacetamide, aluminum chloride, and zinc in the treatment of acneJAMACADDERMATOL VOLUME 74, N UMBER 5Zaenglein et al 951Staphylococci and P acnes regimens. diarrhea or Clostridium difficile erelated colitis with clindamycin topically have appeared inthe literature, but the risk appears low. 66Tolerance of these agents is excellent; clindamycin alone is pregnancy category B. Topical retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that are prescription agents with randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled trials supporting their use foracne treatment. 70-72,175Three active agents are available: tretinoin cream, gel or foam). Each retinoid binds to a different set of retinoic acid receptors: tretinoin toalpha, beta, and gamma, and tazarotene andadapalene, selectively, to beta and gamma dthereby conferring slight differences in activity, tolerability,and efficacy. Retinoids are the core of topicaltherapy for acne because they are comedolytic,resolve the precursor microcomedone lesion, and are antiinflammatory. These agents enhance any topical acne regimen and allow for maintenance of clearance afterdiscontinuation of oral therapy. Retinoids are idealfor comedonal acne and, when used in combinationwith other agents, for all acne variants. Three topicalagents are available that contain retinoids incombination with other products: adapalene 0.1%/ BP 2.5%, approved for use in patients $9 years of age, and 2 agents with xed combinationclindamycin phosphate 1.2%/tretinoin 0.025% gel,approved for patients $12 years of age. 75,76,176 Retinoid use may be limited by side effects, including dryness, peeling, erythema, and irritation,which can be mitigated by reduced frequencyof application. 177Given any single agent, higher concentrations may be more efficacious, but with greater side effects.70,74,77Some formulations of tretinoin (primarily generic products) are notphotostable and should be applied in the evening.Tretinoin also may be oxidized and inactivated bythe coadministration of BP. It is recommended thatthe 2 agents be applied at different times. Tretinoinmicrosphere formulation, adapalene, and tazarotene do not have similar restrictions. Topical retinoids have been associated with an increased risk ofphotosensitivity; concurrent daily sunscreen can beused to reduce the risk of sunburn. There are several head-to-head studies with retinoid products. Some support greater efcacy oftazarotene over adapalene and tretinoin, and adapalene over tretinoin, but the concentrations and formulations used were varied. 73,78-80Data suggest that adapalene is better tolerated thanmultiple concentrations of tretinoin, but this is basedon older formulations. 81Overall, the limitations of the existing studies prohibit direct efficacycomparisons of topical retinoids. Tretinoin and adapalene are pregnancy category C, while tazarotene is category X; therefore, patients should be counseled on these pregnancy risks whenstarting a retinoid or if a woman patient desirespregnancy. The therapy of acne in children \\12 years of age with products approved by the FDA has expanded.Fixed combination BP 2.5%/adapalene 1% gel isapproved for of tretinoin 0.05% micronized tretinoin gel for patients $10 years of age. All other retinoids are approved by the FDAfor patients $12 years of age. Current data show that retinoids in younger patients are effective and are notassociated with increased irritation or risk. Azelaic acid 20% is mildly effective as a comedolytic, antibacterial, and antiinflammatory agent. The agenthas use in patients with sensitive skin or of Fitzpatrick skin types IVor greater because of the lightening effect of the product on dyspigmentation. 82,83,178Azelaic acid is category B in pregnancy. The sulfone agent, dapsone 5% gel, is available as a twice-daily agent for the therapy of AV. In clinicaltrials, topical dapsone showed modest to moderateefcacy, primarily in the reduction of inflammatorylesions. 84,85Combination with topical retinoids may be indicated if comedonal components are present. The mechanism of action is poorly understood, andits ability to kill P acnes has been poorly studied. It is generally thought to work as an antiinflammatoryagent. The benefit in women seems to exceed thebenefit in male and adolescent patients. 86,179 Topical dapsone may be oxidized by the coappli-cation of BP, causing orange-brown coloration of the skin which can be brushed or washed off. Topical dapsone 5% gel is pregnancy category Cand has efficacy and safety data down to patients12 years of age. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge-nase testing is not required before starting topicaldapsone. Salicylic acid is a comedolytic agent that is available over the counter in 0.5% to 2% strengths for the therapy of AV. Both wash-off and leave-on preparations are well tolerated. Clinical trialsdemonstrating the efcacy of salicylic acid in acneare limited. 87,180 Although sulfur and resorcinol have been used for many years in the treatment of acne, evidence fromJAMACADDERMATOL MAY2016952 Zaenglein et alpeer-reviewed chloride possesses antibacte- rial activity and, therefore, has been investigated inthe treatment acne. Of 2 peer-reviewed studies, 1found benefit 182and 1 did not.183Topical zinc alone is ineffective.184-186There is some evidence to suggest the efficacy of sodium sulfacetamide.187-189 Topical niacinamide (nicotinomide) 2% to 4% gel isavailable over the counter. The limited studiesavailable compare its efficacy to topical clindamycin1% gel. 190,191 SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS Systemic antibiotics have been a mainstay of acne treatment for years. They are indicated for use inmoderate to severe inflammatory acne and should beused in combination with a topical retinoidand BP. 95,192,193Evidence systemic antibiotics are shown in Table VI , and the strength of recommendations for treatment of acne withsystemic antibiotics is shown in Table III . Prescribing information for systemic antibiotics islocated in the Supplementary Tables XIV-XXII . The tetracycline class of antibiotics should be considered rst-line therapy in moderate to severe acne, except when contraindicated because of other circumstances (ie, pregnancy, #8 years of age, or allergy). The antibiotics of the tetracycline class workby inhibiting protein synthesis by binding the 30Ssubunit of the bacterial ribosome. This class alsohas notable antiinflammatory includinginhibiting chemotaxis and activ-ity. Previous guidelines recommended as superior to doxycycline in reducing P acnes . 1 However, a recent Cochrane review of clinical trialsfound minocycline effective but not superior to other antibiotics in the treatment of acne.88There are few studies addressing dosing of the tetracycline class.Minocycline in an extended release form appearssafest (at 1 mg/kg), but no dose response was found for efficacy. 194Doxycycline appears effective in the 1.7 to 2.4 mg/kg dose range.89Subantimicrobial dosing of doxycycline (ie, 20 mg twice daily to40 mg daily) has also shown efficacy in patients withmoderate inflammatory acne. 195,196 Erythromycin and azithromycin have also been used in the treatment of acne. The mechanism ofaction for the macrolide class of antibiotics is to bind the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Again, there are some antiinflammatory properties for thesemedications, but the mechanisms are not wellunderstood. Azithromycin has been primarilystudied in the treatment of acne in open label studieswith different pulse dosing regimens ranging from 3times a week to 4 days a month, with azithromycinbeing an effective treatment in the time span evaluated dusually 2 to 3 months. 92,197-204A recent randomized controlled trial comparing 3 days permonth of azithromycin to daily doxycycline didshow superiority of doxycycline. 205Macrolides as the penicillin class represent an alternative whentraditional antibiotics cannot be used. TMP/SMX and trimethoprim have also been used for the treatment of acne. Sulfamethoxazole is bacteriostatic by blocking bacterial synthesis of folic acid, which is necessary for cell division.Trimethoprim is a folic acid analog that inhibits theenzyme dihydrofolate reductase. The 2 agents worktogether to block nucleotide and amino acidsynthesis in the bacteria. Outside of case reports,there is 1 small, double-blind study showing thatTMP/SMX is as effective as oxytetracycline. 93 Although data supporting their use are limited, penicillins and cephalosporins are sometimes usedTable VI. Recommendations for systemic antibiotics Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne that are resistant to topical treatments Doxycycline and minocycline are more effective than tetracycline, but neither is superior to each other Although oral erythromycin and azithromycin can be effective in treating acne, its use should be limited to those who cannot use the tetracyclines (ie, pregnant women or children \\8 years of age). Erythromycin use should be restricted because of its increased risk of bacterial resistance Use of systemic antibiotics, other than the tetracyclines and macrolides, is discouraged because there are limited data for their use in acne. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim use should be restricted to patients who are unableto tolerate tetracyclines or in treatment-resistant patients Systemic antibiotic use should be limited to the shortest possible duration. Re-evaluate at 3-4 months to minimize the development of bacterial resistance. Monotherapy with systemic antibiotics is not recommended Concomitant topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used with systemic antibiotics and for maintenance after completion of systemic antibiotic therapyJAMACADDERMATOL VOLUME 74, N UMBER 5Zaenglein et al 953in the treatment of acne and can be used as an alternative treatment when circumstances dictate. Inparticular, these medications represent a useful option in patients who may be pregnant or who have allergies to the other classes of antibiotics.These antibiotics work by binding the penicillin-binding proteins in the bacterial cell membrane andinhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. There are fewreferences to support the use of these medications inthe treatment of acne outside of case reports.However, there is a small retrospective chart review with cephalexin where the majority of patients showed some clinical improvement on thismedication. 94 Adverse events of systemic therapy are often a concern to patients and practitioners. However,severe adverse effects of systemic antibiotics in thetreatment of acne are rare. Vaginal candidiasis anddrug eruptions can occur with any antibiotic. Adverse events with the tetracycline class vary with each medication. Photosensitivity can be seenwith tetracycline class, doxycycline minocycline. Doxycycline ismore frequently associated with gastrointestinaldisturbances, and higher doses are more likely tocause symptoms. 89Minocycline has been associated with tinnitus, dizziness, and pigment deposition of the skin, mucous membranes, and teeth. Minocycline pigmentation is more common inpatients taking higher doses for longer periods oftime. Doxycycline is primarily metabolized by theliver, and can be used safely in most patients withrenal impairment. When minocycline is compared toother tetracyclines, more serious adverse events arereported (8.8 cases per 100,000 patient years). 88,90 The rare serious events associated with minocyclineinclude autoimmune disorders, such as drug reactionwith eosinophilia and (DRESS),drug-induced lupus, and other hypersensitivityreactions. 91,206-209Finally, pseudotumor cerebri is a rare phenomenon associated with the tetracyclineclass of antibiotics. The adverse events of TMP/SMX include gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, and drug eruptions. Multiple cutaneous reactions have beenobserved with patients on this medication, the most severe eruptions being Stevens eJohnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. 210,211Such severe eruptions are more common in patients with HIV. The relative risk for such a severe reaction varies, butis still a rare event, with studies citing the cruderelative risk at 172. 211Disorders of the hematopoietic system can also occur with TMP/SMX andcan include serious blood dyscrasias, such asneutropenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, andthrombocytopenia. Although these are rare adverse events, patients on long-term therapy with this medication should be periodically monitored witha complete blood cell count. Cases of fulminanthepatitis necrosis have also occurred in patientstaking this medication, as has respiratory hypersen-sitivity. The concurrent use of TMP/SMX andmethotrexate (MTX) can be with severetoxicity ( Supplementary Table XVII ). The macrolide class of antibiotics is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal distur-bances. Erythromycin is associated with a higherincidence of diarrhea, nausea, and abdominaldiscomfort than azithromycin. Macrolides havebeen reported to cause cardiac conductionabnormalities, and rarely hepatotoxicity has beenreported. Macrolide antibiotics can also decrease metabolism of cyclosporine. Azithromycin has been associated with cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. Penicillins and cephalosporins are most associ- ated with the adverse events of hypersensitivityreactions ranging from mild drug eruptions toanaphylaxis. Gastrointestinal disturbances arealso common and include nausea, diarrhea, andabdominal distention and discomfort. When prescribing systemic antibiotics, the issue of bacterial resistance remains a major concern.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) has stressed antibiotic stewardship. This isan initiative to promote the appropriate use ofantibiotics where patients receive the right dose ofthe right antibiotic at the right time for the rightduration. Limiting antibiotic use to the shortest possible duration, ideally 3-4 months, can be accomplished with the concomitant use of a retinoidTable VII. Recommendations for hormonal agents Estrogen-containing combined oral contraceptives are effective and recommended in the treatment of inflammatory acne in females Spironolactone is useful in the treatment of acne in select females Oral corticosteroid therapy can be of temporary benefit in patients who have severe inflammatory acne while starting standard acne treatment In patients who have well documented adrenal hyperandrogenism, low-dose oral corticosteroids are MAY2016954 Zaenglein et alor retinoid/BP.212,213While limiting the use of systemic antibiotics is necessary, the work group'sconsensus agrees there are a subset of patients for whom alternative therapies are inappropriate and who may require a longer course of antibiotics evenwhile taking topical medications. In such patients,consistent follow-up and reevaluation should beused to use the antibiotic for the shortest timenecessary. Monotherapy with oral antibiotics isstrongly discouraged. The use of topicalmaintenance regimens cannot be overemphasized. Topical therapies can accomplish continued efficacy months after the discontinuation of systemicantibiotics. 95,96,212,214The work group's consensus agrees that such maintenance is paramount toreducing antibiotic resistance. 215Other attempts to limit antibiotic use revolve around different dosingrecommendations, such as pulse dosing andsubmicrobial dosing. No alternate dosing routines consistently appear superior to standard dosing. Finally, limiting systemic antibiotic use is urged because of the reported associations of inflammatorybowel disease, Combination oral contraceptive pills (COCs) contain both an estrogen and a progestincomponent. COCs were rst approved by the FDA for contraception in the United States in 1960.They prevent ovulation and pregnancy by inhibiting gonadotropin-releasing hormone and, subsequently, follicle-stimulating and luteinizinghormones. These hormones are needed tobegin follicular maturation and for ovulation;in their absence, ovulation does not occur.Recommendations for hormonal agents are showninTable VII , and the strength of recommendations for the treatment of acne with hormonal agents is shown in Table III . World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for COC usage eligibilityare listed in Table VIII . Prescribing information for hormonal therapies is located in Supplementary Tables XXIII-XXVIII . COCs have evolved since 1960. Ethinyl estradiol levels have gradually decreased from around 50 to150/C22g per pill to as low as 10 /C22g. A variety of different progestational moieties have been used, beginning with testosterone and alone haveTable VIII.

Fourth-generation progestins are testosterone and progestin drospirenone. Whileprogestins vary androgenic potential,evidence suggests that when combined withethinyl estradiol, the net effect of all COCs isantiandrogenic. 219,220 There are currently 4 COCs approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne. action of COCs in thetreatment of acne is based on their antiandrogenicproperties. These pills decrease androgenproduction at the level of the ovary and also increasesex hormone ebinding globulin, binding free circulating testosterone and rendering it unavailable to bind and activate the androgen receptor. Inaddition, COCs reduce 5-alfa-reductase activity andblock the androgen receptor. 219,221-223 Numerous randomized controlled clinical trials have assessed the efcacy of COCs in the manage-ment of acne. 98-101,221,224-226It is evident from these trials that COCs reduce acne dboth inflammatory and comedonal lesion counts. It is more difficult to determine which, if any, COC is consistently superiorin the treatment of acne. A 2012 Cochranemetaanalysis assessed the effect of birth controlpills on acne in women and included 31 trials witha total of 12,579 women. Nine trials compared a COCto placebo, and all of these COCs worked well toreduce acne. The progestins included in these trials norethindrone acetate, norges- timate, drospirenone, 2 COCs, but noconsistent differences in acne reduction wereappreciated based on formulation or dosage of theCOC. Only 1 small study compared a COC to an oralantibiotic; no significant difference in self-assessedacne improvement was identified. 221 A recent publication evaluated the effectiveness of drospirenone 3 mg/ethinyl estradiol 20 /C22g in the treatment of moderate truncal AV. The COC showedsignicant reductions in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions compared toplacebo. 227 The risks of COCs must be weighed against the risks of the condition that they are treating or preventing. When COCs are used for contraception, their risks must be compared to the risks ofpregnancy. If COCs are used exclusively for acne,their risks must be compared to the risks of acne. It isimportant to remember that FDA approval of allCOCs for acne species that they are approved forthe treatment of acne in women who also desire contraception. COC use is associated with cardiovascular risks. Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have beenthe center of an ongoing debate regarding COCs.Traditionally, higher doses of ethinyl estradiol havebeen linked to increased risks of VTE. However,in recent years, some progestins have beenimplicated as risk factors for VTE. A recent Cochrane metaanalysis evaluated 25 publications reporting on 26 studies focused on oral contra-ceptives and venous thrombosis. The analysisconcluded that all COC use increases the risk ofVTE compared to nonusers. The relative risk ofvenous thrombosis for COCs with and gestodene, desogestrel, cyprot-erone acetate, or drospirenone was similar and about 50% to 80% higher than for COCs with levonorges- trel. 228To put this increased risk into perspective, it is important to note that the baseline risk of VTE innonpregnant, nonusers of COCs is 1 to 5 per 10,000woman-years. Users of COCs have a VTE risk of 3 to9 per 10,000 woman-years. Users of drospirenone-containing COCs have a VTE risk of about 10 per10,000 woman-years. Pregnant women have a VTE risk between 5 and 20 per 10,000 woman-years, and women within 12 weeks postpartum have a VTE riskof between 40 and 65 per 10,000 woman-years. 229,230 Myocardial infarction (MI) risks are also increased in COC users. This risk is strongly associated withcigarette smoking and other risk factors, such asdiabetes mellitus and hypertension. The WHOreports that COCs are not associated with an increased risk of MI in healthy, normotensive, nondiabetic, nonsmokers at any age. 231There is also an increased risk of both ischemic andhemorrhagic stroke in COC users. Cigarette smokingand hypertension contribute to this increased risk, asdo higher doses of ethinyl estradiol and age [35 years. While these are serious potential adverse events, these cardiovascular events are uncommon in women of reproductive age. An increased relative risk still translates to an overall low absoluterisk. 219,222,232 COC use may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in some women. A largemetaanalysis including data from 53,297 womenwith breast cancer and 100,239 controls showed anincreased risk of breast cancer in current users of COCs. The relative risk of breast cancer in current COC users was 1.24 (95% condence interval [CI],1.15-1.33). This increased risk disappeared 10 yearsafter COC discontinuation. Age at rst use of a COCwas the only factor that was associated with anoverall increased risk. Risk did not appear toJAMACADDERMATOL MAY2016956 Zaenglein et alcorrelate with the duration of use of the COC or family history of breast cancer.233A more recent systematic review of cancer risks associated with oralcontraceptive use also showed an increased relativerisk (1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.17) of breast cancer in COCusers, and higher risk was associated with morerecent use of a COC. 234Notably, this increased risk of breast cancer is greatest in women \\34 years of age, when the overall incidence of breast cancer is at its lowest.233 The risk of cervical cancer may be increased in women who use COCs. An analysis of 24observational studies found that the risk of cervicalcancer increases with an increased duration of COCuse. The risk declines after the COC is discontinuedand the increase in risk disappears after 10 years ofnonuse. 235Another systematic review found no significant increase in the risk of cervical cancer among ever-users of COCs and never-users from 9pooled studies. This study did show an increased riskof cervical cancer in women with [5 years of COC use compared with never-users, but the differencewas not statistically significant. 234 There is additional concern regarding COC use in younger adolescent populations given the adverse effects of low estrogen on bone mass. Peak bone mass development occurs during adolescence andyoung adulthood. The addition of low-dose estrogenCOCs early in the teen years may undermine theaccrual of bone mass. 236Osteopenia or decreased bone mineral density with COC use has not beenshown. 237,238However, definitive conclusions are yet to be made. In general, the use of COC for acne should be avoided within 2 years of first starting menses or in patients who are \\14 years of age unless it is clinically warranted. The FDAhas approved COC use for females 14 years(eg, 15 (eg, norgestimate and older (and desiring use of aCOC as mentioned above). There are many noncontraceptive benets of COCs in addition to the improvement of acne.These include regulation of the menstrual cycle,lessening of menorrhagia and associated anemia,and a reduction in the formation of benign ovariantumors. Decreased risks of colorectal, ovarian, andendometrial cancers have been shown in COCusers. 222,239 Oral contraceptives may improve acne for many women. They may be used alone or in combinationwith other acne treatments. While some womenpresent with signs or symptoms suggestive of ahormonally induced worsening of acne (ie,premenstrual flares or hirsutism), the use of COCsis not limited to these individuals. Any woman with signs or symptoms of hyperandrogenism should be evaluated appropriately for anunderlying cause. However, COCs may be benecialto women with clinical and laboratory ndings ofhyperandrogenism and in women without thesendings. COCs may be included as part of a comprehensive acne treatment regimen. Women who desire contraception or who suffer from menorrhagia may choose to begin a COC early in their acne treatment.In other women, COCs may be added to a treatmentregimen when results with other agents have beenlimited. COCs may be used in combinationwith other oral acne medications, including thetetracycline class of antibiotics and spironolactone.There is much misunderstanding regarding the concomitant use of oral antibiotics and COCs and putative contraceptive failure. Rifampin andgriseofulvin are the that interactwith COCs, lessening their effectiveness. 240The tetracycline class of antibiotics has not been shownto reduce the effectiveness of COCs when takenconcomitantly. 222,232,241,242 Because the progestin drospirenone is an analog of spironolactone, there has been some concern that using a drospirenone-containing COC andspironolactone together might increase the risk ofhyperkalemia. In 1 study, 27 women with acne weretreated with a COC containing drospirenone 3 mgand ethinyl estradiol 30 /C22g and spironolactone 100 mg each day. There were no signicantelevations of serum potassium and there were no additional side effects signicant enough to discontinue treatment. 243 Acne reduction with COC use takes time. Randomized controlled trials consistently showa statistically signicant improvement in acnewith COCs compared to placebo by the end of cycle3. 98-101,224,225Those treated with COCs for acne should be educated that acne reduction may not be appreciated for the first few months of treatment. Therefore, combining COCs with other acnemedications early in treatment may be appropriate. A Papanicolaou smear and a bimanual pelvic examination are no longer deemed mandatorybefore initiating the use of a COC. While thesescreening examinations may offer valuableinformation, they do not identify women who should not take a COC and should not be required before initiating treatment with a COC. Obtaining athorough medical history and a blood pressuremeasurement are important before prescribing aCOC. 244Proper patient selection is imperative to minimize risks associated with COC use. The WHOJAMACADDERMATOL VOLUME 74, N UMBER 5Zaenglein et al 957has published contraindications for the use of COCs.245 Spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist that exhibits potent antiandrogen activityby decreasing testosterone and inhibiting dihydrotestosterone to androgen receptors inthe skin. 246-249It may 5-alfa-reductase and increase steroid hormone ebinding glob- ulin.250,251Its use as an antiandrogen is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne. Two small,placebo-controlled prospective studies showedstatistically significant improvement in acne severityand sebum production at doses ranging from 50 to200 mg daily. 252,253A retrospective chart review of 85 patients treated with spironolactone 50 to 100 mgdaily, either as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy, revealed that 66% of women were clear or markedly improved with favorable tolerability atthese lower doses. 102More recently, a Japanese study investigated the efficacy of spironolactone inAsian patients. One hundred thirty-nine Japanesepatients (116 women and 23 men) were treated withspironolactone 200 mg daily for 8 weeks, followedby a taper of 50 mg every 4 weeks over a total of 20 weeks. All 64 women who completed the study had clinical improvement ranging from good toexcellent. The study was discontinued prematurelyin the male patients because of the development ofgynecomastia. 103Given the small number and size of available studies, a recent Cochrane database reviewconcluded that there are insufficient data to supportthe efficacy of spironolactone in the treatment of acne. 254Despite the lack of published data, relying on available evidence, experience, and expertopinion, the work group supports the use ofspironolactone in the management of acne in selectwomen. Spironolactone is well tolerated overall, and its side effects are dose-related. Common side effectsinclude diuresis (29%), menstrual irregularities (22%), breast tenderness (17%), breast enlargement, fatigue, headache, and dizziness. 255Spironolactone is also pregnancy category C; animal studies haveshown feminization of a male fetus early in gestation.Therefore, concomitant use of a COC is oftenrecommended to both regulate menses and preventpregnancy in many patients. Hyperkalemia is apotentially serious side effect that, fortunately, is rare in young healthy individuals with normal hepatic, adrenal, and renal function. Non eclinically relevant elevations may occur in about 13.7% ofpatients. 228A recent retrospective database review identifying 967 women between 18 and 45 years ofage taking spironolactone 50 to 200 mg daily for acnefound that only 0.75% of the 1723 associated potassium measurements exceeded 5.0 mmol/L. Six of the 13 abnormal tests were normal upon repeattesting. Patients with renal or cardiovascular diseaseand those taking angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers wereexcluded. Based on these findings, the authorsconcluded that testing for potassium in younghealthy women taking spironolactone for acne is unnecessary. 256Serum potassium testing is therefore not required, but should be considered in olderpatients and in patients who are also takingangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angio-tensin receptor blockers, nonsteroidal antiinflamma-tory drugs, and Measurements should beperformed at baseline, during therapy, and afterdose increases in these patients. Patients should also be educated about avoiding foods that are high in dietary potassium, such as low-sodium processedfoods and coconut water. 257Spironolactone may also be used safely with drospirenone-containingCOCs. No elevations in serum potassium wereidentified in a series of 27 patients treated withspironolactone 100 mg daily in combination withethinyl estradiol 30 /C22g/drospirenone 3 mg. 243 Animal studies using up to 150 times human doses of spironolactone or its metabolite found thedevelopment of thyroid, hepatic, testicular, andbreast adenomas, as well as thyroid carcinoma andmyelocytic leukemia. These ndings contributed to ablack box warning stating that the off-label andunnecessary use of spironolactone should beavoided. To date, there has been only 1 human report suggesting carcinogenicity in which the authors identied 5 hospitalized patients withbreast cancer who were taking spironolactoneamong other medications 258; however, subsequent longitudinal and retrospective studies found noassociation. 255,259,260In addition, a recent large retrospective matched cohort study of 1.29 millionwomen[55 years of age found no association between spironolactone use and breast cancer with 8.4 million patient-years of use, further disprovingany causal relationship. 261These findings were supported by another large retrospective cohortstudy of 2.3 million women representing 28.8 millionperson-years that showed no association betweenspironolactone use and the development of breast,uterine, cervical, or ovarian cancers. 262 Flutamide is a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor blocker used in the treatment of prostatecancer. It is not approved by the FDA for use in acne.Doses ranging from 250 mg twice daily to as little as62.5 mg daily have shown efcacy in the treatment ofacne in small prospective trials. 104,263-267FlutamideJAMACADDERMATOL MAY2016958 Zaenglein et al250 mg twice daily combined with a triphasic COC reduced acne by 80% compared with spironolactone50 mg twice daily/COC, which reduced acne by only50% after 3 months of therapy. 245 Common side effects associated with flutamide include gastrointestinal distress, breast tenderness, hot flashes, headache, xerosis, and decreased libido.228,267High rates of side effects among users may decrease compliance with use.105In 1 prospec- tive randomized trial of 131 women, side effects at adose of 125 mg daily were comparable to placebo. 267 Importantly, flutamide use has been associated withidiosyncratic fatal hepatotoxicity, which appears tobe dose- and age-related. 268,269Therefore, liver function tests need careful monitoring, and the risk of this serious adverse effect must be considered. Useof flutamide in the treatment of acne is discouragedexcept where benefit warrants the risk. Low-dose prednisone in doses ranging from 5 to 15 mg daily, administered alone or with high-estrogen containing COCs, has shown efcacy inthe treatment of acne and seborrhea. 106,270,271 However, long-term adverse effects of corticoste-roids prohibit use as a primary therapy for acne.Prednisone in doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day isindicated for treatment of the systemic andcutaneous manifestations of acne fulminans and fortreatment and prevention of isotretinoin-inducedacne fulminans elike eruptions. A slow taper over several months is recommended while transitioning to isotretinoin or oral antibiotics in order to minimize relapses. 272,273 Isotretinoin Oral isotretinoin, an isomer of retinoic acid, has been used in the United States for the treatment ofacne for[30 years and is approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe recalcitrant AV. Its use has proven successful for most patients with severe acne, resulting in decreased sebum production, acnelesions, and acne scarring, along with a decrease in symptoms of anxiety and depression. 107-117,274-277It has also been effectively used in the treatment ofmoderate acne that is either treatment-resistant orthat relapses quickly after the discontinuation of oralantibiotic therapy. 32,134-138It is the consensus of the current working group that the presence of moderate acne that is either treatment-resistant, orthat produces physical scarring or significantpsychosocial distress, is an indication for treatmentwith oral isotretinoin. Recommendations forisotretinoin are shown in Table IX , and the strength of recommendations for treatment of acne withisotretinoin therapy is shown in Table III . Prescribing information for the treatment of acne with isotretinoin is listed in Supplementary Table XXIX . When used for severe AV, isotretinoin is commonly initiated at a starting dose 0.5 mg/kg/dayfor the rst month, then increased to 1.0 mg/kg/daythereafter as tolerated by the patient. 118In extremely severe cases, even lower starting doses, with or without the concomitant use of oral steroids, may be needed. In earlier studies of optimal dosing ofisotretinoin in patients with severe AV, doses rangingfrom 0.1 mg/kg/day to 1.0 mg/kg/day were mostcommonly used. Some efficacy was generally seen atall doses, along with a dose-dependent decrease insebum production. 109While there was not a significant difference in the improvement of acne by the end of the treatment course between doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day in most of the studies, therewas a significant difference in relapse rates andthe need for retreatment; patients treated withapproximately 1.0 mg/kg/day had a significantlylower relapse rate and a lower rate of retreatmentwith isotretinoin than those treated with 0.5 mg/kg/day. 110,112,116Similarly, a lower relapse rate was seen for those treated with a cumulative dose of [120 mg/kg compared to those treated withTable IX. Recommendations for isotretinoin Oral isotretinoin is recommended for the treatment of severe nodular acne Oral isotretinoin is appropriate for the treatment of moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or for the management of acne that is producing physical scarring or psychosocial distress Low-dose isotretinoin can be used to effectively treat acne and reduce the frequency and severity of medication-related side effects. Intermittent dosing of isotretinoin is not recommended Routine monitoring of liver function tests, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides at baseline and again until response to treatment is established is recommended. Routine monitoring of complete blood count is not recommended All patients treated with isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program Females of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be counseled regarding various contraceptive methods including user-independent forms Prescribing physicians also should monitor their patients for any indication of inflammatory bowel disease and depressive symptoms and educate their patients about the potential risks with isotretinoinJAMACADDERMATOL VOLUME 74, N UMBER 5Zaenglein et al 959\\120 mg/kg.110,119It has been suggested that this dose-dependent therapeutic benefit plateaus beyond 150 mg/kg.119Therefore, in patients with severe AV, the work group supports initiation of isotretinoin at0.5 mg/kg/day when appropriate, subsequentlyincreasing to a full dose of 1 mg/kg/day after the firstmonth as tolerated, with a goal cumulative dosebetween 120 and 150 mg/kg. One recent study of 116patients found that a cumulative dose of 220 mg/kg or more may result in lower relapse rates, but confir- mation will require study in larger populations. 278 Isotretinoin treatment has been studied in patients with treatment-resistant or quick-relapsing,moderate AV. In this patient population, multiplestudies have found that low-dose isotretinoin(0.25-0.4 mg/kg/day) is effective in the treatment ofacne, and that this efcacy is comparable to the use of more conventional dosing. 32,107,134,135,279This may also be true for a low cumulative doseregimen. 136In addition, low-dose regimens are associated with a decreased rate of medication-related adverse effects, thereby leading to improvedtolerability and increased patient satisfac-tion. 107,134,135,279,280Unlike in patients with severe acne, relapse rates in patients with moderate acne treated with low-dose isotretinoin are equal to relapse rates in those treated with conventionaldosing. 32,279Intermittent dosing, however, is not as effective and is associated with higher relapse rates;therefore, it is not recommended. 32,134,135,276 Isotretinoin is highly lipophilic and is best absorbed when taken with food.115,120,121Patients should be instructed to take isotretinoin with meals. One formulation, isotretinoin with lidose, uses lipid agents to encase the medication, bypassing the needfor food, and can be taken on an empty stomach. 121 Common adverse effects associated with the intake of isotretinoin have been well documentedand reviewed in previous guidelines. 1The most prevalent side effects involve the mucocutaneous,musculoskeletal, and ophthalmic systems, generally mimicking symptoms of hypervitaminosis A. With standard courses, these side effects are temporaryand resolve without sequelae after discontinuationof the drug. Other real and speculative adverseeffects of interest include inflammatory boweldisease, depression/anxiety/mood changes,cardiovascular risk factors, bone mineralization,concerns regarding scarring, and S aureus colonization. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).Several retrospective analyses have been performedto determine whether there is an associationbetween isotretinoin intake and IBD. 122-126,281,282While 2 studies123,282have shown a potential relationship, more recent analyses122,125,283suggest no association between IBD and isotretinoiningestion. The most convincing article suggestingan association between isotretinoin and UC 124was directly refuted by a later analysis of the samedatabase. 125Therefore, the work group agrees with the position statement of the American Academy ofDermatology that the ''current evidence is insufficient to prove either an association or causal relationship between isotretinoin use and IBD.'' 284 Changes in mood, including depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide have been reported sporadi-cally in patients who are taking isotretinoin. 127,285To date, no studies to suggest an evidence-based linkbetween isotretinoin and depression, anxiety, moodchanges, or suicidal ideation/suicide exist. Multiple studies have shown no evidence of depression from isotretinoin on a population basis. 128-133,137,285 On the contrary, most studies have shownisotretinoin to improve or have no negativeeffects on mood, memory, attention, or executivefunctions. 113,128-133,137,285-288However, given the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and suicidalideation/suicide in the general population, and especially the adolescent population who may be candidates for isotretinoin therapy, the prescribingphysician should continue to monitor for thesesymptoms and make therapeutic decisions withinthe context of each individual patient. Physicians prescribing isotretinoin need to be aware of guidelines for evidence-based monitoringof side effects. Interest in bone demineralization and premature epiphyseal closure observed with long-term oral retinoid intake led to early concernsabout these issues for patients taking isotretinoin foracne. While premature epiphyseal closure has beenreported in 2 isolated patients who were takingshort-term isotretinoin for acne, 289,290these effects have not been reported in any other studies ofpatients taking short-term isotretinoin therapy for AV. 119,139It remains the opinion of this work group that routine screening for these issues is not requiredin patients who are taking short-term isotretinointherapy. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides, as wellas transaminases, have been known to rise in somepatients taking oral isotretinoin. 140-142While there is no proof of long-term cardiovascular risk fromshort-term elevation of triglycerides and cholesterol during short-term isotretinoin therapy, 140the routine monitoring of serum lipid profiles and liver functionstudies should continue. 139,142,291,292This work group could find no evidence-based reason thatroutine monitoring of complete blood cell counts iswarranted.JAMACADDERMATOL MAY2016960 Zaenglein et alSeveral early case series described delayed wound healing or keloid formation in patients whowere taking or had recently taken isotretinoin,leading to the current recommendation to delayprocedures such as dermabrasion or laserresurfacing until 6 to 12 months after discontinuing isotretinoin. 293,294Recent prospective small inter- ventional studies did not scarring withchemical peels or dermabrasion in anypatient currently or recently on isotretinoin. 291,294 There are also retrospective studies and case reportsdemonstrating safety with laser hair removal, pulseddye laser, and CO 2laser.295-299While elective procedures should be delayed for 6 to 12 months when possible, careful consideration may be given on a case by case basis. Higher rates of colonization with S aureus have been seen in patients taking systemic isotretinoin,leading to increased rates of minor skin infections,such as folliculitis and furunculosis. 300,301On rare occasions, the combination of cheilitis and S aureus colonization can cause lip or perioral abscesses, a serious complication requiring prompt attention.300 The teratogenic effects of isotretinoin and the risk for retinoic acid embryopathy are well known. Afterintroduction of isotretinoin in the United States in1982, there were hundreds of reports of isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies within just several years,resulting in a high rate of congenital malforma-tions. 302Because of this, the first risk management program was implemented. iPLEDGE is now the third risk management program that has been put inplace in an effort to prevent isotretinoin exposureduring pregnancy. As mandated by the FDA, allpatients receiving isotretinoin dboth men and womendare required to enroll in and adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program. Despitethis, fetal exposure has not significantly decreased since the implementation of iPLEDGE, and approximately 150 isotretinoin-exposed pregnan-cies still occur in the United States each year 143,144 because of noncompliance with the iPLEDGEcontraceptive requirements to abstain from sex orto use 2 contraceptive methods. Nearly one-third ofall women of childbearing potential in a recent USstudy admitted noncompliance with iPLEDGE pregnancy prevention requirements; of those that were sexually active, 29% did not comply with theuse of condoms that they had agreed to use as 1 of their methods, and 39% missed $1 contraceptive pills in the previous month. 144Therefore, every woman of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoinshould be carefully counseled regarding variouscontraceptive methods that are available and the specific requirements of the iPLEDGE system at each clinic visit. Patient-independent forms ofbirth control, including long-acting reversiblecontraceptives, should be considered wheneverappropriate. MISCELLANEOUS THERAPIES/PHYSICAL MODALITIES There is limited evidence published in the peer-reviewed medical literature that addresses theefcacy of comedo removal for the treatment ofacne despite its long-standing clinical use. It is,however, the opinion of the work group thatcomedo removal is often helpful in the managementof comedones that are resistant to other therapies.Recommendations for miscellaneous therapies and physical modalities are listed in Table X , and the strength of recommendations for treatment ofacne using miscellaneous therapies and physicalmodalities is shown in Table III . Prescribing information for miscellaneous therapies andphysical modalities is located in Supplementary Tables XXX-XXXIII . Studies exist suggesting that chemical peels may improve acne. However, large, multicenter, double-blinded control trials comparing peels toplacebo and comparing different peels are lacking.Glycolic acid and salicylic acid chemical peelsmay be helpful for noninflammatory (comedonal)lesions. 145-147,303,304However, multiple treatments are needed and the results are not long-lasting. Inthe opinion of the work group, chemical peels may result in mild improvement in comedonal acne. Some laser and light devices may be benecial for acne, but additional studies are needed. Studies existevaluating the use of many lasers, including pulseddye laser, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser,fractionated and nonfractionated infrared lasers, andthe fractionated CO 2laser. Light devices aside from lasers have also been investigated, including radio- frequency, intense pulsed light, photopneumatic therapy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT).Table X. Recommendations for miscellaneous therapies and physical modalities There is limited evidence to recommend the use and benefit of physical modalities for the routine treatment of acne, including pulsed dye laser, glycolic acid peels, and salicylic acid peels Intralesional corticosteroid injections are effective in the treatment of individual acne nodulesJAMACADDERMATOL VOLUME 74, N UMBER 5Zaenglein et al 961Of all laser and light devices, the most evidence exists for PDT in treating acne.305-308With PDT, a photosensitizer, such as aminolevulinic acid, is first applied to the affected skin for a period of time (varying from 15 minutes to 3 hours). Thephotosensitizer is then absorbed into thepilosebaceous units and is preferentially taken upby sebocytes. A laser or light device is then used toactivate the photosensitizer, generating singletoxygen species, and thereby damaging the seba-ceous glands and reducing P acnes . This treatment shows great promise, but additional studies are needed to determine the optimal photosensitizer,incubation time, and light source. Intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide is a commonly used technique for the managementof larger, nodular lesions in patients with acne. 148,149 Rapid improvement and decreased pain are noted.Local atrophy, systemic absorption of steroids, and possible adrenal suppression may occur. 309 Decreasing the concentration and the volume of steroid used will minimize these complications. COMPLEMENTARY/ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES Two clinical trials have shown that topical tea tree oil is effective for the treatment of acne.150,151In 1 study, it was comparable to BP but better tolerated.Other herbal agents, such as topical and oralayurvedic compounds, oral barberry extract, andgluconolactone solution have been reported to havevalue in the treatment of acne. 152-155 The psychological effects of acne may be profound, and it is the opinion of the expert work group that effective acne treatment can improvethe emotional outlook of patients. There is weakevidence of the possible benet of biofeedback-assisted relaxation and cognitive imagery. 156,310 The recommendation for using complementary and alternative therapies is listed in Table XI , and the strength of recommendation for treatment of acne using complementary and alternative therapies is shown in Table III . ROLE OF DIET IN ACNE Emerging evidence suggests that high glycemic index diets may be associated with acne. In 2007, a randomized controlled trial with 23 Australian males 15 to 25 years of age examined the impact of a lowglycemic diet on acne. Those randomized to follow the low glycemic load (LGL) diet had signicantimprovement in acne severity, a signicant reductionin weight and body mass index (BMI), a signicantdecrease in free androgen index, and improved insulin sensitivity at the end of 12 weeks. 157The study was limited by its small sample size and the factthat both groups lost weight. In 2012, a 10-weekrandomized controlled trial was conducted in 32Korean subjects (24 men and 8 women) 20 to 27 yearsof age. Those randomized to the LGL diet had astatistically significant improvement in acne severityand no change in weight and BMI. Histologic analyses were conducted, and the authors found that the size of the sebaceous glands weresignificantly reduced in the LGL group, whereashematoxylin eeosin stains revealed a decrease in inflammatory cells and additional stains showed adecrease in inflammatory cytokines. 158Although these 2 studies are the most rigorous to dateanalyzing the effect of glycemic index diets on acne, a small number of studies further support this association. 159-161,311 While no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to examine the role of dairy consumptionand acne, several observational studies suggest thatcertain dairy products, especially skim milk, mayaggravate acne. In 2005, a retrospective studyanalyzed data from 47,355 adult women who were asked to recall their high school diet. They were also asked to recall if they had ''physician-diagnosedacne.'' In this study, acne was positively associatedwith the reported quantity of milk ingestion. Thestrongest association was noted with skim milk.Specically, women who consumed $2 glasses of skim milk a day had a 44% increased risk of reportingacne. 312This study was heavily criticized for its retrospective design, so the same research group conducted 2 follow-up, prospective studies. The firstTable XI. Recommendation for complementary/alternative therapies Herbal and alternative therapies have been used to treat acne. Although most of these products appear to be well tolerated, limited data exist regarding the safety and efficacy of these agents to recommend their use in acne Table XII. Recommendations for the role of diet in acne Given the current data, no specific dietary changes are recommended in the management of acne Emerging data suggest that high glycemic index diets may be associated with acne Limited evidence suggests that some dairy, particularly skim milk, may influence acneJAMACADDERMATOL MAY2016962 Zaenglein et alwas conducted on a cohort of girls, and found that acne was associated with total milk intake, wholemilk, low-fat milk, and skim milk. 162The second study focused on boys only, and found that acne was associated with the intake of skim milk only.163More recently, a case control study involving 88 Malaysiansubjects 18 to 30 years of age found that thefrequency of milk and ice cream consumption wassignificantly higher in patients with acne comparedto controls. 161Dermatologist-assessed subjects who consumed milk or ice cream $1 time per week had a 4-fold increased risk of having acne. No association was found with cheese or yogurt. Also in 2012, another case control study involving 563 Italiansubjects 10 to 24 years of age found that the risk of acne was also increased with milk consumption.164 The association was more marked with skim milk,and again no association was seen with cheese or yogurt. Although some small preliminary studies have examined the role of antioxidants (including oralzinc 313), probiotics,314and fish oil315on acne, the existing evidence is not strong enough to supportany recommendations regarding these dietaryfactors at this time. Recommendations for the roleof diet in acne are listed in Table XII , and the strength of recommendations for the role of diet in acne is shown in Table III .Table XIII.
