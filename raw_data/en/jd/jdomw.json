But somehow our noble plans rarely make it into reality. In this retreat program we focus on building a personal practice, finding clarity, visualizing our desires and rooting them into our core. Empower your intentions and dive into the year 2023 with purpose and positivity! A New Years celebration with 8 days of yoga, meditation and rituals, guided by experienced yoga teachers Kelly and Remy Groenendaal. Imagine waking up to the sounds of the birds, the monkeys and the trees. You take a stroll through the garden of Eden where your fresh brewed coffee awaits. Your stroll is taking you further up to the ocean view yoga shala, where you wake up the body and quiet the mind through an energized morning flow. You feel the connection with nature as you are mesmerized by its beauty. Today your teacher is inviting you to connect with the element water, to be playful, accepting and to go with the flow. This is exactly what you do today. After a delicious multi course breakfast, you step out of your comfort zone and join a surf class. It's challenging, but mostly FUN. In the afternoon you decide to take it easy. The lodge invites you to relax at the pool or in the hammocks. The sunset evening yoga class slows you down. While the sky is turning pink, your teacher is taking you on an inner journey. After class, your 3-course healthy and nourishing dinner awaits. You feel deeply connected and accepted by like minded people at the lodge. Another stroll takes you down to your bungalow, the garden lights up with fairy lights. Whatever the circumstances are, right at this moment, life is good. Your breakfast, lunch and dinner are included. The way we fuel our bodies is one of the most important focuses of the retreat. All of our meals have all of these ingredients: - It's honest. We are conscious of where our food is coming from. [Remy Groenendaal](/teacher/remy-groenendaal) Remy, from The Netherlands, decided he wanted a change in his life. The interest of becoming a better version of himself and living a healthy lifestyle was always a big part of his life since his professional tennis career. [Kelly de Beer](/teacher/kelly-de-beer) After giving up a life as a tax advisor in Amsterdam, Kelly traveled the world with Remy to search for something more in life. She had no idea what she was looking for. A yoga teacher training, a Reiki training, and a Vipassana meditation course helped her find happiness by just being. [Monika Staszczyk](/teacher/monika-staszczyk) Monika is sun-loving, traveling yoga teacher. She is a 300 RYT yoga teacher specialized in Vinyasa, Yin Yoga and Yoga Nidra and a Pilates instructor.

Ayelet LPosted 5 months ago on TripAdvisorWe stayed 2 incredible weeks at Eden. We celebrated our anniversary. Our Cabanna was absolutely beautiful clean and facing the ocean. Lucas and Monica were incredible hosts! Monica and Jenna... LaurenPosted a year ago on BookRetreats I chose to go to Eden because it appeared to be the most intimate yoga retreat I had seen online and in person, it is exactly that. It is a space that has incredible natural beauty, but it also cultivates a space where you can connect deeper with yourself and those around you in a very natural way. I loved all of the yoga sessions, the meals we shared together, and the cacao ceremony. Some accomplishments from this retreat were being able to challenge myself to get back into my practice and push myself to try surf, as well as go deeper into poses. Also pushed me to confront some of what I have been facing personally and work through it in a healthy way. Lauren, you truly made us all feel so welcomed. You have such a welcoming presence and made me feel very safe and comfortable right away. You and Mario have truly cultivated a safe and beautiful space to be in. This was truly a transformative experience and I will forever remember my time at Eden. Thank you. Mona S.Posted 8 months ago on BookRetreats I really enjoyed my time at Eden. The yoga classes, the beautiful surroundings, the attentiveness of the staff and the interesting guests all made for a refreshingly relaxing stay. Hanging out with and petting the animals was the extra perk I didn't realize I needed. I gave them a 4-star review because I think they could have taken a lot more sanitary precautions to contain the stomach flu virus that was going around while I was there. They didn't seem to pay much attention to it, which I found somewhat irresponsible. I ended up getting the stomach flu and was incapacitated for a couple of days. It is possible that I could have caught it from somewhere else but the chances I got it at Eden are very high, as everyone was falling around me like dominoes. While I respect their preference for a raw vegan menu, I ultimately think raw foods are the ideal vehicle for passing on unwanted bacteria and I would highly recommend offering hot, fully cooked options instead, especially since they're in the business of accommodating foreigners whose guts may not be conditioned to local water/foods. Generally speaking, the food (dinner especially) would be something to improve upon in my opinion. Also, their policy of not bringing outside food is not very reasonable in my opinion for those of us who have needs beyond vegan preferences, especially since they don't serve lunch. MettePosted 9 months ago on BookRetreats I just want to send you a few words after my lovely days at Eden. It was an absolutely healing and beautiful time.
