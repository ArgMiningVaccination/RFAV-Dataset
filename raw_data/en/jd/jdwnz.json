Here, we developed a novel vaccineplatform consisting of genetically detoxied pertussis toxoid (PTd) with multiple adjuvant componentsincluding CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, and cationic innate defence regulator the serum IgG2a and IgG1 antibody titres inadult mice when compared to immunization with each of the selected adjuvants or immunization withPTd antigen alone. When used in combination, these adjuvants were able to induce a superior IgG2aresponse in both adult and neonatal mice, when compared to antigen alone or commercial vaccines.The increased response observed when using this adjuvant formulation was also initiated earlier and,moreover, was maintained over a period of greater than 22 months. The adjuvant platform also showedan ability to induce an immune response in a greater number of mice as compared to antigen alone. Thissuggests that this uniquely adjuvanted vaccine induces a stronger and more balanced immune responsewith an earlier onset of this response than vaccination with PTd antigen alone. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Whooping cough is an acute, highly communicable infection caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis .I ti sa major childhood illness in the developing world and even in severalindustrialized nations [1-3] . Pertussis causes signicant morbidity and mortality mostly in infants and young children, who are eithertoo young to have been vaccinated (<two months old), or who havenot received their full series of vaccinations [1,3,4] . Although it is reported that >80% of people in industrialized nations have beenvaccinated against pertussis, there has been a resurgence of thedisease within the past two decades [2-4] . B. pertussis is generally considered to be an extracellular pathogen that localizes at the epithelial cell surface and thus itwas previously believed that humoral immunity and a Th2-typeresponse would mediate protection, as is usually the case for Corresponding author. Tel.: +1 bacteria [5]. Although antibodies can be protective against infection, as shown by passive antibody transfer, exper-iments in mice have shown that circulating antibodies are notnecessary for maintenance of vaccine-mediated immunity [6,7] . Since B. pertussis is also able to invade human and mouse lung macrophages, full clearance of this pathogen requires an addi-tional strong immune response (CMI), with antibodyalone being insufcient [5-8] . Studies of pertussis infection in human infants and mice indicate that a strong Th-1 response,specically mediated by IFN- /H9253, is required to resolve infections [7,9,10] . Polarizing the T-cell response after vaccination towards a Th-1 type response has been shown to improve the effectivenessof acellular pertussis vaccines [7]. Indeed, respiratory-challenge protection has been shown in the absence of a detectable anti-body response, but is correlated with a strong Th-1 response[6]. The neonatal immune response is functionally skewed towards a Th-2 type bias [11,12] , in part due to the repression of Th- 1 responses in the mother and fetus during pregnancy, andcompromised antigen presentation. This immune bias can pre- 0264-410X/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.12.0831596 A. Gracia et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 1595-1604 clude successful infant immunization when a pathogen, such as pertussis, requires the induction of a balanced or Th1-typeimmune response through vaccination. Recent studies in mice haveindicated that appropriate adjuvantation, such as simultaneousstimulation of multiple Toll-like receptors (TLR), can augment theimmune response in neonates and may compensate for a sub-optimal immune system [13] . Thus, to achieve the best possible immune response to vaccination in neonates, multiple adjuvantsworking synergistically through multiple mechanisms may berequired. In the present study we have evaluated a combinationof novel adjuvants based on three distinct types of immunomod-ulators, which together promote a more balanced or oligodeoxynucleotides potent activators ofthe innate and adaptive immune systems of many species(reviewed in [14] ). CpG ODNs promote a Th-1 APCs (reviewed in [14,15] ). CpG ODN have been used as adjuvants to promote switching from a Th-2 response to aTh-1 response in neonatal mice [15] . Since TLR signalling and activation is necessary for DC maturation and B cell activation,marked effects on antibody production would also be expected,making CpG ODN an excellent candidate adjuvant for a vaccineaimed at shifting the immune response towards the Th-1 direction[16] . Polyphosphazenes (PPs) are synthetic polymers with an ganic backbone of alternating phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)atoms and two side groups attached to each P (reviewed in[17] ). PPs can form microspheres to encapsulate possible vac- cine antigens [18,19] . Two PPs in particular adjuvants, polyphosphazene polyelec-trolyte, poly[di(sodium carboxylatoethylphenoxy)phosphazene](PCEP) and poly[di(sodium carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene](PCPP). adjuvant that, when compared with PCPPin a murine model, was found to be an even better enhancer ofantigen-specic Th-1 and Th-2 immune responses. PCEP modi-ed the immune response from a Th-2 bias to a mixed Th-1/Th-2response, with both PPs being vastly more potent adjuvants thanalum [20] . Cationic innate defence regulator peptides (IDR) are naturally occurring innate host defence molecules found in animals, insects,and plants. Although originally studied for their (often-weak) directantimicrobial activities, they have a number of immunomodula-tory properties. These include recruitment and selective activationof immune cells including dendritic cells (DC) through mech-anisms independent of TLRs, synergy with CpG ODNs, and anability to protect against a variety of bacteria in mouse infec-tion models (reviewed in [21,22] )[23] . IDRs are evolutionarily conserved and innate andadaptive immunity [24,25] . At physiological concentrations, IDRs immune effector cells, throughchemokine induction or leukocyte recruitment, to the site ofinfection, allowing innate, then adaptive immune responses tobe generated [26-29] . Evidence exists that IDRs such as catheli- cidins and defensins can function as potent adjuvants and cellular and humoral immune responses in murinemodels [30] . The present study was undertaken to determine whether a novel combination of vaccine adjuvants can shift the immune responsetoB. pertussis in both adult and neonatal mice towards a balanced or more Th-1 type response. The results suggest that this vac-cine adjuvant technology can be viewed as a platform for futureneonatal vaccines directed against pathogens that require a strongcell-mediated immune response for full clearance.2. Materials and methods 2.1. Animals Adult male and female BALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All mice were housed andcared for in the Animal Care facilities at VIDO, University ofSaskatchewan (Saskatoon, SK). 8-week old females were used forall adult mouse studies, and mice were bred in the Animal Carefacilities at VIDO, University of Saskatchewan, to obtain neonatalmice. Neonates were immunized at 7 days and housed with theirdams until weaning at four weeks of age. All animal experimentswere performed in agreement with the guidelines proposed by theUniversity of Saskatchewan and the Canadian Council for AnimalCare. 2.2. Immunization of mice Adult mice were immunized subcutaneously between the shoulder blades with either 50 /H9262lo r1 0 0 /H9262l of (PBS) (Gibco, Invitrogen; Carlsblad, CA),and boosted in the same manner after four weeks unless other-wise indicated. Neonatal mice also received 50 /H9262l of the respective formulations or sterile PBS subcutaneously between the shoulderblades and were boosted in the same manner after four weeks.Experimental groups requiring pre-complexing of the IDR and CpGODN adjuvants IDR ODN components co-incubatedin 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes (VWR; West Chester, PA) at 37 Ci na block heater for 30 min prior to the addition of any other vaccinecomponents. 2.3. Vaccine components Genetically detoxied PTd was provided by Novartis, formerly Chiron (Siena, Italy) [31] . Received batches were centrifuged at 1350 \u00d7gfor 10 min before storing at 20 C in aliquots. Frozen aliquots were thawed at room temperature and then centrifugedat 1350 \u00d7gfor 10 min. The supernatents were removed and subse- quently stored at 4 C for use in the vaccine formulations. Three IDRs, IDR-HH2, IDR-HH18, and IDR-HH1002, were [29] De-protected IDRs were cleaved from prior to lyophilization. Lyophilized IDRs were resuspendedin de-ionized water prior to dilution in PBS for use. CpG ODNwere purchased from [20] with minor modications. The synthesis was performed by the Idaho National Laboratory(Idaho Falls, ID), under the supervision of Dr. John Klaehn. Polyphos-phazenes were received in lyophilized form and stored at 4 C in the dark, then dissolved for use in Dulbecco's PBS (1.54 mM KH Sigma-Aldrich, MO) by gentle shaking for 36 h at room temperature (RT). After resuspen-sion, polyphosphazenes were stored in aliquots at RT in the dark. Quadracel TMwas purchased from Sano Pasteur (Toronto, ON). The human dosage of 0.5 ml, contains 15 Lf Diphtheria toxoid, 5Lf Tetanus 40 D-antigen units type type 2 (MEF-1) and 32 D-antigen units type3 (Saukett)] with 1.5 mg aluminum phosphate as adjuvant. Forimmunization of mice, the volume administered was adjusted tocontain a dose of chemically detoxied PT identical to that of thegenetically detoxied PTd in the novel vaccine formulations studiedhere.A.

PTd-specic serum IgG2a Ab responses to immunization with various adjuvants. Adult BALB/c mice ( n= 8 or 10 mice per group) were immunized with PTd antigen alone, PBS, or antigen combined with various dosages of CpG ODN, IDR, or PP at 8 weeks of age. An identical secondary immunization was given at 4 weeks. Se ra were collected immediately prior to the initial immunization and every 2 weeks thereafter for 10 weeks. ( A) Statistically signicant differences occurred between each class of CpG ODN relative to PTd ( p< 0.05) treated mice. ( B) Statistically signicant between CpG ODN with respect to PTd ( p< 0.05) treated mice occurred, and between 50/H9262g of VIDO-PP4 when compared to 50 /H9262go /H9262g of VIDO-EP#3 ( p< 0.05). ( C) The only statistically signicant differences occurred between CpG ODN combined with 75/H9262g IDR-HH18 compared to PBSA ( p< 0.05) treated mice. 2.4. ELISA analysis of PTd-specic Abs Blood was collected through tail bleeding at two week inter- vals, starting at zero weeks (at the time of the initial immunization)for adults, and four weeks post-initial immunization for neonates.Serum was then collected by centrifugation of the blood in a micro-centrifuge at 5940 \u00d7gfor 5 min, and this was used to perform ELISAs. Polystyrene microtiter plates (Immulon 2 HB; Thermo, Mil- ford, MA) were coated overnight at 4 C with 0.25 /H9262g/ml of PTd antigen in coating buffer (15.0 mM Na 2CO3and 34.88 mM NaHCO 3). The plates were then incubated for 2 h with serially diluted sera. PA;1/5000 dilution, starting concentration 500 /H9262g/ml) was used to amplify the reaction, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich,St. Louis, MO; dilution 1 mg/ml) was used as a Sam-ples were analyzed using a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad iMarkMicroplate Reader; Philadelphia, at /NAK405 nm with a reference of /NAK490 nm. 2.5. Statistics Data was analyzed for normal distribution and signicance using the STATA program version 10 for Windows (StataCorp LP,College Station, TX). One-way ANOVA was used to determine thepresence of a signicant difference between groups, followed byScheffe's test to identify which of the groups were signicantly dif-ferent. A p-value of p< 0.05 was considered statistically signicant. 3. Results 3.1.

PTd-specic serum Ab responses to immunization with various adjuvant platform combinations. Adult BALB/c mice ( n= 10 mice per group) were immunized with either PTd antigen alone, PBS, or antigen combined with various formulations of CpG ODN, IDR, and PP combined at 8 weeks of age. An identical secondary i mmunization was given at 4 weeks. Sera were collected immediately prior to the initial immunization and every 2 weeks thereafter for 10 weeks. ( A) Statistically signicant IgG2a antibody differences occurred between the adjuvant platform combination containing 75 /H9262g IDR-HH18 (complexed with CpG ODN) relative to 0.05) treated mice.

Immunization with 10 /H9262g of each class of CpG ODN resulted in a statistically signicant increase in IgG2atitres (indicative of a Th1 response) as compared to either onlyor 10/H9262g control ODN ( Fig. 1 A), but between the CpG groups no signicant difference was observed in the IgG1 titres (indicative of a Th2 response) (datanot shown). Class-C 10101 ODN was selected for inclusion inthe vaccine adjuvants described here, as its mechanism of action isreported to combine the qualities of both Adult mice were immunized with0.10/H9262g of PTd and either 50 /H9262go r1 0 0 /H9262g of each polyphosp- hazene, with and without 10 /H9262g of the selected CpG ODN, and the serum IgG1 and IgG2a titres were compared. Both the 50 /H9262g/mouse and 100 /H9262g/mouse doses of VIDO-EP#3, in combination with CpG C ODN and PTd, were found to induce higher IgG2a titres thanVIDO-PP#4 and CpG C, however, these increases were not statis-tically signicant. We observed a 500-fold increase in IgG2a titre,as compared to PTd antigen alone, after boosting with VIDO-EP#3at four weeks. A statistically signicant difference in IgG2a titreswas observed in mice immunized with PTd and 50 /H9262g VIDO-EP#3 compared with mice immunized with PTd and 50 /H9262g VIDO-PP#4 (Fig. 1 B). No statistically signicant differences in the IgG2a titres occurred after immunization with either dose of VIDO-PP#4. TheIgG1 titres showed no signicant differences between the twodoses of the two polyphosphazenes. Mice vaccinated with PTd anti-gen alone failed to produce statistically signicant PTd-specicIgG2a titres as compared to unvaccinated mice over the entirecourse of the experiment. However, these mice did display a sig-nicant increase in IgG1 response. When CpG was included inthe formulation, we observed a statistically signicant increase inIgG2a titres; however, there were other differences noted betweenthe two PP-adjuvanted groups. None of the mice vaccinated with50/H9262g/mouse VIDO-PP#4, PTd and CpG ODN produced a signicant IgG2a response. When the dose was increased to 100 /H9262g/mouseVIDO-PP#4 (still including CpG), three mice failed to respond post- vaccination, and four mice responded after 8 weeks or longer,instead of the usual four to six weeks. In contrast, all except onemouse vaccinated with 50 /H9262g/mouse VIDO-EP#3, PTd, and CpG ODN produced an IgG2a response, and only two mice vaccinatedwith 100 /H9262g VIDO-EP#3 failed to produce detectable IgG2a. Thus VIDO-EP#3 as a vaccine adjuvant appeared to be a more consis-tent stimulator of the IgG2a response, and was selected for furtherformulations. Two IDRs, IDR-HH2 (VQLRIRVAVIRA-NH 2) and IDR-HH18 (IWVIWRR-NH 2) were synthesized and tested. Adult mice were immunized with 0.1 /H9262g of PTd together with 75 /H9262go r1 5 0 /H9262g (3.75 mg/kg or 7.50 mg/kg, respectively) of IDR-HH2 or IDR-HH18,were boosted in the same manner after 4 weeks, and the IgG1 andIgG2a serum responses were analyzed. Vaccination with each IDRand PTd at 75 /H9262g/mouse or 150 /H9262g/mouse doses resulted in no detectable IgG2a response. When the IDRs were combined witha1 0/H9262g/mouse dose of CpG C ODN and PTd, a statistically sig- nicant IgG2a response was observed in mice immunized with75/H9262g/mouse of IDR-HH18 as compared to mice immunized with PTd only ( Fig. 1 C). Vaccination with 150 /H9262g/mouse of this IDR resulted in the abla- tion of the IgG2a response. The lower dose of IDR-HH18 combinedwith CpG ODN was the only IDR group tested that was statisticallydifferent from the PTd antigen alone. Thus, there appeared to be aninverse dose effect, with lower doses of IDR able to increase theIgG2a titres better than higher doses. Vaccines formulated withIDR-HH2 resulted in no signicant IgG2a response, and additionof CpG C ODN did not improve the results. Upon measuring theIgG1 titres, we observed that either IDR alone resulted in a greaterincrease in IgG1 titres as compared to either IDR in combinationwith CpG C (data not shown). However, once again lower dosesappeared to perform better in the IDR and CpG C combinationgroups. Due to the IgG2a results, as well its potential effects oncellular recruitment and cytokine levels, IDR-HH18 was selected asthe IDR for continued testing.A.

Testing the combined adjuvant platform in adult mice After the selection of each of the components, a vaccine com- bination using the adjuvant platform was developed. It had beenfound in vitro that when CpG ODN was added to IDRs, a precip- itate complex was formed that was able to enhance chemokineproduction in vitro , as well as to increase mucosal and systemic responses in vivo [33] . Thus, vaccine groups were included to con- rm the ability of this complexation to increase immune responsesin vivo . Vaccine formulations consisted ODN, of To create the complexed precipitate, CpG C and IDR-HH18 were pre-combined and heated at 37 C for 30 min. Non-complexed groups had CpG C and IDR-HH18 kept separate until immediately priorto injection. Adult mice were immunized and boosted with varia-tions of the adjuvant platform combination and the serum IgG2aand IgG1 titres were compared ( Fig. 2 A and B). A large increase in serum IgG2a titres was observed in mice immunized and boosted with the adjuvant platform formulationsas compared to PTd antigen alone ( Fig. 2 A). An earlier, stronger IgG2a response was observed when the adjuvants were complexedprior to vaccination and this difference was statistically signicant(p< 0.05) between the groups containing a 75 /H9262g dose of IDR. Evenwhen the IDR dose was lowered to 10 /H9262g/mouse, antibody titres rose earlier and higher in the complexed adjuvant platform groupas compared to the non-complexed group. The IgG1 serum response after vaccination showed a similar trend to the IgG2a ( Fig. 2 B). There was a signicantly earlier and greater IgG1 response when the adjuvants were included in thevaccine, as compared to antigen alone. There was also a signif-icant difference in IgG1 titres seen between the complexed andnon-complexed adjuvant platform groups; however, there wasno difference seen between the complexed groups containing thehigher 75 /H9262g/mouse dose of IDR, and the lower 10 /H9262g/mouse dose. When comparing the IgG2a responses, we observed several non- responders in the PTd only group ( Table 1 ). Three mice in this PTd group that did not produce detectable IgG2a also failed to pro-duce an IgG1 response to the antigen. In contrast, mice from thehigher dose 75 /H9262g/mouse IDR group complexed with CpG ODN all showed a measurable IgG2a response to vaccination, with no lateresponders. All of these mice also had an IgG1 response. In thenon-complexed adjuvant platform group containing 75 /H9262g/mouse of IDR, there were two IgG2a non-responder mice, and three late-responders. The adjuvant platform group containing 10 /H9262go fI D R complexed with CpG ODN contained non-responders.These three responses to immunization with adjuvant platform combinations. Neonatal BALB/c mice were immunized with either PTd a ntigen alone, antigen combined with various formulations of CpG ODN, IDR, and PP combined ( n= 8 mice per group), or PBS ( n= 5 mice per group) at 7 days of age. An identical secondary immunization was given at 4 weeks. Sera were collected at 4 weeks after the initial immunization prior to the boost, and every 2 weeks thereaf ter until 8 weeks post-initial immunization. ( A) At week 6-8, statistically signicant differences in IgG2a antibody titres occurred between complexed adjuvant platform combination and PTd ( p< 0.001) treated mice. There was also signicant difference in IgG2a antibody titres ( p< 0.05) seen between the complexed and non-complexed adjuvant platform combinations. ( B) At week 6-8, statistically signicant differences occurred between the complexed or non-complexed adjuvant platform combination relative to PTd treated mice ( p< 0.05). There was no statistically signicant difference seen between the complexed and non-complexed adjuvant combinations.1600 A. Gracia et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 1595-1604 Fig. 4. PTd-specic neonatal serum IgG2a Ab responses to immunization with various adjuvant platform combinations or alum. Neonatal BALB/c mice were immun ized with either PTd antigen alone, antigen combined with various adjuvant platform combinations, antigen with alum ( n= 10 mice per group), or PBS ( n= 9 mice per group), at 7 days of age. An identical secondary immunization was given at 4 weeks. Sera were collected at 2 weeks after the initial immunization prior to the boost, and every 2 weeks thereafter. Statistically signicant differences occurred between the adjuvant platform combination containing 35.55 /H9262g IDR and the combination containing 4.74 /H9262g PTd treated mice ( p< 0.05, and p< 0.01, respectively) at selected time points. There was also a statistically signicant difference found between the adjuvant platform combination containing 35.55 /H9262g of IDR and the PTd and alum group ( p< 0.01). There were no differences between the two adjuvant platform combination formulations. 3.3. Triple adjuvant combination in BALB/c neonatal mice Seven-day old mice were used in our neonatal experiments. This age has been shown to correlate best with the human neonate'simmune system [11,12] . IgG1 titres monitored over time ( Fig. 3 A and B). A higher dose of PTd was used for vaccination in the neonatal modelto compensate for the reduced ability of the immature immunesystem to respond to the antigen, and the dosages of other vac-cine components used were adjusted for the smaller weight of thepups in comparison to adult mice. Vaccine formulations Large increases in the serum IgG2a response were observed in mice immunized and boosted with each adjuvant platform com-bination tested. The differences between the responses to thecomplexed adjuvant formulation, or the non-complexed formu-lation, and statistically signicant ( respectively). Immunization with vant platform vaccine also resulted in signicantly ( 0.05) higher IgG2a titres as compared to the non-complexed combination. The IgG1 titres in this experiment followed a very similar pattern to the IgG2a response, with adjuvant combinations induc-ing approximately 10 times higher titres than the antigen alone(Fig. 3 B). There was no signicant difference seen in the IgG1 titres between the complexed and non-complexed vaccine groups, how-ever, the mouse to mouse variability in antibody titre was larger inthe non-complexed vaccine groups. 3.4. Variations of the adjuvant ratio in neonatal mice In vitro evidence indicated that an adjuvant ratio of 1:2:1 (CpG ODN:IDR:PP) was most effective at increasing chemokine produc-tion in vitro [33] . In our previous experiments, a ratio of 1:15:1was being used, thus, a comparison of this ratio to the in vitro sug- gested adjuvant ratio was performed. Neonatal 7-day old mice wereimmunized with vaccine formulations either containing 1.0 /H9262g PTd alone, or consisting of the 1:15:1 ratio with 2.5 /H9262g alum (alu- minum phosphate), the commercially used adjuvant that inducescharacteristically strong Th-2 type immune responses. A large increase in the IgG2a titres already occurred after the rst immunization with either ratio of the adjuvant platform formula-tion, as compared to antigen alone ( Fig. 4 ). No signicant difference was seen between the adjuvant platform combination containinga dose of 35.55 /H9262g of IDR-HH18 (1:15:1 ratio) and combination with the lower 4.74 /H9262g IDR dose (1:2:1 ratio). Very low found in the PTd + alum immunized group. Within this alumgroup, there were ve non-responder mice and one late-responderout of a total of 10 mice ( Table 2 ). In the adjuvant combination group with 35.55 /H9262g of IDR-HH18, all mice showed an IgG2a response and there were no late responders. In the adjuvant combination groupcontaining 4.74 /H9262g of IDR, there was one mouse that was a late responder, however all mice eventually showed an IgG2a responsepost-vaccination. 3.5. Duration of immunity The antibody levels of the group containing an adjuvant ratio of 1:2:1 were followed over a longer period of time to examine whenthey would decrease ( Fig. 5 ). Very high IgG2a titres were induced after immunization and boosting, and these titres remained ele-vated at the highest level for approximately 52 weeks. Past thispoint, the antibody titres decreased slightly, however, the IgG2aantibody response has remained highly elevated for more than 22months, with the experiment still ongoing.

An identical secondary immunization was given at 4 weeks. Sera were collected at 2 weeks after the initial immunizationprior to the boost, and every 2 weeks thereafter, until week 10, after which serawere collected approximately every 4 weeks. 3.6. Comparison of single and double immunizations with a commercial vaccine The ability of these adjuvants to induce a response comparable with, or ideally superior, to that seen after immunization using acommercial vaccine and the response to one or two doses wereexamined. Vaccine formulations consisted of vaccine Quadracel TM. The IDR-1002 and CpG ODN components were complexed. Single and double immunization groups for theadjuvant platform combination and Quadracel TMwere included. IDR-HH18 was replaced by a third generation synthetic IDR,IDR-1002 (VQRWLIVWRIRK-NH 2) because of its ability to induce superior chemokine responses in vitro and in vivo [29] . IgG2a serum responses were compared ( Table 3 )(Fig. 6 ). A large increase in IgG2a titre was seen after both a single and a double immunization with the adjuvant platform formulations, ascompared to PTd antigen alone; however there was a noticeable dif-ference between the single dose and the boosted groups, with theboosted group developing much higher titres. Immunization withthe commercial Quadracel TMvaccine, currently used for infant vac- cination, resulted in very low to negligible IgG2a titres after a singledose, with an increase in titre occurring when boosted. However,even within the boosted Quadracel TMgroup, the resulting IgG2a titres were still lower than or similar to those that occurred in thesingle dose adjuvant platform group. The IgG2a antibody responsein the adjuvant platform and Quadracel TMgroups remained ele- vated for over four months. Thus it appears that through using the adjuvant platform for- mulation, a greater Th-1 immune response can be induced, evenafter a single immunization, than that seen with a commercial vaccine. 4. Discussion Whooping cough remains a major threat to infants and chil- dren in the developing world, with serious complications resultingfrom the disease including encephalopathy, convulsions, braindamage, and death (reviewed in [34] ). Current pertussis vaccines cannot be administered until 6-8 weeks of age, as prior to thistime several factors, including the presence of maternal antibod-ies and the innate Th-2 bias of the infant immune system, canmodulate response to vaccination. Since neonates are known tobe the most severely affected by whooping cough, a protectiongap exists prior to the possibility of immunization, during whichinfants are at serious risk. To circumvent this gap a novel neona-tal vaccine formulation, able to successfully overcome infants'Th-2 bias as well as the interference of maternal antibodies, isrequired. Combinations of adjuvants may be used to induce superior immune responses than achieved by single adjuvants alone. It hasbeen found that the simultaneous stimulation of several TLRs usingmultiple adjuvants in mice can improve the afnity maturationand neutralizing antibody production in vaccinated animals [35] . This positive modulation effect is not seen with alum, the currentlyused adjuvant in most human vaccines, including pertussis vac-cine. Using mixed TLR ligands in vaccine formulations, the immuneresponse can be increased until it reaches a threshold of activa-tion necessary for antibody maturation [35] . Co-administration of TLR-9 agonists has also recently been tested in humans and foundto enhance afnity maturation of specic anti-vaccine antibodies[36] . Because of this, we have sought to formulate effective, multi- component-adjuvanted vaccines with a combination of a knownTLR ligand and other adjuvants to create a more balanced immuneresponse and protect neonates against pertussis. Three classes of adjuvants were selected. These act via comple- mentary mechanisms and are thus speculated to simultaneouslyactivate the immune system in distinct ways. Class C CpG ODNis a well characterized TLR 9 agonist, combining the mechanisticabilities of the other CpG classes by inducing both the secretionof IFN- /H9251from pDC and the proliferation of B and NK cells [32] . Although the precise mechanism of action of the polyphosphazenePCEP is unknown, its adjuvant effects are suspected to result atleast partially from a depot effect. Polyphosphazenes have beenshown to stimulated increased cytokine production, and it is alsospeculated that they may stabilize antigens, allowing more ef-cient presentation to immune cells [37,38] . IDRs have a plethora of immunomodulatory effects; however, their ability to recruit cellsto the site of injection and activate DCs, resulting in increased APCfunction is speculated to be important for increasing the cellularimmune response necessary to clear B. pertussis infection. Evidence from this report indicates that the combination of PTd antigen plus CpG C, IDR-HH18 or IDR-1002, and VIDO-EP#3 hasadvantages over the use of each adjuvant individually or as a doubly Table 3 Individual IgG2a antibody responses and antibody kinetics post-vaccination for Fig. 6 .

Gracia et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 1595-1604 Fig. 6. PTd-specic neonatal serum Ab responses to single or double immunization with PTd formulated with adjuvant platform combinations or the commercial vaccine QuadracelTM. Neonatal BALB/c mice were immunized with either PTd antigen combined with the adjuvant platform, or QuadracelTM(n= 10 mice per group), or PBS ( n=9 mice per group) at 7 days of age. An identical secondary immunization was given at 4 weeks to some groups. Sera were collected at 3 weeks after the initial immunization, and also at 8, 10 and 14.5 weeks post-initial immunization. Statistically signicant differences occurred between 2 doses of the adjuvant platform r elative to a single dose of QuadracelTM(p< 0.05) treated mice. adjuvanted vaccine formulation. Vaccination using the developed complexed adjuvant platform was found to result in the earlieronset of the IgG2a antibody response in both adults and neonates.This was a distinct asset when compared to the responses to vac-cination with PTd antigen alone, antigen adjuvanted with alum, licensed Quadracel TMvaccine, and using the non- complexed adjuvant platform. When the immune response to vaccination with PTd antigen was examined with each adjuvant individually in adults, it wasfound that both CpG ODN and PP were able to signicantly increaseIgG2a titres, indicating an enhanced Th-1 immune response, ascompared to PTd only. Class C was selected due to its unique abil-ity to combine the effects of the other classes. The selection ofthe PP VIDO-EP#3 was based on its ability to induce higher IgG2atitres, and thus a stronger Th-1 immune response than VIDO-PP#4in the absence of CpG ODN after a primary injection. Also, over-all, a higher proportion of immunized mice were able to producedetectable IgG2a titres when this VIDO-EP#3 was used. Immuniza-tion with IDRs alone as an adjuvant failed to increase IgG2a titres.A possible explanation is that the IDRs are working through a dif-ferent mechanism than the other adjuvants, for example it is wellunderstood that IDRs do not interact with TLRs but do modulatesignal transduction downstream of TLRs including CpG ODN [23,39] . However, since the likely effect of this component is enhancement of the recruit-ment of immune cells, the apparent inability of IDRs to affect theIgG2a response by themselves may be irrelevant. IDRs are knownto have chemotactic effects on immune effector cells, and our syn-thetic IDRs have been shown to induce increased production ofchemokines in vitro and in vivo [33] . Their cell recruitment effect may possibly be achieved through changing the microenviron-ment at the vaccination site, resulting in increased APC recruitmentand subsequent increases in cytokine production that results in anincreased cellular immune response. When we combined CpG ODN and IDR together in a complexed precipitate form, a signicantly stronger and earlier IgG2a responseoccurred in both adult and neonatal mice over that seen whenthe components were added separately. A higher dose of IDR alsoresulted in a higher proportion of mice responding with detectableIgG2a to vaccination. The indication is that IDRs have an effect onthe ability of the mice to respond to the vaccine antigen by produc-ing antibodies, and thus IDRs may in fact result in an increase of theTh-1 immune response. This would indicate that the addition of acertain amount of the IDR component allows the required thresh-old of activation needed for antibody maturation to be reached. Theabsence of a detectable antibody response in some mice within avaccine group, while the other mice develop a very good response,supports the supposition that there is a stimulation threshold nec-essary to achieve activation of the humoral response.After selection of each single adjuvant, these were combined together with PTd antigen to make an adjuvant platform combina-tion vaccine. In adult mice vaccinated with the selected adjuvantplatform, the IgG2a and IgG1 serum antibody titres were sig-nicantly increased as compared to immunization with antigenalone. This indicates an enhancement of the overall, as well assupport of a Th-1 immune response. Immunization with the adju-vant platform vaccine in adult mice was able to induce a higherand longer-lasting immune response than single adjuvants alone.Complexation was found to cause a large increase in antibody pro-duction, with the greatest enhancement of IgG2a titres resultingafter a 75 /H9262g IDR dose, with a lower 10 /H9262g dose of IDR appearing to have a lesser effect, although the difference was not statisticallysignicant. There are several other known functions of IDRs, such asactivation and maturation of dendritic cells and chemokine induc-tion, which were not assessed in using the readouts of IgG1/IgG2atitres. These functions may be very important in inducing a strongoverall immune response to our vaccine formulations. PTd aloneat the dosages used was found to be very poor at inducing anIgG2a response, and somewhat better at inducing an IgG1 response,which was commensurate with previous experiments performed.In particular, there were several IgG2a non-responder mice seenin the PTd only group, with some mice in this group also failing toproduce an IgG1 response to the antigen. It is notable that mice inthe 75 /H9262g/mouse IDR complexed group all had a measurable IgG2a and IgG1 response to vaccination, with no late responders, indi-cating that complexation not only increased the overall immuneresponse in these mice, it enabled us to ensure that mice that mightnot otherwise respond to vaccination would do so. Immunization in the neonates with the adjuvant platform com- bination was found to induce signicantly higher IgG2a responsesthan PTd antigen alone, conrming the ability of the formula-tion to increase the Th-1 response, even within a model lesslikely to respond in a Th-1 type fashion. The results of complex-ation of the IDR and PP components mirrored those seen in theadult mouse model, with signicantly higher IgG2a titres occur-ring after complexation. This further indicates that complexationhas an important effect on the ability of the vaccine combinationsto induce a Th-1 response, although we do not know if this involvesco-localization of components or genuine synergy between associ-ated components. The neonatal mice were found to respond withdetectable IgG2a titres to both the antigen alone as well as to theadjuvanted groups. A possible explanation for this is the higherdose of antigen being used to vaccinate in the neonatal model.When neonatal mice were immunized using alum as an adjuvant,the IgG2a response was almost non-existent, and was signicantlylower than the response induced by the adjuvant platform com-binations. This was expected, as alum is an adjuvant that typicallyinduces a Th-2 type immune response [40] . Within the alum group,A. Gracia et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 1595-1604 1603 there was a 50% IgG2a non-response rate among the mice, indicat- ing a poor Th-1 response being induced when using this adjuvant.Since alum is currently uses to adjuvant human acellular pertus-sis vaccines, the ability of our adjuvant platform to induce superiorIgG2a titres is promising. When neonatal mice vaccinated with the adjuvant platform were followed long term over nearly two years, the IgG2a anti-body titres were shown to remain elevated over the entire period.This indicates that the Th-1 immune response being induced bythe platform formulation is not only superior in magnitude to thatachieved after immunization with PTd only, but that it is also along-lasting response. When the ability of the adjuvant platform formulation to induce an immune response after a single immunization was examined, itwas found that, although the IgG2a titres were superior followinga second immunization, the titres seen after a single dose werestill greater than those induced by a single dose of the commercialQuadracel TMvaccine, and appeared in fact to be superior to two doses of that vaccine. Thus it appears that through using the cur-rent adjuvant platform, a greater Th-1 immune response could beinduced than that seen with a commercial vaccine, and a good IgG2aAb response might be induced even after a single immunization. In conclusion, we have shown that through use of our adjuvant platform, a greater Th-1 immune response could be induced thanthat seen with a commercial vaccine, and a good IgG2a Ab responseappeared to be induced even after a single immunization, which issubstantially fewer than the three to ve doses currently requiredfor commercial acellular vaccines. Overall, the adjuvant platformformulation has the potential to improve the balance of the neona-tal immune response to pertussis, allowing an earlier, stronger, andmore effective response to be mounted to deal with infection. Fur-ther characterization of the mechanisms involved in the change ofthe immune response is needed to optimize these formulations.
