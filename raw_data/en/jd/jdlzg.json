Contact poisons information for advice if specific ingestant is known For 24 hour advice, contact the Poisons Information Centre 13 11 26 Background - Essential oils are a common household product used for medicinal, aromatic, cleaning and other purposes - Common essential oils include lavender, tea tree, nutmeg, sage, peppermint, wintergreen (see [Salicylates Poisoning](http://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Salicylates_Posioning/)), fennel, geranium, oil (see [Eucalyptus oil Poisoning](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Eucalyptus_Oil_Poisoning/)) and clove - Toxicity depends on the dose and the essential oil ingested - Toxicity can occur from the essential oil itself along with the hydrocarbons (see [Hydrocarbon Poisoning](http://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Hydrocarbon_poisoning/)) or emulsifiers added to many of the preparations Pharmacokinetics Essential oils mimic other fat soluble drugs. They are well absorbed through mucous membranes and the skin and are excreted unchanged or as hepatic metabolites via lungs, urine, faeces and skin. Following ingestion, onset of symptoms (including rapid onset of CNS symptoms) is usually within one hour. Signs of aspiration usually appear immediately, but can be delayed up to 6 hours. Biochemical abnormalities following large ingestions may take 10 hours to occur Dose related toxicity - Essential oil concentrations range from 1-20%. - Volumes of 5-15 mL are likely to cause toxicity in adults - Smaller Ingestions of 2-3 mL of some essential oils have been associated with toxicity in children - Signs of toxicity include mucous membrane irritation and gastrointestinal symptoms with possible CNS depression Children requiring assessment - All patients with deliberate self-poisoning or significant accidental ingestion - Any symptomatic patient - Ingested dose >5 mL - Any patient whose developmental age is inconsistent with accidental poisoning as non-accidental poisoning should be considered Risk assessment History Intentional overdose or accidental Dose: - Stated or likely dose taken - Exact name of oil and amount/volume taken - Preparation type and % concentration, co-ingestants, eg paracetamol Examination CNS: CNS depression (any change in significant), ataxia, seizures CVS: diarrhoea. Hepatotoxicity is associated with clove oil and pennyroyal oil ingestion Other: Mucous membrane irritation and numbness, dermal irritation, chemical conjunctivitis and corneal scarring have been reported | | Specific oils and associated clinical manifestations | | Essential Oil | | Clinical manifestations | | Clove Requires urgent discussion with toxicologist | | Large ingestions can have hepatotoxicity similar to paracetamol poisoning, renal failure, DIC, inhalational pneumonitis, coma | | Fennel | | Nausea, vomiting, seizure activity, pulmonary oedema | | Geranium | | Allergic contact cheilitis | | Lavender | | CNS depression, ataxia, photosensitiser that promotes hyperpigmentation, contact dermatitis | | Lemon myrtle | | Skin irritation and corrosion | | Nutmeg | | hallucinations, coma | | Pennyroyal Requires urgent discussion with toxicologist | | Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lethargy, agitation, dizziness and weakness.

A dose as small as 1-2 mL can be toxic (see [Salicylates Poisoning](http://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Salicylates_Posioning/)) | | Wormwood | | Acidosis, acute renal failure, respiratory acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, visual alterations, delirium, restlessness, paranoia, tremor, seizures | | Eucalyptus | | See [Eucalyptus Oil Poisoning](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Eucalyptus_Oil_Poisoning/) Always check for Medicalert bracelet in any unconscious patient, or any other signs of underlying medical condition (fingerprick marks etc) Investigations Asymptomatic children with small ingestions do not usually require investigation In all children, consider: - Chest X-ray and blood gas if signs of aspiration pneumonitis - UEC and LFT in patient with significant illness, large ingestions or with clove oil/pennyroyal ingestions - Paracetamol level in all intentional overdoses Acute Management 1. [Resuscitation](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Resuscitation__Hospital_Management_of_Cardiopulmonary_Arrest/) - Standard procedures and supportive care - Aspiration/chemical pneumonitis is managed supportively with oxygen and bronchodilators and may require non-invasive ventilation or intubation if severe - Fever is common following aspiration with pneumonitis. Antibiotics should be withheld until there is objective evidence of bacterial infection. Corticosteroids and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated 2. Decontamination Charcoal is contraindicated due to risk of aspiration and due to the fact essential oils are rapidly absorbed. - Specific treatments: Consider NAC for significant clove oil, pennyroyal or halogenated hydrocarbon poisoning, discuss with poisons/toxicologist - Eye irritation management: Routine eye irrigation, however may require a longer duration of irrigation (oily substances). Persistent eye symptoms should have ophthalmology review - Dermal exposure: Decontaminate area with soapy water, symptomatically treat any dermatitis/skin irritation Ongoing care and monitoring - Asymptomatic children with significant exposure (>5 mL) and normal vital signs including GCS, should be observed for 4 hours post exposure before discharge - Patients with respiratory or CNS symptoms should be admitted for a longer period of observation +/- supportive care. - Enhance elimination: ineffective - Antidote: Nil Consider consultation with local paediatric team when Admission should be considered for all adolescents with an intentional overdose Consult Victorian Poisons Information Centre 13 11 26 for advice Consider transfer when A child has significant CNS depression, seizures or respiratory compromise as these children usually require ongoing management in a paediatric intensive care unit For emergency advice and paediatric or neonatal ICU transfers, see [Retrieval Services](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Retrieval_services/). Consider discharge when Normal GCS Period of observation as above Assessing risk and connecting to community services - Prior to discharge, adolescents who present with deliberate ingestions need a risk assessment regarding the likelihood of further ingestions or other attempts to self-harm - Assessment of other drug and alcohol use should also be undertaken - If, after risk assessment, it is deemed safe to discharge the child or adolescent from hospital, but ongoing mental health or drug and alcohol needs are identified, they should be linked with appropriate services (see links below for services in the State of Victoria) Discharge information and follow-up: Parent Information: [Poisoning prevention for children ](https://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/fact_sheets/Poisoning_Prevention_for_Children/) [Prevention of poisoning](https://www.austin.org.au/page?ID=525) (Victorian Poisons Information Centre) Poisons Information Centre: phone 13 11 26 Mental Health, Drug and Alcohol Services Victoria Last Updated "}
