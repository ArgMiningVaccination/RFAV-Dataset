Well, they're not. These are all very real benefits of some magic little plants and herbs called [adaptogens](https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/What-Adaptogens-41639074). [Dr. Will Cole](https://drwillcole.com/), DC, a functional medicine practitioner from Pennsylvania, told POPSUGAR that what makes this plant family so special is that \"they have a common bond of having a balancing impact on your body's immune system and hormones.\" Dr. Josh Axe, DC, a major proponent of natural health, echoes Dr. Cole's belief in adaptogens, especially in their ability to keep your cortisol levels in check. Research has shown when [cortisol levels are high](https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Lower-Cortisol-Levels-44125783), there is a correlation in weight gain and inflammation. Dr. Axe also said that healthy cortisol levels are the key \"to looking younger, feeling younger, and being healthy.\" Both are fans of taking adaptogens, encouraging their patients to consider adding them to their wellness regimens for optimal well-being, as they can help lower stress levels, increase energy, and boost immunity. If you're interested in introducing adaptogens into your own wellness regimen, this guide is a great place to start.
