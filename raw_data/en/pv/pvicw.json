Good evening and, I hope, very healthy evening to all of you. My name is Yair Maimon. I've been practicing Chinese medicine for over 30 years. I'm very lucky because I've been involved both as a practitioner all these years, practicing also in private practice, but also in the health system and in hospitals. I've been teaching all around the world. I live in Israel, but I'm used to frequently travel, now a bit less lately. Also, I've been researching, so I was very fortunate to have my own research center in several hospitals and the last one also a laboratory center. One of the areas that I've been deeply researching and had interest in was the immune system. Actually, my main interest is very extreme. One is the shen and the relationship of the body to the shen. The other one is the body, cancer, and immunity. As far as immunity, I've been researching especially herbal medicine and different herbal combinations and their effect on the immune system. As we know, we are now in a very challenging time. The key in this challenging time is actually the immune system and the immune response and immunity overall. In this lecture, I would like to touch on this topic more from a Chinese point of view, but also from a research and one of my research that has been just accepted for publication two days ago and have a better understanding on how Chinese medicine affects immunity and how Chinese medicine could be a key player, actually both in strengthening immunity and helping it to deal with pathogens and really, any pathogens, but also viruses and bacteria. This also we are seeing in research, in our clinical experience. I think it's a good opportunity to go deeper and look at the current situation we are facing from a Chinese medical point of view and deepen our Chinese medical understanding. I would like to start, first of all, with some relevance to our times, to try to take it from, again, as I said, a different angle. There's many angles that have been all the time on the news that everybody be talking about. If you look at it from Chinese medical point of view, we are looking at a struggle between two forces. This is the best way to start to address the situation and address immunity and the immune response. We are looking traditionally at zheng qi, which is the upright qi, which is the summary of all the body's ability to keep its vitality, and xie qi, or bad qi, which is pathogens that are trying to invade the body, so constantly in life, we have this struggle between these two forces. This struggle is quite interesting because on both sides, we have qi, so we have the same phenomena that we are addressing, but from a different point of view. Chinese medicine doesn't just look at the body. It looks at the Universe. It looks at how things are functioning. Qi can be of different natures and here, we look at the body's qi, which is the zheng qi, and the xie, the bad qi, which is trying to invade the body and take over. This is like a key aspect to this struggle. I would like to put in a chart which, again, takes it a bit deeper into the conflicts we are facing now. On one hand, we have zheng qi. Zheng qi also can represent the immune system, but also something which is deeper, the vitality. From a Western point of view, we'll talk also about the immune response, the antibodies that the body produces, so this is our immunity. Then we have the pathogens. As we know, we have different types of pathogens. The pathogens can be damp, can be heat, can be cold, and, by the way, the same, for example, virus can manifest differently in different individuals according to their preexisting condition. For us as a clinician, it's very important because if we help to clear the preexisting condition, let's say damp, we know fat people or people with diabetes will have a much stronger response to a viral infection, especially the current one. If there is too much heat, again because this virus is very hot, the heat will even go faster. I think if there is something common, it's the toxic part, if we look at all this type of invasions. Then if we look at the zheng qi, the immune qi, or if we look at the body, we have three options. I'm putting it as a large category, but obviously, in the clinic, it helps us to guide an individual case, which can be a mixture or can be not always all straightforward. We have either a good zheng qi, a good immunity, slightly weak immunity, or somebody with a weak immune system. By the way, since I'm treating a lot of cancer patient and I specialize in treatment of cancer, we see a lot of patient with weak immunity, not just due to their disease, but also due to the medicines they are taking. Also, people with autoimmune disease will take chemotherapy or other intervention, Western intervention, that will weaken their immunity, even that initially, they are not with weak immunity, they are now in a state of weak immunity and weak zheng qi. Then we have a pathogen. In this respect, the pathogen is strong. That's what we see. If the immune system is good and the pathogen is strong, there can be total healthy response, so people can stay healthy even if the pathogen is strong. If the pathogen is slightly weak and the xie qi is strong, the pathogen is strong, then we'll get a mild disease. Everything soon will be translated to acupuncture points into clinical usage. The main problem we have that when the zheng qi, the immune is weak and the pathogen is strong, then we get very fast, serious disease. Fast means also that there is the nature of toxins and wind and heat will dampen it, so this is the condition which is actually in the hub of the problem we are facing now. Now if we look at clinical approach, then when the immune system is good, you can mildly tonify it, take some herbs. I'll talk later about my herbs that you can take, but you actually don't need to do anything. I have hundreds of people calling me, say if your immune system is good, probably you don't need to do much. You can do something. People, one of the problem is a psychological problem, so a lot of times, when you take something, you also feel psychologically better. Or if you have a purposefully designed prescription which is good for you to keep your health, definitely this is one of the things I'll advocate, so in this respect, you tonify the immune system or that's the strategy [inaudible 00:08:40]. In the second stage, when the immune system is weak and the pathogen is strong, actually, what you need to do is to take the heat out, is you need to focus on the pathogens because when you eliminate or reduce the toxicity or the heat or the damp of the pathogen, then the body's immunity can pick up and can give a good fight and then eventually go out with ... You don't deteriorate into serious condition. Obviously, the most complicated situation is the worst and the most difficult is the third case, where the immunity is weak. Then you need to tonify or strengthen the immunity and, at the same time, to reduce the pathogen, so you're kind of doing a dual approach or a dual strategy approach, which is very possible from Chinese medical point of view, but it will require a more complex or more complicated approach or complex approach also, as far as herbs, as far as the acupuncture points that we choose. Let me take it to a clinical situation. I'm looking at the curve, but from a different point of view. The curve has this area where there is a place for prevention because ... Sorry. I'll just go back to this. When there is a possibility of prevention because here, if the immune system will be good in this area, probably disease will not develop or will develop very mildly. The person will not feel it, so there'll be some antibodies build up. There'll be some immune response, but there will be no disease. The second is when there is a full-blown disease and then again, we are treating very differently. The third situation is actually when there is a cure from the disease, when somebody is over the acute phase, the active phase, and is in the curative and getting back to normal situation. In these three situations, we will use different points. I'll just illustrate it with some points like from the lung du mai or some of you may use it as a GV or from the stomach or large intestine meridians. If we look at the lung meridian, for prevention, I've put lung 9. The yuan [inaudible 00:11:12] the line the earth points to tonify the yuan qi. Yuan qi is closely linked to wei qi. Actually, the way wei qi is build is all the time with interaction of pre-heaven and post-heaven qi. We'll touch on it a bit later or I will go deeper in other situations. From the du mai, I will take du 4, the Ming men, again to tonify the yuan qi and stomach 42, the yuan point of the stomach, which also will have a strong effect on both tonifying the stomach, but also enhancing the body fluids and alleviating a tendency for dampness, etc., so all of them will be kind of tonifying the yuan qi and through this, the wei qi and keeping the [inaudible 00:12:00], keeping the zheng qi in large intestine four again, the yuan qi or the large intestine. When there is a disease phase and there is a lot of heat and a dramatic response in the body, then from the lung, we can take lung 10, the water part, sorry, the fire part, and reduce the heat in the lung. From the du, we take du 14, where all the yuan are meeting and, again, helping to reduce this acute heat building up situation in the body. From the stomach, stomach 44, the water points that will also help to reduce the heat and again, we are doing here a yangming treatment of stomach and large intestine using large intestine 11 and both of them together reducing heat. It's a strong reduction of heat and increasing or building back some fluids in the body and helping the body to deal with the pathogen. In the curative stage, we'll use lung 7, which is the lu point, which will, again, help to eliminate the residue of the pathogens, du 12, which we'll discuss in a minute, the body pillar, beautiful point to build up immunity and to build up back zheng qi. Stomach 36 we'll talk a lot about it also later and about research when stomach 36 was used to build up, again, the zheng qi, the correct qi, from many different aspects, and amazing combination stomach 36 and large intestine 10 both the san li points to build up white blood cells and strengthen the body. You can see how three different strategies, three different usage of acupuncture points, are utilized here in order to achieve the best effect in the clinic when we are facing different situation. Obviously, you can cross use points depending on the situation and when on the patient and also, as the patient goes along, obviously, we change our strategy. Just a word about du 12. Du 12 is called body pillar. It's just on the line of bladder 11, which is the zhu point of the lung, and bladder 42, which also a very good point to strengthen the lung and the immunity, so all this three points being affecting the lung and the qi and the zheng qi in the body are very important for immunity. The interesting things about especially du 12 that has this dual action. On one hand, it clears heat from the lung, so when there is heat, it helps to clear the heat, but it also pacify wind and tonify the lung and wei qi. Acupuncture overall has this capacity to be modulating, on one hand reducing excess and, on the other hand, building the deficiency. That's, I think, the strength of acupuncture, especially because we live in the world is striving for balance. If we have a point that allows the body to reach this balance in a better way, then definitely, especially if we look at immunity and the way the immune system work and modulate itself, it's a very effective point. Its indication will have heat in the chest, dyspnea, so there will be difficulty in breathing, sudden cough, etc. You can also actually use even cupping around this area to help people if they have a cough and difficulty breathing and heat in the lung, so all these points can be star points to use. It's called body pillar, so I think it needs name. We are studying deeply the names, as well. It kind of tells about this zheng qi, about holding strongly to body and the body's ability to fight. If you have a strong back, you can easily fight a disease, so body pillar brings the body back this pillar and this upright situation like the zheng qi. It's also very good in allergies and, especially, allergies when there is stuck heat in the body and there's lingering pathogenic factors in the body. This column is also nicely linking between Heaven and Earth, so it's kind of helping us to stand erect. You know if you want to stand erect, you kind of just straighten this area of the body, opening your chest and moving up this area where this point is. This shows good immunity, but also good stand as a human between Heaven and Earth, having this pillar, which is a human pillar. I want just to bring something about the history of Chinese medicine. Li Shi Zhen, from the Ming Dynasty, was a famous doctor who wrote the Bencao, which has almost 1800 herbs in it. It's amazing book about treating disease. At this point, there was a pandemic, as well, and he was one of the first one to point out that during the plague, disease comes through the mouth and nose. In the West, it was discovered maybe 200 or 300 years later. As we know, this is the key to prevent pathogens to go in. To us, it's obvious, but it took ages in human history. As we know, the most effective part about Western medicine is hygiene, always has been. Chinese medicine has also long history and one of the first one to point out that the entry points of disease would be through the openings in the face. This is interesting. I mean, I find it interesting that this year started in February is the metal year, yang metal year and, as we know, yang is metal. It's not just it's a yang metal, so there is a strong dynamic of yang. I'm not the greatest astrologist in Chinese medicine, but I find it, again, just interesting to see that [inaudible 00:18:16] the hexagram from this year is built from thunder and wind, so everything is about these kind of changes that are coming quickly that are affecting the lung that are to do with extreme situation that move extreme, like the rat. It's just interesting to note on another aspect, which is some closely or some relevance to Chinese medicine. One of the prescriptions that were heavily ... We get now a lot of research from China and I do believe that by the end of this pandemic, we will be able to analyze better and understand better the role of Chinese medicine in treating a new disease. I believe that there will be breakthroughs as far as both treating immunity and helping recovery, but also preventing deterioration of disease. That's what we are seeing now from China, so I thought I'll bring the most famous prescription. I like it because it shows the complexity of Chinese medicine. You see it's a huge prescription, qing fei pai du tang. It's made from different subscripts, prescriptions, so I kind of put it in colors. Ma xing shi gan tang is the first herbs here. Then wu ling san is these herbs, so this wall is more for the shortness of breath, the cold, the cough, and eliminating pathogens from the lung. Shen gan ma huang tang, this is the next one. It's indicating it again more for phlegm in the lung. Xiao chai hu tang is more for kind of this ShaoYang syndrome, the nature of not just a regular invasion through the [inaudible 00:20:10], but the ShaoYang area. Then some additional herbs to clean and remove toxins. I think we should watch very carefully and deeply the effect of herbal medicine in helping patients during a disease and helping them from deteriorating into severe stages. We talked a little bit about things that are relevant to our time. I would like to go deeper into immunity and Chinese medicine because the immune system it quite unique. It is a system. I call it it's orchestrating life. When you talk about immunity, hormonal system, neurological system, they're all Western terminologies. They're not Chinese, but they're talking about a system, about something which is orchestrating, something which is making sure everything is working together. The immune system is actually the most complex one and truly, it needs a lot of time to get to understand it. It's different than local systems like if we talk stomach, spleen in digestive system and lung, respiratory, urinary, so here we are talking about local xiang fu kind of engagement in the processes of changing water and food into our qi. Here we are talking about and orchestrating large system that is multifaceted, that has a lot of different aspects that we need to consider when we want to understand it fully. One of the things we can look at from a three dimensional point of view because we have the wei qi, actually wei and ying qi. We have the jing qi and actually jing and yuan qi, but also the shen qi. Shen qi also means our emotions and the way we feel in ourself and in the world. As we know, the immune system is very much closely related to the mental, to emotional, and to the inner connection to the shen. Many times, especially with acupuncture in the clinic, if you put the right point for the person to enhance the shen qi, sometimes especially for prevention, it will be the key point to strengthen their immune system. When we study immune system, we need to study this threefold kind of situation or threefold co-enhancing qis that are all the time interplaying in the body. Especially when we're teaching from a healthy point of view, we are looking to enhance wei qi, jing qi, and shen qi on a regular basis in order to prevent disease. When we look at causes of disease and the way they relate to the different qis, we can see that external disease, I'll put it also the Heaven, Earth, man model, but external pathogens more relate to wei qi. Internal pathogens more to the ying qi that flows in the channels, and the lack of communication with one's dao, the lack of being centered in one's self to shen qi. They're all interrelated and they're all part of what we will call immunity. When we come to treatments or to treat the wei qi, the lung will be the main xiang fu and to eliminate pathogen, we'll use also different systems like tendinomuscular meridian, divergent meridian. For jing qi, we'll use more the kidney. For internal pathogenic factors, maybe also external meridians. For the shen qi, the heart and we'll look also deeper on trauma and how it affects or weakens or distract the shen qi. We'll look at special points to do with traumas. This is like the complexity of Chinese medicine when we talk about immunology. In Western immunity, we'll talk about adaptive and innate immunity and actually my research, herbal research was really in innate immunity, which is really the part of us, the first line of defense against viruses. Wei qi is one of the strongest qi. It's a very dynamic yang qi. Also, when we look at the Chinese character, on both sides, we have this xing, like wu xing, like in the five elements, like left and right foot walking, so we have some dynamic movement forward, and in the center, again the phonetic qi, but also like a strong movement. Ying qi moves more in the channels. The wei qi actually moves between the muscles and the channels. That's why it's very good to enhance sweating when you want to tonify the wei qi and so you actually need different herbs and different suggestion to enhance the sweating. With the sweating, the wei qi comes up. A good point that I mentioned before, bladder 42 in line with bladder 13 and GV 12 that we talked about. I think the most amazing thing about this point it's also good for deep exhaustion of lung. There's been research published in Japan that shows it actually [inaudible 00:25:29] on these points can strengthen and makes the white blood cells, like they increase the count of white blood cells, so [inaudible 00:25:38] on this point is very advisable way to increase immunity on a daily basis. Since I deal a lot with compromised immune patients, I will touch also on this topic a bit. From a wei qi point of view, we want to tonify the lung and zheng qi, so points we discussed, GV 12, bladder 13, lung 9, stomach 36 is good combination for. For jing qi, we'll go deeper to ren mai, CV 4, and stomach 30, which is both where the chong mai emerge, but also, it's part of the Sea of Nutrition. It's a very strong point. For the marrow because I'm dealing a lot of patients with bone marrow and marrow suppression and these patients needs different care and I teach worldwide, especially oncology acupuncture among other things, so we go over deep in understanding the marrow and how we can tonify the marrow, for example, with chong mai, with gallbladder 39, which is the wei point for the gallbladder. If you are interested in studying further both immune system or oncology, you're always welcome to go to my website and probably it will direct you to different places. The last thing I would like to touch on is on some herbal formulas which can be useful for our times and also a little bit of our own research. I'll do it through ren shen, ginseng, because ren shen is a very unique herb. We know the ginsenosides. We know some active ingredients in it, but we also know its different types, so ren shen as we know, the regular ren shen tonifies qi. There's also yuan qi and deeply tonifies the vitality of the body. When we treat it to be red like hong ren shen or Korean ginseng, then it's more tonifying the yang. Need to be careful with people who have already too much heat in their body or high blood pressure. Xi yang shen is American ginseng. It's a very different nature. It actually tonifies the yin. Ci wu jia is Siberian ginseng. It's not ginseng, but it has the word ginseng, so I put it here. It's very adaptogen. It's very good also to help with stamina and to sustain situation when you need stamina. Obviously disease and a difficult disease is one of them, but also for people are doing sport, extreme sports, etc, or just tired, so ci wu jia, or Siberian ginseng, will be very kind of immunomodulating adaptogen. Generally ren shen is adaptogen, so we can use it in different situation. I personally like more formulas than single herbs. Chinese medicine is based on complexity and understanding complexity and using formulas. Yu ping feng san will be the most simple, but also the most beautiful formula. Yu ping feng san, if you look at it, to me, some formulas are almost like the same as acupuncture prescription. They're almost like a song. It's like you have these different parts of the choir playing together to create the beautiful harmony, so it has huang qi, which works strongly on the lung the qi, and bai zhu also. It dries the dampness, but also works on qi and spleen qi, so you have the lung and spleen working together, and fang feng, which again stimulates, but also good for the beginning of wind cold, wind heat. It's a classical prescription that can be modified. Then there is two formulas that we've been studying this one for now almost 20 years and this one, I think, for about 10 years. This one we just recently got the approval for publication. Its last study took almost five years and almost 20 year to finally approve a publication in the good journal, so it's a kind of long distance running if you do research and you want to publish in a good paper. That's what it takes. That's what it needs. I'm happy to be on the spot. I think there's no shortcuts in research and definitely if you want to achieve something meaningful. What we have been studying, here we are looking at white blood cells, so when you have the white blood count, when you go and you have your white blood count in Western medicine, you will see that under the white blood cells, leukocytes, you will have five types, very interesting from Chinese point of view. We like the number five. In our research, we are specifically looking at the neutrophils and on the lymphocytes and then subtypes of lymphocytes because they are the one that are key factors in viral, in bacterial infection and prevention. The subcategory of the here again we see them, but we see them divided into two types, the leukocytes, but the subcategories of the lymphocytes are the most interesting ones, especially the T cells, T-helper cells, and the natural killer cells. When we do study in the lab, we take the blood of patients and also volunteers. We compare both. We take from cancer patients. We take from our staff, friends, whoever is willing to donate a little bit of blood to us. Then actually take sometimes month to three months to work on their blood with the herbs to see how the herbs are affecting it. In our last research, we specifically look at the T, T-helper cells, and the natural killer cells and the neutrophils. We look at herbal medicine, specifically the formula we were studying and specifically the formula that we were studying the way we kind of I can say adjusted it and concentrated it affected it. By the way, one of the good thing about research is you can play. You can change. You can modify and see which modification works the best, both in the clinic and then you can check it later in the kind of environment of the laboratory that the conditions are the same, so you repeat it and repeat it and so I'm very fortunate that I could do this work, as well. This is how it looks in the lab. In the lab, you kind of go through a specific assay where you take the white blood cells and you take the neutrophils. You can isolate them from the lymphocytes and then you can look at there at CD69. It's a special kind of addition you can use. Then you can look at activation. Here we look this is like the control, how active it is comparing to little bit of formula comparing to more formula. We see that the more we are increasing the formula, the more the neutrophils are active, so we see dose dependent, time dependent manner, which means there is something very active in it. That's how it looks on patients and we did many patients checking out their blood. It's [inaudible 00:33:16] so we take their blood to the lab and then we are checking it outside of their body. That's their normal neutrophil activation and so you can see they are different on each patient. This patient are more cancer patient, so it's extreme, so it's lower than the norm. Then you can see once we are adding the LCS102, when we are adding, we call it now Tonix, Tonix-R formula. It activates dramatically comparing to the control their neutrophil activity, so you see this will be the norm and you can see how much it gets more active on that patient. This here we look at natural killer cells, the natural killer that's like their name. They are born to kill. They are looking at bacteria. They are looking also on cells, also on cancer cells, the deformed cells, and they are killing them. That's their job in the body. Again, we are comparing here on the same patient that's the control. That's their blood, the activation of the natural killer, and then when you're adding the LCS102 or the Tonix, Tonix-R. We can see it gets more active and, again, it's individualized, so in each patient we see a different response. That's normal. That's normal with herbs. This is the ingredients in Tonix-R, so we have poriae, ganoderma, and cordyceps, three mushrooms. They are very researched mushrooms. We are using specific subtypes of them. Then they show significant effect on immunity. From Chinese point of view, they also reduce dampness. They're also tonifying different aspects of qi. Then for additional herbs, astragalus, atractylodes, lycium, and ligustrum, which, again, further have shown in different research to have immunomodulation effect in increase fatigue, mental function, blood sugar level, leaving enhanced blood sugar level, and liver and kidney function. This is the formula we have been using. The Tonix-R is one of two in the research that just got accepted for publication. The other formula, LCS101, we are more checking on cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and the first one, the LCS102, the Tonix was also for healthy people. I use it now. This formula is more for people with undergoing chemo or with suppressed immunity or people with history of cancer or the need of cancer care. Then again we're looking at a larger picture, so we need a randomized clinical trial. We look at the red blood leukocytes and, specifically, neutrophils on these patients and then we're showing that we're actually protecting the bone marrow. Bone marrow means the jing, so in Chinese medicine, protecting bone marrow is a deep implication in many level. You see people sometimes are undergoing chemo, they go older quite fast, so the jing is reduced. This one we published specifically on the immunomodulating effect. We published at OncoTarget and Therapy also quite a few years ago. This is the second formula and, again, we look at the T activation and natural killer cells activation. This is the herbs in the formula. You can always look in all the publications, so you don't need to worry about it. It's on every publication on this formula or you can always go to my website, which is just my name dot com. Then you will be directed to research and to all the herbs in the formula. We show the further effect just because we've been researching for many years in more than seven research centers, including cooperating with Miami Children Hospital, with researcher from MD Anderson. The last publication is actually with one of the renown professors from Harvard Medical School, so we've been collaborating worldwide and with different researchers to produce research that shows the multifacet effect of a formula in Chinese medicine. To me, that's the beauty of formulas, so in a sense, this formula, to me, can be like a pioneer to other people in the West and to study formulas and their multifacet effect. In this respect, we show the effect to the protection that they top, a little bit about the immunity that I talk about also, a lot of effect on anticancer effect. We look deeper into the ... This was in the lab, but we look at the mechanism of action, so we kind of have a better understanding of how a complex formula is working and what's its potential in human care. To finish up with immunity and acupuncture points, I would like to introduce stomach 36. This is a beautiful painting. I've been doing this project with some colleagues of mine, [Abatos Komininski 00:38:35], Dr. Abatos Komininski from Poland and Ron [Yael 00:38:38] from Israel with amazing painter from Poland [inaudible 00:38:42] where we paint the meridian. This is the stomach meridian. We paint the points. We kind of try to illustrate the nature of the point, so this is stomach 36. You see the three different aspects of the stomach. Actually, this is the three avenues and then sources of yuan qi and the [inaudible 00:39:00]. It's an Earth point, so we kind of look in deeper into this. We're looking into the names of the point, one step deeper the alchemy of the poin and lis, one of it's understanding, it's cultivating a field of land like on an eight village family kind of, so it's very much to do with self-sustainability and the ability to produce all the food you need. San has also caused Heaven and Earth, talks about the three aspects of the origin of the yuan qi in the san jiao, etc., so it has different meanings. We know this point has many effects on the body. It harmonizes stomach, but again, it has this kind of modulation effect because it also can resolve dampness. Its strengths in the zheng qi and yuan qi. It helps to nourish and tonify qi and blood and yin even, so it's a magical point. For that reason, we have been looking at different research on immunity. I'll give a webinar, I think tomorrow. A friend of mine will give a webinar. I'll moderate it. I mentioned him, Dr. Abatos Komininski, specifically on the research, just specific the research and the mechanism of action of acupuncture in modulating and working on immune system. Here I want to point out there's been a summary of research with acupuncture point that has been studied both in human and animals and, as you can see, stomach 36 is one of the most researched points both in animals you see 25 studies and 14 studies in human. There's been a lot of studies on the effect on this point and even kind of trying to understand the mechanism of action, how tonifying this point will affect enhancing natural killer cells in the body through the avenue of the brain and the central nervous system. I'll end up with some combination of stomach 36, so qi you can combine it with lung 7, bladder 42, GV 12 that I mentioned. For yuan qi with san jiao 4, the yuan qi, the one point of the san jiao, which would be warmer, and CV 4, and for zheng qi with kidney 27, the last point on the kidney, and lung 9, so this would be also interesting combination for qi, yuan, and zheng qi. I want to leave you with different potential clinical abilities. I'm going to give a series of webinars actually starting from I think the dates are different, so like two weeks from now. It's called To Serve & Protect, a bit kind of known thing and so you can go look into it at TCM.AC if you want more information. If you want to understand better immunity, so immunity is made out of three things. It made out of the shen qi, the body's qi, and also the jing qi and what you bring to the world in order to keep yourself in great vitality. Lastly, to say when you're choosing a point the resonates with the patient's inner heart and heaven, this is where healings come from. Then you touch the real depth of the person.
