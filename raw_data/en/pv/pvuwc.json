This synergistic combination of herbs also works to support the healthy functioning of your liver. As your body's natural filtration system, your liver filters toxins and chemicals from the food you eat and the water you drink. In this way, Aller-Defense offers a natural, long-term approach to allergens. Aller-Defense offers a long-term approach: Supports your body's natural defense mechanisms Flushes out toxins Addresses sensitivity and helps the immune system to respond naturally to allergens Supports digestion Poor digestion causes the build-up of toxins and negatively impacts the immune system Promotes healthy liver function Aids cellular nutrition and performance Support a Healthy Response to Allergens If you're the kind of person who experiences allergen sensitivity when you even think about spring flowers, ragweed, dust, mold or pet dander, chances are you have an immune system that overreacts to harmless natural substances. This is your body sounding a false alarm when exposed to a certain food or even a blade of grass \u2014 and rallying the immune system to attack. But what causes your body to overreact in the first place? According to Maharishi Ayurveda, accumulated toxins prevent your immune system from functioning normally. Fortunately, Aller-Defense herbal formula offers a powerful, two-pronged approach. It supports your body's natural immunity to allergens by helping to eliminate existing toxins. At the same time, it promotes a healthy response to harmless allergens. Reviews Carolyn D. I have used this product for several years. It seems that my allergies are year round anymore. I can take this product every day, adjusting amount at different times of the year. Loraine P. Works Well for Seasonal Allergies. I have seasonal allergies typically in the Fall from ragweed. Symptoms include postnasal drip and cough. I've started taking Aller-Defense and my symptoms have improved dramatically! Joel P. Good results. I've been through years of taking conventional allergy medicine. Practicing TM, eating better, getting enough sleep and taking Aller Defense have greatly reduced my symptoms with zero side effects. No conventional medicines can achieve the same. These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
