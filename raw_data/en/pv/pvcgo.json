My name is Julia Petrovic and I live in Rugby. I am here today to speak with you about House Bill1468 which deals with true informed consent prior to receiving vaccinations . I want you to know that I strongly support this bill. 1. Are Vaccines Effective? What is the meaning of \"effective\" when applied to vaccines? Webster's Dictionary: \"effective\"- adequate to accomplish a purpose,- producing the intended or expected result, - fulfilling a specific function. Yes, vaccines are effective, BUT...\u00b7 <Researchers investigate the ability of injected matter to stimulate the production of an antibody. <...but the ~rotection from the illness. EFFECTIVE DOES NOT mean PROTECTIVE I would like to use the Tetanus Vaccine as an example. What is Tetanus? -Tetanus is a condition manifested by severe muscle spasms with the slightest movement. The muscle spasms can involve the muscles of the neck and severe clenching of the teeth, hence the name \"lock jaw\" -The Tetanus is caused by a toxin made by spores of bacteria, clostridium tetani. -The spores release an extremely potent toxin called tetanospasmin. -It can take 2-14 days for the toxin to migrate along the neuron to the spine cord A PROPER WOUND CARE is essential! Keep the wound open, because tetanus bacteria will thrive in anaerobic environment. Proper bleeding of the wound is ESSENTIAL! Bleeding clears out the clostridium tetani spores and brings oxygen and white blood cells to neutralize the bacteria. 2. Tetanus Factoids: -There is no diagnostic laboratory test for tetanus, the diagnostic is entirely clinical (observing the muscle spasms) -Clostridium Tetani is recovered from wounds in only about 30% of cases of clinical studies -The organism is sometimes isolated from patients with dirty wounds but DO NOT have clinical tetanus -Tetanus can occur with \"protective\" levels of antitoxin (>0.1 IU/dl) Reference: Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, Chapter 16: Tetanus So, effective does not mean PROTECTIVE. The next time you hear a vaccine is \"effective\" think... \"When a foreign matter is injected into a person, an antibody is generated to assist in the elimination of the foreign matter. Do I want to risk the potential vaccine side effects-which can include dea~-to develop an antibody that probably does nothing to to keep me from getting sick?\" Package inserts are the only proper document for TRUE INFORMED CONCENT . Lets refer to a copy of a package insert of DAPTACEL (Diphteria and Tetanus Toxoids -Data from Post\u00ad Marketing Experience, -Drug Interaction, -Use in specific Population, etc. 5.5 Limitations of the Vaccine effectiveness Vaccination with DAPTACEL may not protect all individuals 6.1 Data from Clinical Studies....the safety of Daptacel was compared with OT and a whole-cell pertussis DTP Vaccine. No ~lacibo! 8.4 Daptacel is not indicated for use in infants below 6 weeks of age or children 7 years of age or older, Safety and effectiveness of Daptacel in these age groups have not been established. 13.1 DDaptacel has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility. Useful info: www.vaccinesafety.edu (John Hopkins University website on package inserts) drugs.com (lists 270 oral drugs that can interact with the flu vaccine) Conclusion: I hope I successfully demonstrated how important a true informed consent is and how crucial it is for a patient to know all the risks and potential benefits to receiving a vaccine. Some side effects of a vaccine can be quite life changing, and not in a good way. Thank you very much for your time.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION : 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE DAPTACEL\u00ae is a vaccine indicated for active immunization against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis as a five-dose series in infants and children 6 weeks through 6 years of age (prior to seventh birthday). 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Immunization Series DAPTACEL is to be administered as a 5 dose series at 2, 4 and 6 months of age (al intervals of 6-8 weeks), at 15-20 months of age and al 4-6 years of age. The first dose may be given as early as 6 weeks of age. Four doses of DAPTACEL constitute a primary immunization course for pertussis. The fifth dose is a booster for pertussis immunization. Three doses of DAPTACEL constitute a primary immunization course for diphtheria and tetanus. The fourth and fifth doses are boosters for diphtheria and tetanus immunization . [See Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3).] DAPTACEL should be used as the fifth dose of the DTaP series in children who initially received 4 doses of Pentacel\u00ae [(Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids the same pertussis antigens, manufactured by the same process, although Pentacel contains twice the amount of detoxified pertussis toxin (PT) and four times the amount of filamentous hemagglulinin (FHA) as DAPTACEL. Data are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using mixed sequences of DAPTACEL and DTaP vaccines from different manufacturers for successive doses of the DTaP vaccination series. DAPTACEL may be used to complete the immunization series in infants who have received 1 or more doses of whole-ceJI pertussis DTP. However, the safety and efficacy of DAPTACEL in such infants have not been fully demonstrated . If a decision is made to withhold any recommended dose of pertussis vaccine, [see Contraindications (4.2), (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.~)J,Diphth eria and Tetanus Toxoids Adsorbed For Pediatric Use (DT) should be administered. 2.2 Administration Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for paculatematter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exist, the product should not be administered. After removing the'11ip-off\" cap, cleanse the vaccine vial stopper with a suitable germicide. Do not remove either the rubber stopper or the metal seal holding it in place. Just before use, shake the vial well, until a uniform, white, cloudy suspension results. Using a sterile needle and syringe and aseptic technique, withdraw and administer a single 0.5 ml dose of DAPTACEL intramuscularly. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each inection . Changing needles between withdrawing the vaccine from the vial and injectingntoa recipient is not necessary unless the needle has been damaged or contaminated. In infants younger than 1 year, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh provides the largest muscle and is the preferred site of injection. In older children, the deltoid muscle is usually large enough for inection .The vaccine should not be injected into the gluteal area or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk. Do not administer this product intravenously or subcutaneousl y. DAPTACEL should not be combined through reconstitution or mixed with any other vaccine. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS DAPTACEL is a suspension for injection in 0.5 ml single dose vials. See Description (11) for a pIetel1stmgohng redents 4) CONTRAINDICATIONS ; 1 Hypersensitivity A severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of DAPTACEL or any other tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or pertussis-containing vaccine, or any other component of this vaccine is a contraindication to administration of DAPTACE L. [See Description (11).] Because of uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine may be responsible, none of the components should be administered. Alternatively, such individuals may be referred to an allergist for evaluation if further immunizations are to be considered. 4.2 Encephalopathy Encephalopathy (eg, coma, decreased lwel of consciousnes s, prolonged seizures) within 7 days of a previous dose of a pertussis containing vaccine that is not attributable to another identifiable cause is a contraindica tion to administration of any Pro_gressive_ N~ur?,logi_c D!sord_er uncontrolled eplepsy,or progressive encephalopathy is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing vaccine, ncluding DAPTACEL. Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with such :onditions until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition has stabilized. S WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS :i.1 Management of Acute Allergic Reac.1ions epinephrine hydrochloride solution (1 :1,000) and other appropriate agents and equipment must Je available for immediate use in case an anaphylactic or acllle hypersensitivity reaction occurs. ,.2 Adverse Reactions Following Prior Pertussis Vaccination f any of the following events occur within the specified period after administration of a Nhole-cell pertussis vaccine or a vaccine containing an acellular pertussis component, the lecision to administer DAPT ACEL should be based on careful consideration of potential Jenefits and posslerisks. [See Dosage and Administratio 6 Temperature of <'.40.5\u00b0C (105\"F) win48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable cause. Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-h yporesponsive episode (HHE)) within 48 hours. Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting <'.3 hours within 48 hours. Seizures with or withouterwithin 3 days. 5.3 Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Brachial Neuritis A review by the Institute of Medicine founddencefor a causal relation between tetanus toxoid and both brachia! neuritis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. (1) If Guillain-Barre syndrome occurred hin6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the risk for Guillain-Barre syndrome may be increased following DAPTACEL. 5.4 Infants and Children with a History of Previous Seizures For infants or children with a history of previous seizures, an appropriate antipyretic may be administered (in the dosage recommended in Its prescribing information) at the time of vaccination with a vaccine containing an acellular pertussis component (including DAPTACEL) and for the following 24 hours, to reduce the possibility of post-vaccination ter. 5.5 Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness Vaccination with DAPTACEL may not protect all individuals ~ ~ ~ 5.6 Altered lmmunocompetence If DAPTACEL is administered to immunocompromised persons, including persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained. [See lmmunosuppressive Treatments (7.2).] 5.7 Apnea in Premature Infants Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. The decision about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including DAPTACEL, to an infant born prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant's medical status and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. 5.8 Syncope Syncope (fainting) has been reported following vaccination with DAPTACEL. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling inuryand manage syncopal reactions. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Data from Clinical Studies Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to vaccine use and for approximating rates of those events. Approximately 18,000 doses of DAPTACEL have been administered to infants and children in 9 clinical studies. Of these, 3 doses of DAPTACEL were administered to 4,998 children, 4 doses of DAPTACEL were administered to 1,725 children, and 5 doses of DAPTACEL were administered to 485 children. A total of 989 children received 1 dose of DAPTACEL following 4 prior doses of Penlacel. In a randomized , double-blinded pertussis vaccine efficacy trial, Sweden I and 14 days after each i - were made monthly to monitor the occurrence of severe events and/or hospitalizations for the 2,months after the last injection. There were fewer of the solicited common local and systemic reactions~lollowing DAPTACEL than following the whole-cell pertussis DTP vaccine. As shown in Table 1, the 2,587 infants who received DAPTACEL at 2, 4 and 6 months of age had similar rates of reactions wtthin 24 hours as recipients of DT and significantly lower rates than infants eceMngwhole-cell pertussis DTP.

In the US study in which children received 4 doses of DAPTACEL, of 1,454 subjects who received DAPTACEL, 5 (0.3%) subeelsexperienced a seizure within 60 days following any dose of DAPTACEL. One seizure occurred within 7 days post-vaccination : an infant who experienced an afebrile seizure with apnea on the day of the first vaccination. Three other cases of seizures occurred between 8 and 30 dpost-vaccination. Of the seizures that occurred within 60 days post-vaccination, 3 were associated with fever. In this study, there were no reported cases of HHE following DAPTACEL There was one death due to aspiration 222 days post-vaccination in a subject with ependymoma. Within 30 dsfollowing any dose of DAPTACEL, 57 (3.9\u00b0/o} subeelsreported at least one serious adverse event. During this period, the most frequently reported serious adverse event was bronchiolitis , reported in 28 (1.9%) subjects. Other serious adverse events that occurred within 30dsfollowing DAPTACEL include three cases of pneumonia, two cases of meningitis and one case each of sepsis, pertussis (post-dose 1), irritability and unresponsiveness In the US study in which DAPTACEL was administered as a fifth DTaP dose in DAPTACEL\u00ad primed subjects, within 30 days following the fifth consecutive dose of DAPTACEL, 1 (0.2%) subject reported 2 serious adverse events (bronchospa sm and hypoxia). In the US study in which DAPTACEL was administered as a fifth DTaP dose in Pentacel-primed subjects, wtthin 30 days following DAPTACEL, 4 (0.4%) subjects reported one or more serious adverse events (asthma and pneumonia; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; vomiting; cellulitis not at the injection site). In these two studies, there were no reports of seizures within 30 days following DAPTACEL in either eDAPTACEL-primed subjects or Pentacel-primed subjects. In another study (Sweden II Efficacy Trial), 3 DTaP vaccines and a whole-cell pertussis DTP vaccine, none of which are licensed in the US, were evaluated to assess relative safety and efficacy. This study included HCPDT, a vaccine made of the same components as DAPTACEL but ::ontaining twice the amount of detoxified PT and four times the amount of FHA (20 mcg detoxified PT and 20 mcg FHA). HHE was observed following 29 (0.047%) of 61,220 doses of HCPDT; 16 (0.026%) of 61,219 doses of an acellular pertussis vaccine made by another manufacturer; and 34 [0.056%) of 60,792 doses of a whole-cell pertussis DTP vaccine. There were 4 additional cases of -IHE in other studies using HCPDT vaccine for an overall rate of 33 (0.047%) in 69,525 doses. ,n a randomized, parallel-group, US multi-center clinical trial conducted in children 4 through 6 rears of age, DAPTACEL was administered as follows: concomltanfty with (Sanofi Pasteur SA} allowed 30 days IPV [Group B]; after concomitant administration of Menactra IPV[Group C]. Solicited inectionsite and systemic reactions were recorded in a diary card or 7 consecutive deys after each vaccination. For all study groups, the most frequently reported ;oliciled local reaction at the DAPTACEL inectionsite was pain: 71.7%, 69.4% and 52.1 % of eelsin Groups A, B and C, respectively. For all study groups, the most frequenfty reported ;ystemic reaction after DAPTACEL vaccination was myalgia: 46.2%, 37.3% and 25.8% of subjects n Groups A, B and C, respectively.

In cases where DAPTACEL and Menactra are to be administered to children 4 through 6 years of age, the two vaccines should be administered concomitantly or Menactra should be administered prior to DAPTACEL. Administration of Menactra one month after DAPTACEL has been shown to educemeningococcal antibody responses to Menactra.

Human or animal data are not available to assess vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation DAPTACEL is not approved for use in indMduals 7 years of age and older. Human or animal data are not wailable to assess the impact of DAPTACEL on milk production, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breastfed infant 8.4 Pediatric Use DAPTACEL is not indicated for use in infants below 6 weeks of age or children 7 years of age or older~ estabhshed -@ DESCR1PTlON APTACEL is a sterile isotonic pertussis antigens and diphtheria and tetanus toxoids adsorbed on aluminum phosphate, for intramuscular injection. Each 0.5 ml dose contains 15 Lf diphtheria toxoid, 5 Lt tetanus toxoid and acellular pertactin fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM)]. Other ingredients per 0.5 ml dose include 1.5 mg aluminum phosphate (0.33 mg of aluminum) as theadjwant 5mcg residual formaldehyde, residual glutaraldehyde v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative). The acellular pertussis vaccine components are produced from Bordetella pertussis cultures grown in Stainer-Schol le medium (2) modified by the addttion of casamino acids and dimethyl-beta\u00ad cyclodextrin . PT, FHA and PRN are isolated separately from the supernatant culture medium. The FIM components are extracted and co-purified from the bacterial cells. The pertussis antigens are purified by sequential filtration, salt-precipitation , ultrafiltration and chromatography. PT is detoied with glutaraldehyde. FHA is treated with formaldehyde, and the residual aldehydes are removed by uftrafiftration. The individual antigens are adsorbed separately onto aluminum phosphate. Corynebacterium diphtheriae is grown in rnodmed Mueller's growth medium. (3) Alter purification by ammonium sulfate fractionation, diphtheria toxin is deloedwith formaldehyde and diafiltered. C/ostridium tetani is grown in modified Mueller-Miller casamino acid medium without beef heart infusion. (4) Tetanus toxin is detoxified with formaldehyde and purified by ammonium suttate fractionation and diafiltration. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are individually adsorbed onto aluminum phosphate. The adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis components are combined with aluminum phosphate (as aduvant), 2-pheno ethanol(not as a preservative) and water for injection. Both diphtheria and tetanus toxoids induce at least 2 units of antitoxin per ml in the guinea pig potency test. The potency of the acellular pertussis vaccine components is determined by the antibody response of immunized mice to detoxified PT, FHA, PAN and FIM as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ditheria Diphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by toxigenic strains of C diphtheriae. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to diphtheria toxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/ml is the lowest level giving some degree of protection. toxinlevels of at least 0.1 IU/ml are generally regarded as protective. (5) Lsof 1.0 IU/ml have been associated with long-term protection. (6) whoopingcough) is a respiratory disease causedBpertussis. This Gram-negative coccobacillus produces a variety of biologically active components ~ugh t~r~er the pathogenesis of, or immunity to, pertussis has not been clearly defined -OGVlts .a .1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,lmpainn entofFertiIitym DAPTACEL has not been ervaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertili.,. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Diphtheria In a US study in which children received 4 doses of DAPTACEL at 2, 4, 6 and 15-17 months of age, after the third dose, 100% (N = 1,099) achieved diphtheria antitoxin levels of ~.01 and 98.5% achieved diphtheria antitoxin levels of 2:0.10 IU/mL Among a random subset of children who received the fourth dose of DAPTACEL at 15-16 months of age, 96.5% (N = 659) achieved diphtheria antitoxin levels of :::1.0 IU/mL after the fourth dose. 14.2 Tetanus In a US study in which children received 4 doses of DAPTACEL at 2, 4, 6 and 1517 months of age, after the third dose, 100% (N = 1,037) achieved tetanus anttoxinlevels of ~.10 IU/mL. Among a random subset of children who received the fourth dose of DAPTACEL at 15-16 months of age, 98.8% (N = 681) achieved tetanus antitoxin levels of 2:1.0 IU/mL after the fourth dose. 14.3 Pertussis nded, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study was and 6 months of age.The mean length of follow-up was 2 years after the third dose of vaccine. The protective efficacy of DAPTACEL against pertussis after 3 doses using the World Health Organization(WH0) case definition (2:21 consecutive days of paroxysmal cough with culture or serologic confirmation or epidemiologic link to a confirmed case) was 84.9% (95% confidence interval [Cl] 80.1 to 88.6). The protective efficacy of DAPTACEL against mild pertussis (2:1 day of cough with laboratory confirmation) was 77.9\"lo(95% Cl 72.6 to 82.2). Protection against pertussis by DAPTACEL was sustained for the 2-year follow-up period. In order to assess the antbodyresponse to the pertussis antigens of DAPTACEL in the US population, 2 lots of DAPTACEL, including the lot used in the Sweden I Efficacy Trial, were administered to US infants in the US Bridging Study. In this study, antibody responses following 3 doses of DAPTACEL given lo US children at 2, 4 and 6 months of age were compared lo those from a subset of the infants enrolled in the Sweden I Efficacy Trial. Assays were performed in parallel on the available sera from the US and Swedish infants. Antibody responses to all the antigens were similar except for those to the PRN component. For both lots of DAPTACEL, the geometric mean concentration (GMC) and percent response to PRN in US infants (Lot 006, N = 107; Lot 009, N = 108) were significantly lower after 3 doses of vaccine than in Swedish infants (N = 83). In separate US and Canadian studies in which children received DAPTACEL at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, with a fourth dose at either 17-20 months (Canadian study) or 15-16 months (random subset from US study) of age, antibody responses to each pertussis antigen following the fourth dose (Canadian study N = 275; US study N = 237-347) were a! least as high as those seen in the Swedish infants after 3 doses. While a serologic correlate of protection for pertussis has not been established, the antibody response to all antigens in North American infants after 4 doses of DAPTACEL at 2, 4, 6 and 15-20 months of age was comparable to that achieved in Swedish infants in whom efficacy was demonstrated after 3 doses of DAPTACEL at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. 14.4 Concomitantly Administered Vaccines In the US Bridging study, DAPTACEL was given concomitantly with Hib conjugate vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur SA) according to local practices. Anti-PRP immune response was evaluated in 261 infants who received 3 doses of Hib conjugate vaccine. One month after the third dose, 96.9% achieved anti-PRP antibody levels of at leasf 0.15 mcg/mL and 82.7% achieved antibody levels of at least 1.0 mcg/mL. In the US study in whinfantsreceived Reactions {6.1at7 months of age, 100.0\"/o of sub eels(N = 1,050-1,097) had protective neutralizing antibody levels (2:1 :81/dil) for poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3; and 92.4% (N = 998) achieved anti-hepatitis B surface antigen levels:::10.0 mlU/mL Although there is no established serologic correlate of protection for any of the pneumococcal serotypes, at 7 months of age 91.3%-98.9% (N achieved anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide for 68. The mumps rate was lower when DAPTACEL was administered concomitantly (86.6%; N = 307) vs. non\u00ad concomitantly (90.1 %; N = 312) with the first dose of MMR vaccine [upper limit of 90% confidence Page 5 of 6 interval for difference in rates (non-concomitant minus concomitant) >5%]. There was no evidence for interference in the immune response to the measles, rubella, and varicella antigens or to the fourth dose of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with concomitant administration of DAPTACEL. In a randomized, parallel-group, US multi-center clinical trial conducted in children 4 through 6 years of age, DAPTACEL was administered as follows: concomitantly with IPV (Sanofi Pasteur SA) followed 30 days later by Menactra [Group A]; concomitantly with Menactra followed 30 days later by IPV [Group BJ; or 30 days after concomitant administration of Menactra and IPV [Group CJ. Sera were obtained approximately 30 days after each respective vaccination. When DAPTACEL was administered concomitantly with Menactra [Group BJ, antibody responses to PT, FHA and PRN (GMC), tetanus (% participants with antibody concentrations :2!1.0 IU/mL), and diphtheria (%participants with antibody concentrations ;;::1.0 IU/mL) were non-inferior to those observed when were administered [Group A]. The anti-FIM GMCs were marginally lower when DAPTACEL and Menactra were administered concomitantly but the clinical significance is unknown because there are no established serological correlates of protection for pertussis. When DAPTACEL (and IPV) were administered 30 days prior to A], significantly lower 4 meningococcal serogroups were observed compared to when Menactra (and IPV) were administered 30 days prior to DAPTACEL [Group CJ. were non-inferior to those observed when Menactra (and IPV) were administered [Group CJ. The non-inferiority criterion was marginally missed for meningococcal serogroup Y. [See Drug Interactions (7. 1). J 15 REFERENCES 1 Stratton KR, et al. editors.
