Addiction and Substance Abuse Addiction doesn't discriminate. Anyone can fall victim to substance abuse, regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity It used to be common belief that anyone struggling with substance abuse made the choice for themselves, continuing to use despite all the negative effects on their health, life, and family. Thankfully, modern medicine has proven this belief wrong. Addiction is a complex disease of the brain. Substance Use Disorder is a treatable medical condition, which balances brain chemistry and behaviors. People impacted by Substance Use Disorder experience involuntary cravings, which leads them to seek out and use the substance despite the negative impacts on their health and life. It can be very difficult to stop using, often producing significant illness and discomfort when tried. However, successful treatment is available for anyone needing assistance to discontinue substance abuse and treat their addiction.
