Did you know that there are holistic approaches for just about every form of veterinary medicine, including vaccinations? Holistic veterinary medicine is humane, gentle, and minimally invasive. It emphasizes stress reduction and focuses on your pet's overall well-being. At [Animal Care Center](/) of Castle Pines, we offer the highest quality holistic veterinary care for your furry friends. How Is Holistic Veterinary Care Different? Holistic veterinary medicine takes the whole patient into account\u2014it looks at your pet's environment, genetics, disease patterns, symptoms, nutrition, stress levels, and more to determine the best course of preventive treatment. A [holistic veterinarian](/services/advanced-care/) will recommend the best combination of conventional and alternative therapies for your pet's specific situation. Holistic Approaches to Pet Vaccinations Modern veterinary medicine offers many vaccines for pets that can protect them from [life-threatening diseases](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/canine-parvovirus). These vaccines, while effective, sometimes come with side effects that cause pet owners to be wary about immunizing their furry friends. By looking at each pet as an individual, assessing their individual risks and needs, we can construct a personalized vaccine plan for our patients who are hesitant about giving their pets vaccinations. Essential Vaccines for Every Pet There are several life-saving vaccines that are extremely important and should be seen as essential for every pet. Regardless of whether you prefer holistic vet care, we always recommend the following vaccinations: - Rabies (dogs) - Distemper (dogs) - Parainfluenza (dogs) - Canine Adenovirus 2 (dogs) [Parvovirus](https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/canine-parvovirus)(dogs) - Feline rhinotracheitis (cats) - Calicivirus (cats) - Feline panleukopenia (cats) Certain illnesses on this essential vaccines list\u2014such as [rabies](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html)\u2014can be transferred from pets to humans. Because rabies presents a significant health risk to humans, many states require dogs and cats to have a rabies vaccine under law, including Colorado. Selective Pet Vaccinations In some cases, you can be more selective with your pet's vaccinations. Because some pets have a higher risk for diseases than others based on their lifestyles, you may be able to forgo vaccinations for certain diseases if your pets stay indoors.
