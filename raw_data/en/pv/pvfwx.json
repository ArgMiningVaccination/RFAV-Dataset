However this is totally farce. All our old traditions had a very strong research basis, the need is only to re search these basis. This in true sense will be the actual research. Today I'm going to discuss one such old tradition with you that is SWARNA PRASHAN sanskar. Many-many years ago in 7th and 8th century our rishis understood the need of immunization. At that time they didn't think of burdening our bodies with cultured organisms. Rather they developed techniques which enhanced our built in immunities. They set certain life time guidelines for these benefits and they were named sanskaars. SWARNA PRASHAN is one such sanskaar, which was mentioned to be started in infancy. This was strictly directed towards enhancing natural immunity and for development of healthy body and mind with smoothly functioning systems of the body. Yes gold can be harmful to body, but only when it has not been properly processed, for that matter the medicine made by snake venom can also be as much dangerous if not more. But then we are thankful to our westernized counter parts for having developed certain body functioning monitoring techniques in pathology which can keep a tap on our systems. In SWARNA PRASHAN sanskaar a precise quantity of swarna bhasam is amalgamated in various kinds of medicated ghrit (which act not only as carriers of swarn but they have their own role on enhancing various bodily functions). This compound can be administered to children from infancy to adolescence. BENEFITS - Improves intellect - Improves metabolism and digestion - Improves immunity and physical strength - Improves fertility - Improves quality and span of life LET US ALL JOIN HANDS IN NURTURING A HEALTHY GEN NEXT DEVOID OF CHEMICALS AND STILL BE NATURALLY HEALTHY WITH STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEM.
