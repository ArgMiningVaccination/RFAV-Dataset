Dr. V. Gustavo Blanco serv es as the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair of and Dr. Warren Nothnick as the Vice Chair. The current personnel in our depa rtment include 1 3 tenure /track faculty members, 5 research track faculty, 2 postdoctoral fellows, 1 senior scientist, and 1 8 graduate students. Two faculty members who had primary appointments with us (Drs. Sam Enna and John Wood ) both retired in 2020. This past year has been particularly different from previous years due to all the challenges imposed by the Covid -19 pandemic. Our School's leadership responded very well to this and after a relatively short shutdown period in March 2020, activities were rei nitiated with the implementation of a series of safety measures. This allowed to continue research and teaching activities under a controlled environment. Fortunately, our personnel stayed healthy and in good spirits. There are not enough words to thank the faculty, postdoctoral fellows, research staff, students, and administrative staff in our department, who despite all the challenges, worked hard to continue our mission . We continued advancing with our primary goals in three academic areas : 1) engag ing in high quality research to generate new discoveries in basic and translational physiology, which contribute to advance human health; 2) performing innovative and high quality teaching to train new generations of physicians, graduate students, and postdoc toral fellows in physiology and pathophysiology; and 3) perform academic service through participation in committees and task forces that aid our department , School , and national and international scientific organizations . Regarding research, our programs continued to cover several topics including, integrative physiology, male and female reproductive physiology, neurophysiology, and metabolism and energetics. Our researchers have been using a wide variety of approache s, inc luding molecular as well as whole animal physiology to answer relevant questions related to physiology . Research in the department has also continued to be very collaborative, complement ing the research efforts of several Centers in our School, as well as other departments in our institution and outside. With respect to education, our department has had another outstanding year, covering many different educational activities in both the medical and graduate student curriculum. Due to the pandemic, this ha d to be performed using a hybrid system, with constant changes, switching from in person to virtual classes, depending on the situation. Our faculty continued to play key roles in medical education during the first and second year of the Active Competency Based and Excellence Driven (ACE) curriculum. With the retirement of Dr. Wood, Dr. Nothnick served as the new Thread Head Leader in our department, to provide input on the content and objectives of the medical curriculum. Along with Dr. Paige Geiger, Dr. B lanco took over all the teaching load in the Cardiopulmonary Block that was performed by Dr. Wood . Drs. Stanford and Wolfe, served as Block Directors for the Muscle and Movement and Reproduction and 2 Sexuality Blocks, respectively. The rest of our faculty h ave al l been actively involved as Facilitators , leading the small group Case Based Clinical Learning (CBCL) activities of the ACE medical curriculum. Faculty in our department have also had a significant presence in the education of graduate students by participating in the core Integrated Graduate Program in Biological Sciences (IGPBS) curriculum and in our department al mandatory courses for graduate students . All t hese courses have done well and received excellent reviews from the students. The hard w ork of our faculty in teaching has been recognized with important awards given to individual lecturers and to course directors for their outstanding participation in education. We are also proud of the service activities that faculty have been engaged in. They serve in numerous key leadership roles and on committees, which are essential to the overall mission of our department and School. Dr. Smith continues to serve as the Senio r Associate Dean for Research and the Co -Director of the Kansas Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (KIDDRC); Dr. Nothnick is the Director of the Center for Reproductive Sciences; Dr. Stanford is the Program Director of the KUMC Bio medical Research Training Program and the Campus Coordinator, K -INBRE Program Director ; Dr. Blanco is the K -INBRE Research Developmental Core Director; Dr. Geiger is the Facility Co -Director of the Metabolic and Obesity Research Phenotyping Facility (Morph ); Dr. Thyfault is the Scientific Director of Children's Mercy Healthy Lifestyle and Nutrition Center (KUMC/CMH joint funded center); and Dr. Wolfe serves as the Research Integrity Officer of our School. This past year, Dr. Stanford was selected to serve a s the new Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Education. In addition, we have maintained our presence at the national and international level , with faculty serv ing on different review panels of the National Institutes of Health as well as other fundi ng agencies. They have also served as editors and members of the editorial boards for a variety of journals. We are very grateful to our faculty who, through their talent and hard work, have continued maintaining the high academic standards and success tha t gives our department the great national and international visibility that it has . In the department's office Shari Standiferd continues as the Director of Operations , Liam Higgins (Assistant Director of Operations) and Jennifer Wallace (Accountant) Fernie Bahena joined us in February 2020 as our Administrative Program Manager working with our PhD program and web updates, finances, etc. Our special thanks go to them. They provide outstanding administrative support to our department through their hard wo rk and continuous dedication. In addition, we would like to thank our work study student, Christine Younker, who has provided additional excellent administrative support to our office. 3 HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE 2019 - 2020 ACADEMIC YEAR RESEARCH FUNDING: The Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology has had a better year compared to 2018 -2019, with respect to funds coming from the School of Medicine Allocation Model and extramural funding. Our faculty have been actively submitting new gra nt proposals and several of them were able to obtain new awards. Currently, members of our department continue to work hard to produce and submit high quality grant proposals and our goal is to increase this number. Based on data provided by KUMC Enterpris e Analytics, the total grant direct costs for FY20 was $2,726,454, which represents a growth of ~35 % compared to the 2019 period . The latest data available shows that our department was ranked 35 at the national level for NIH research funding among 49 med ical schools receiving NIH funding. While this is a good position, we would like to continue improving this ranking. EDUCATION: Continuing a long tradition the physiology department has had another outstanding year with respect to teaching. The Cardiopulmonary block was selected and awarded by the students as one of the best modules in the ACE curriculum. Dr. Blanco received individual Student Voice awards for excellence in teaching. These awards were presented by the medical students at the Gran de Affair celebration in January 2020. Due to the importance of physiology in years 1 and 2 of the medical curriculum, faculty in our department will continue to have a key role in teaching new generations of physicians. With respect to the graduate stud ent curriculum, besides our involvement with the IGPBS, we continued offering our two main courses. These include PHSL 842 Comprehensive Human Physiology and PHSL 843 Physiology of Disease, directed by Drs. Wolfe and LeVine respectively . In addition, sever al advanced courses were offered. These included the PHSL 835 Integrative Physiology of Exercise course (directed by Drs. Geiger and Thyfault), PHSL 848 Molecular Mechanisms of Neurological Disorders (lead by Dr. LeVine), and Physiology of Reproduction , PHSL 834 (directed by Dr. Chennathukuzhi ). TENURE TRACK APPOINTMENTS: E. Matthew Morris, Ph.D. was hired as an Assistant Professor on the tenure track on January 1, 2020. His research is related to the influence of the nervous system in the metabolism of the liver and the entire body. RESEARCH TRACK APPOINTMENTS: Colin McC oin, Ph.D. was appointed as Research Assistant Professor, beginning on August 19, 2019. Dr. McCoin's research is centered on investigating the impacts of obesity and related diseases on mitochondrial quality and function across multiple tissues including the liver and skeletal muscle and the sex -dependence influencing metabolism and energetics. 4 JOINT AND ADJUNCT APPOINTMENTS: The following researchers received joint appointments at their current ranks. Adam Rouse, MD/PhD from Neurosurgery became a joint appointment on November 1, 2019. Courtney Marsh, MD/MPH from Obstetrics and Gynecology became a joint appointment on January 1, 2020.

OTHER FACULTY ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Numerous members of our department have been serving on review panels from NIH and other agencies. They have als o served as editors or on the editorial board of different journals and presented invited lectures at different national and international meetings and seminars at various universities. Approximately 45 peer reviewed original articles were published by our faculty in top research journals and as book chapters. GRADUATE PROGRAM AND PHYSIOLOGY SOCIETY: The student led \"Physiology Society\" continued functioning well this year. A new president was elected, and a new committee was chosen. The leadership of the Physiology Society is currently: Rikki Nelson , President Social Chair Consuelo Perez Sanchez - Stowers Chair The graduate students in the department had another active year. In 201 9-2020 four new students were recruited to the department. These include students who are working with our affiliate members at Stowers Research Institute and joint appointment faculty at KUMC. Currently, our department has a total of 1 9 enrolled doctoral students. Several of our students were awarded external fellowships to support their training. Funding came from different sources, including the SELF Fellowship program, the KUMC Biomedical Training Program, National Science Foundation, and National Institute of He alth. The new graduate students that joined the department in the 201 9-2020 fiscal year included the following individuals (their respective mentors are listed in parenthesis): Ananya Nidamangala Srinivasa (Dr. Sarah Zanders ) Olsen ) Kristen Schwingen . (Dr. Gustavo Blanco ) 5 One student completed their Ph.D. degree during the summer of 201 9 and one student completed their master's degree in Spring 2020 .

Gustavo Blanco, M .D./Ph.D. Professor and Kathleen M. Osborn Chair 6 7 8 Molecular & Integrative Physiology Emeritus Professors 9 In Honor of Physiology Donors and the Continued Impact that their Generosity Provides Mr. James Osborn (1919 - 2018 ) Mr. Osborn's relationship with our department began through his daughter Kathleen. She developed an interest in science and biology in high school and while attending college at the University of Missouri. During the summers of 1968 and 1969, Kathleen worked in the rep roductive physiology lab of Dr. Gilbert Greenwald at the KU School of Medicine. This experience was particularly meaningful to Kathleen and might have motivated her to enter a career in science had she not been taken prematurely in an automobile accident i n 1970. At the time of her death, Kathleen was in her junior year at the University of Missouri. Mr. Osborn and his late wife Marion had such high regard for Dr. Greenwald, who died in 2004, and deep gratitude for Kathleen's experience, that they made pla ns to benefit the medical center through KU Endowment. Their generosity started with the Kathleen M. Osborn Lectureship in 19 71. This lectureship remains the longest running and most successful lectureship in the history of the medical center. It has attra cted a long list of preeminent scientists from around the world and funds from the Kathleen Osborn Lectureship have also supported the annual Gilbert S. Greenwald Symposium. In 2006, in memory of his beloved wife, Mr. Osborn established the Marion M. Osbo rn Professorship to support reproductive science within the department. The inaugural and current recipient is Dr. Leslie Heckert. Mr. Osborn continued his generosity in honor of his daughter in 2012, establishing the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair to support t he leadership position of the department. Dr. Paul Cheney was the inaugural recipient and in 2016 Dr. Gustavo Blanco was named the second Kathleen M. Osborn Chair. This year we are again the thankful beneficiaries of Mr. Osborn's philanthropy with the establishment of the Kathleen M. Osborn Fellowship in Reproductive Physiology. This fellowship will support graduate students in our department interested particularly in reproductive science. The first student to receive this great honor was Rikki Nelson. Since then, other four students have been the recipients of this fellowship. The Kathleen M. Osborn Endowed Chair, the Marion M. Osborn Professorship, and the lectureship in honor of Kathleen M. Osborn have made a great difference to our 10 departme nt. These funds continue to support the research goals of our department and our students. We immensely appreciate the generous contributions that Mr. Jim Osborn made over the years. They have significantly contributed to our success. 11 William Biklen Pendleton J.D. (1920 - 2015) William Biklen Pendleton attended Liberty High School and graduated in 1939 from Shattuck High School in Minnesota. After graduation he attend ed the University of Kansas and joined the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. William served during World War II in the U.S. Army from 1942 -1946 as a Lieutenant in the 593rd engineer boat and shore regiment that was attached to the Australian 6th Division for the invasion of Borneo. Following the war, he resumed his studies at the University of Kansas. He graduated with an AB in economics in 1946. He was hired by the accounting department of Link Belt Company of San Francisco. Later, he moved back to Lawrence and farmed for five years. In 1957 he received his JD from the University of Kansas Law School. During his law practice he was a municipa l court judge from 1959 -1967, and president of the Douglas County Bar Association in 1981. In 1958 he married Edith Cottom Livingston and adopted her two ch ildren Stephen and Helen. Together, they had a son Martin William Pendleton. Edith and Martin both passed away in 1974 in an automobile accident. When William retired he remain ed active in the community. He participated in many clubs including the KU Cha ncellors Club, Elizabeth M. Watkins Society, the Vestry of Trinity Episcopal Church and was tre asurer in the 1960's, Lawrence B reakfast Optimist Club was Optimist of the Year in 1992 and 1997, the Midland Railway Historical Association where he was a direc tor, and the American Legion. He volunteered at the Heartland Medical Clinic at the Leo Center and Friends of Hidden Valley. When he was not volunteering or participating in clubs William enjoyed collecting one -cylinder antique engines, traveling and ridin g ste am trains around the world, and going on rail excursions in his own Fairmont inspection car. He passed away at the age of 95 on May 15th, 2015 at Pioneer Ridge Assisted Living in Lawrence, KS. Pendleton donated his body to research. Pendleton graciously donated to the University of Kansas Endowment Association. He wished for the money to be used in reproductive b iology for family planning and birth control research and counseling. 12 Dr. Louis R. Fletcher (1892 - 1973) \"Life is so precious and exciting, and there is so much to be learned, that I dislike to waste a minute.\" Louis R. Fletcher, M.D. Dr. Louis R. Fletcher left an unforgettable and generous mark on the University of Kansas. Described as a farm boy from Harper, Kansas, D r. Louis R. Fletcher attended the University of Kansas and Southwest ern College for medical s chool. Hardworking, humble, and adventurous are just a few words to describe the life Dr. Louis R. Fletcher lived. Dr. Fletcher was a modest man who worked extreme ly hard for his opportunities and income. Throughout college he paid for his expenses by washing dishes, lawn keeping, and working wheat fields. Additionally, he took breaks in his schooling to save money by working in various employment opportunities in A laska including working in the gold mines, ore processing mills, and as a bridge carpenter. He returned to KU for the 1917 -18 school year and then finished his last 2 years of education at Rush Medical College of the University of Chicago where he received his degree in medicine. He spent much of his professional career (26 years) working for the United Fruit Company in hospitals in Panama, Guatemala, and Honduras. He served his country as a commissioned Lieutenant Commander in the Navy. Additionally, he also served as chief of surgery at the Camp White Naval Hospital in Medford, Oregon. He had a lifelong love of learning. He returned to KU for postgraduate study in anatomy, not for a degree, but for the inner desire to learn. Dr. Fletcher rarely stayed i dle in his work as he then served in many different medical positions. His adventurous spirit served as a driving factor as he traveled and worked in many different countries. He returned to the United Fruit Company for a few years, served at a hospital at Superior, Arizona, worked as the medical superintendent of the Valdez Community Hospital, was the project physician at the Naval Base at Point Barrow, and served as a surgeon for a construction company in the Marshall Islands. Following retirement from th e medical profession, Dr. Fletcher spent time traveling to grand places. He began by sailing from New Orleans to South Africa and then continued his travels to Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Throughout his life, Dr. Louis R. Fletcher became intrigued w ith the prospect of being a \"millionaire.\" Fletcher made this happen through \"frugality, skimping, and strict economy.\" He invested his money and was very conservative with his spending and lifestyle. He 13 lived modestly, ate lo w cost substantial food, and c hose to travel by bus instead of train or plane. Dr. Fletcher humbly achieved that goal of a million dollars, in which he then said, \"As you know, I have always dreamed of acquiring a million dollars. This has finally been accomplished and today I have giv en this million dollars to Kansas University, the school that I love so deeply and which has had such a tremendous good influence on my life. I have done this with the greatest of pleasure and satisfaction.\" His donation to the Kansas University Endowment Association has provided support for research in physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, and anatomy at the University of Kansas Medical Center as well as construction of the Dr. Louis R. Fletcher Research Laboratories. The physiology department wants to extend a gracious and continued thank you to Dr. Louis R. Fletcher for the opportunities and support his generosity continues to provide . 14 Dr. Walter Joseph Meek (1878 - 1963) Dr. Walter Joseph Meek demonstrated academic excellen ce throughout his life. Dr. Meek and his family's generosity is continually valued and honored in the Physiology Department. Walter Joseph Meek was born in Dillion, KS in 1878. At age eight , Dr. Meek's father passed away followed by his mother's passing a few years later. Following their passing , he was raised with his first cousins. From a young age, Dr. Meek showed strong educational aspirations. Dr. Meek graduated from the University of Kansas in 1902 where he was senior class president and editor of the school paper. As of 1983 , Dr. Meek held the highest -grade point average of a University of Kansas Graduate. He continued his educational pursuits at Penn College and the University of Chicago obtaining his Ph.D. in Physiology in 1909. While pursuing his Ph.D. he taught at Penn College from 1903 - 1908 where he attained the rank of professor of biology. Dr. Meek then began teaching at the University of Wisconsin. He served as instructor in physiology (1908 -1910), assistant professor (1910 -1912), associate professor (1912 -1918), and professor (1918 -1948). He then a ssumed the position of chairman of P hysiology Department until his retirement in 1948. Additional professional accomplishments at the University of Wisconsin include assistant dean of medicine from (1920 - 1942), acting dean (1942 - 1945), and associate dean from 1945 until his retirement. Dr. Walter Joseph Meek also held the commission of major in the Chemical Warfare Serv ice du ring the World War I. A chemical warfare unit was set up at the University, and Dr. Meek assisted with discovering the biological effects of mustard gas, lewisite, and phosgene. Dr. Meek married Crescence Eberley on December 26, 1906. Six years later, the y had their first child, Joseph Walter Meek, born in 1912. Joseph became a law school professor at the University of New Mexico. Their second child, Mary Crescence Meek, born in 1917, worked as a stewardess for American Airlines. Their third and final son, John Sawyer Meek, was born a year later in 1918. He became a professor of chemistry at the University of Colorado. The Meek family was very adventurous , embarking on many different outdoor endeavors. They visited Switzerland to hike over the high passes a nd climbed Pikes Peak. They also spent time at Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. Additionally, Dr. Meek enjoyed side hobbies including photography, gardening, repairing and refinishing antique furniture, and collecting shells and stamps. 15 Dr. Meek's contributions to the study of the history of medicine are nothing short of extraordinary. His bibliography consisted of 110 scientific papers and one of his most clinically relevant contributions was the discovery, in collaboration with Maurice H. Seevers and Ralph M. Waters, that catecholamines cause ventricular fibrillation in dogs anesthetized with cyclopropane. Upon Dr. Meek's retirement in 1948 he remained at the University of Wisconsin as a research professor for an additional year. He continued to l ecture at the University of Texas and served on a committee to establish a medical school in Gainesville, Florida. His death occurred quietly in 1963 at the age of 84. Mrs. Meek passed away in 1973 at the age of 92. His ashes are buried with his wife's in her family' s burial plot in Pennsylvania. The Physiology D epartment extends remembrance and sincere gratitude to Dr. Meek and his family for the generosity bestowed upon the Physiology Department. The allocation of funds is still greatly valued and utilize d within the D epartment to continue Dr. Meek's passion of advancing medicine. 16 Mr. J. Hambleton Abrahams (1913 - 1996) Abrahams and his wife, Julie, live d in Topeka, where he was born and raised. Mrs. Abrahams wa s a KU Endowment Association trustee. He attended Chattuck Military Academy, Northwestern University and graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor's degree in philosophy. In 1978 he received an honorary doctor's degree in Business from Washburn University. He served during World War II in the U.S. Navy and later in the Naval Reserve as an officer. Abrahams was active throughout the community. Serving as an officer or member on the board of banks, hospitals , the chamber of commerce, the Red Cross, and many other organizations. Secu rity Benefit is the parent company of the Security Benefit Group of Companies, a financial services organization that maintains more than $13 billion of life insurance in force and has $2 billion in assets under management. After joining the company in 193 5 he later held the positions of secretary treasurer, executive vice president, president, and chairman. Abrahams encompassed the leadership skills to grow Security Benefit from a small, midwestern company to one of the largest life insurance companies in the United States. The Security Benefit Group of Companies headquartered in Topeka, started an annual gift of $7,500 to the KU Endowment Association to fund the J Hambleton Abrahams Lectureship in Physiology at KUMC. The lecture series honors Abrahams's 50 years with Security Benefit. According to Gilbert S. Greenwald, Ph.D., chairman of the Physiology Department in KUMC: \"the funds will be used to bring annually to the center a person of national and international reputation in one of the physiology sub specialties: cardiovascular physiology, renal physiology, neurophysiology, endocrinology, biophysics or epithelial transport physiology.\" After 60 years of service for Security Benefit Abrahams retired in 1995. He stayed busy traveling between homes in Topeka, Colorado, and Arizona. Abrahams passed away at the age of 83 in 1996 one year after retirement. 17 Kathleen M.

Conversely, nearly 50% of the genome is composed of transposable elements. Transposable element sequences are derived from viral inf ections that were captured by the host genome. Integration of transposable events can have an important impact on the genome and on organismal physiology. In some cases, integration of transposable elements may cause DNA damage and mutagenesis, but it may also result in the introduction of sequences that can recruit transcription factors and result in the rewiring of transcriptional networks. Integration events can also occur within protein coding exons, generating proteins of altered function. Lastly, inte gration of transposable elements can result in the preservation of the viral open reading frames, resulting in the expression of full -length viral proteins. This is a particularly important point, because transposable element encoded proteins have the pote ntial to retain many of the multifunctional roles of their viral cousins. These include modulation of signal transduction pathways, attenuation of innate immune signals, and altering translation efficiencies. In most tissues, transposable elements are tran scriptionally silenced. Dysregulation of transposable element expression drives inflammatory states, and during pregnancy, inflammation is associated with adverse outcomes. Paradoxically, during pregnancy trophoblast cells are permissive for the expression of transposable elements. Trophoblast lineage differentiation is required for the survival and development of embryos during pregnancy. Defects in trophoblast development can lead to failed pregnancies and other pregnancy related disorders. My research fo cuses on understanding how proteins encoded by transposable elements function in trophoblast cells during normal and pathological conditions.

Research is focused on the Na, K -ATPase, a plasma membrane enzyme system that uses the energy from ATP to establish and maintain the high internal K+ and low internal Na+ concentrations characteristic of most animal cells. Specific research projects include: 1. Function, regulation and role of the testes -specific isoform of the Na,K -ATPase in sperm function. Several years ago, we discovered a novel molecular form of the Na,K -ATPase, an ion transporter that exchanges sodium for potassium across the cell plasma membrane. This isoform, named Na,K -ATPa se 4 is specifically expressed in the testis and is abundant in spermatozoa. Our research is currently directed to understand the role, mechanisms of action and regulation of the 4 polypeptide in sperm function. Our main findings show that the 4 isoform is expressed in male germ cells of the testis after meiosis and is localized to the mid -piece of the sperm flagellum. The 4 isoform has functional properties that are different from all other Na,K -ATPases. It is required for sperm motility and is essenti al for sperm fertility. Activity of 4 is up -regulated with sperm capacitation and it plays an important role in maintaining cell pH, membrane potential and motility of spermatozoa. Because of the importance of 4 in sperm physiology, it represents a possi ble marker for male fertility and an attractive target for male contraception. An important component of our research project is devoted to find specific inhibitors of the 4 isoform, with the idea of using them as male contraceptives. Overall, this projec t is important to understand sperm physiology, male fertility and contraception. 2.Role of the Na,K -ATPase in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We are investigating the role of the Na,K -ATPase in cyst generation and progression in the kidney in ADPKD. This is being performed in rodent models of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and in primary cultures of kidney epithelial cells from patients with ADPKD. Our main findings show that in ADPKD, the Na,K -ATPase exhibits an abno rmally increased sensitivity to ouabain, a hormone released by the adrenal glands. At physiological concentrations, ouabain induces proliferation of ADPKD cells. Simultaneously, ouabain favors fluid accumulation in the cysts. Both cell proliferation and fl uid secretion are important factors involved in formation and enlargement of the cysts in ADPKD. Therefore, our findings identified ouabain as a novel circulating factor that can positively contribute to progression of the disease. We are currently studyin g the intracellular pathways involved in ouabain effects and the mechanisms of action of ouabain in ADPKD cells, with the idea to use this information to pharmacologically interfere with the pro -cystogenic actions of ouabain. This work will be important in understanding the role of the hormone ouabain and its receptor, the Na,K -ATPase in ADPKD, the molecular basis of cystogenesis in the kidney, as well as approaches to treat the disease. 50 Dr. Blanco (continued) For both Projects, we are using a combinati on of molecular, biochemical, immunochemical and cell biology methods. We use different expression systems for the Na,K -ATPase in mammalian cells and in insect cells. Also, we have developed animal models, using transgenic and knock out mice.

Chennathukuzhi, Ph.D ., Associate Professor Uterine fibroids are the most common tumors of the female reproductive tract, clinically relevant in 20 -40% of reproductive aged women, occurring in up to 70% of white and 80% of black women by the age of 50 years. Uterine fibroids account for over 200,000 hysterectomies annually in the United States alone. Currently there is no approved drug for the long -term medical therapy of fibroids. One of our research interests is to understand the biology of an aberrantly expressed G protein -coupled receptor that contributes to the fibroids tumor growth. We utilize genetically modified animal models as well as primary human fibroids cells to study the etiology of uterine leiomyomas. Our goal is to develop small molecule and peptidomimetic drugs for the treatment of u terine fibroids. My laboratory also studies the biology of a sperm -specific sodium -proton exchanger that regulates intracellular pH and motility of the sperm. In addition, we are interested in novel cancer testis antigens and development of targeted cancer therapies .

Christenson, Ph.D. , Professor My research is focused on understanding the molecular processes of reproduction in order to enhance and inhibit fertility. My primary interest has been focused on understanding how post -transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms (i.e., microRNA - mediated, R NA editing) facilitate ovulation and luteinization of the ovarian follicle following the LH surge. More recently, my laboratory has focused on another aspect of post-transcriptional gene regulation, A -to-I RNA editing, this exciting work (NIH -RO1 funded) i s implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction within the oocyte, we are also simultaneously pursuing its role in ovarian somatic cell function. My laboratory is also funded by NASA to investigate the effects of microgravity on female fertility. Our work in mi RNA within the follicle also led to our studies looking at the role extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles) in this dynamic tissue and to develop a murine in vivo tissue specific extracellular vesicle tracking system. My laboratory has also partnered with Dr. Paige Geiger's laboratory to investigate the role of extracellular vesicles in meditating the protective effects of exercise in Alzheimer's patients (NIH - R21).

Geiger, Ph.D. , Professor My research focus is on the cellular mechanisms leading to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. My laboratory examines insulin signaling pathways and the regulation of glucose uptake and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle in response to obesity -inducing high fat diets as well as exercise training and heat treatment. In the past 12 years, my research has focused on the therapeutic role of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in obesity and type 2 diabetes. HSPs are a highly conserved famil y of proteins best identified for their role as molecular chaperones. They play a critical role in maintaining cellular function via regulation of protein folding and degradation, and changes in their expression profile and cellular location have been linked to numerous disease states. In 2009, only one other publication had demonstrated the ability of heat treatment and/or HSP induction to regulate glucose metabolism and mitigate the effects of a high fat diet. Findings from my lab expanded on this discove ry by demonstrating the ability of heat treatment to prevent high fat diet - induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (Gupte AA, Bomhoff GL, Swerdlow RH, Geiger PC. Diabetes 2009). Additional research from our laboratory demonstrated the ability of HSPs to increase insulin sensitivity in aging skeletal muscle and in skeletal muscles from high fat -fed rats,and demonstrated for the first time that HSP expression correlates with oxidative capacity in different white adipose tissue depots. Our latest researc h indicates that a deficiency in the HSP response could be a major factor in the development of metabolic disease with diet or aging. We examined the impact of an acute high fat diet on a rat model selectively bred for high and low aerobic capacity (High C apacity Runners and Low Capacity Runners, HCR and LCR, respectively, Rogers et al. Diabetes, 2016). HCR and LCR rats have decreased expression of heat shock proteins in skeletal muscle making them susceptible to insulin resistance with even a short metabol ic insult (3 day high fat diet). Our research to date has greatly contributed to an understanding of HSPs in metabolic disease with implications for future treatment of diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases.

Osborn Professor for Reproductive Sciences Our laboratory is studying the molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular differentiation and organ development of the reproductive system. We are interested in the transcriptional and cell -signaling processes involved in activating and regulating genes important for the development and function of the testis and their implications in sex determination. In particular, we are studying the processes that control testis - or gonad - specific expression of three genes that are critical for proper fetal developmen t and/or gonad function. These are: 1) doublesex and mab -3 related transcription factor 1, an evolutionarily conserved protein that is required for testis differentiation, 2) steroidogenic factor 1, a protein that is required for the formation of adrenal g lands and gonads, and 3) follicle stimulating hormone receptor, a protein expressed only in somatic cells of the gonads and is required for endocrine regulation of the testis and ovary. My laboratory employs a variety of experimental approaches that includ e cell culture, molecular biology, and transgenic and knockout mice. Through these studies, we hope to provide insight into the genetic events necessary for formation and function of the gonads, thus expanding our understanding of the biological requiremen ts for organ development and reproduction Editorial and Grant Reviews Ad Hoc Manuscript Reviewer, Toxicology Letters Ad H oc Reviewer , FASEB Teaching Activities ACED - Reproduction, Development, Sexuality - Disorder of Sex Development 1 - 1 Hour Session PHSL 842 - Human Physiology 1 - 4 Hour Session PHSL 84 2 - Human Physiology Honors/Awards Marion M.

Matthew Morris , Ph.D. , Assistant Professor Dr. Morris' research interests center around the regulatory mechanisms of energy homeostasis through modulation of tissue -specific and systemic energy metabolism, and how these mechanisms fail or are overwhelmed leading to weight gain and, ultimately, obesity. This starts by studying how the function of the primary energy producing cellular bodies, mitochondria, can impact tissue function and systemic he alth. Currently, the lab is investigating: 1) how liver mitochondrial function can, through peripheral neural pathways to the homeostatic control regions of the brain, influence sex differences in high fat diet -induced weight, 2) how systemic energy expend iture and sex differences interact to regulate diet -induced weight gain, changes in adiposity, and adaptation of energy metabolism, and finally, 3) whether transcriptional control of mitochondrial lipid metabolism in the ventromedial hypothalamus is necess ary for alterations in energy metabolism resulting in susceptibility to diet -induced weight gain.

Endometriosis is a chronic disease in which endometrial tissue grows ectopically, is characterized by pelvic pain and infertility and affects over 70 million women world -wide. One of the reasons for its high prevalence is that the disease is usually diagnosed only after it has established. An additional clinical shortcoming is that the majority of treatments for the disease rely on the induction of a hypo -estrogenic state which is ass ociated with unwanted side effects and negative impacts on bone health. Clearly, both better diagnostic tools and treatment options are warranted.

I am also involved in research into determining the short - and long -term neurological effects of hyperbilirubinemia in rodent models of neonatal jaundice. Finally, I remain interested in the effects of metabolic challenges on neural function to understand the co -morbidity between obesity and neurodegenerative diseases.

Thyfault, Ph.D., FACSM , Professor Chronic physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and low aerobic fitness are linked to the development of chronic disease conditions including obesity, insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In contrast, daily physical activity and maintenance of aerobic fitness throughout the lifespan are associated with protection against chronic disease(s). The mechanism(s) underlying the development of these diseases and the role th at activity and fitness status play in altering susceptibility remain largely unknown and are the focus of our research. We utilize integrative (multi - tissue and whole body), translational (cells, rodents, humans) approaches to perform studies in these are as with a focus on clinical or human relevance. The specific projects ongoing right now are focused on four primary areas: 1. Links between fatty liver, hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction, and low aerobic fitness and the role that hepatic PGC -1a may be playing in this process 2. Role of hepatic mitochondrial function to impact systemic metabolism and regulation of energy intake and physical activity 3. Role of physical activity and inactivity to modulate insulin action and glycemic control 4. Impact of statins to negatively impact the ability of exercise training to improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and aerobic fitness Meetings Attended October 2019 - Seminar Series, Harold Hamm Diabetes Center February 2020 - Seminar Series , Nutrition and Exercise P hysiology March 2020 - New Insights in Biology of Exercise Keystone Symposium Committee Activities KUMC Facility Director - Metabolic and Obesity Research Phenotyping (MORPH) Facility National Member - NIH Nutrition and Obesity Research Center at th e University of Colorado - Anschutz Medical Campus National, External Advisory Committee Chair - Pennington Biomedical Research Center - Obesity COBRE National, External Advisory Committee Editorial and Grant Reviews Consulting Editor - Insight - Journal of Clinical Investigation External Reviewer - Grant Proposal - Study Section - Integrative Physiology of Obesity and Diabetes (IPOD), NIH External Reviewer - Grant Proposal - Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Grant 75 Dr. Thyfault (continued) External Reviewer - Grant Proposal - Health Research Board External Reviewer - Grant Proposal - Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw) Editorial Board, American Journal of Physiology Editor, Journal of Applied Physiology Reviewer, NIH Study Section Reviewer, Aging Cell Reviewer, AJP - Cell, - Comp, Reg, Int.

In mice, SSCs, making up only ~0.03% of all germ cells, produce ~40 million sperm per gram of tissue per day by way of mitosis and meiosis. Proper maintenance of this small pool of SSCs is essential to sustain lifelong product ion of sperm. We have established a transgenic mouse line, in which the Stra8 promoter, whose activation is probably one of the earliest events during GSC differentiation of both sexes, drives GFP reporter expression (Stra8 -GFP). We recently reported that, by using cell surface markers for undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia in Stra8 -GFP mice, we are able to separate spermatogonia into six populations at consecutive differentiation stages (Figure 1; Xiong et al, Cell Cycle, 2015). Thus, we ar e using this unique system to: 1) Characterize novel phenotypical markers of the primitive spermatogonial stem cells; 2) Investigate the mechanisms governing stem cell maintenance and differentiation. In addition to SSCs, we are currently investigating how spermatogonial cells commit meiosis. Meiotic initiation is a key feature of sexual reproduction that launches an intricate chromosomal program involving DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), homolog pairing, cohesion, synapsis, and recombination. Vertebrate ge ne Stra8 is an essential gatekeeper of meiotic initiation. However, the molecular role of STRA8 and its target genes remain elusive. Using mouse spermatogenesis as a model, we recently reported that STRA8 suppresses autophagy by repressing the transcriptio n of a nuclear hormone receptor gene Nr1d1, and in turn, silencing the expression of Ulk1, a gene essential for autophagy initiation (Figure 2; Ferder et al, PLoS Genetics, 2018). Given that autophagy is critical for protein and cellular organelle recyclin g and for preventing genomic instability, our study suggests that this newly demonstrated function of STRA8, as a suppressor of autophagy, may be an important mechanistic feature of its role in meiotic initiation. Currently, we are using a combination of m olecular, cellular, and genetic approaches to investigate autophagic regulation of meiotic initiation during germline development.
