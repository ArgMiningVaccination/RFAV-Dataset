Heat or cold @(Model.HeadingTag)> Heat, such as warm baths, warm water bottles and heating pads, may be used to treat aches or persistent muscle pain. Heat can help reduce stiffness in joints, relax muscles, ease muscle spasms and increase blood supply to the area. Heat should not be used on areas of skin that have received radiation therapy. Cold, such as running cold water over or applying ice to an area, can be used to treat muscle spasms or headaches. Hypnosis @(Model.HeadingTag)> Hypnosis is a state of relaxed and focused attention in which you concentrate on a certain feeling, idea or suggestion. Hypnosis can be used to block the awareness of pain or to substitute another feeling for pain. Massage @(Model.HeadingTag)> Massage is a form of touch therapy.

Tai chi @(Model.HeadingTag)> Tai chi is an ancient Chinese martial art that combines slow, focused body movements, mediation and deep breathing. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) @(Model.HeadingTag)> Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive treatment that may reduce pain. TENS is believed to interrupt the pain signals sent to the brain. It may also work by promoting the release of endorphins, which are the body's natural painkillers. TENS may help treat headaches, muscle aches or pains or nerve pain. During TENS, wires and electrodes attached to a small battery-powered device are placed on the skin, usually on either side of the area where you feel pain. The electrodes carry electrical impulses to the nerves. Yoga @(Model.HeadingTag)> Yoga involves stretches and poses with special focus given to breathing. It can be used to calm the nervous system and balance the body, mind and spirit. Expert review and references - American Cancer Society. Cancer Pain. 2015. - American Society of Clinical Oncology.
