It is meant to restore drained reserves of life force (ojas) and to preserve strength, stamina, and vitality, while stalling the course of aging. Chyawanprash is formulated by processing around 50 medicinal herbs and their extracts, including the prime ingredient, Amla (Indian gooseberry), which is the world's richest source of vitamin C. Chyawanprash preparation involves preparing a decoction of herbs, followed by dried extract preparation, subsequent mixture with honey, and addition of aromatic herb powders (namely clove, cardamom, and cinnamon) as standard. The finished product has a fruit jam-like consistency, and a sweet, sour, and spicy flavor. Scientific exploration of CP is warranted to understand its therapeutic efficacy. Scattered information exploring the therapeutic potential of CP is available, and there is a need to assemble it. Thus, an effort was made to compile the scattered information from ancient Ayurvedic texts and treatises, along with ethnobotanical, ethnopharmacological, and scientifically validated literature, that highlight the role of CP in therapeutics. Citations relevant to the topic were screened.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-04-26", "cleaned_text": "on Human 1. Introduction [1](#B1-biomolecules-09-00161)]. [2](#B2-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Chyawanprash that contains Amla has a mixed taste, combining sweet, sour, bitter, pungent, and astringent qualities [ [3](#B3-biomolecules-09-00161)]. On regular intake, it maintains physiological functions and rejuvenates the whole body system [ [4](#B4-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 2. Origin [5](#B5-biomolecules-09-00161), [6](#B6-biomolecules-09-00161), [7](#B7-biomolecules-09-00161), [8](#B8-biomolecules-09-00161)]. The foremost historically recorded recipe for CP is reported in the Charaka Samhita, the ancient Ayurvedic classic, where it is appreciated as being superior to all other herbal rejuvenative tonics [ [9](#B9-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 3. Composition [10](#B10-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Typically, CP includes four classes of herbal drugs: The Dashmula class (ten roots); the Chaturjata class (four aromatic plants); Ashtavarga (threatened medicinal herbs from the Northwest Himalayas, which are not commercially available in the modern era) [ [11](#B11-biomolecules-09-00161)]; and a general class (materials not belonging to the former classes). The Chyawanprash formula is described in the ancient Ayurvedic texts, namely, Ashtanga Hridayam, Charaka Samhita, Sangandhara Samhita, which are dedicated to clinical management. The dominant ingredient is Amla, a citrus fruit that is a highly renowned and potent botanical in Ayurveda. The main ingredients of CP, along with their botanical identities, key active biomolecules and specific therapeutic roles, are ancient manufacturing guidelines and deviation from the original recipe is a common malpractice in the pharma sector. The original formula is wiped out in between the practices of preparation and immoral marketing tactics to make it more presentable and appealing than the competitors' product. It will no longer be called CP if there is any change in the ingredients of the traditional formula [ [58](#B58-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 4. The \"Missing\" 8 Ingredients of Chyawanprash [59](#B59-biomolecules-09-00161)]. These Ashtavarga herbs which are close to extinction are stipulated in [Table 2](#biomolecules-09-00161-t002). 5. Manufacturing Process of Chyawanprash [60](#B60-biomolecules-09-00161)]. The weight of 500 fresh Amla varies from 2.5-25.25 kg, as cultivated hybrid Amla has a bigger size than wild collected Amla. The Ayurvedic Formulary of India (AFI) considers the use of 2.5 kg of fresh Amla for 500 numbers and 2.4 kg sugar for its preparation [ [10](#B10-biomolecules-09-00161)]. If cultivated hybrid Amla is available, 500 such fruits would weigh approximately 6.5 kg. [Figure 2](#biomolecules-09-00161-f002). [1](#B1-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 6. Mode of Administration [2](#B2-biomolecules-09-00161), [61](#B61-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Chyawanprash should be taken in a quantity such that it does not interfere with hunger and appetite for food [ [62](#B62-biomolecules-09-00161), [63](#B63-biomolecules-09-00161), [64](#B64-biomolecules-09-00161), [65](#B65-biomolecules-09-00161), [66](#B66-biomolecules-09-00161)]. The general dosage of CP (12-28 g) is to be taken with milk (100-250 ml) on an empty stomach in the morning [ [66](#B66-biomolecules-09-00161), [67](#B67-biomolecules-09-00161)]. [67](#B67-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In such cases, the formulation can be administered with lukewarm water. It is recommended to consume CP within a year from the manufacturing date, as a study has indicated that chemical deterioration may occur during the storage period, resulting in loss of the therapeutic potency of CP [ [68](#B68-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 7. Phytochemical and Quality Specifications of Chyawanprash [69](#B69-biomolecules-09-00161), [70](#B70-biomolecules-09-00161)]. The taste is predominantly governed by the flavors of honey, cow ghee (clarified butter), and Triphala (a mixture of three myrobalans), and the aroma by cow ghee and certain spices viz. sandalwood, cinnamon, and cardamom. Limited studies are available on quality testing of CP. A major part in the composition of CP is Amla, which is rich in vitamin C and polyphenolics, including flavonoids. The phenolic compounds of CP possess antioxidant principles that are said to contribute to the rejuvenating and tonic attributes of CP. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis has identified several biologically active in i.e., gallic acid, rutin, ferulic acid, and quercitrin, which may account for its therapeutic activity [ [71](#B71-biomolecules-09-00161)]. By contrast, individual pharmaceutical companies have their own in-house specifications for the quality of CP, which are not in the public domain. The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) has published a monograph on CP along with a brief method of preparation and various physicochemical and assay tests as official quality standards. These include description, identification (such as microscopy, thin layer chromatography (TLC), physicochemical parameters water-soluble extractive, pH)), test aflatoxin. The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India mentions that CP should contain no less than 0.5% of gallic acid when assayed, based on the officially stated method [ [70](#B70-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 8. The 'Vitamin C' Controversy [72](#B72-biomolecules-09-00161), [73](#B73-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Owing to the lack of uniform quality control standards of Ayurvedic drugs, it becomes challenging to ensure the uniformity of their composition and so the efficacy of final products [ [74](#B74-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Although the official quality testing methods for CP [ [75](#B75-biomolecules-09-00161)] do not contain vitamin C content, there are contrasting findings apropos of its presence in CP [ [76](#B76-biomolecules-09-00161), [77](#B77-biomolecules-09-00161)], possibly due to the application of less sensitive and nonspecific methods of investigation. A study in 1997 found that vitamin C was missing in the tested CP samples, and it might have been destroyed during cooking of the Amla pulp with cow ghee in the pharmaceutical process [ [78](#B78-biomolecules-09-00161)]. It has been reported that upon heat exposure during preparation of CP, the vitamin C contents remain unaffected [ [68](#B68-biomolecules-09-00161), [79](#B79-biomolecules-09-00161)], with a study reporting 34 mg/100 g vitamin C in CP [ [80](#B80-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Another study found that the percentage of vitamin C in the old samples of CP (0.0253 \u00b1 0.0001%) was much lower than that of the new samples (0.0512 \u00b1 0.0003%), thus signifying the chances of degradation on storage [ [68](#B68-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 9. Chyawanprash: A Nutraceutical and Functional Food [81](#B81-biomolecules-09-00161), [82](#B82-biomolecules-09-00161), [83](#B83-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 10. Health Benefits 10.1. Ancient Claims and Contemporary Scientific Evidence [3](#B3-biomolecules-09-00161), [84](#B84-biomolecules-09-00161)]. [85](#B85-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Chyawanprash has passed the scrutiny of several scientific studies. Contemporary studies corroborate and validate the ancient claims and traditional beliefs regarding its therapeutic use. The herbal and spicy ingredients of CP help to convalesce the circulatory system, thus channelizing the removal of the toxins from distant tissues and visceral organs. It builds a congruent synergy amid physiological functions steering toward an improved metabolism. All herbal and natural products in the composition of CP have been well investigated and explored by the scientific community for their therapeutic vistas. It is very challenging to uncover the active phytochemicals, the rationality behind its therapeutic usage, and the underlying mechanistic role of herbal medicine by adopting contemporary scientific tools and methods. However, this does not imply that all the doctrines or beliefs in traditional medical systems which are not justifiable by scientific substantiation are irrational and non-existent. It is aptly cited in Charaka Samhita, \"What is perceptible to humans is merely a petite fraction of this cosmos and what we cannot observe is far more than that, which doesn't make that non-existent\". Chyawanprash is beneficial for health in several ways. It is an excellent ergogenic (enhancing physical performance), tonic, rejuvenator, anabolic, immunomodulator and promotes strength to the gastrointestinal tract, digestive organs, cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrospinal systems, neuronal circuits, and renal and reproductive tissues [ [86](#B86-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 10.2. Improves Digestion and Metabolism [1](#B1-biomolecules-09-00161), [64](#B64-biomolecules-09-00161)]. It protects and strengthens the liver and kidneys and improves lipid and protein metabolism [ [87](#B87-biomolecules-09-00161), [88](#B88-biomolecules-09-00161), [89](#B89-biomolecules-09-00161), [90](#B90-biomolecules-09-00161), [91](#B91-biomolecules-09-00161)]. metabolism [ [92](#B92-biomolecules-09-00161), [93](#B93-biomolecules-09-00161)]. [94](#B94-biomolecules-09-00161), [95](#B95-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 10.3. Protect nourish the respiratory system [ [92](#B92-biomolecules-09-00161), [93](#B93-biomolecules-09-00161), [99](#B99-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 90 pulmonary tuberculosis patients were treated with CP 10 g, twice daily as an adjunct to antitubercular drugs. CP augmented the bioactivity of antitubercular drugs and prevented their side effects. Cough, expectoration, weakness, loss of appetite, loss of weight, fever, edema aches, and hemoptysis disappeared almost completely in the treated group, along with improvement in the hemoglobin (Hb) levels and effective healing as evidenced through chest X-ray post-therapy [ [96](#B96-biomolecules-09-00161), [100](#B100-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Another observational study on 99 newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients revealed that concomitant adjunct use of CP with antitubercular drugs significantly abated the symptoms and improved bioavailability of isoniazid and pyrazinamide The characteristics CP are attributable to its excellent antiaging and anxiolytic supplement. The revitalizing and tonic effects of CP could be due to its rich antioxidant composition, bioactive phytoconstituents, such [103](#B103-biomolecules-09-00161), [104](#B104-biomolecules-09-00161), [105](#B105-biomolecules-09-00161)], though supportive experimental and clinical evidence is scarce. Recent investigations have ascertained that polyphenols (gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin) in CP exert key antioxidant potential and is known to possess potent neuroprotective, cytoprotective, and antioxidant properties [ [106](#B106-biomolecules-09-00161), [107](#B107-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Chyawanprash is an effective adaptogenic [ [108](#B108-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Some clinical reports do support the adaptogenic and antioxidant effect of CP on normal and depressive subjects [ [109](#B109-biomolecules-09-00161)]. [110](#B110-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Another study found potent DPPH radical scavenging ability and antioxidant effects of ethanolic extracts of CP [ [107](#B107-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Chyawanprash strengthens immunity and facilitates the healing process [ [111](#B111-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Due to the rich Amla percentage, CP is loaded in high vitamin C, polyphenolics, including flavonoids, and exhibits evident antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity, enhances the immune system, and fights infections [ [112](#B112-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Vitamin C also helps to revive and restore the energy loss of the human body [ [113](#B113-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Vitamin C conjugates to gallic acid molecules and reducing sugars and facilitates the development of intricate synergistic effects with other phytoconstituents [ [114](#B114-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Polyphenols are acknowledged to be more effective antioxidants in vitro than vitamin E and C on a molar basis. Polyphenolic compounds in several herbs and natural honey in CP are found beneficial in various human degenerative diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes [ [83](#B83-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Several natural antioxidants, especially flavonoids, exert studies also support the immune-booster role of CP as demonstrated by reduced disease symptoms of seasonal influences, modulated IgE and immunity markers C3 and C4 levels, improved pulmonary functions, decreased cortisol levels, and increased quality of life (QoL) [ [118](#B118-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 10.5. Nootropic Potential [119](#B119-biomolecules-09-00161), [120](#B120-biomolecules-09-00161), [121](#B121-biomolecules-09-00161)]. The rich Amla and ascorbic acid contents play a vital role in such activities CNS functions [ [92](#B92-biomolecules-09-00161), [93](#B93-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 60 participants (normal volunteers and patients suffering from depression), CP achieved a significantly effective reduction in the Hamilton-D (HAM-D) scores compared to placebo in both normal subjects and patients of depression [ [69](#B69-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In an RCT on 128 college students, CP significantly improved cognitive functions, i.e., alertness, attention, and concentration [ [120](#B120-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 10.6. Cardiotonic in their ability to rejuvenate and restore the cardiovascular system functions [ [92](#B92-biomolecules-09-00161), as lipid deposition inhibitory properties [ [125](#B125-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In rat models, Punarnawa increased the reduced level of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalase (CAT) and decreased the elevated level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in cardiac tissue [ [126](#B126-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 10.7. Potent Aphrodisiac and Balances the Endocrine System [127](#B127-biomolecules-09-00161), [128](#B128-biomolecules-09-00161), [129](#B129-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Ingredients vitalizing properties of CP [ [92](#B92-biomolecules-09-00161), [93](#B93-biomolecules-09-00161)]. A recent systematic review on Ashwagandha demonstrated statistical (p 0.002 versus baseline) increase in sperm concentration (167%), semen after 90 days of Withania somnifera treatment [ [130](#B130-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In rat models, Gokshur and Shatavari also showed significant improvement in sexual behavior, androgen levels, increased amount and intromission frequency, improved penile erection, testosterone level, Antimutagenic and efficacy of CP (Dabur company) on the somatic chromosomes of 25 bidi smokers (bidi: A traditional handmade conical smoking stick, prepared by filling tobacco in Diospyros melanaxylon leaves). A total of 20 g of CP was administered for two months, twice a day, and parameters such as the mitotic index (MI), chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), and satellite associations (SA) were studied and found to have significantly decreased (p < 0.01) in CP-fed smokers compared to normal smokers. A significant decline in the frequency of CA is indicative of the genoprotective role of CP against mutagenic agents present in tobacco smoke [ [109](#B109-biomolecules-09-00161)]. [133](#B133-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Due to its rich Amla contents, CP also exhibits cytoprotective (effective against metal clastogens), anticarcinogenic, and antimutagenic activities and stabilizes the side-effects [134](#B134-biomolecules-09-00161), [135](#B135-biomolecules-09-00161), [136](#B136-biomolecules-09-00161), [137](#B137-biomolecules-09-00161), [138](#B138-biomolecules-09-00161), cocktail of herbal metabolites of CP and the multiple points of intervention offer higher efficacy during chemoprevention regimens [ [140](#B140-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In an RCT on 75 patients of head and neck cancer, CP (10 g, twice daily) along with radiotherapy reduced the severity of mucosal reactions and improved the Hb levels [ [69](#B69-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 10.9. Favorable Effects on Lipid Profile and Glycaemic Levels [80](#B80-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Chyawanprash is also an efficient hypolipidemic [ [141](#B141-biomolecules-09-00161)]. A study conducted on CP for evaluation of health promotion in elderly people reported a decrease in cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and increase in HDL (high-density lipoprotein) levels which corroborates its indications in geriatrics as cited in Phalashruti (beneficial effects) of this formulation [ [142](#B142-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In a randomized open label clinical study (n = 121; age group: 18-70) on type 2 diabetics, no statistically significant change in HbA1c and blood sugar levels was found. This signifies the safety of CP in type 2 diabetic patients controlled by oral hypoglycemic agents. Additionally, a statistically significant convalescence was also found in energy levels of diabetics [ [143](#B143-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 10.10. Other Preventive, Promotive and Curative Health Benefits [144](#B144-biomolecules-09-00161), [145](#B145-biomolecules-09-00161), [146](#B146-biomolecules-09-00161)]. It eliminates blood impurities and acts as a natural detox [ [147](#B147-biomolecules-09-00161)]. It promotes hair growth, skin complexion, cures dermal infections, and improvises personality characteristics by imparting splendor, exquisiteness, youthfulness, wisdom, vitality, and glow [ [92](#B92-biomolecules-09-00161), [93](#B93-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In hairless mice model, CP has shown a protective effect on photoaging of skin. In HeLa cells, CP suppressed epidermal thickening, improved the proliferation of human keratinocytes, and effectively removed ROS (reactive oxygen species), which are liable for skin photoaging [ [148](#B148-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In a study, CP showed promising potential for use as an antimicrobial agent. CHCl3 as well as hydrolyzed concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity [ Chyawanprash has also shown protective effects in steroid-induced opacities in the eye lens of a chick embryo [ [150](#B150-biomolecules-09-00161)]. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study on 177 subjects, CP improved Hb levels consistently, irrespective of the season of its consumption, along with improvement in pulmonary function tests and immunological parameters [ [69](#B69-biomolecules-09-00161)]. 11. Toxicity and Safety Concerns [151](#B151-biomolecules-09-00161)]. Chyawanprash is rich in Amla contents; therefore, it is better to avoid it at bedtime. Usually, this information is missing from CP packaging. 12. Necessity for Standards of Chyawanprash 13. Market Trends [152](#B152-biomolecules-09-00161)]. [153](#B153-biomolecules-09-00161)]. There are many CP brands in the Indian market, such as Dabur, Emami Group, Himalaya, Bajaj, and Baidyanath; however, the leading brand is Dabur, with a market share of 70%. Comparative test performance scores of various leading market brands of CP are detailed in [Table 3](#biomolecules-09-00161-t003)[ [154](#B154-biomolecules-09-00161)]. [155](#B155-biomolecules-09-00161), and exciting variants of CP, organizations have backed their marketing campaigns with well-known stars. To entice the younger generation, Indian movie stars and sportsman such in CP advertisements and other promotional activities [ [153](#B153-biomolecules-09-00161)]. The cost of production of CP, if it is produced in bulk, will be around 70-80 per kg. However, there are no stringent regulations on companies for pricing, as price control systems are not applicable to Ayurveda products. 14.
