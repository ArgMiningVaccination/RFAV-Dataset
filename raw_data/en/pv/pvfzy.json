Introduction This evidence review examines the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost effectiveness of canakinumab compared to current standard treatment in patients with systemic -onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab1. Canakinumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits the binding of interleukin-1 ( IL-1) beta to its receptor. Canakinumab is given as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. If patients do not respond to 1st, 2nd or 3rd line therapy, canak inumab is being proposed as a 4th line option. First line treatment for SJIA consists of corticosteroids. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as methotrexate, can be added for patients who fail to achieve r emission, or for those who are dependent on steroids for symptomatic control. Intravenous tocilizumab should be started for all patients with SJIA. If there are ongoing systemic symptoms, tocilizumab should be switched to anakinra if not already used to tr eat macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Canakinumab is licensed for the treatment of SJIA and adult-onset Still's disease in patients aged two years and older who have responded inadequately to previous therapy NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids (European Medicines Agency, 2009, updated in 2019). 1 PICO amended following clarification with NHS England CET by email correspondence 7 December 2020. Intervention was changed from 4th line canakinumab following anakinra or tocilizumab to 4th line canakinumab following tocilizumab then anakinra if no response. Hence population was changed from SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizum ab to SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab. 4 | NHS England Evidence Review: 2. Executive summary of the review Three papers were included in the evidence review (Barut et al 2019, Horneff et al 2017 and Nishimura et al 202 0). Two studies were prospective case series (Horneff et al 2017 and Nishimura et al 202 0) and one study was a retrospective case series (Barut et al 2019). No studies directly compared canakinumab to a control group (either placebo or active comparator). Horneff et al 2017 was a prospective case series which included 245 patients from a national registry of systemic -onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA ) patients treated with biologics , all of whom had previously received steroids and the majority methotrexate. For those patients on interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra or canakinumab) , the m ean age of disease onset was 4.5 years (standard deviation ( SD) 3.2) and the mean age of initiation of biologics was 9.6 years (SD 4.6). The paper reported results for a subgroup of seven patients who were treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab. Results for these seven patients were extracted for inclusion in the evidence review. Nishimura et al 2020 was a prospective case series ( number of centres not reported) which included 19 patients with SJIA treated with canakinumab (median age 9 years (range 1 to 19), all of whom were receiving concomitant oral corticosteroids and 47% on methotrexate (previous use of methotrexate not reported) . The paper reported results separately for 15 patients who had been previously treated with tocilizumab. Results for these 15 patients were extracted for inclusion in the evidence review. Barut et al 2019 was a single centre retrospective case series , which included 168 patients with SJIA , all of whom were treated with steroids and 75% with methotrexate. The median age of patients at time of study was 16 years ( interquartile range (IQR) 9) and the median age at time of diagnosis was 5.8 years (IQR 7.2) . The paper reported results for a subgroup of 27 patients treated with canakinumab, following tocilizumab in up to 18 cases and anakinra in up to 27 cases . Results for these 27 patients were extracted for inclusion in the evidence review. Research Question 1: 1. In patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the clinical effectiveness of canakinumab compared with current standard treatment? 5 | NHS England Evidence Review: Critical outcomes The critical outcomes for decision making are quality of life, reduction and resolution of symptoms (as measured by the juvenile arthritis disease activity score (JADAS) or similar ), and reduction in corticosteroid use. The certainty of the evidence for all critical outcomes was very low when assessed using modified GRADE . Quality of life No evidence was identified for this outcome. Reduction and resolution of symptoms (as measured by the juvenile arthritis disease activity score (JADA S) or similar ) Three case series (Barut et al 2019, Horneff et al 2017 and Nishimura et al 2020) provided non-comparative evidence relating to resolution and reduction of symptoms as measured by the JADAS -10 score2, American College 30/50/70 criteria4 or study's own criteria i n a subgroup of SJIA patients treated with canakinumab and following tocilizumab in all or the majority of cases . One prospective case series (Horneff et al 2017) (n=7) provided non-comparative evidence that in SJIA patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab, 55% of patients achieved remission when defined as JADAS-10 score of 1 and 43% of patients achieved remission when defined by American Coll ege of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, at last documented follow -up response (estimated graphically ; median/mean timepoint not reported). One prospective case series ( Nishimura et al 2020) (n=15) provided non- comparative evidence that at 8 weeks , ACR paediatric 30, 50 and 70 criteria was achieved in all SJIA patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab. One single centre retrospective case series (Barut et al 2019) of 27 SJIA patients treated with canakinumab 2 JADAS10 is a composite disease activity score (0 -40) for JIA including four measures: active joint count (up to 10 joints), physician's global assessment of disease activity, parent/patient evaluatio n of the child's overall rate ACR preliminary criteria for remission/inactive disease includes: (i) the lowest value of the physician's judgement on global disease activity of 0 on a 100- mm visual analogue scale; (ii) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) up to 20 mm/h; (iii) C reactive protein (CRP) up to 6 mg/l; (iv) morning stiffness lasting up to 15 min and (v) the absence of systemic manifestations (fever, rash, pericarditis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or lymph node swelling) . 4 Adapted ACR paediatric 30/50/70 criteria was defined as improvements of 30%/50%/70% from baseline in 3 of the six variables in JIA core set and no intermittent fever (body temperature 38\u00b0C) in the preceding week , with no more than one of the six variables worsening by >30%. The six JIA components were the number of joints with active arthritis, the number of joints with a limited range of motion, physician's global assessment (PGA), and patients'/parents' global assessment (PPGA) of disease activity on a 100mm visual analog scale (VAS), standardized CRP level (normal range: 0-10 mg/L), and functional ability (using the Disability Index of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, on a scale of 0- 3). 6 | NHS England Evidence Review: following anakinra or tocili zumab5 provided non-comparative evidence that remission6 off medication (no usage of any anti -rheumatic drugs during the last 12 months) was achieved in three (11.5%) patients and minimal disease activity (not defined) on medication was achieved in 23 (85%) patients, all with follow -up of a minimum of 12 months (timepoint not reported). Reduction in corticosteroid use One prospective case series (Nishimura et al 2020) (n=15) provided non-comparative evidence that at 28 weeks , successful oral corticosteroid tapering7 was achieved i n 11 (73.3%) SJIA patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab, of which 10 (66.7%) were tapered and one (6.7%) was corticosteroid-free, Important outcomes The important outcomes for decision making are control of biochemical markers of inflammation (C -reactive protein (CRP ), A (SAA) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR )) and changes in systemic features of disease (fever, rash, weight change and hepatosplenomegaly). The certainty of the evidence for all important outcomes with evidence identified was very low when assessed using modified GRADE. Control of biochemical markers of inflammation (CRP; SAA and ESR) No evidence was identified for this outcome. Changes in systemic features of disease (fever, rash, weight change and hepatosplenomegaly) One prospective case series (Horneff et al 2017) (n=7) provided non-comparative evidence that 85% of SJIA patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab had no fever at 5 No treatment history was provided for canakinumab treated patients. An assumption was made that these patients were treated with 4th line canakinumab following anakinra or tocilizumab based on the treatment history provided for all patients in the case series and the authors' discussion of routine treatment practice in their centre. 6 Remission was defined as lack of fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and arthritis, as well as normal levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) Dose reduced from >0.8 mg/kg/day to 0.5 mg/kg/day, or f rom 0.5 mg/kg/day and 0.8 mg/kg/day by 0.3 mg/kg/day, or from any initial dose to 0.2 mg/kg/day, or any reduction from an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day, while maintaining ACR paediatric 30 response. 7 | NHS England Evidence Review: last d ocumented follow -up response (estimated graphically ; median/mean timepoint not reported). Research Question 2 2. In patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the safety of canakinumab compared with current standard tr eatment? The safety outcomes were adverse effects (AEs ), most important ly respiratory infections, upper abdominal pain and treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects . The certainty of the evidence for adverse effects was very low when assessed using modified GRADE. Adverse effects Three case series (Barut et al 2019, Horneff et al 2017 and Nishimura et al 2020) provided non-comparative evidence relating to adverse effects in a subgroup of patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab in all or the majority of cases . One prospective case series (Nishimura et al 2020) (n=15) reported that \"all patients experienced 1 AE during the study\" . One prospective case series (Horneff et al 2017) (n=7) reported that \"1 patient on canakinumab treatment who had macrophage activation syndrome discontinued due to intolerance\". One single centre retrospective case series (Barut et al 2019) (n=27) reported that \"one patient treated with canakinumab had pneumonia\" . Research Question 3 3. In patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the cost-effectiveness of canakinumab? No evidence was identified on the cost effectiveness of canakinumab compared with current standard treatment. Research Question 4 4. From the evidence selected are there any data to suggest that there are particular sub- groups of patients that would benefit from treatment with canakinumab more than others? 8 | NHS England Evide nce Review: No evidence was identified regarding any subgroups of patients that would benefi t more from treatment with canakinumab. Limitations The key limitation to identifying the effectiveness of canakinumab compared to standard treatment is the lack of comparative studies , with relevant results only found from 49 in scope patients within three case series (two prospective and one retros pective) . Baseline characteristics and treatment history for these patients were not reported separately so it was not always possible to determine with certainty whether canakinumab was given as fourth line treatment following tocilizumab. However, this appeared likely in the majority of cases. Furthermore, it was not possible to determine f ollow -up timepoints in two of the case series ( Barut et al 2019 and Horneff et al 2017) and one study did not use a validated disease activity measure (Barut et al 2019) for assessing remission. Many results were only reported graphically and no statistical comparisons were made with baselines , so it was not possible to determine whether the results represent statistically significant changes. Conclusion Very low certainty, non-comparative evidence identified for inclusion in this review is insufficient to draw conclusions about the clinical effectiveness and safety of fourth li ne canakinumab following current standard treatment (corticosteroids, DMARDs, and tocilizumab then anakinra) compared to standard treatment alone in patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab. The evidence is limited to 49 patients extracted from three case series and suggests that , compared to baseline, canakinumab improves disease severity, reduces concomitant corticosteroid dosage and reduces fever with few adverse effects. No results were reported for quality of life and biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, SAA and ESR). No evidence on the cost effectiveness of canakinumab compared to current standard treatments was identified. No evidence was identified for particular sub- groups of patients that would benefit more from treatm ent with canakinumab. 9 | NHS England Evidence Review: 3. Methodology Review questions The review question(s) for this evidence review are: 1. In patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the clinical effectiveness of canakinumab compared with current s tandard treatment? 2. In patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the safety of canakinumab compared with current standard treatment? 3. In patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the cost-effectiveness of canakinumab? 4. From the evidence selected are there any data to suggest that there are particular sub-groups of patients that would benefit from treatment with canakinumab more than others? See Appendix A for the full review protocol. Review process The methodology to undertake this review is specified by NHS England in their 'Guidance on conducting evidence reviews for Specialised Services Commissioning Products' (2019). The searches for evidence were informed by the PICO document and were conducted on 23rd October 2020. See Appendix B for details of the search strategy. Results from the literature searches were screened using their titles and abstracts for relevance against the criteria in the PICO framework. Full text references of potentially relevant evidence were obtained and reviewed to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria for this evidence review. See Appendix C for evidence selection details and Appendix D for the list of studies excluded from the review and the reasons for their exclusion. 10 | NHS England Evidence Review: Relevant details and outcomes were extracted from the included studies and were critically appraised using a checklist appropriate to the study design. See Appendices E and F for individual study and checklist details. The available evidence was assessed by outcome for certainty using modified GRADE. See Appendix G for GRADE Profiles. 11 | NHS England Evidence Review: 4.

Results In patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the clinical effectiveness and safety of canakinumab compared with current standard treatment? Outcome Evidence statement Clinical Effectiveness Critical outcomes Quality of life Certainty of evidence: Not applicable Quality of life is important to patients because of the impact on the patient's function, activities of daily living and self -perceived well-being. Improvement in quality of life is a marker of successful treatment. No evidence was identified for this out come. Reduction and resolution of symptoms (as measured by the juvenile arthritis disease activity score (JADAS) or similar ) Improvement in symptoms is important to patients because this could help determine treatment choice (such as reduction of corticosteroids) and impact on the patient's function and activities of daily living. Resolution of symptoms also indicates clinical r emission. Three case series (Barut et al 2019, Horneff et al 2017 and Nishimura et al 2020) provided non-comparative evidence relating to resolution and reduction of symptoms as measured by the JADAS-10 score14, American is a composite disease activity score (0- 40) for JIA including four measures: active joint count (up to 10 joints), physician's global assessment of disease activity, parent/patient evaluation of the child's overall well -being and erythrocyte rate ACR preliminary criteria for remission/inactive disease includes: (i) the lowest value of the ph ysician's judgement on global disease activity of 0 on a 100- mm visual analogue scale; (ii) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) up to 20 mm/h; (iii) C reactive protein (CRP) up to 6 mg/l; (iv) morning stiffness lasting up to 15 min and (v) the absence of systemic manifestations (fever, rash, pericarditis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or lymph node swelling) . 16 Adapted ACR paediatric 30/50/70 criteria was defined as improvements of 30%/50%/70% from baseline in 3 of the six variables in JIA core set and no intermittent fever (body temperature 38\u00b0C) in the preceding week, with no more than 16 | NHS England Evidence Review: Certainty of evidence: Very low own criteria in a subgroup of patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab in all or the majority of cases . Remission (defined as JADAS -10 score 1): 1 prospective case series (Horneff et al 2017) of 245 patients from a national registry of SJIA patients on biologics reported results for 7 patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab providing non- comparative evidence that remission (defined as JADAS - 10 score 1) was achieved in 55% of these in scope patients at last documented response (estimated from graph; median/mean ti mepoint not reported). (VERY LOW) Remission (defined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria): 1 prospective case series (Horneff et al 2017) of 245 patients from a national registry of SJIA patients on biologics reported results for 7 patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab providing non- comparative evidence that remission (defined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria) was achieved in 43% of these in scope patients at last documented response (estimated from graph; median/mean timepoint not reported). (VERY LOW) Achieving ACR paediatric 30, 50 and 70 criteria: 1 prospective case series ( Nishimura et al 2020) of 19 SJIA patients treated with canakinumab reported results for a subgroup of 15 patients previously treated with tocilizumab providing non -comparative evidence that one of the six variables worsening by >30%. The six JIA components were the number of joints with active arthritis, the number of joints with a limited range of motion, physician's global assessment (PGA), and patients'/parents' global assessment (PPGA) of disease activity on a 100mm visual analog scale (VAS), standardized CRP level (normal range: 0-10 mg/L), and functional ability (using the Disability Index of the Childh ood Health Assessment Questionnaire, on a scale of 0- 3. 17 | NHS England Evidence Review: ACR paediatric 30, 50 and 70 criteria was achieved in all patients at 8 weeks. (VERY LOW) Rem ission off medication (study 's criteria ): 1 single centre retrospective case series (Barut et al 2019) of 168 SJIA patients reported results for 27 patients treated with canakinumab providing non-comparative evidence that remission17 off medication (no us age of any anti-rheumatic drugs during the last 12 months) was achieved in 3 (11.5%) patients treated with canakinumab with follow -up for a minimum of 12 months (timepoint not reported). While it is likely that canakinumab was given as 4th line treatment following tocilizumab or anakinra, only up to 67% of patients can have been previously treated with tocilizumab. (VERY LOW) Minimal disease activity on medication (not defined): 1 single centre retrospective case series (Barut et al 2019) of 168 SJIA patients reported results for 27 patients treated with canakinumab providing non-comparative evidence that minimal disease activity on medication was achieved in 23 (85%) patients treated with canakinumab with follow -up of a minimum of 12 months (timepoint not reported). While it is likely that canakinumab was given as 4th line treatment following tocilizumab or anakinra, only up to 67% of patients can have been previously treated with tocilizu mab. (VERY LOW) These studies provided very low certainty evidence that compared to baseline , canakinumab reduces and resolves symptoms in patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab. 17 Remission was defined as lack of fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and arthritis, as well as normal levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) | NHS England Evidence Review: Reduction in corticosteroid use Certainty of evidence: Very low Assessment of corticosteroid use is important to patients because long-term steroid use can be harmful and cause side effects unwanted by patients and may affect treatment choice. One prospective case series (Nishimura et al 2020) provided non-comparative evidence relating to reduction in corticosteroid use in a subgroup of patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab. Successful oral corticosteroid tapering: 1 prospective case series (Nishimura et al 2020) of 19 SJIA patients treated with canakinumab reported results for a subgroup of 15 patients previously treated with tocilizumab providing non-comparative evidence that successful oral corticosteroid tapering18 was achieved at 28 weeks in 11 (73.3%) of these in scope patients, of which 10 (66.7%) were tapered and 1 (6.7%) was corticosteroid-free. (VERY LOW) This study provided very low certainty evidence that compared to baseline , canakinumab reduces corticosteroid use up to 28 weeks in patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab. Important outcomes Control of biochemical markers of inflammation (C - reactive protein (CRP ), serum amyloid A (SAA ) and erythrocyte Assessment of inflammatory biomarkers is important to patients because these blood tests are a direct, quantifiable measure of disease activity and treatment response. Retur n to normal levels can indicate biochemical remission. No evidence was identified for this outcome . 18 Dose reduced from >0.8 mg/kg/day to 0.5 mg/kg/day, or from 0.5 mg/kg/day and 0.8 mg/kg/day by 0.3 mg/kg/day, or from any initial dose to 0.2 mg/kg/day, or any reduction from an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day, while maintaining ACR paed iatric 30 res sedimentation rate (ESR )) Certainty of evidence: Not applicable Changes in systemic features of disease (fever, rash, weight change and hepatosplenomegaly) Certainty of evidence: Very low Assessment of systemic disease is important to patients because this could help determine treatment choice and because of the impact on the patient's self -perceived well -being. One prospective case series (Horneff et al 2017) provided non- comparative evidence relating to changes in systemic features of disease in a subgroup of patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab. 1 prospective case series (Horneff et al 2017) of 245 patients from a national registry of SJIA patients on biologics reported results for 7 patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab providing non- comparative evidence that 85% of patients had no fever at last documented response (estimated from graph; median/mean timepoint not reported). (VERY LOW) This study provided very low cert ainty evidence that compared to baseline , canakinumab improves systemic features of disease in patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab. Safety Adverse effects Certainty of evidence: Very low Safety outcomes are relevant to patients because adverse events can affect survival, quality of life, tolerability and overall responses. Three case series (Barut et al 2019, Horneff et al 2017 and Nishimura et al 2020) provided non-comparative evidence 20 | NHS England Evidence Review: relating to adverse effects in a subgroup of patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab. Severe adverse effect s: 1 single centre retrospective case series (Barut et al 2019) of 168 SJIA patients reported results for a subgroup of 27 patients tr eated with canakinumab providing non-comparative evidence that \"one patient treated with canakinumab had pneumonia\" . While it is likely that canakinumab was given as 4th line treatment following tocilizumab or anakinra, only up to 67% can have been previously treated with tocilizumab. (VERY LOW) Experience 1 adverse event(s) during the study : 1 prospective case series (Nishimura et al 2020) of 19 SJIA patients treated with canakinumab reported results for a subgroup of 15 patients previously treated with tocilizumab providing non-comparative evidence that \"all patients experienced 1 AE during the study\" . (VERY LOW) Discontinuation of medication due to intolerance: 1 prospective case series (Horneff et al 2017) of 245 patients from a national registry of SJIA patients on biologics reported results for 7 patients treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab providing non- comparative evidence that \"1 patient on canakinumab treatment who had MAS discontinued due to intolerance\" . (VERY LOW) This study pr ovided very low certainty evidence on the safety of canakinumab in patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab. 21 | NHS England Evidence Review: Abbreviations : ACR - American College of Rheumatology, AE - adverse event, JADAS - juvenile arthritis disease activity score, MAS - macrophage activation syndrome, SJIA - systemic -onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis .

Outcome Evidence statement Cost Effectiveness No evidence was identified for cost effectiveness 22 | NHS England Evidence Review: 6. Discussion This rapid evidence review considered the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of fourth line canakinumab following current standard treatment (corticosteroids, DMARDs, and tocilizumab then anakinra) compared with standard treatment alone in patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab. The critical outcomes of interest were improvement in quality of life, reduction and resolution of symptoms (as measured by the JADAS or similar ), and reduction in corticosteroid use. The important outcomes of interest were control of biochemical markers of inflammation (CRP, SAA and ESR) and changes in systemic features of disease (fever, rash, weight change and hepatosplenomegaly). No comparative studies were found that met the inclusion criteria for population and intervention. To be in scope patients with SJIA needed to be treated with canakinumab as fourth line treatment following first line treatment with corticosteroids, second line treatment with a conventional DMARD ( methotrexate) and third line treatment with tocilizumab then anakinra if no response.19 Limited evidence was available with only results from 49 in scope patients extracted from three case series (Barut et al 2019, Horneff et al 2017 and Nishimura et al 2020), only one of which was specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of canakinumab (Nishimura et al 2020) . Results from the 49 canakinumab treated SJIA patients provided limited evidence for reduction and r esolution of symptoms (as measured by JADAS or similar) and reduction in corticosteroid use (critical outcomes) , changes in fever, rash and hepatosplenomegaly (important outcomes) , and safety outcomes . No evidence was available for the other outcomes of interest. The case series were at very high risk of bias mainly due to limitations in the reporting of baseline characteristics and results for the patient subgroup of interest . Certainty in the evidence for critical and important outcomes was very low when assessed using modified GRADE. Horneff et al 2017 was a prospective case series of 245 patients included in a national registry of SJIA patients treated with biologics, seven of which were treated with canakinumab following tocilizumab. Relevant outcomes for these seven patients were extracted for inclusion in this review. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were not reported separately for the patients who received canakinumab following tocilizumab. It is likely that canak inumab was given as fourth line treatment in these 19 PICO amended following clarification with NHS England CET by email correspondence 7 December 2020. Intervention was changed from 4th line canakinumab following anakinra or tocilizumab to 4th line canakinumab following tocilizumab then anakinra if no response. Hence population was changed from SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab to SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab. 23 | NHS England Evidence Review: patients , as all patients in the study had previously received steroids and the majority of patients had previously received or were on concomitant methotrexate. Patients were follow ed-up as part of the registry at three and six months after starting biologics and six monthly thereafter , and results were reported up to 24 months and at last documented response timepoint . Results for in scope patients were only reported graphically for remission and no fever , and only for the last documented observation timepoint (no mean/median length of follow -up reported) . Nishimura et al 2020 was a prospective case series ( number of centres not reported) which included 19 patients with SJIA treated with canakinumab with up to 48 weeks follow -up. The paper reported results separately for 15 patients who had been previously treated with tocilizumab. Results for this group were extracted for inclusion in the evidence review. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were not reported separately for patients who received prior tocilizumab. It is not known for certain whether canakinumab was given as fourth line treatment in these patients , as although it was reported that all patients were on concomitant oral corticosteroids , previous use of methotrexate was not reported, only that just under half were receiving methotrexate at time of study . One patient previously treated with tocilizumab was discontinued from the study before eight weeks either due to adverse event s or loss of efficacy . Barut et al 2019 was a single centre retrospective case series, which included 168 patients with SJIA . The paper reported results for a subgroup of 27 patients treated with canakinumab. Results for these 27 patients were extracted for inclusion in the evidence review. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were not reported separately for these canak inumab treated patients . It was not possible to determine whether canakinumab was given as fourth line treatment in these patients , only that all 168 patients were treated with steroids, 75% with methotrexate, 17% with cyclosporine A, 16% with anakinra and 11% with tocilizumab. However, it seems likely that canakinumab was given as fourth line treatment following tocilizumab or anakinra as the authors reported that they use tocilizumab for patients resistant to standard treatment ; anakinra and canakinumab are successfully used in patients with resistant SJIA and macrophage activation syndrome; and anakinra was replaced by canakinumab in the majority of patients. It should be noted however, that only 18 patients out of 168 patients were reported to be treated with tocilizumab, and therefore it is only possible that a maximum of 18 out of 27 (67%) canakinumab treated patient were previously treated with tocilizumab. The median treatment duration of canakinumab was reported to be 19.5 months but the length of retrospective follow -up was not reported. Furthermore, a validated disease activity measure was not used to assess remission and no definition was provided for minimal 24 | NHS England Evidence Review: disease activity. The results for adverse effects were inconsistent with the authors reporting that one patient treated wi th canakinumab had pneumonia in the discussion, but not in the results section. For all included studies, no statistical comparisons were made with baseline, so it was not possible to determine whether the results represent statistically significant changes. 25 | NHS England Evidence Review: 7. Conclusion The evidence included in this review is insufficient to draw conclusions about the clinical effectiveness and safety of fourth line canakinumab following current standard treatment (corticosteroids, DMARDs, and tocilizumab then anakinra) compared to standard treatment alone in patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab. The key limitation to identifying the effectiveness of canakinumab compared to standard treatment is the lack of comparative studies with only relevant results found from sub-groups of in scope patients within case series. Limited evidence was identified with results for only 49 patients treated with canakinumab extracted from two prospective case series and one retrospective case seri es. Baseline characteristics and treatment history for these patients were not reported separately , so although it appears highly likely that canakinumab was given as fourth line treatment following tocilizumab in the majority of cases , this was not always certain. This very low certainty, non-comparative evidence for 49 patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of tocilizumab suggests that canakinumab improves disease severity , reduces concomitant corticosteroid dosage and reduces fever with few adverse effects . No results were reported for quality of life and biomarkers of inflammation ( CRP , SAA and ESR ). No evidence on the cost effectiveness of canakinumab compared to current standard treatments was identified. No evidence was identified for particular sub-groups of patients that would benefit more from treatment with canakinumab. 26 | Appendix A PICO Document Appendix A PICO Document The review questions for this evidence review are: 1. In patients with SJI A refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the clinical effectiveness of canakinumab compared with current standard treatment? 2. In patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the safety of canakinumab compared with current standard treatment? 3. In patients with SJIA refractory to or intolerant of anakinra or tocilizumab, what is the cost-effect iveness of canakinumab? 4. From the evidence selected are there any data to suggest that there are particular sub-groups of patients that would benefit from treatment with canakinumab more than others? P - Population and Indication Patients with a diagnosis of systemic -onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) that are refractory or intolerant to anakinra or tocilizumab. SJIA is a severe subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) characterised by arthritis with systemic inflammation that can c ause hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and serositis. Some patients with SJIA show a monophasic course, with resolution of all symptoms and no recurrences, but the majority develop recurring symptoms. I - Intervention Canakinumab as 4th line treatmen t, after: 1. Corticosteroids no response20 Canakinumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that is proposed as a 4th line treatment option for patients with SJIA that is refractory to the three lines of current standard treatment. C - Comparator(s) No treatment with canakinumab as 4th line treatment after all the following: 20 PICO amended following clarification with NHS England CET by email correspondence 7 December 2020. 27 | Appendix A PICO Document 1. Corticosteroids 2. DMARDs (methotrexate)20 3. Tocilizumab then anakinra if no response20 Current standard treatment for SJIA involves three lines of treatment. First line treatment is with corticosteroids, followed if necessary by treatment with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). If remission is still not achieved, third line treatment is with tocilizumab and/or anakinra. O - Outcomes Response to treatment for all of the clinical effectiveness outcomes would be expected to be achieved within 12 weeks of starting treatment. There are no known standard MCIDs for any of the outcome measures with SJIA. Clinical Effectiveness Critical to decision-making: Quality of life: preferred measure is the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) or similar. This questionnaire assesses quality of life specific to children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis by measuring disability, discomfort and pain. Quality of life is important to patients because of the impact on the patient's function, activities of daily living and self -perceived well -being. Improvement in quality of life is a marker of successful treatment. Reduction and resolution of symptoms (as measured by the juvenile arthritis disease activity score (JADAS) or similar). Improvement in symptoms is important to patients because this could help determine treatment choice (such as reduction of corticosteroids) and impact on t he patient's function and activities of daily living. Resolution of symptoms also indicates clinical remission. Reduction in corticosteroid use Assessment of corticosteroid use is important to patients because long-term steroid use can be 28 | Appendix A PICO Document harmful and caus e side -effects unwanted by patients and may affect treatment choice. These are considered the outcomes most critical to decision making as they include the patient's perspective on their condition. They help to determine if the treatment is effective at reducing symptoms, modifying disease activity, improving quality of life and improving biochemical markers. Important to decision-making: Control of biochemical markers of Assessment of inflammatory biomarkers is important to patients because these blood tests are a direct, quantifiable measure of disease activity and treatment response. Return to normal levels can indicate biochemical remission. Changes in systemic features of disease (fever, rash, weight change and hepatosplenomegaly) Assessment of systemic disease is important to patients because this could help determine treatment choice and because of the impact on the patient's self -perceived well -being Safety Adverse effects - most important are respiratory infections, upper abdominal pain and treatment withdrawal due to adver se effects Cost effectiveness Inclusion criteria Study design Systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, cohort studies.

Baseline The set of measurem ents at the beginning of a study (after any initial 'run-in' period with no intervention), with which subsequent results are compared. Bias Systematic (as opposed to random) deviation of the results of a study from the 'true' results, which is caused by the way the study is designed or conducted. Case series Reports of several patients with a given condition, usually covering the course of the condition and the response to treatment. There is no comparison (control) group of patients. Confidence inter val A way of expressing how certain we are about the findings from a study, using statistics. It gives a range of results that is likely to include the 'true' value for the population. A wide confidence interval (CI) indicates a lack of certainty about the true effect of the test or treatment - often because a small group of patients has been studied. A narrow CI indicates a more precise estimate (for example, if a large number of patients have been studied). The CI is usually stated as '95% CI', which means that the range of values has a 95 in a 100 chance of including the 'true' value. For example, a study may state that 'based on our sample findings, we are 95% certain that the 51 | Glossary 'true' population blood pressure is not higher than 150 and not lower than 110'. In such a case the 95% CI would be 110 to 150. GRADE (Grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation) A systematic and explicit approach to grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations developed by the GRADE working group. PICO (population, intervention, comparison and outcome) framework A structured approach for developing review questions that divides each question into 4 components: the population (the population being studied); the interventions (what is being done); the comparators (other main treatment options); and the outcomes (measures of how effective the interventions have been). P-value (p) The p value is a statistical measure that indicates whether or not an effect is statistically significant. For example, if a study comparing 2 treatments found that 1 seems to be more effective than the other, the p value is the probability of obtaining these results by chance. By convention, if the p value is below 0.05 (that is, there i s less than a 5% probability that the results occurred by chance), it is considered that there probably is a real difference between treatments. If the p value is 0.001 or less (less than a 0.1% probability that the results occurred by chance), the result is seen as highly significant. If the p value shows that there is likely to be a difference between treatments, the confidence interval describes how big the difference in effect might be. Retrospective study A research study that focuses on the past and present. The study examines past exposure to suspected risk factors for the disease or condition. Unlike prospective studies, it does not cover 52 | Glossary events that occur after the study group is selected. Statistical significance A statistically significant res ult is one that is assessed as being due to a true effect rather than random chance. 53 | References References Included studies Barut K, Adrovic A, Sahin S, Tarcin G, Tahaoglu G, Koker O, et al.
