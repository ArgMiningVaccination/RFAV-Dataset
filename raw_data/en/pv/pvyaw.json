Introduction from the McLean County Community Health Council's Executive Steering Committee The formation of the McLean County Community Health Council marked an important milestone for community health in McLean County. Prior to this collaborative assessment, the two hospitals in McLean County and the McLean County Health Department each conducted their own community health needs assessment which resulted in three community health plans for the County. During the same time, United Way of McLean County conducted a broad -based community needs assessment. a) Philosophy and Development of Collaborative All four organizations are dedicated to improving the health of the community and strongly believe in the philosop hy of collaboration. Collaborating together in a more effective manner was identified as the primary learning opportunity from the previous community health needs assessment s. The involved organizations determined that the community health needs assessmen t for McLean County could be conducted more efficiently and effectively by pooling resources. Collaborating together was also identified as the key for a successful implementation plan that would make impactful and sustainable community health improvements in McLean County. For all of the above reasons, the McLean County Community Health Council was formed in April, 2015. The result is the production of a collaborative community health needs assessment followed by one community health implementation plan for McLean County. b) Community Feedback from Previous Assessments Both hospitals provided a mechanism for community members to provide feedback from the 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment and mad e the reports available to community members. Each hospital Community Health Needs Assessment report was also posted on their respective websites. The McLean County Health Department also posted the McLean County 2012 -2017 IPLAN on their website. Although feedback was not given by individuals in the community via the available mechanisms, verbal feedback was provided from key stakeholders from community service organizations. Consistently, stakeholders inquir ed as to why McLean County had four different community health needs assessments and three different implementation plans . c) Community Health Needs Assessment Report Approval BroMenn Medical Center and St. Joseph Medical Center are utilizing this joint report in conjunction with the McLean County Health Department and United Way of M cLean County to meet their 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment requirements reportable to the Internal Revenue Service as 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 2 outlined by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The McLean County Health Departmen t will also utiliz e this report and subsequent community health implementation plan to meet IPLAN requirements for local health department certification by the Illinois Department of Public Health. United Way of McLean County is not required to perform a community health needs assessment; however, they are collaborating with the above organizations and adopting this joint report in order to better serve the health needs of McLean County . BroMenn Medical Center, the McLean County Health Department, St. Jose ph Medical Center and United Way of McLean County are the primary organizations responsible for guiding implementation plans that will be developed as a result of this community health needs assessment. Implementation plans will be developed in partnership with other community social service agencies and organizations. This plan was approved by United Way of McLean County's Board of Directors on June 10th, 2016, Advocate BroMenn Medical Center and Eureka Hospital's Governing Council on July 19, 2016, the McLean County Board of Health on July 13, 2016 and OSF Healthcare System's Board of Directors on July 25, 2016 . II. Executive Summary BroMenn Medical Center, the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and United Way of McLean County collaborated together fo r the first time for the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment. This exciting and unique opportunity was possible , according to the final rules of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , as all four entities define their service area as McLean County. The goals of the collaborative are as follows: Establish the McLean County Community Health Council Analyze data collectively Prioritize and select the top three health needs for McLean County Generate one community health needs assessmen t for McLean County Work collaboratively on a community health implementation plan addressing each of the top three health priorities with other key community stakeholders At least one member from each of the four organizati ons made up the Executive Steering Committee. The steering committee analyzed an extensive quantity of both primary and secondary data from July, 2015 to February, 2016. Due to the availability of new datasets, the steering committee was able to analyze data at a more detailed level and identify health disparities for gender, age, race/ethnicity, and zip code for a variety of health outcomes. In February, 2016, the Executive Steering Committee presented 13 health issues to the McLean County Community Hea lth Council that the data suggested were health problem s. The McLean County Community Health Council consists of 33 individuals from 13 organizations in McLean County representing public entities, faith -based and private organizations, social service organ izations, healthcare facilities and city and regional planning . Although a standard prioritization methodology was not utilized at this stage in the process, the following factors were taken into consideration in the decision making process when analyzing the data: 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 3 Trending unfavorably overall Worse than state, national, and/or Healthy People 2020 goals Demonstrating significant local disparities The 13 issues that rose to the top as potential health concerns for McLean County are listed below in alphabetical order: Alzheimer's and Dementia Birth Outcomes Cancer Cesarean Section Heart Disease Mental Health Obesity Oral Health Radon Respiratory Disease Sexually Transmitted Diseases Substance Abuse Violent Crime During the first McLean County Community Health Council meeting robust data was presented on the 13 health issues which were then narrowed down to six health issues to be prioritized duri ng the next meeting. It is important to note that although it was not presented as one of the 13 health concerns, access to appropriate health care continually came up as an important issue during group discussion. It was decided upon by the group that this would be added as one of the health issues to be voted on in addition to the 13 issues presented. Additionally, council members were informed that they could combine any issues they felt were appropriate. For example, council members could vote for menta l health or they could combine mental health and substance abuse and vote for behavioral health. Discussion also occurred during the meeting that diabetes, cancer and heart disease could all fall under obesity if selected as one of the six priorities on wh ich to vote because reducing obesity could positively impact the incidence of each of the above diseases. After council members voted, the results of the top six issues prioritized at the next meeting were as follows: Access to Appropriate Healthc are for the Underserved and Areas of High Socioeconomic Needs Behavioral Health (Mental Health and Substance Abuse) Birth Outcomes Obesity Oral Health Respiratory Disease 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 4 The Hanlon Method was utilized during the prioritization meeting to select the top three h ealth priorities for McLean County. The following three health priorities were selected by the McLean County Commun ity Health Council for the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment: Access to Appropriate Healthc are for the Underserved and Areas of High Socioeconomic Need Behavioral Health (including Mental Health and Substance Abuse) Obesity The three health issues that were not selected were birth outcomes, oral health and respiratory disease. The council acknowledged the importance of a ll three of these issues, but the prioritization scores for the three selected issues were higher than those for the issues not selected. After identification of the top three health priorities, the next step in the process included pulling key stakehold ers together to set high level goals for each health priority. A separate meeting was held for each health priority, during the month of April, 2016, to discuss appropriate community goals for each initiative. The goals for each of the health priorities i dentified are listed below: Access to Appropriate Healthcare Goal : By 2020, decrease barriers to utilizing primary care in 61701 in order to reduce use of hospital emergency departments for non -emergent conditions. Behavioral Health Goal #1 : By 2020, increase coping skills to red uce deaths due to suicide and emergency room visits due to self -inflicted injury and alcohol abuse. Behavioral Health Goal #2 : By 2020, reduce behavioral health stigma to increase earlier access to care. Obesity Goal : By 2020, pursue policy, system and environmental changes to maintain or increase the percentage of people living at a healthy body weight in McLean County. In the fall of 2016, the community health implementation plan will be developed as implementation groups be gin working on setting specific objectives towards achieving the goals and identifying intervention strategies . Notably, the partners involved in the Executive Steering Committee and the City of Bloomington Community Development Division were recently awa rded the \"Invest Health \" grant funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Reinvestment Fund. Through this grant, the Invest Health team will bring together disparate sectors of the community to identify and create built environment changes in Bloomin gton to increase access to healthcare and access healthy foods. McLean County is well poised to make meaningful progress due to the innovative collaboration among BroMenn Medical Center, the McLean County Health Department, St. Joseph Medical Center and Un ited Way of McLean County , all of whom are eager to continue their mission and journey in helping to improve the health and well -being of the individuals in McLean County.

Summary of Previous ly Selected Priorities and Update on Implementation Plans f or Past McLean County Community Health Needs Assessments a) Previously Selected Health Priorities BroMenn Medical Center 2011 -2013 CHNA BroMenn Medical Center selected mental health and obesity as its two health priorities for the 2011 - 2013 CHNA. This is consistent with two of the three health priorities selected by the McLean County Community Health Advisory Committee for the 2012 -2017 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan through the IPLAN process. . McLean County Health Department 2012 -2017 IPLAN The McLean County Community Health Advisory Committee selected mental health, oral health, and obesity as the health priorities for the 2012 -2017 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan through the IPLAN process. Three task forces were formed to addre ss these issues in McLean County . Both hospitals a nd United Way had representatives serving on the task forces. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 9 St. Joseph Medical Center 2011 -2013 CHNA St. Joseph Medical Center selected mental health, risky behaviors -substance abuse, obesity, healthy behaviors, access to health services, and dental for the 2011 -2013 CHNA. Three of the six selected priorities : 1) obesity ; 2) mental health ; and, 3) dental are consistent with the three health priorities identified by the McLean County Community Health Advisory Committee for the 2012 -2017 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan through the IPLAN process. United Way of McLean County 2014 Community Assessment United Way of McLean County conducted a comprehensive community needs assessment in 2014. Although health was a key component of the assessment process, the priority selected for McLean County's Collective Impact was declining graduation rates. Mental health and obesity were identified as key health issues in McLean County, however the Collective Impact Steering Council felt and literat ure supports that declining graduation rates was a more suitable issue to focus on for its collective impact efforts. The United Way Collective Impact Steering Council has met on a nearly monthly basis since August, 2015 to establish the strategy, provide education by subject matter experts, and to discuss the formation of work groups for this effort. b) Previous Implementation Plan Key Accomplishments Although the two hospitals in McLean County and the McLean County Health Department each conducted sepa rate CHNA's for the previous cycle, they collaborated together for mental health, oral health, and obesity implementation efforts in McLean County via task forces led by the McLean County Health Department for mental health and oral health and the McLean C ounty Wellness Coalition for obesity. Below are some highlights of the key accomplishments for the selected priorities listed below. Mental Health: Health priority for BroMenn Medical Center , McLean County Health Department and St. Joseph Medical Center There are several significant accomplishments in the area of mental health. An overview of these is explained below. As a result of mental health being identified as a key health priority for both hospitals and the health department, the Mc Lean County Mental Health First Aid Collaborative was formed in the spring of 2014. Since its inception , 654 community members have become certified in Mental Health First Aid due to courses offered by partners in the collaborative. As a part of the McLea n County Mental Health First Aid Collaborative, the McLean County Health Department received a grant for $8 ,500 from the Women to Women's Giving Circle of the Illinois Prairie Community Foundation in 2015 and a $10,000 grant in 2016. The grant allowed memb ers of the collaborative, such as BroMenn Medical Center and St. Joseph's Medical Center to offer Mental Health First Aid courses for a reduced fee of $10 per course. Each hospital also provided in -kind advertising, space and food for courses hosted at the ir 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 10 hospitals. The McLean County Health Department provided coordination, support, and training materials for all courses offered. McLean County Board officials, supported by key community stakeholders from BroMenn Medical Center , McLean County Health Dep artment and St. Joseph Medical Center developed a McLean County Mental Health Action Plan. As a result, in April, 2015, Chestnut Health Systems opened a Crisis Stabilization Unit which was identified as a community need. In addition, in May 2016, 16 indiv iduals were appointed to the Behavioral Health Coordinating Council, which will serve as an advisory body to the McLean County Board of mental health policy decisions. A Community Crisis Planning Group was established in January 2015 to improve community crisis services and serve individuals in the most appropriate setting. The goal of the group is to save lives and reduce inappropriate emergency room visits and incarcerations. Both hospitals and the health department have key staff serving on this planning group. Obesity: Health priority for BroMenn Medical Center , McLean County Health Department and St. Joseph Medical Center The McLean C ounty Wellness Coalition serves as the group which focuses on decreasing the prevalence of obesity in the county. Representatives from BroMenn Medical Center , St. Joseph's Medical Center and the McLean County Health Department serve on the leadership committee of the McLean County Wellness Coalition . Its goal is to increase the number of people in McLean County living at a healthy body weight through policy, system, and environmental changes (PSE's). Some of the key accomplishments of the McLean County Wellness Coalition include: In January, 2015 Ridgeview Custodial District #19 purchased 26 Polar Active Heart Rate Monitors due to an in -kind donation by BroMenn Medical Center . The heart rate monitors are being utilized in conjunction with an evidenced -based P.E. program entitled S PARK (Sports, Play, and Active Recreation for Kids) for approximately one hundred 6th and 7th grade students. The heart rate monitors will assist students in receiving immediate feedback on exercise and the health benefits of exercising in different heart rate zones. Ridgeview P.E. teachers received professional training, curriculum, and equipment for SPARK P.E. through their partnership with the McLean County Health Department and the Illinois Department of Public Health's We Choose Health Initiative (mad e possible by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ). St. Joseph Medical Center created a community garden on the hospital campus and partnered with Home Sweet Home Ministries for distribution of nearly 500 pounds of produce through the Bread fo r Life Co -op. Established four new community gardens . Promoted Walk/Bike to School Day with over 600 participants . From 2014 -2016, over 1,000 individuals participated in Live Healthy Central Illinois wellness challenges that focused on physical activity, h ealthy eating, and weight management. Managed volunteers for the Veggie Oasis , which provides locally -grown produce donated by farmers from th e Downtown Bloomington Association's Farmer s' Market, to low -income 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 11 neighborhoods in Bloomington. Approximately 4 ,200 pounds of produce were distributed to 697 people in 2015. The following was accomplished in addition to the activities conducted by the McLean County Wellness Coalition: Eight patients of the Community Health Care Clinic participated and completed a four week diabetes education class offered twice in 2013 and once in 2014 at BroMenn Medical Center . Twelve patients of the Community Health Care Clinic participated in a similar class in 2013 held at St. Joseph Medical Center. Oral Health: Health priority for McLean County Health Department and St. Joseph Medical Center The Oral Health Task Force was established in January of 2013 as the result of the McLean County Health Department's 2012 -2017 IPLAN and is comprised of 11 agencies and organizations with a stake in oral health. The purpose of the Oral Health Task Force is to implement and maintain outcome objectives outlined in the 2012 -2017 IPLAN. Illinois State University Mennonite College of Nursing students piloted an America's Promise School program during 2012 and 2013 in a select number of McLean C ounty's first grade classrooms. The objectives of the pilot program were to : identify the effect of oral health disease among children in our local schools; determine if there was an associ ation between poor oral health and increased school absenteeism and decreased school performance; and , to implement standardized oral health education and promote preventive behaviors to decrease the risk of oral health disease. The program consisted of da ily onsite tooth brushing, oral health education and messaging directed toward parents and guardians. The McLean County Health Department partnered with District 87's Summer Feeding Program to provide a 10 -week oral health education program modeled after the American Dental Association's Smile Smarts curriculum. The program reached over 100 students and their families. In 2015, pamphlets discussing the importance of infant oral health were distributed to each new parent at St. Joseph Medical Center and Br oMenn Medical Center, reaching at least 2,500 individuals. Purchased and obtained donations of pediatric toothbrushes for distribution through primary care offices . United Way of McLean County convened a regularly recurring meeting among oral health stakeholders to identify the major local challenges and gaps, and specifically solicited oral health grant proposals for their FY17 -19 grant cycle. Risky Behaviors -Subst ance Abuse : Health priority for St. Joseph Medical Center Collaborated with local organizations to produce a video and educational material s aimed at discouraging underage drinking and distributed them to local schools for use in classroom settings. Healthy Behaviors: Health priority for St. Joseph Medical Center 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 12 Offered smoking cessation programs in partnership with community organizations. Access to Health Services: Health priority for St. Joseph Medical Center Established an E mergency Departme nt Navigator position to assist patients , who frequently visit the emergency department , in connecting to resources in the community that can help proactively manage health issues. V. Community Health Needs Assessment a) Methodology The 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment was conducted using a mixed methodological approach. Secondary statistical data were collected from over 30 different sources and used to assess the community profile, morbidity and mortalit y rates, as well as ot her aspects of health of McLean County . Additionally, based on a sample of 834 survey respondents (25 respondents used a version translated into Spanish) from McLean County, a Community Health Survey was administered to examine perceptions of community hea lth issues, unhealthy behaviors, issues with quality of life, healthy behaviors and access to healthcare. When available, each section of the report provides prevalence rates, comparisons to state, national, and Health y People 2020 data, trend and dispari ties data . Key findings can be found at the end of each major data category . Secondary Data Existing secondary data was used to develop an overall assessment of health -related issues in the community. The most recent data available at the time of data c ollection and presented to the McLean County Community Health Council during the prioritization process for this community health needs assessment is included in the report. Data prior to 2006 was not included unless utilized for trend comparisons. Much of the secondary data used for this assessment was acquired via Healthy Communities Institute, a centralized data platform purchased by Advocate Health Care to help drive community health improvement efforts . Healthy Communities Institute operates as a re pository for publicly available secondary data and hospital emergency room visits and hospitalization rates. The platform includes dashboards, GIS maps, disaggregation at the zip code level, disparities information and effective practices for over 100 heal th-related issues. Healthy Communities Institute also supplies a colorful gauge to depict comparisons between McLean County, Illinois counties, Illinois and U.S. counties . 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 13 Green (Good): When a high value is good, community value is equal to or higher than the 50th percentile (median) -- OR - When a low value is good, community value is equal to or lower than 50th percentile Yellow (Fair): When a high value is good, community value is betw een 50th and 25th percentile - - OR - When a low value is good, community value is between 50th and 75th percentiles Red (Poor): When a high value is good, community value is less than 25th percentile -- OR - When a low value is good, community value is gre ater than 75th percentile Other frequently cited secondary data sources are as follows: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System: A county -level, self -report survey conducted every five years that gathers information on risk factors among Illino is adults 18 and over through monthly telephone surveys. Illinois Youth Survey: A county -level, self -report survey administered in school settings and designed to gather information about a variety of health and social indicators including substance use p atterns and attitudes of Illinois youth. Illinois Department of Public Health: State data repositories, such as iQuery, Illinois Project for Local Assessment of Need data set, birth and death records, and Vital Statistics. A comprehensive list of secondar y data sou rces can be found in Appendix 1 . Primary Data In addition to existing secondary data sources, it was also important to utilize primary survey data to collect current information and ask questions not asked elsewhere, such as ratings of health is sues in the community. A community health survey (Appendix 2) consisting of 36 demographic and health - related questions was administered from July through September 2015 and yielded a total of 834 responses from McLean County residents. Survey Development The survey development began with a review of instruments used in health needs assessments across the U.S. to identify common themes. Interviews with clinical teams and focus groups in the community were used to gather additional inform ation about the types of questions to include. Five specific sets of items were included in the final survey: 1) Ratings for health issues in the community; 2) Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community; 3) Ratings of issues concerning well -being; 4) Accessibility to health care; and, 5) Healthy behaviors. After the initial survey was designed, a pilot study was implemented to test the psychometric properties and statistical validity of the survey instrument. The 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 14 pilot study was conducted at the Heart land Community Health Clinic facilities and the results were used to finalize the survey questionnaire. Data Collection and Sample Size To collect the survey data, t wo techniques were used. O nline an d paper versions of the survey were available in English and Spanish and were distributed through organizations in the community. To specifically target the at -risk population ( defined as low income residents in this case ), surveys were distributed at social service organizations, food pantries and soup kitchens. While 834 surveys were collected, study authors reduced the number of responses to produce a sample that was more representative of the total population in McLean County. First, surveys of those individuals living in poverty were identified. The re were 297 persons living in poverty who had responded to the survey, a number much larger than their percentage within the county because of purposeful oversampling. However, for a more in -depth analysis of the responses of this population, a sample size of at least 271 was required. To provide a more representative sample of the general population of McLean County, the non -poverty population (537) was combined with a portion of the population living in poverty. A random -number generator was used to selec t at-risk cases (89) to include in the general sample matching the proportion of population living in poverty for the whole county (14.2 percent). The total sample for nearly all of the analyses was ther efore 626 respondents. Exhibit 11, McLean County At -Risk Percentages for Choice of Medical Care , further analyzes the answers of all 297 respondents living in poverty. Comparisons with 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Throughout the report, the 2015 McLean County Community Health survey is comp ared to the 2013 McLean County Community Health Survey. The two surveys were nearly identical with only one additional question added in 2015 related to flu vaccines. The resulting samples were also quite comparable on various demographic variables. A comp arison of the 2015 sample and key demographics for Mc Lean County reveals that the survey sample included a higher proportion of women respondents than their percentage in the population and a higher proportion of individuals with a Bachelors or a graduate degree. While these differences may cause a small bias in some analyses, the size of the sample and the comparability of other demographic variables suggest that the bias will be minimal. b) Community Description The McLean County Community Health Council defined the community as McLean County, the primary service area for BroMenn Medical Center, the McLean County Health Department, St. Joseph Medical Center and United Way of McLean County. This area includes the following cities and towns: Anchor, Arrowsm McLean, Merna, Normal, Saybrook, Stanford and Towanda. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 15 Exhibit 1: McLean County Community Wellness Council Community Map - McLean County Source: McLean County Regional Planning Commission, 2016 Population McLean County consists of a total population of 174,879 (Healthy Communities Institute, Claritas, 2016). According to the 2014 US Census Bureau, Bloomingto n has the largest population in the county with 78,730 and Normal has the second largest population with 54,594. The population in McLean County increased by 3.1 percent from 2010 to 2016 (Healthy Communities Institute, Claritas, 2016). Social Determinan ts of Health: Socioneeds Social and economic factors are strong determinants of health outcomes. Six factors are utilized by Healthy Communities Institute to create socioneeds county rankings (1 -5) and national index values (1 - 100) for all of the zip cod es in McLean County. The six factors include: Poverty Education Unemployment Occupation 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 16 Income Language High values are associated with the highest socioeconomic need, which is correlated with preventable hospitalizations and premature death. The socioneeds map for McLean County is illustrated below in Exhibit 2. McLean County has four zip codes with a ran king of five , which represents the areas with the highest socioeconomic needs in McLean County: Bloomington - 61701: 36,197 1486 residents Stanford - 61774: 952 residents In addition to 61701, Bloomington has two other zip codes, 61704 and 61705, which both have a socioneeds ranking of one (low soci oeconomic need ). See Appendix 3 for county rankings and the national indexes for all of the zip codes in McLean County. Normal has one zip code, 617 61, which has a county ranking of four and a population of 54,431. Bellflower and Cooksville also have a county ranking of four . Both towns, however, have a population less than 500 residents. Exhibit 2: McLean County Socioneeds Map 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 17 Source: Healthy Communities Institute, 2016 Throughout this report, available social disparities will be highlighted for the zip codes with the hig hest socioneeds county rankings or high socioeconomic needs. While it is important for each county to identify its own highest scoring zip codes , it is also important to compare McLean County to other counties around the US . For example , the zip codes with the highest socioeconomic needs in McLean County do not exceed a 45.9 value , which is half the value of many zip codes on the west and south sides on Chicago. In other words, McLean County 's worst scoring zip code is still in the top or best 50th percentile of all US zip codes.

McLean County's ratio of dentists per population has improved over time, from 51 dentists per 100,000 in 2007 to 60 dentists per 100,000 in 2013 (Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 2013). According to United Way of McLean County's 2014 Community Needs Assessment, 39.1 percent of McLean County residents are without dental insurance. Medicare does not cover dental services and Medicaid does not cover preventive oral health services for adults. Medicaid reimbursement is low overall and dec reasi ng for children (decreased 16.8 percent from 2003 -2013); therefore, a limited number of private practices accept Medicaid as payment (Health Policy Institute, \"Are Medicaid and Private Dental Insurance Payment Rates for Pediatric Dental Care Services Keeping up with Inflation,\" 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 31 2014 ). Seventy -seven percent of the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey respondents reported that they have access to dental care. Twenty -three percent indicated that they do not have access to dental care ( McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 ). The primary reason reported by respondents from the 2015 McLean County Communit y Health Survey that they were not able to get dental c are was that they do not have insurance (45 percent) followed by they could not afford th e co- pay (30 percent; see Exhibit 17 ).

In 2014, 12 percent of 12th graders in McLean County had smoked a cigarette in the last 30 days, a 45 percent decrease since 2010. Of those who had smoked a cigarette, the average age of i nitiation was 15, higher than the state average age of 14.2 (Illinois Youth Survey, 2014) . 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 34 Substance Abuse Alcohol Use The percentage of McLean County adults at risk f or acute/binge drinking is 26.9, higher than the percentage at risk for the state (21.8 percent) . McLean County adults at risk for acute/binge drinking has increased from 1 9.0 percent in 2007 -09 to 26.9 percent (Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2013) . Men are more at risk for acute/binge drinking at 34.4 percent comp ared to women at 5.1 percent (Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2007 -2009). The age -adjusted emergency room rate due to alcohol abuse is 50.7 visits per 10,000 population for McLean County. This rate is in the worst fourth quartile rang e when compared to other I llinois counties (see Exhibit 20 ) and has increased 40 percent since 2009 -2011. McLean County's age -adjusted hospitalization rate due to alcohol abuse is 11.0 per 10,000 population, also in the worst fourth quartile rang e (red ind icator; see Exhibit 20 ).

The highest emergency room rates due to alcohol abuse are seen in: individuals aged 18 -19 (96.4 emergency room visits per 10,000 population) males (70.3 emergency room visits per 10,000 population) Blacks or African Americans (140.2 emergency room visits per 10,000 population) those living in 61701 (119.1 emergency room visits per 10,000 population) The highest hospitalizations rates due to alcohol abuse are seen in: individuals aged 45 -64 (18.1 hospitalizations per 10,000 population) males (16.3 hospitalizations per 10,000 population) those living in 61701 (21.5 hospitalization per 10,000 population) The percent of motor vehicle crash deaths with alcohol involvement in McLean County is 39.3 percent. This rate is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other U.S. counties (County Health Rankings, 2015). 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 35 Other Substances Drug -induced deaths accounted for 1.3 percent of the total deaths in McLean County in 2015. No single substance attributed to more deaths than others (McLean County Health Department Vital Records, 2015). Compared to other Illinois counties, the age -adjusted emergency room rate for substance abuse is in the best 0 -50th percentile range (green indicator) at 10.0 emergency room visits per 10,000 population. Similar to alcohol abuse, this rate is almost double for 61701 (19.3 per 10,000 population; Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2012 -2014 ). Overall, 30 percent of McLean County 8th graders and 65 percent of 12th graders report using any substance (including alcohol, cigarettes, inhalants, and marijuana) in the past year. Similarly, 26 percent of McLean County 8th graders and 64 percent of 12th graders reported using alcohol within the past year. Twelfth grade alcohol usage is comparable to the State (64.8 percent), whereas 8th grade usage is lower than the State (34.5 percent; Illinois Youth Survey, 2012). Nutrition According to the Illinois Be havioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 13.7 percent of McLean County adults consu me five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day , fewer than the state (22.6 percent) and nation (23.4 percent; 2007 -2009). Nineteen percent of 6th graders eat fou r or more fruits per day and 15 percent eat four or more vegetables per day (Illinois Youth Survey, 2014). Adult consumption of fruits and vegetables has decreased 36.3 percent since 2001 -2003, whereas youth consumption of fruits and vegetables has increas ed (18.8 percent for fruits; 66.7 percent for vegetables) since 2010. The 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey data show o ver half (60 percent ) of McLean County residents report no consumption or low consumption ( one to two servings per day) of fruits and vegetables (see Exhibit 21). Frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption tends to be higher by people with the following characteristics: women, higher education and higher income. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 36 Exhibit 21 : Responses for \"On a typical day, how many servings of fruits and/or vegetables do you eat?\" for McLean County, 2015 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 For the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey respondents who indicated not e ating fruits or vegetables, difficulty buying fruits and vegetables and the inability to afford fruits and vegetables were the two most frequently cited reasons for failing to consume fruit s and vegetables (see Exhibit 22 ).

Physical Activity and Inactivity According to the 2013 Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 69.0 percent of McLean County residents indicated they participated in physical activity or exercise within th e past month. The percentage of individuals in McLean County exceeds tha t of the State of Illinois ( 51.7 percent) . The percentage of McLean County residents participating in regular exercise for the past six months or longer, however, decreased from 39.3 p ercent in 2004 -2006 to 31.3 percent in 2007 -2009. In 2007 - 2009, 5.7 percent of residents had not exercised and exhibited no intent to exercise. The percentage of McLean County adults (ages 20 and up) who did not participate in any leisure -time activities (physical activities other than their regular job) during the past month is 22.3 percent . This rate is in the best 50th percentile (green indicator) when compared to other U.S. counties (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). In 2014, 41 percent of McLean County 6th graders were physically active for at least 60 minutes every day during the past seven days, a 12.8 percent decrease from 2012. The percent of McLean County 6th graders watching five or more hours of TV has also decreased over time, from nine percent in 2012 to five percent in 2014 (Illinois Youth Survey). The 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey data provide a more fine -grain assessment of exercise. Specifically, 27 percent of respondents indicated that they do not exerc ise at all, while the vast majority of residents (73 percent) exercise one to two time s per week or more (see Exhibit 23 ). Exhibit 23 : McLean County Residents' Exercise Frequency, 2015 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 38 Respondents who indicated that they do not exercise were asked to cite their reasons for not exercising. The most common reasons for not exercising are not enough time and being too tired (see Exhibit 24 ). Exhibit 24 : Reasons for Not Exercising in the Last Week for McLean County Residents, 2015 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 Comparison to the 2013 McLean County Community Health Survey Dissimilar from Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data trends, data from the 2013 McLean County Co mmunity Health Survey show an increase in percentage of adults participating in physical activity from 64 percent in 2013 to 73 percent in 2015 . Weight Status In 2013, 32.7 percent of McLean County residents were classified as overweight and 32.1 percent were classified as obese. A total of 64.8 percent of McLean County residents are either overweight or obese. McLean County's obesity rate is higher than the state (29.4 percent) and national rates (29.4 percent). As shown in Exhibit 25 , the obesity rate in McLean County has more than doubled since 2001 -2003 when the rate was 15.4 percent (Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2013) and is rising faster than the state and national obesity rates. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 39 Exhibit 25 : McLean County's Obesity Rate Trend, 2001 - 2013 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35% 2001 -2003 2004 -2006 2007 -2009 2013McLean County Illinois U.S. Sources: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2001 -2013; Center s for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System , 2001 -2013. Key findings: Modifiable Health Behaviors Fewer McLean County adults identify as smokers than adults in Illinois and in the U.S. and the percentage of smokers has declined 44.2 percent since 2004 -2006. More McLean County adults are at -risk for acute/binge drinking than adults in Illinois and the percentage has increased 41.6 percent since 2007 -2009. The age -adjusted emergency room visit rate and hospitalization rate due to alcohol abuse are in the worst fourth quartile range when compared to other Illinois counties. Emergency r oom visit rates due to alcohol abuse are almost double for 18 -19 year olds, 177% for Blacks or African Americans in comparison to other race/ethnicities and more than double for 61701. Emergency room visit rates due to substance abuse are almost double in 61701. Fewer McLean County adults consume five or more servings of fruits and vegetables than Illinois and the U.S. and the percentage for McLean County has decreased 36.3 percent since 2001 - 2003. Youth consumption, however, has increased. A greater perce ntage of McLean County residents participated in physical activity over the past month than the State of Illinois. The percentage of McLean County adults participating in regular exercise for six months decreased 20.3 percent from 2004 -2006 to 2007 -2009. McLean County's obesity rate is higher than the state and national rates and has more than doubled since 2001 -2003. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 40 f) Environment Physical Environment Air Poor air quality can lead to asthma, emphysema, lung cancer, congestive heart disease and other serious health conditions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Outdoor Air, 2013). The Air Quality Index is the national standard method for reporting air pollution leve ls to the general public . The Air Quality Index is based on the short -term feder al National Ambien t Air Quality Standards for the following criteria pollutants: ozone, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxid e. One air quality monitoring station is located in McLean County at Illinois State University 's Power Plant and monitors ozone and particulate matter . In 2013, this air quality station recorded an Air Quality Index of 0 -50, in the \"Good\" range , 74.9 percent of the time and an Air Quality Index of 51 -100, in the \"Moderate\" range, 25.1 percent of the time. In 2013, there were 25 percent more \"Good\" days than recorded in 2005. The American Lung Association assigns grades A -F to counties (A=1; B=2; C=3; D=4; F=5), based on the average annual number of days that ozone levels exceeded U.S. standards duri ng a three year measurement period . For the measurement period of 2011 -2013, McLean County received a D grade for its annual ozone air quality (see Exhibit 26). Using the same scale, McLean County received a B rating for the average number of day s particl e air pollution exceeded U.S. standards for the measurement period of 2010 -2012 (see Exhibit 26). Exhibit 26: McLean County Annual Ozone Air Quality and Particle Pollution, 2010 -2012 and 2011 -2013 Ozone Air Quality Particle Pollution Source: Healthy Communities Institute, American Lung Association, 2010 -2013 The nearest carbon monoxide monitoring site is located in Bondville, Illinois . According to this site, McLean County is estimated to produce 234.7 tons of carbon monoxide emissions per year. The state of Illinois produced 64,915 tons in 2013. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 3,656 pounds of recognized carcinogens were released into the air in McLean County during 2014. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 41 Water Illinois Department of Public Hea lth monitors the fluoride level of community water supplies. In order to protect the dental health of all citizens, community water supplies are required to adjust the fluoride level to between .9 -1.2 milligrams per liter (Ill. Compiled Statute, Act 40(7a )). Less than one percent (1,186 out of 133,230 residents on public water supply) of McLean County residents on community water supply receives water that does not meet the current standards for optimally fluoridated water (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention My Water's Fluoride) . McLean County exceeds the Healthy People 2020 goal of \"increasing the proportion of the U.S. population served by community water systems with opti mally fluoridated water to 79.6 percent\" with 99 percent of its population r eceiving optimally fluoridated water. Private water wells are tested on a yearly basis by the McLean County Health Department for Nitrate/Nitrite and Total Coliform/E -coli. In 2014, 40.7 percent of private water wells inspected by McLean County Health Depa rtment in 2014 were in violation . Radon Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). The average indoor radon level for homes in McLean County was 5.7 pCi/L in 2014, higher than state (4.9 pCi/L) and national (1.3 pCi/L) levels. Half of McLean County homes tested for radon had levels above 4pCi/L (Illinois Emergency Management Agency, 2014) . Currently, radon testing is not required to buy or sell a home in Illinois. McLean County has a radon task force. The goal of the task force is to educate the citizens of McLean County about the dangers of radon gas and strongly encourage residents to get their homes tested (Ecology Action Center, 2016) . Lead Exposure to lead can pose serious health risks for children, such as brain damage, slowed growth and development, behavioral issues and hearing and speech problems (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Lead, 2016 ). Of the children (aged 6 months to 5 years) tested at the McLean County Health Department in 2014, 2.24 percent had blood lead levels of five or higher. This is a 24 percent reduction from 2009 . 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 42 Exhibit 27 : Percentage of Children Tested wit h Blood Lead Levels Outside of Normal Limits, 2009 - 2014 Source: McLean County Health Department, 2014 Over half of owner -occupied and rental units in Bloomington (53 percent ) were built before 1980, and therefore have the potential to present lead b ased paint hazards. Roughly 33 percent of units built before 1980 house children. Renters in Bloomington are more likely to be exposed to Lead Based Paint Hazards as 60 percent of rental units were b uilt before 1980 compared to 49 percent of owner -occupied units. The Center s for Disease Control and Prevention recommends monitoring children with blood lead levels of five micrograms per deciliter or higher; however, the state of Illinois sets the monitoring level at 10 micrograms per deciliter or higher (City o f Bloomington Consolidated Plan, 2015 -2019) . Hazardous Waste From 1998 -2015, McLean County hosted nine household hazardous w aste events and collec ted 3,043 55-gallon drums of Household Hazardous Waste . Over this time, the amount of household hazardous waste collected has increased by 163 percent, from 189 55 -gallon drums in 1998 to 498 55 -gallon drums in 2015 (Ecology Action Center, 2015 ). Efforts to properly dispose of hazardous waste have grown in McLean County over the past decade. Built Environment Physical Activity According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, \"t he built environment describes physical or manmade features such as sidewalks, streetlights, traffic and parks that may promote or discourage activity. \" The built environment is important to consider when assessing physical activity as there is strong evidence suggesting an association between access to recreational resources, bikability and walkability of neighborhoods as well as safe, esthetically pleasing environments with increased phy sical activity and reduced obesity rates (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Built Environment and Physical Activity, 2007). 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 43 In McLean County, 78.2 percent of residents have access to exercise opportunities, meaning they live reasonably close to a park or re creational facility. McLean County falls in the best 50th percentile when compared to other U.S. counties for access to exercise opportunities despite the county's rural expanse (Healthy Communities Institute, County Health Rankings, 2015). According to t he U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Environment Atlas, 2012, there are .13 recreation and fitness centers per 1,000 population in McLean County, slightly more than the national average of .06 per 1,000 population (see Exhibit 28). Since 2008 , there has been a 30 percent increase in the number of recreation and fitness facilities in McLean County.

According to a survey conducted by the McLean County Regional Planning Commission , eight percent of respondents indicated using a bicycle as their mode of transportation for location -based trips. Respondents noted they would ride their bicycle more often if they felt safer on the streets, there were more on -road bike lanes and shared lane markings and there were more off -road trails. Bike Blono recently conducted a bicycle crash analysis, in which it discovered that 37 percent of bicycle crashes in McLean County occur when the cyclist was reported as located on the s idewalk immediately prior to the crash. Riding a bicycle on the sidewalk presents an 80 percent higher risk of a crash compared to riding on the road and obeying the same traffic laws as motorists (McLean County Bike Safety Bicycle Crash Analysis, 2014 -2015). Food S ecurity and Access to Health y Foods Food Insecurity The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines food insecurity as limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods or uncertain ability to acquire these foods in socially acceptable ways. The percentage of the population that experienced food insecurity in McLean County at some point during 2013 is 13.2 percent. This rate is in the best 0 -50th percentile range (green indicator) compared to other counties in the United Stat es. The percentage of children (under 18 years of age) living in households that experienced food insecurity at some point during 2013 is 18 percent (Healthy Communities Institute, Feeding America, 2013). 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 44 Grocery Store Density McLean County falls at the 50th percentile in comparison to other counties in the United States for grocery store density with .20 supermarkets and grocery stores per 1,000 in McLean County (Healthy Communities Institute , US Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Index, 2 012). Access to a Grocery Store for Low -income Adults Low a ccess is defined as living more than one mile from a supermarket or large grocery store if in an urban area and more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store if in a rural area. The percentage of low -income adults who do not have adequate access to a grocery store or supermarket in McLean County is 8.2 percent. McLean County is in the worst 50th to 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) for this measure when compared to other co unties in the United States (Healthy Communities Institute, US Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Index, 2010).

It is a progressive and irreversible disease where memory and cognitive abilities ar e slowly destroyed making it impossible to carry out even simple, daily tasks. Alzheimer's disease typically manifests after the age of 60. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Alzheimer's disease is the fifth leading cause of death among adults aged 65 and older. The Alzheimer's Association notes that the number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer's disease is estimat ed to reach 7.1 million by 2025, a 40 percent increase from the estimated 5 million age 65 and older currently affected by the disease.

Tuberculosis In 2015, McLean County had zero cases of active tuberculosis and 22 cases of latent tuberculosis. McLean County has not exceeded the Healthy People 2020 of one new case per 100,000 population for at least the past six years (Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2010 - 2015).

In any given year, approximately 13 million American adults have a serious ly debilitating mental illness. Furthermore, unstable mental health can lead to suicide, which accounts for the death of approximately 30,000 Americans every year (Healthy Communities Institute, 2016). Psychiatric visits were the second most common reason for patient visits to BroMenn Medical Center's emergency room in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and the fourth most common reason in 2011 (Advocate BroMenn Medical Center, Top ICD -9 Diagnosis, 2011 -2014). The number of psychiatric visits has increased 13.6 percent fr om 2011 (1,682 visits) to 2014 (1911 visits). BroMenn Medical Center has the only in -patient mental health unit in McLean County. This is one reason why St. Joseph Medical Center does not see similar numbers of patients due for psychiatric visits in their emergency room. From 2012 - 2014, psychiatric visits were the 19th most common reason for visits to St. Joseph Medical Center's emergency room (St. Joseph Medical Center, Top ICD -0 Diagnosis, 2012 -2014 ) with visits numbering 630, 652 and 704 in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. Although St. Joseph Medical Center had less psychiatric visits in their emergency room than BroMenn Medical Center, both hospitals saw the numbers increase every year.

The highest rates for age -adjusted emergency room visits due to adolescent suicide and self - inflicted injury occur in individuals 15 -17 years old, females and Whi te/non -Hispanic. The highest rates for age -adjusted emergency room visits due to pediatric mental health occur in 12 -14 and 15 -17 year olds, females and Black or African Americans. The highest rates for age -adjusted emergency room visits due to suicide and intentional self - inflicted injury occur in 25 -34 year olds, males and Blacks or African Americans. The highest rates for age -adjusted emergency room visits due to mental health occur in individuals 25 -34 years old, females and Blacks or African Americans. Ten percent of 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey respondents needed mental health counseling but were unable to access it. Oral Health A higher percentage of McLean County residents visit the dentist than the state, nation, and other comparative Illinois counties. Emergency Room visits due to oral health issues have declined since 2011. McLean County has fewer untreated dental caries in k indergarteners, second graders, and sixth graders than the Healthy People 2020 goals. Respiratory Disease Age-adjusted emergency room visits due to adult asthma are nearly double in 61701 and 498 percent higher f or Blacks or African -Americans than any other race or ethnicity. Age-adjusted emergency room visits due to pediatric asthma are 72.6 percent higher in Bloomington - 61701 and 285 percent higher f or Blacks or African Americans than any other race or ethnicity. Age-adjusted emergency room visits and hospitalizations due t o chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are more than double for Colfax compared to the rates for McLean County. McLean County has a higher percentage of Medicare beneficiaries being treated for asthma than other comparative counties in the United States. Upper respiratory infections and pneumonia/bronchitis were in the top 10 reasons for emergency room visits to both BroMenn Medical Center and St. Joseph Medical Center. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 80 h) Maternal and Child Health Pre- and Post -Natal Care Mothers Who Smoked During Pregnancy The percentage of births that were to mothers that smoked and/or used tobacco products during pregnancy in McLean County is 10.8 percent. Compared to other Illinois Counties, McLean County is in the best 0 -50th percentile range for this measure; however, this percentage is higher than the Health y People 2020 goal to \" decrease the percentage of women who gave birth and who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy to 1.4 percent\" (Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2008; Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Healthy People 2020, 2016 ). Breastfeeding Aggregate data is not available for breastfeeding rates for McLean County residents. However, in 2014, 82.9 percent of women w ho delivered at BroMenn Medical Center and 88.0 percent of women who delivered at St Joseph Medical Center initiated breastfeeding (Illinois Hospital Report Card , 2014 ). This percent has increased from previous years. Also, the breastfeeding rate for McLe an County Women, Infants and Children participants is 86 percent, a 96 percent increase since 2000 (McLean County Health Department Cornerstone System, 2014). These percentages within McLean County exceeded the state (77.4 percent) and national rate (79.2 percent) for breastfeeding initiation as well as the Healthy People 2020 target of 81.9 percent. Data is currently not available on average length of time mothe rs' are breastfeeding . Child Abuse and Neglect In 2015, 278 McLean County children were in state custody with the Illinois Department of Child and Family Services and the number has remained steady s ince 2010 (see Exhibit 69 ). Exhibit 69 : McLean County Children in Illinois Department of Child and Family Services' Care, 2010 - 2015 Source: Ill inois Department of Child and Family Services, 2010 -2015. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 81 McLean County's child abuse rate (number of children under the age of 18 that experienced abuse or neglect) is 9.4 cases per 1,000 children (2014). This rate is in the best 0 -50th percentile range w hen compared to other Illinois counties and has decreased 26.5 percent since 2011 (Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, 2014). Birth Characteristics Live Births In 2013, there were 2,140 live births in McLean County. The majorit y of births (64.6 percent) occurred to mothers between the ages of 25 and 34. Just over 75 percent of births were White, 11.2 percent were Black or African American, 5.8 percent were of Hispanic origin and 13.6 percent were \"other.\" The number of live births has remained relatively unchanged since 2009 (Illinois Department of Public Health Vital Statistics, 2009 -2013). Births to Teenage Mothers In 2013, there were eight births to teenage mothers ages 15 to 17 per 1,000 live births in Mc Lean County, which is lower than the state rate at 19.1 per 1,000 live births. For teenage mothers ages 18 to 19, there were 36 births per 1,000 live births in McLean County, also lower than Illinois' rate of 48 p er 1,000 live b irths. Exhibit 70 below show s the percentage of births to teenage mothers in McLean County has been decreasing over time but has remained consistently lower than th e state percentage (Illinois Department of Public Health Vital Statistics, 2007 -2013). Exhibit 70 : Percentage of Births to Teenage Mothers in McLean County, 2007 - 2013 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health Vital Statistics, 2007 - 2013. Method of Delivery In 2013, 38.8 percent of women who gave birth in McLean County had a cesarean section. This percentage is higher than Illinois (31.7 percent), the U.S. (32.7 percent) and the Health y People 2020 Goal of 23.9 percent and has increased 17.9 percent since 2009 (Illinois Department of Public Health 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 82 Vital St atistics, 2009 -2013).

This rate is in the worst 50th to 75th percentile when compared to other Illinois counties and higher than the Healthy People 2020 goal of six per 1,000 births. The number of infant deaths experienced in McLean County has increased since 2009 and remained higher than t he Illinois numbe r or total (see Exhibit 72 ). Exhibit 72 : Number of Infant Deaths per 1,000 live births, 2005 - 2012 Source: Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2005 - 2012 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 83 The leading causes of infant mortality in Illinois are short gestation or low birth weight, congenital malformations, newborn affected by maternal complications of pregnancy, newborn affected by complications of placenta, cord and membranes and Sudden Infa nt Death Syndrome (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2011). No data are available on the leading causes of infant mortality for McLean County. Low Birth Weight and Very Low Birth Weight In McLean County , 6.8 percent of the babies are considered to hav e low birth weight , which is in the best 0 -50th percentile range compared to other Illinois counties and exceeds the Health y People 2020 goal of 7.8 percent. In 2014, 0.38 percent of infants were born with very low birth weight at BroMenn Medical Center and 0.47 percent at St. Josep h Medical Center (see Exhibit 73 ). Both of these percentages are lower than the Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce very low birth weight to 1.4 percent of live births.

Congenital Anomalies McLean County ranks in the top 10 for three specific congenital anomaly prevalence rates: cardiovascular system defects, major genitourinary defects and major musculoskeletal defects. McLean County has the ninth highest prevalence rate in Illinois for card iovascular system defects at 206.5 defects per 10,000 live births, the ninth highest prevalence rate for major genitourinary defects at 74.9 defects per 10,000 live births and the third highest prevalence rate for major musculoskeletal defects at 22.8 defe cts per 10,000 live births (Illinois Department of Public Health Birth Defects and Other Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Illinois, 2005 - 2009). Key findings: Maternal and Child Health Breastfeeding initiation is higher in McLean County than the state, nati on, and Health y People 2020 goal. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 84 A higher percentage of women deliver by c -section in McLean Count y than in Illinois and the nation. McLean County has fewer preterm births and births to teenage mothers than other Illinois counties . McLean County's infant mortality rate is higher than Illinois' rate, the Healthy People 202 0 goal and falls in the worst 50th to 75th percentile compa red to other Illinois counties. McLean County ranks in the top 10 for three specific congenital anomaly prevalence rates: cardiovascular system defects, major genitourinary defects and major musculoskeletal defects. VI. Prioritization of Health -Related Issues a) Community Health Survey: Perceptions of Health Issues, Unhealthy Behaviors and Issues Impacting Quality of Life To aid in identifying the high priority health issues in McLean County, the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey asked respondents to report on their perceptions of the three most important health issues, unhealthy behaviors and factors that contribute to well -being in the community. Perceptions of Health Issues The 2015 McLean County Community Health S urvey asked respondents to rate the three most important health issues in the community out of 15 choices (see Exhibit 74 ). The health issue that rate d highest was mental health. It was identified 60 percent of the time and was significantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means. Mental health tended to be rated with higher importance by people who are White and with h igher education and income . Mental health was rated of lower importance by Blacks or African Americans . Mental health was followed by obesity and cancer. Obesity was rated of higher importance by people who are White, more educated and have a higher income . Obesity was rated of lower importance by people with Latino ethnicity. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 85 Exhibit 7 4: Survey Respondents' Perception of the Most Important Health Issues in McLean County , 2015 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 Perceptions of Unhealthy Behaviors Respondents were asked to select the three most important unhealthy behaviors in the community out of a total o f 10 choices (see Exhibit 75 ). The three unhealthy behaviors that rated highest were drug abuse, alcohol abuse and poor eating habits. Drug abuse was rated of higher importance by people who are younger, less educated and with lower incomes. Alcohol abuse was rated higher by people who are of lower income and homeless. Poor eating habits was rated higher by people with the following characteristics: men, Whites, higher income and higher education. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 86 Exhibit 75 : Survey Respondents' Perception of the Most Important Unhealthy Behaviors in the McLean County, 2015 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 Perceptions of Issues Impacting Quality of Life Respondents were asked to select the three most important issues impacting well -being in the community out of a total of 11 ch oices (see Exhibit 76 ). The issue impacting well -being that rated highest was job opportunities . Job opportunities was rated of higher importance by Blacks or African Americans and homeless individuals. Job opportunities was followed by access to health services and healthy food choices. Access to health services was rated higher by Whites and people who are older. Healthy food choices was rated higher by Whites and people with higher incomes. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 87 Exhibit 76 : Survey Respondents' Perception of the Most Important Factors Impacting Quality of Life in McLean County, 2015 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 b) Summary of Health Disparities When a health behavior or health outcome is seen to a greater or lesser extent between populations, it is considered a health disparity. Health disparities are often the result of social inequities related to geography, race or ethnicity, income, educational attainment, age, gender and other social factors (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion , Healthy People 2020, 2016) . This section highlights the key health disparities that emerged for McLean County. Geographic Disparities Individuals living in specific geographic areas of McLean County experience worse health outcomes than individuals liv ing in other geographic areas. The zip codes that were identified through Healthy Communities Institute's SocioNeeds Index as having the highest socioeconomic needs in McLean County (Bloomington - 61701, Stanford - 61774, Chenoa - 61726 and Colfax - 61728) were also the communities with higher emergency room visit rates and hospitalization rates for numerous health outcomes. The most significant geographic disparities are evident between Bloomington -61701 and M cLean County overall. Exhibit 77 below shows that emergency room visits due to alcohol, substance abuse, 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 88 mental health, hypertension, diabetes and adult asthma are higher for Bloomington - 61701 than the rates for McLean County overall. Hospitalization rates for diabetes, adult asthma, hypertension and alcohol abuse are also higher for Bloomington - 61701 than McLea n County overall (see Exhibit 78 ). Exhibit 77 : Age -adjusted Emergency Room Visit Rates per 10,000 Population in McLean County versus Bloomington - 61701, 2012 -2014 Source: Healthy Com munities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2012 -2014. Exhibit 78 : Age -adjusted Hospitalization Rates per 10,000 Population in McLean County versus Bloomington - 61701, 2012 -2014 Source: Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2012 -2014. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 89 The hospitalization rate due to heart failure is 166 percent higher in Stanford - 61774, and 46 percent higher in Chenoa - 61726, than the McLean County overall rate. Emergency room and hospitalization rates for COPD are 124 percent and 130 percent higher respectively in Colfax - 61728. Racial and Ethnic Disparities In McLean County, Blacks or African Americans visit the emergency room at higher rates than McLean County overall for almost all age -adjusted emergency room visit rates available through Healthy Communities Institute (se e Exhibit 79 ). Exhibit 79 : Age -adjusted Emergency Room Visits per 10,000 Population by Race in McLean County, 2012 -2014 Source: Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2012 -2014. According to the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey, Blacks or African Americans tend to report lower access to prescription medication and are more likely to be on Medicaid. Hispanics also experience health disparities as they tend to report less access to dental care and are less likely to report having a personal physician. Hispanics are more likely to be uninsured in McLean County (McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 ). Emergency room visits for hypertension are also 98 percent higher for Hispanics than the overall McLean County rate and 154 percent higher than the rate for Whites (Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2012 -2014). Other Disparities Many other social factors contribute to health disparities, such as age, gender, income level, educational attainment, and employment status. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 90 According to the 2015 McLean County Community Health Survey, individuals with a higher income tend to have privat e insurance, use a clinic or doctor's office more often and report ease of access to medical care, dental care and counseling. Individuals with lower incomes are less likely to seek medical care, report higher usage of the emergency department and experien ce more poor mental health days. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment tend to have private insurance and a personal physician and report ease of access to medical and dental care. Individuals with lower educational attainment report a higher frequency of smoking and/or vaping and are more likely to be obese (McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 ; Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2013). Younger people report higher usage of the emergency department and are les s likely to have insurance, whereas older people report higher usage of the clinic or doctor's office and ease of access to medical care (McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 ). Men are at a higher risk of acute/binge drinking but are more likely to exercise than women. Women report a higher frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption than men (Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2013; McLean County Community Health Survey, 2015 ). After analyzing the data and disparities in McLean County, it became apparent that disparities in McLean County were an important issue that needed to be taken into consideration throughout the prioritization process explained in detail below. c) Priority Setting Process In order to maximize the effectiven ess of the community health implementation plan that will result from this Community Health Needs Assessment, it is necessary for the health issues presented above to be prioritized and narrowed to a select few. By determining the most important health iss ues, it is hoped that more significant advances can be made in a shorter amount of time. The McLean County Community Health Council held its first meeting on April 27, 2015. A second meeting was held on June 1, 2015. The purpose of the first two meetings was to explain the collaborative nature of the 2016 community health needs assessment with BroMenn Medical Center, the McLean County Health Department, St. Joseph Medical Center and United Way in addition to the end goal of producing a joint community heal th plan for McLean County. The Executive Steering Committee of the McLean County Community Health Council , consisting of at least one leadership member from each organization listed above, met every other week from July - December, 2015 and weekly in Jan uary and February, 2016 to collect and analyze data to present to the McLean County Community Health Council for the prioritization of key health needs. The Executive Steering Committee analyzed all of the primary and secondary data presented in this report. Any issue that was identified as a potential health concern for McLean County was presented to the McLean County Community Health Council at the February 11, 2016 data sharing meeting. Although a standard prioritization methodology was not utilized at this stage in the process, the following factors were taken into consideration in the decision making process when analyzing the data: 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 91 Trending unfavorably overall Worse than state, national, and/or Healthy People 2020 goals Demonstrating significant local disparities The thirteen issues that rose to the top as potential health concerns for McLean County are listed below in alphabetical order: Alzheimer's and Dementia Birth Outcomes Cancer Cesarean Section Heart Disease Mental Health Obesity Oral Health Radon Respiratory Disease Sexually Transmitted Diseases Substance Abuse Violent Crime McLean County Community Health Council Data Sharing Meeting: February 11, 2016 After the Executive Steering Committee identified the health concerns for McLean County, the next steps in the prioritization process included the following: 1. Reviewing the data for the 13 health concerns with the McLean County Community Health Council; 2. Facilitating group discussion on the hea lth concerns presented ; and, 3. Voting by Council membe rs in attendance (see Appendix 4 for Top Six Issues Voting Ballot) to narrow down the 13 health concerns to six health concerns to prioritize via the Hanlon Method at the February 25, 2016 prioritization meeting. It is important to note that although it was not presented as one of the 13 health concerns, access to appropriate health care continually came up as an important issue during group discussion. The group decided that this would be added as one of the issues to be voted on in addition to the 13 issues presented. Additionally, council members were informed that they could combine any issues they felt were appropriate. For example, council members could vote for mental health or they could combine mental health and substance abuse and vote for behavioral health. Discussion also occurred during the meeting that diabetes, cancer and heart disease could all fall under obesity if selected as one of the six priorities to vote on because reducing obesity c ould positively impact the incidence of each of the above diseases. The results from the Top Six Issues Voting Ballot that would be prioritized at the next meeting 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 92 are as follows: Access to Appropriate Healthc are for the Underserved and Areas of High Socioeconomic Needs Behavioral Health (Mental Health and Substance Abuse) Birth Outcomes Obesity Oral Health Respiratory Disease McLean County Community Health Council Prioritization Meeting: February 25, 2016 The McLean County Community Health Council reached a consensus on the top six health issues to prioritize at the completion of the data sharing meeting on February 11, 2016. The goal of the next meeting was to apply a prioritiz ation method to the six health issues and select the top three health priorities obtained from the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment and around which the community health implementation plan will be developed . The Hanlon Method, developed by J.J. Hanlon, was the prioritization method utilized by the McLe an County Community Health Council to select the top three health priorities for McLean County. The Hanlon Method is a well -respected quantitative technique by the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Prioritization ratings are based on the size of the health problem, seriousness of the health problem and effectiveness of available inter ventions. As shown in Exhibit 80 , prioritization ratings are given on a scale of zero to 10. Exhibit 80 : Hanlon Method Criteria Rating Size of the Health Problem (% of population w/ health problem) Seriousness of the Health Problem Effectiveness of Available Interventions 9 or 10 >25% Very serious 80% - 100% effective 7 or 8 10% - 24.9% Relatively serious 60% - 80% effective 5 or 6 1% - 9.9% Serious 40% - 60% effective 3 or 4 0.1 % - 0.9% Moderately serious 20% - 40% effective 1 or 2 0.01% - 0.09% Relatively not serious 5% - 20% effective 0 <.01% Not serious <5% effective Source: National Association of City and County Health Officials, First Things First: Prioritizing Health Problems, 2009. The following guidelines helped determine the ratings for each criterion: 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 93 Size of the health problem or percent of the population with the health problem o The average size rating of numerous indicat ors for each health issue was calculated to arrive at an overall size rating . o The midpoint of the range for percent of population with a health problem was used to determine a single size rating per indicator . For example , .61 percent of the population visits the emergency room due to pediatric mental health . This percentage falls in the r ange of 0.1 percent to 0.9 percent for a size rating of three or four. The midpoint for this range is .5 percent. Since 0.61 percent is greater than the midpoint of 0.5 percent, it is given a size rating of four. Seriousness of the health problem; the following questions were taken into consideration when rating seriousness: o Does it require immediate attention? o Is there public demand to address the issue? o What is the e conomic impact? o What is the impact on quality of life? o Is there a high hospitalization and death rate? o Are there severe disparities associated with this issue? Is the issue more prevalent in certain populations or zip codes? Is the morbidity burden greater in certain populations? Are certain populations more likely to die of this condition? Effectiveness of available interventions McLean County Community Health Council members were provided with an explanation of the Hanlon Method from the National Association of County and C ity Health Officials (Appendix 5 ) to assist with rating the seriousness and effectiveness of each health problem. The size ratings were pre -populated by the Executive S teering Committee in the Hanlon Method Table and pro vided to the council (Appendix 6 ) to decrea se subjectivity. See Appendix 7 for specifics about each size rating estimation. To assist with rating the seriousness of the health problem and the effectiveness of available interventions, the Executive S teering Commit tee provided the McLean County Community Health Council with a summary handout o f health disparities (Appendix 8 ), examples of effective and evidenced -based interventions (Appendix 9 ) and the economic impact of the top s ix health priorities (Appendix 10 ). Once the six health problems had been rated by the Council members for all criteria, the 'PEARL' test was applied. The 'PEARL' test is used to screen out health problems based on the following feasibility factors: Propriety: Is the program for the health problem suitable? Economics: Does it make economic sense to address the problem? Are there economic consequences if a problem is not addressed? Acceptability: Will a community accept the program? Is it wanted? Resources: Is funding available or potentially available for a program? Legality: Do current laws allow program activities to be implemented? 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 94 If the answer to any of the questions above is no for any of the health problems, then it is eliminated as a choice for prioritization. The council did not an swer no to any questions for any of the six health problems. The next step in the process was to calculate the priority scores for each of the health problems. Exhibit 81 below illustrates the results of the scoring with behavioral health, access to appropriate healthcare for the underserved or in areas of high socioeconomic needs and obesity receiving the top scores. Exhibit 81 : Hanlon Method Prioritization Results Health Concern A B C D Size Seriousness Effectiveness of Interventions Priority Score (A+2B)C Behavioral Health 6.3 8.5 7.5 175.7 Acces s to Appropriate Healthcare for the Underserved and Areas of High Socioeconomic Needs 7.5 7.6 7.0 158.6 Obesity 7.6 8.1 6.5 153.8 Oral Health 6.8 6.9 7.2 148.4 Respiratory Disease 6 6.4 6.5 121.0 Birth Outcomes 5.2 5.7 6.5 106.9 d) Health Needs Selected As illustrated in Exhibit 81 above, Access to Appropriate Healthc are for the Underserved and Areas of High Socioeconomic Needs, Behavioral Health, and Obesity received the top three priority scores according to the Hanlon method calculations with scores of 175.7, 158.6 and 153.8. Oral health followed closely in third place with a score of 148.4. F ollowing a group discussion, the McLean County Community Health Council agreed to select the top three health priorities as the ones with the highest priority scores. They are listed below: Access to Appropriate Care for the Underserved and Areas of High Socioeconomic Needs Access to appropriate care for the underserved and areas of high socioeconomic needs was selected as a health priority by the McLean County Community Health Council not only because of its high priority score (158.6), but for several ot her reasons. Access to appropriate care is an important issue that affects many health outcomes. Improving access in certain areas and for certain populations can have a widespread impact on a variety of health outcomes ranging from oral health to behavior al health. Data 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 95 presented to the council also indicated that there are significant geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in McLean County that may be related to access to care. Research and subject matter expertise suggested that there are a variety of factors that can improve access to appropriate care ranging from increased hours of operation for urgent care clinics and primary care offices, transportation and education of both consumers and providers. Behavioral Health (Me ntal Health and Substance Abuse ) Behavioral health was selected as a health priority by the McLean County Community Health Council for several reasons. Behavioral health received the highest priority score (175.7) clearly indicating the need to further improvements in this area i n McLean County. In addition, there are numerous health disparities in Bloomington - 61701 and Normal - 61761 for both mental health and substance abuse. There is also a great deal of public support and momentum behind mental health in McLean County and has been for the last few years. McLean County is well situated to collaborate on mental health due to the on -going efforts of numerous organizations. Mental health was also previously selected as a key health priority by both hospitals and the health depa rtment during the previous community health needs assessments , giving further momentum to the efforts of improving mental health for county residents. Obesity Obesity was selected as one of the three top health priorities by the McLean County Community Hea lth Council because it ranked as number three according to its priority score of 153.8. Additionally, the council felt that by improving obesity, many other health outcomes such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes may also positively be impacted. It was also selected because obesity is a widespread issue affecting so many people and does not discriminate. There are also many significant efforts underway in the community related to obesity through the efforts of the McLean County Wellness Coalition. The health department and both hospitals are a part of the wellness coalition as are 28 other community organizations in McLean County. e) Health Needs Not Selected Birth Outcomes Birth outcomes was not selected as a health priority since it was rated sixth according to its priority score. Although the seriousness of the problem and the long term consequence were taken into consideration by the McLean County Community Hea lth Counci l, it was agreed that the three health issues selected were greater in both size and seriousness in McLean County. The council also felt that there are several positive efforts currently underway to improve birth outcomes. For example, there is a No Elect ive Inductions Less than 39 W eeks initiative with the March of Dimes and both hospitals. In addition , the McLean County Health Department has three program s available which promote healthy pregnancies and connect pregnant women to health and wellness serv ices: the All Our Kids Early Childhood Netwo rk, family case management and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 96 Oral Health There was some discussion in the prioritization meeting about selecting oral health as one of the three health priorities in place of one of the three highest priority scoring health concerns. Oral health ranked closely behind obesity (153.8) with a priority score of 148.4. Although oral health is deemed as an extremely important issue in McLea n County, the McLean County Community H ealth Council agreed to proceed with the three issues that received the highest priority scores. This is partially due to the efforts currently in place to assist individuals without dental insurance or Medicaid to receive care. For example, the McLean Co unty Health Department provides a dental clinic with intervention care for adults (no pregnant women) and preventive care and intervention for kids. Heartland Head Start coordinates referrals to dental care for kids six weeks to five years as well as pregn ant women . The America's Promise Project provide oral health education and onsite toothbrushing in schools and extraction clinics are held twice per year at a local oral surgeon's office. Respiratory Disease One of the reasons respiratory disease was not selected as one of the top three health priorities for McLean County was that it ranked fifth according to its priority score of 121 and the McLean County Community Health Council did not feel that there was a compelling reason to eliminate one of the heal th concerns that ranked in the top three. The council did discuss that improving access to appropriate health care may possibly also improve health outcomes for respiratory disease , particularly in areas of high socioeconomic needs. VII. Overview of Impleme ntation Plan Goals and Community Resources In April of 2016, three meetings were held with groups of community stakeholders , one around each of the prioritized health issues, to establish high -level outcome goals. Individuals and organizations with a particular stake in the health issue were invited to the meeting. Each meeting consisted of a review of the Community Health Ne eds Assessment process and data pertaining to the health issue. The attendees then discussed key takeaways and further explored additional contributing factors and current efforts in place to address the health issue. Next, the attendees utilized a goal -setting worksheet, which was informed by the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnership (MAPP) goal -setting process and can be found in Appendix 11 . a) Access to Appropriate Healthcare for the Underserved and Areas of High Socioeconomic Needs The Access to Appropriate Healthcare goal -setting meeting, held on April 12th, 2016, comprised of individuals from healthcare, transportation, city planning, social service organizations, and the faith - based community. Each brought a unique insight on access issues in McLean County, particularly related to residents living in 61701 and non -Whites. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 97 As access to appropriate healthcare had not been selected as a health priority as a result of previous community health needs assessment s and few efforts are curre ntly in place to address the issue, significant time was spent discussing barriers to accessing primary care and factors contributing to usage of emergency departments for non -emergent health conditions. Exhibit 82 below captures the discussion. Exhibit 8 2: Barriers to Accessing Primary Care in McLean County Barriers to Accessing Primary Care Insurance & Payment Some don't accept Medicaid and/or are not welcoming of Medicaid patients Require payment upfront Difficulty knowing who primary care provider is when insurance is restrictive or constantly changing Convenience Typically not open on nights and weekends Transportation to primary care facilities Knowledge & Awareness Patients not always aware of options outside of primary care options Not familiar with primary care provider or primary care setting Health Behaviors Low income population is focusing on meeting immediate needs rather than preventing health issues from occurring down the road; therefore, making and keeping PCP appointmen ts is low priority Lack of emphasis on prevention by patients, providers, and the community overall Lack of awareness of the connection between current behaviors and chronic disease The following outcome -driven goal was established as a result of the meeting: Access t o Appropriate Healthcare Goal : By 2020, decrease barriers to utilizing primary care in 61701 in order to reduce use of hospital emergency departments for non -emergent conditions. Barriers to accessing and utilizing primary care were mo st often cited as the reason for overutilization of hospital emergency departments for non -emergent conditions. Few coordinated efforts have been in place to address access to appropriate healthcare for the underserved and areas of high socioeconomic needs ; however, new opportunities have risen since the start of this community health needs assessment. The partners involved in the Executive Steering Committee and the City of Bloomington Community Development Division recently applied for and received an Inv est Health grant funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Reinvestment Fund. Through this grant, the Invest Health team will bring together disparate sectors of the community to identify and plan for built environment changes in Bloomington to incr ease access to healthcare and access to healthy foods. The Executive Steering Committee will be directly involved in the Invest Health initiative and continue to engage the stakeholders who attended this meeting and other key community partners that surfa ce to 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 98 establish specific objectives and interventions to decrease barriers to utilizing primar y care in 61701. See Appendix 12 and Appendix 13 for a complete list of community resources and stakeholders. b) Behavioral Health Unlike Access to Appropriate Healthcare, Behavioral Health (mental health, in particular) had been identified as a priority health issue in McLean County by the McLean County Health Department's 2012 - 2017 Community Health Improvement Plan , St. Joseph Medical Center's 2013 Community H ealth Needs Assessment and BroMenn Medical Center's 2011 -2013 Community Health Needs Assessment. In addition, the McLean County Board Executive Committee convened two workgroups in early 2014, one tasked to identify community mental health needs and one to identify best practices. The product of these workgroups was a comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan for McLean County. As a result of the abovementioned needs assessments and improvement plans, many task forces, committees, programs and efforts have b een underway to address the behavioral health needs in our community since 2012 . The Behavioral Health goal -setting meeting, held on April 26th, 2016, consisted of representatives from each of the active behavioral health groups as well as schools, law enf orcement, court services and mental health service providers. The following behavioral health groups were represented: Behavioral Health Coordinating Council Bloomington -Normal Community Campus Committee Crisis Planning Group Infant, Toddler and Preschool Mental Health IPLAN Mental Health Task Force McLean County Board Mental Health Advisory Board Mental Health First Aid Collaborative Mental Health in Schools Four major themes emerged from the goal -setting discussion: 1) the need for stigma reduction; 2) the need for coordination of current efforts and funding streams; 3) the need for coordination of behavioral health services; and, 4) the need to develop copin g skills as a prevention mechanism. As the Behavioral Health Coordinating Council will be exploring the coordination of current efforts and funding streams and other groups are already tackling the coordination of behavioral health services, the high -level goals were developed around stigma reduction and coping skills development. Behavioral Health Goal #1: By 2020, increase coping skills to reduce deaths due to suicide and ER visits due to self -inflicted injury and alcohol abuse. Increasing coping skills was identified as a mechanism to prevent mental health and substance abuse crises from occurring in the first place. Some local schools have social and emotional wellness programming that touches on developing life skills, includin g coping skills, but funding to continue and expand upon these programs is limited. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 99 The Executive Steering Committee will work collaboratively to engage local school districts, college campuses, mental health and substance abuse service providers and othe r social service organizations to identify specific objectives and interventions to increas e coping skills. See Appendix 12 and Appendix 13 for a complete list of community resources and stakeholders. Behavioral Health Goal #2: By 2020, reduce behavioral h ealth stigma to increase earlier access to care. Stigma around mental health and substance abuse was recognized as an issue in McLean County and in need of further interventions. Mental Health First Aid, an evidence -based training that helps people recogn ize signs and symptoms of mental illness and connect them with the appropriate care, was implemented in McLean County as a result of the hospital's and health department's previous community health implementation plans. By increasing awareness of mental he alth, the training redu ces stigma. Since May, 2014, 654 individuals have received Mental Health First Aid training and 9 individuals from McLean County have become trained to be a Mental Health First Aid trainer. One of the instructor trainers is from the McLean County Health Department and one is from BroMenn Medical Center. Additionally, Project Oz received a new grant, Ending the Silence, that aims to end stigmatization around behavioral health in junior and senior high schools. The Executive Steering Committee will capitalize upon existing efforts, such as Mental Health First Aid and Project Oz's Ending the Silence program, and continue to engage the key stakeholders involved in the Behavioral Health goal -setting meeting to establish specific objectives and interventions to reduce behavioral health stig ma. See Appendix 12 and Appendix 13 for a complete list of community resources and stakeholders. c) Obesity Obesity was also selected as a health priority in past community health needs assessments. In la te 2009, the McLean County Wellness Coalition was established to address the alarming rates of obesity in a collective and coordinated manner. The McLean County Wellness Coalition's mission is to make the healthy choice the easy choice by enacting policy, system, and environmental changes. Over 60 community stakeholders representing over 28 different community organizations are engaged in the McLean County Wellness Coalition and efforts to reduce obesity. The Obesity goal -setting meeting, held on April 28th, 2016, was conducted with the Leadership Committee of the McLean County Wellness Coalition as the coalition already engages many of the necessary stakeholders for addressing obesity. Individuals attending the meeting represented local hospitals, city and regional planning, universities, and local recreational businesses. The McLean County Wellness Coalition recently completed a strategic planning process through which specific objectives and strategies were identified to increase the number of people livi ng at a healthy body weight in McLean County. Rather than draft new goals, the following goal was developed to match the McLean County Wellness Coalition strategic plan: Obesity Goal : By 2020, pursue policy, system and environmental changes to maintain or increase the percentage of people living at a healthy body weight in McLean County. 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 100 Those attending the Obesity goal -setting meeting highlighted the importance of creating a culture of prevention in McLean County and doing so through policy, system and en vironmental changes. According to Tom Frieden's Health Impact Pyramid changing policies, systems and environments to make individuals' default decisions healthy is the second most effective intervention method, right behind directly ad dressing socioeconomi c factors (American Journal of Public Health, April 2010). Since conception, the McLean County Wellness Coalition has been enacting policy, system and environmental change to increase physical activity and increase consumption of healthy foods and beverages. For example, Veggie Oasis, a collaboration between West Bloomington Revitalization Project, Downtown Bloomington Farmers Market and the McLean County Wellness Coalition, gleans fresh produce from the farmers market and distributes it for free in West Bloomington. The coalition has also established multiple com munity gardens, worked with local businesses to create worksite wellness programs and policies, and encourage d use of alternative modes of transportation. Further, one of the focuses of the Invest Health initiative is to identify built environment changes to increase access to healthy foods. The Executive Steering Committee will be directly involved in the Invest Health initiative and will continue to work with the McLean County Wellness Coalition Leadership Committee to identify objectives and interventio ns that corroborate the coalition's strategic plan.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: Mental Health Each year, serious mental illness costs Americans $193 billion in lost earnings (American Journal of Psychiatry). Much of the economic burden of mental illness is not the cost of care, but the loss of income due to unemployment, expenses for social supports, and a range of indirect costs due to a chronic disability that begins early in life (NIH). Suicide costs society over $44.6 billion a year in combined medical and work loss costs. The average suicide costs $1,164,499 (CDC). Substance Abuse Alcohol abuse costs the U.S. $191.6 billion and drug abuse costs $151.4 billion (SAMSHA). Excessive alcohol consumption cost the U.S. $223.5 billion in 2006, or about $1.90 per drink . Binge drinking is 76% of the costs (CDC). BIRTH OUTCOMES: Premature birth costs the nation $26.2 billion each year (March of Dimes). Low birth weight & very low birth weight babies that survive the first year incur medical bills averaging $93,800 (Marc h of Dimes). An increase of 250 grams (about 1/2 pound) in birth weight saves an average of $12,000 to $16,000 in first year medical expenses. Prenatal interventions that result in a normal birth (over 2500 grams or 5.5 pounds) saves $59,700 in medical exp enses in the infant's first year (March of Dimes). OBESITY (Diabetes and Heart Disease): The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. was $147 billion in 2008 U.S. dollars (CDC). The medical costs for people who are obese were $1,429 higher than those of normal weight (CDC). Obesity costs the Illinois health care system and taxpayers nearly $3.4 billion per year (Illinois Alliance to Prevent Obesity). ORAL HEALTH The average cost of a Medicaid enrollee's inpatient hospital treatment f or dental problems is nearly 10 times more expensive than the cost of preventive care delivered in a dentist's office (PEW: A Costly Destination) Illinois children with poor oral health are almost three times more likely to miss school days due to pain tha n children with good oral health (Healthy Smiles, Healthy Growth report, 2013 - 2014). Nationally, employed adults lose more than 164 million hours of work each year due to oral health problems or dental visits (CDC). RESPIRATORY DISEASE: The yearly cost of asthma in the U.S. is around $56 billion . The direct costs make up almost $50.1 billion . Hospital stays are the largest part of that cost. Indirect costs make up $5.9 billion . This includes lost pay from sickness or death and lost work outpu t from missed school or work days (EPA). Nationally, children with asthma miss 2.48 more days of school each year than children without asthma. In 2010, COPD resulted in $49.9 billion in direct and indirect costs. Total costs incurred by COPD 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 124 patients are approximately $6000 higher than non-COPD patients (COPD Foundation) 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment 125 Appendix 11 McLean County Community Health Council (MCCHC) Meeting Type/Purpose: Small Group Meetings with Community Stakeholders to Set High Level Goals McLean County Health Department, Room 322 Tuesday, April 12th, 8:00 am - 10:00 am Goals: broad, long -term aims that define the desired result associated with identified strategic issues (patterns of action, decisions, policies that guide toward a goal); goals a nd strategies provide the connection between the current reality (what the health priority looks like now) and the vision (what we want it to look like in the future); goals set a common direction and an understanding of the anticipated end result; goal st atements come from two sources \u2014the vision and strategic issues; having clear goals provides focus for [later] strategy development. (Source: MAPP Process guidance) Key Questions to Assist with the Development of GOALS for Each Health Priority: 1. What do w e want to achieve when this health priority is resolved? (What is our vision?) 2. Which categories of needs assessment data for this health priority indicate a particular area of concern that needs addressin g or resolution? 3. Once a goal has been identified: Will we have the resources to identify potential strategies/interventions for achieving each goal?
