What you eat has a significant impact on how well your immune system functions. While no single food or vitamin supplement can prevent sickness, you can strengthen your body's natural defenses by eating foods rich in nutrients. This is even more important as you age and immune function begins to decline. Here are 15 boosts that can boost your immune system and help protect you from disease. 15 immune-boosting foods 1. Citrus fruits Citrus fruits are abundant in [vitamin C](https://www.medicinenet.com/ascorbic_acid-oral/article.htm), which acts as an antioxidant that helps your immune system produce more white blood cells to fight infection and disease. Citrus fruits that are good for immune-boosting include oranges, lemons, limes, kiwis, and grapefruit. 2. Red bell peppers Red bell peppers have 2-3 times more vitamin C than oranges ounce for ounce. They also contain beta-carotene, a potent antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating properties. To retain their nutritional value, try roasting or stir-frying them rather than steaming or boiling. 3. Sweet potatoes Sweet potatoes are rich in beta-carotene, which is converted to [vitamin A](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_a-oral/article.htm) in the body and can help strengthen the immune system. They are also highly versatile and easy to incorporate into your [diet](https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm). 4. Button mushrooms Along with the B [vitamins](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm), [niacin](https://www.medicinenet.com/niacin/article.htm), and riboflavin, button mushrooms are a great source of selenium.

Try cooking it as little as possible to keep more nutrients in the vegetable. 6. Dark leafy vegetables Kale, Swiss chard, and spinach are excellent immune-boosting foods that are rich in beta-carotene, folate, and vitamin C and K, which are essential for cell health. The more pigmentation a leafy green has, the more antioxidants it has. Try adding a variety of greens to your salads to give your body plenty of nutrients for optimal health. 7. Blueberries Blueberries are high in vitamin C and flavonoids, which function as antioxidants that shield you from cellular damage. To benefit from all the health advantages that blueberries offer, eat them fresh or frozen. 8. Acai berries The dark color of acai berries is an indication that it contains a high concentration of polyphenols called anthocyanin. Antioxidants like anthocyanin are important for cell repair and regeneration. Try these berries dried, combined with oats, or blended into smoothies. 9.
