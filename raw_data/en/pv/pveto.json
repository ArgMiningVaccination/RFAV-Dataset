The Biomedical Imaging programme is at the University of Turku a track in the larger ensemble of MSc programme in Biomedical Sciences which together provide the basic courses in transferable skills: languages, bioinformatics, and statistics. At \u00c5bo Akademi University the Biomedical imaging program is part of the Department of Biosciences (Cell biology) at the Faculty of Science and Engineering. Both Finnish and foreign students who have completed a lower university degree equivalent to a Finnish B.Sc. degree are welcome to apply for the programme. The education is given in English. The tuition fee is 12 000\u20ac/year for students applying outside the EU/EEA -area. Scholarships are available. No tuition fee for European students. The studies consist of mandatory courses in biology, physics, engineering, microscopic applications, image processing, multimedia and ethics. They aim to give the student the required basic knowledge in the field of biomedical imaging. Students can select elective courses from a variety of applicable topics according to their interests. Studies also include a Master's Thesis in one of the four specialization themes: - Light microscopy imaging - In vivo & Clinical Imaging - Imaging in Nanotechnology and Material Sciences - Microscopy techniques and instrument design See [Biomedical Imaging course structure ](https://studiehandboken.abo.fi/en/programme/15174)for detailed information about the mandatory and selectable courses. Application for academic year will be open 4.1. - 18.1.2022. The MSc Programme in Biomedical Imaging is jointly administered by Department of Biosciences at [\u00c5bo Akademi University](https://www.abo.fi/en/study-programme/masters-degree-programme-in-biomedical-imaging/) and the Faculty of Medicine at the [University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en/study-at-utu/masters-degree-programme-in-biomedical-sciences-biomedical-imaging). In order to increase the chances of being admitted, applicants are advised to apply to both Universities. The eligible applicants should have sufficient background knowledge in medical, biological and/or natural sciences, and they should have completed a lower university degree equivalent to a Finnish B.Sc. degree in the Life Sciences or in a relevant field (biomedical sciences, physics, engineering or chemistry). Applications for the programme are evaluated by the admission committee. The admission committee scores the applicants according to their background and selects maximum of 50 applicants for the interview round. No tuition fee for European students. The tuition fee is 12 000\u20ac/year for students applying outside the EU/EEA -area. Scholarships are available. APPLYING STEP-BY-STEP: 1.

Possibilities after graduation After the studies students can work in several fields in Finland or abroad. The students can select courses to support their own career goals. Some career paths of our graduates: - continue as postgraduate students to pursue career as scientist - work in imaging core facility - work in science administration nationally or internationally - work in hospital research laboratory - industry and industrial research - popular science projects Why to Choose Turku as your next city Education from the top of the world Finland is a Nordic welfare state where equality is the fundamental ideology behind education. International rankings agree with us, Finland is a great place to study. Finnish higher education consists of two complementary sectors: universities promoting research and academic education, and universities of applied sciences offering professional higher education with close ties to the working life. In Turku there is six higher education institutes. Accommodation Turku offers a wide range of housing options for students near the campuses and the centre. The price of housing is more student-friendly than in many other cities in Finland. [The Student Village Foundation of Turku (TYS](https://www.tys.fi/en/)) was founded by the Student Union of Turku University and it specially builds, renovates, maintains and rents apartments for students in the Turku area. TYS has around 7 300 apartment places and 19 housing locations. As these apartments are specially directed to students, the rent prices are affordable. All TYS apartment rents include water, electricity, Internet connection and sauna turns. Getting around is easy and cheap In Turku everything is close. Turku is a fantastic city for cycling. Distances from place to place are short and traffic design favours bikes. The vast majority of people who live in less than ten kilometers from the city center cycle on a daily basis to work and school. In addition, the movement is easy thanks to a comprehensive local transport. With the valid student card you will automatically get a discount of bus and train tickets in Finland. One month bus card for the whole Turku area costs 33\u20ac (for student) and it can be used unlimitedly. Student lunches As the university students you will have an opportunity to offered government-subsidised student lunches for \u20ac2.60, which usually includes the main dish, side salad, bread, water and a non-alcoholic drink (e.g. milk or juice). Students are expected to show a valid student card each time to get the student-priced lunch. You can find dozens of student cafeterias around the campus area. Freely available courses As a student of the University of Turku or \u00c5bo Akademi you have a right to take any courses provided by the universities freely. Both universities provide high quality education in English language in many fields of study. There is also a great possibility to study various languages in the university's language centre. Some limitations may occur with some of the practical courses where the amount of participants is more limited. Healthcare With a valid Finnish university student card you have the right to free [Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS](http://www.yths.fi/en)). The health services provided are general practitioners and specialists, nursing care and physiotherapy as well as x-ray and laboratory work. FSHS also provides assistance in managing yourself during your studies. FSHS mental health services include mental health counselling, psychotherapy and psychiatric care. Dental care is also included to FSHS and fees are from 16\u20ac to max. 30\u20ac. For the special care such as hospital care and some specialist services, students who have Turku as their place of residence have the right to municipal health care.
