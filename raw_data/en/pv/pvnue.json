The combination of herbs is masterfully designed as herbs chemically respond to one another and increase the bioavailability of the medicinal constituents of a given herb. Chinese Herbal Medicine treats the root cause of illness - the goal being to heal the existing problem instead of developing a dependency on the herbs. Herbal Medicine is potent and can be used as a stand-alone treatment or as a supplement to Acupuncture and/or Shiatsu. The word 'herbs' is a blanket term clinicians use to mean anything that has medical benefits that are either used topically or orally. My personal pharmacy contains about 200 herbs which consist of parts of plants, animals, bugs, rock, stones, and minerals. They are already decocted and in powdered form which dissolves in warm water. I work within the comfort of the client and am transparent about what each formula consists of; being mindful of any dietary restrictions or needs. Herbs are digested like food but overall give a more potent response to the body. Once the herbs are ingested, the bioavailable chemistry of the herbs is assimilated and directed to the correct area the body for treatment. It is recommended to take herbs 2x times daily on an empty stomach. Absolutely, but it is important to disclose all pharmaceutical's taken at the initial consultation so that the clinical can prevent any overlap or redundancy in your herbal treatment. Like Acupuncture, herbs can treat the same wide variety of ailments but more specifically everything that is listed on this website. "}
