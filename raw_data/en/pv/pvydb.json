This is how most chiropractors practice and they are usually great at what they do in this realm. It falls under the category of symptom relief and management care, also known as \"band-aid\" care. Neuro-Spinal Chiropractic At Premier Chiropractic, our focus is on Neuro-Spinal Correction. Picture your spine as the foundation of a building. If the foundation was off or shifted, would you expect the floors to creak, the walls to crack and the windows and doors to not close properly as a result? Now, you can spend time fixing the damages, but with the expectation that in a short period of time, the problems would have to be repaired again... and again. Neuro-Spinal Chiropractic looks for the underlying Neuro-Spinal Shift in the spine that might be causing your foundation to be off. In the vast majority of cases that make their way to our practice is a significant Neuro-Spinal Shift. These Neuro-Spinal Shifts are the underlying causes that often reveal themselves as \"symptoms\" - or what we refer to as secondary conditions. Get back to normal. Rather than constantly repairing damage, at Premier Chiropractic, we focus on finding the underlying Neuro-Spinal Shift and help you reach normal structure. Keep in mind that our services are not for everyone. However, if you are tired of constantly patching the problem and you are looking for a long-term solution that you can both see and feel for yourself, then Premier Chiropractic may be the right place for you.
