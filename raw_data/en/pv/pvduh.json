Dr. Christopher K. Daugherty of the University of Chicago and his team, as reported in the Journal ofClinical Oncology, surveyed 212 patients with advanced cancer who had recently consented to participate in phaseI trials. All of the patients were interviewed about a weekbefore the trial began. Thirty-four percent said they used some type of biologically based alternative medicine, such as an herbaldrug, a supplement, vitamins, or minerals. About half usedherbal drugs, and about half said they used vitamins orminerals. The patients who reported alternative medicine use were younger, with an average age of 55 years comparedwith an average age of 62 years among those who didn'treport using these medicines. Study participants who said they believed they would die within the year were also more likely to report usingalternative medicines. Source: Journal of Clinical Oncology, www.jco.org New study says 22% use massage or chiropractic A new study that mirrors results of a 2002 survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control shows that 22 percent of Americans use massage or chiropractic as apreferred form of alternative therapy. The survey did notbreak out the use of chiropractic specifically. The study, conducted by Thomson Medstat, surveyed 23,000 households. It found that alternative medicine isnot a passing fad, but is used regularly to treat everythingfrom lower back pain to diabetes. Among the findings: More than 37 percent of households use some form of alternative medicine; Alternative medicine use is most prevalent among those with incomes of more than $100,000 per year andthose with post-graduate college degrees; About 42 percent of respondents said insurance covers at least part of their treatments; Nearly two-thirds discuss alternative treatments with their MDs; The most common reason for using alternative treatment is to promote general wellness; Herbals supplements and massage and chiropractic care are the most common types of alternative medicine. People in the 35- to 64-year-old age group led the packof users, with 40.3 percent opting for alternative medicine in the past year. These individuals most often sought carefor general wellness (40.8 percent), although 32.5 percentused alternative medicine to treat an illness and 10.2percent to supplement traditional care. The top three conditions treated by alternative medicine were irritable bowel (46.6 percent), lower back(45.9 percent), and skin problems (44.7 percent). Almost 50 percent of users have an income of more than $100,000 and have post-graduate education.

Green, Esq. STUDENT DC. COM Find your .CHIROECO .COM VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007 Nutritional supplementation made headlines in the popular press at the beginning of this year. Those headlines might have scared your patients. The first story was a controversial two-part series run by the CBS Evening News with Katie Couric. The series was based on the book, Natural Causes: Death, Lies and Politics in American's Vitamin and Herbal Supplement Industry, written by investigative reporterDan Hurley. Hurley's book purports that more than 1.6 million people have reported adverse reactions to vitamins,herbs, and other dietary supplements since 1983. The second story was published the day after the CBS story (possibly as \"catch-up\" journalism), onMSNBC.com, Yahoo News, and other news sources.MSNBC's article was headlined, \"A vitamin a day maydo more harm than good.\" The story cited a Consumerlab.com report on the quality of 21 brands of multivitamins. Only 10 of the vitamins tested by independent laboratories met the stated claims on theirlabels or satisfied other quality standards. If ever there has been an opportunity to talk with your patients about the benefit of physician-grade supplements, those two news stories provided it. Ihope you took advantage of them to educate your patients. If you run a nutrition chiropractic practice, those stories also offered an opportunity to present yourself as an expert to the press. Although each of thestories garnered opposing viewpoints from nationally recognized experts, themedia like to add a local flavor to these types of news stories. As much as we would like to think that assaults on nutritional supplements and chiropractic are things of the past, we know better. Therefore, now is thetime to cultivate those relationships with the press and to have at handinformation you can use to educate the media as well as your patients. In this issue, we asked the manufacturers of physician-grade supplements to offer their advice on how to use negative news to your (and your patients')benefit. I hope you'll take to heart what they have to say. We also offer our annual roundup of new and improved nutritional supplements, as well as other information to help you in your nutritionchiropractic practice.

WoodCover StoryCHEC4p18.ps 2/20/07 4:28 PM Page 18VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 19CONTINUED Many Americans take over-the- counter (OTC) vitaminsupplements in an attempt to fulfill their daily nutritional needs. A new study, however, shows somevitamins do not help those nutritionalneeds, and might even be detrimental to your health. ConsumerLabs, a leading provider of independent test results and information to help educate consumers and healthcare professionals, performed a random test of 32popular OTC vitamin supplements. Among thoseproducts selected, only 10 met their claims and otherquality standards. ConsumerLabs found: A women's multivitamin was contaminated with 15.3 micrograms of lead per daily serving; A children's vitamin contained 216 percent of its labeled amount of vitamin A; Three multivitamins \u2014 one for women, one for men and one for seniors \u2014 did not fully break apart(disintegrate); and One multivitamin contained none of its claimed vitamin A. ConsumerLabs looked at one lot from each of the 32 supplements. When Matt Lauer of NBC's Today Showasked if this was reliable testing ConsumerLabs' presidentDr. Tod Cooperman defended the amount of supplementschosen. \"No lot should ever be bad when it comes to vitamins,\" Cooperman said. \"Ideally, you'd like to look at every lotavailable. We decided to look at one individual lot [ofeach supplement] instead, and examine it very carefully.\" After the release of the study, media outlets began running with the story. One news agency chose theheadline, \"A vitamin a day might do more harm than good.\" Andrew Halpner, vice president of product development and technical services at DouglasLaboratories, a physician-grade supplement manufacturer,challenges this type of sensationalistic reporting. \"This headline is exactly the type of sensational reporting that helps to keep a cloud of suspicion over thedietary supplement industry,\" Halpner said. \"A productthat is reported to contain only 80 percent of a claimedamount of a nutrient is reason for further investigation,but to brand the entire category of dietary supplements aspotentially harmful is simply poor reporting.\" Physician-grade supplements were not part of the study. Are these supplements better? Chiropractic Economics spoke with several other manufacturers of physician-gradeto find out. The individuals questioned were Halpner;Jennifer Cherry, president of Nutraceutics; Allan Wilson,national manager at MatthewArmstrong, vice president of A.C. Grace Company; AnnHolden, vice president of quality control, and DavidBarnes, PhD, director of research, both with StandardProcess; and Richard Drucker, CEO of Drucker Labs. WHY ARE PHYSICIAN-GRADE SUPPLEMENTS BETTER? The term \"physician grade\" refers to professional market supplements available only to and marketed exclusively to doctors. \"It is in the [supplement] manufacturer's best interest to ensure that their products conform to all labelingrequirements, that all ingredients are present as labeledand that products do not contain deleterious materials,\"says David Barnes of Standard Process. \"We expect to beheld to a higher standard.\" Several of the people questioned identify the fact that professional market supplements are held to highaccountability statistics, and are tied directly to the resultsthey provide. \"When companies provide products to a doctor, they know the results will be monitored. If the product doesnot do what it should, the doctor stops using it,\" saysAllan Wilson of Anabolic Laboratories. \"That feedbackloop does not exist only in the consumer market, and alsoacts as a quality gauge. To survive in the 'physician only'market, a supplement company must provide productsthat yield consistent results.\" Jennifer Cherry of Nutraceutics adds the educational access doctors have with physician grade supplementshelp as well. \"Companies specializing in the physicianmarket have better educational tools for the doctor. Wehave trained and qualified employees to answer anyquestion or concern that may come our way,\" Cherry says. \"We know about drug interactions and contraindications. We know about the conditions we are nutritionallysupporting. We know the science inside and out.\"Recent news stories reported serious quality problems ofOTC vitamins. Were you ableto answer your patients'questions ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007WHAT ABOUT QUALITY CONTROLS? According to Ann Holden of Standard Process, the law requires the same level of quality control for both physician-grade and consumer OTC markets. \"Productswhich do not contain the ingredients at the levelsindicated (within a specified margin of error) are inviolation of the law,\" Holden says. \"Some ingredients maybe produced to a certain set of standards such as theUnited States Pharmacopoeia (USP), however suchstandards are not available for all ingredients.\" \"[Companies specializing in physician-grade supplements] have worked very hard to gain the trust andconfidence of physicians and for our sterling reputationsin the industry,\" Cherry adds. \"There is no way we wouldjeopardize this by putting out an inferior, low-quality,contaminated product. It would just never happen.\" IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN OTC SUPPLEMENTS? \"It's not really a question of physician-grade vs. OTC; rather it's about substituting fake vs. real nutrition,\" saysRichard Drucker of Drucker Labs. \"Many OTCsupplements use synthetic chemical nutrients (as opposedto natural and organic sources) because they are muchcheaper to manufacture, and putting a vitamin into amega-drugstore is all about profit margins.\" Matthew Armstrong of A.C. Grace Company says it comes down to quality. Armstrong believes raw materialshave to be checked and double-checked, and companieshave to perform independent assays to verify potency,among other things. Physician-grade supplements, according to Wilson, areformulated with a specific result in mind. They are notintended for a person to use over the counter, as theyoften have very high amounts of particular actives to helpthe doctor manage a case. \"These products are designed tobe part of a protocol,\" Wilson says. \"Consumer productsare designed for maximum sales and profit impact.\" WHAT ABOUT STATED LABEL CLAIMS? Governed by FDA, DSHEA, and FTC, all supplements must meet stated claims and not make unsubstantiatedhealth claims. According to Wilson, standardizing naturalproducts is a real challenge, and the only way to guaranteepotency is to test the product. It is very difficult, especiallywhen premium natural materials are used \u2014 which istypical of physician-grade products. Wilson has a great illustrative example of this question. \"Using a multivitamin image, let's picture a box that is 12feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. You could probably fita car in it. Now you have that whole box filled with powder(all the multivitamin ingredients) and you're blending it. \"Time to add selenium \u2014 which you could fit in a soup bowl. You open the box and dump it in, but how can yoube sure that tiny bit of selenium is going to blend evenlyin that huge box so that when you make tablets, you havethe 200 mcg of selenium present \u2014 no less and certainlyno more \u2014 in the thousands of tablets you're making?The only way to know is to test for selenium. Test theblend, test the tablets.\" A quality company ensures the label meets the claim by assaying the finished product before it is released for sale CONTINUED The \"contaminated vitamins\" story may have raised concerns among your patients about the safety and value oftaking nutritional supplements. Evenif your patients do not bring up thenews stories, you can use the badnews as an opportunity to talk toyour patients about the benefits oftaking the proper supplements \u2014physician-grade. \"This type of information is a strong reason to have apatient/clinician partnership whenusing nutrition as a tool in healthpromotion and for clinicians to dotheir due diligence,\" Holden says.\"High quality companies who havebeen in the marketplace for many years are good resources. This typeof information should promptclinicians to ask good questions ofthe companies selling themproducts.\" \"DCs must first make their own value judgment. Their educationqualifies them uniquely to educatetheir patients and the endconsumers on propersupplementation,\" Drucker adds. \"They are qualified from both nutritional and long-term wellness.It is incumbent upon them torecommend the proper choices fortheir patients. Carrying good qualityproducts in their offices is a servicethey should provide,\" says Drucker. To Wilson, the solution is quite simple. \"DCs need to have that[MSNBC] article in the waiting room,bulletin board, or treatment room.Answer questions with any variationof these: 'We offer products that areonly available to doctors, and these products are made in a regulatedpharmaceutical facility, so articles likethis do not apply, as these aremanufactured to a different standard. \"'It is guaranteed that what is on the label is in the product. You won'tfind these items at the grocery store,and we have seen consistent resultswith these products for decades.' \"The cornerstone of exclusive products is they are only availablefrom the doctor, and they are partof the patient's ongoinghealthcare,\" he adds. Turn bad Page 20CIRCLE 232FREE Story HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007to the general public, says Cherry. \"All ingredients stated on the labelmust be assayed to ensure that thefinished product meets label claim.\" HOW IS CONTAMINATION AVOIDED? Sealed production rooms, documented cleaning procedures, and a whole host of controls must be putin place to insure purity in apharmaceutical plant, according toWilson. \"Think about a grill at the restaurant \u2014 the cook puts down aburger, it gets moved, and down goes some chicken, then a steak, then some shrimp. If a little juice fromanother food mixes in, no problem,\"Wilson says. \"But if you are dealingwith controlled substances, thencontamination becomes a federaloffense.\" Cherry says raw materials need to be tested for purity and identity,microbial contamination, andenvironmental toxins such as lead.\"As a doctor, I would insist the brandI recommend has this [testing]information available. I would ask forthis documentation on the lot numberI was selling. Some companies will doit one time on one batch or lotnumber and then claim it to be truefor a different batch or lot number.\"HOW IS DISINTEGRATION TESTED? According to Wilson, tablet samples must be taken regularly during production and tested forhardness, thickness, weight, andfriability, versus a set specification forthat product. \"If the product iscompressed too hard, then it isbasically a rock, and it will never passdisintegration testing,\" Wilson says. \"Physician-grade per se doesn't mean they dissolve faster or better;rather, companies selling in thismarket have a high likelihood ofconducting the appropriate diligence and reject products which don't meet their specifications,\" Barnes says. A simple laboratory disintegration test may not tell the whole story, saysCherry. \"Factors such as the pH andamount of gastric juices in a person'sgut come into play,\" Cherry says. HOW TO CHOOSE AMONG PHYSICIAN-GRADE PRODUCTS? Holden believes the answer lies in the QC documentation of the supple- ment providers. \"Clinicians mayrequest that supplement companiesdocument quality control proceduressuch as how much testing is conductedand by whom and who inspects theirmanufacturing facility,\" ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007\"Other considerations might include how long they have been in business, whether they have theirown manufacturing facility (andtherefore have more control) or haveproduct manufactured for them, andwhether they produce any of theirown raw ingredients.\" Wilson says quality-control testing of incoming materials is important ina pharmaceutical company such ashis. \"If a pharmaceutical companydoes something wrong, penalties couldinclude prison time for all involvedemployees \u2014 quite a significantincrease over a 'cease and desist' letterand possible fine by the FTC.\" Cherry believes that if you are a chiropractor, your reputation is atstake whenever you are dealing withsupplements and other means ofpatient wellness. \"Everyday I see new companies entering the physician market. It isactually quite scary, because many ofthese companies are not offeringquality education and products. Howis the doctor supposed to know what'sgoing on?\" Cherry says. \"If there is a new company that you are interested in, ask questionssuch as, 'Do you have PhDs on staff?Do you have pharmacologists onstaff? Can I see your assays?' Ask hardquestions. If you do not get theanswers you are looking for, run! Thisis your reputation on the line.\" John V.

Many of those unsuspecting patients may have something in common \u2014 gluten sensitivity, a little known systemic autoimmune disorder that masquerades as othermedical conditions. Most people have heard the word gluten only in context with baking, as in \"kneading dough to developthe gluten.\" Gluten is the protein in wheat (and in barleyand rye) that makes the dough sticky. Unfortunately, this chewy protein that makes bagelstaste so good is poison to a significant portion of thepopulation \u2014 possibly up to an estimated 29 percent ofAmericans. 1When these individuals eat anything with gluten in it, their immune system reacts. Medical doctors have known for more than 50 years that gluten was the cause of celiac disease (CD). Until recently,they suspected that CD was a rare disorder. In 2003,researchers at the University of Maryland conducted anextensive survey of more than 13,000 people and foundthat 1 out of 133 people in the general population has CD. 2 But far more are gluten-sensitive. Think of it this way: CD is the \"extreme condition\" of gluten sensitivity, and itis only one manifestation of gluten sensitivity. (See sidebar, \"The gluten-sensitivity masquerade.\") Doctors only diagnoseCD if the villi in the small intestine are flattened, whichonly occurs in extreme cases. People can be gluten-sensitive but not have CD; all patients who have CD are gluten-sensitive. Your patients (and perhaps you) may have a low level of gluten sensitivity without identifiable and easilyRecognize the grain danger! How to make your patients safe from gluten By Shari Lieberman, PhD, CNS, FACN CONTINUED HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007recognizable symptoms or with symptoms so mild that you do not payattention to them. Feeling less than100 percent may have become\"normal.\" Blood tests that are used to identify CD generally do not pick up glutensensitivity unless the patient has full-blown CD. And even with full-blownCD, it is missed at least 30 percent ofthe time, which is one reason somany cases go undiagnosed. Special saliva or stool testing can definitively identify individuals whoare gluten-sensitive. Genetic testingcan identify those who have a highprobability of acquiring glutensensitivity. (People can acquire thiscondition over time, after use ofantibiotics, or even after an onset ofan illness.) Once a person becomes gluten- sensitive, there is no going back.And, there is no medical solution.The only solution is a strict gluten-free diet \u2014 no wheat, barley, or rye inany form. Some patients whosesensitivity is relatively minor may beable to \"cheat\" and eat a smallamount of gluten occasionally.Others, however, will find they haveno tolerance to gluten at all. A gluten-free diet is also an excellent way to find out if a person isgluten-sensitive. If you suspect glutensensitivity, put him or her on a gluten-free diet for at least two weeks. If thecondition improves, the individual isgluten-sensitive. If the conditionremains, the patient has lost nothing. WHAT TO DO If you suspect a patient may be gluten-sensitive: 1. Discuss gluten sensitivity with him. Explain what it is, how it may be manifested, what the solutionis, and how his quality of life wouldimprove, should the gluten-sensitivityprove true. 2. Put her on a gluten-free diet. This requires the patient to eliminateeverything with gluten in it. She mustThe gluten-sensitivity masquerade Gluten sensitivity, a systemic autoimmune disorder, is a chameleon-like disease. It can develop in many different, unsuspected ways. The condition's ability to hide behind a variety of symptoms makes it difficultto diagnose correctly. Without the correct diagnosis, medical doctors oftenprescribe harsh pharmaceuticals that often cause even more complicatingproblems than the original disease. Gluten sensitivity's masquerade includes a number of conditions that Skin diseases. These include dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis, eczema, acne, and hives; Neurological disorders. These include ataxia, severe headaches, and behavioral problems, including attention deficit disorder and autism; Other autoimmune diseases. These conditions include lupus, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, scleroderma, thyroid disease, osteoporosis, osteopenia,rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis; Digestive disorders. These conditions include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), irritable bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, Undiagnosed diseases and conditions. Under these categories are catch-all conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia,unexplained weight loss or gain, anemia, chronic infection, and asthma. Supplementing a gluten-free diet When you put your patients on a gluten-free diet, help them get well faster by recommending a number of different supplements. Thesesupplements should be taken in three stages. STAGE 1 These supplements provide all the multinutrients and major antioxidants the body requires: Multivitamins; Fish oil (approximately two to three grams); and Coenzyme Q10 (100 to 200 mg per day). STAGE 2 Continue stage 1 supplementation and after two or three weeks, recommend additional supplements: Vitamin C (1,000 to 4,000 mg, buffered and nonacidic), and Quercetin (500 to 2,000 mg). STAGE 3 At least one month into the gluten-free diet, advise your patients to begin the third stage of supplementation, which aids in the restoration ofthe intestine: Acidophilus and other beneficial microorganisms (L. casei GG, one or two capsules daily; S. boulardii, 500 mg each day); Glutamine (500 to 3,000 mg of L-glutamine); Phosphatidylcholine (for collagen deposition and stricture formation, 100 to 300 mg daily); Fiber (one or two tablespoons of fiber supplement); and Other anti-inflammatories (as needed).

Consequently, whenever they eat wheat, barley, or rye in any form and in any amount (not necessarily a sliceof bread or a piece of cake!), their body reacts to the gluten and interpretsit to be antigen. The gluten fails to be broken down and passes into the bloodstream, where the body forms antibodies to combat it. These antibodies, whichreside in the intestine as long as the villi are functioning properly, may beanti-endomysial antibodies, antigliadin IgA antibodies, or anti-tissuetransglutaminate antibodies. These antibodies try to defend the body against the invader gluten. The overreaction of antibodies to gluten may cause immune reactivity,autoimmunity, and inflammation.go through her pantry, freezer, and refrigerator to check labels for glutenby looking for the words wheat,barley, or rye. (Note: Malt, used forflavoring in cereals, among otherfoods, is made from barley. Hence,products using malt have gluten.) 3. Tell him to go easy on the veggies. If your patient has gastrointestinal problems, he may notbe able to tolerate salads or raw or aldente vegetables initially, because ofgastrointestinal inflammation.Introduce these vegetables slowly andjudiciously. 4. Drink water. She should stay away from carbonated drinks. Theymay cause gas. 5. Recommend supplements. Dietary supplementation gives recoverya boost. Advise your patient to usesupplements in three stages. (See side- bar, \"Supplementing a gluten-free diet.\") Some patients may balk at the prospect of giving up wheat. Theythink it is the end of the world \u2014that they can no longer eat the foodsthey enjoy. Nothing can be fartherfrom the truth. Gluten-sensitive people have to change their lifestyles to a degree, butthey can enjoy gluten-free versions ofalmost everything they like in thegluten variety.

Fine, MD, \"Early Not-at-Risk Groups inthe United States,\" Archives of .COM VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007What is the best way to determine the nutritionalsupplementation products that will benefit your patients? If you practice evidence-based healthcare, you must be able to utilize the best and most current evidence and integrate your individual clinical expertise into thepractice, while considering each patient's individual needs(Table 1), because scientificevidence alone is notsufficient to make a clinicaldecision. Clinicians have routinely found value in manynutritional productsindependent of strongscientific evidence. Treating patients also requires consideration of thebenefits and risks to thepatient, the patient's values,the level of convenience,and the costs associated with the treatment. 1 Consider this example: You are interested in prescribing glucosamine/chondroitin supplements for patientspresenting with osteoarthritis. Where do you begin? 1. Define the problem. A common problem-solving tool used in evidence-based healthcare is a PICO(Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes)worksheet. 2This worksheet can guide you through the information-seeking process. In our example, the PICO would look like this: P (patient/problem): In patients presenting with osteoarthritis how well doesI (intervention/exposure): glucosamin/chondroitinO (outcome): improve symptoms? In this case, there isn't a (C) comparison ( For example: How well does glucosamine/chondroitin improvesymptoms compared to NSAIDs?), but there could be, ifthat is the information you are seeking. 2. Review the literature. Now that you have identified your problem you can begin a literature search. Locating useful information can be a daunting process since evidence is abundant and is being published daily. Searching throughevidence-based, systematicreviews is the most efficientway to conduct a literaturesearch in evidence-basedpractice and there are avariety of online resourcesthat provide thisinformation (Table 2). 3. Consider the evidence. Another important consideration isan understanding of thestrength of the evidence that is presented in these reviews in order to criticallyappraise them (Table 3). The gold standard in research is the randomized control trial (RCT). These experiments randomly assign humansubjects to two or more treatment groups and outcomes ofthese groups are compared. Findings from RCTs providethe strongest evidence for understanding howinterventions affect subjects at the population level. RCTs do not, however, provide strong information about how an intervention will affect an individual,which is why it is important to consider each patientTable 1: Key practices in evidence-based healthcare Find the best evidence to answer your questions Critically evaluate the evidence for its validity and usefulness; Draw from your clinical expertise; Consider individual patient needs; Determine how to apply research review findings in your clinical practice; Treat your patient; and Evaluate the outcome.

Observational studies measure health outcomes in a certain patient population and provide weakerempirical evidence than the RCT,because unlike RCTs, observationalstudies are not controlled, therebymaking them subject to confoundingfactors and bias. Clinical observations provide the weakest evidence for understandingeffects on a population, but in clinicalpractice, they can provide a lot ofvalue in treating individual cases. With reference to the example introduced earlier, a review of theliterature reveals that the evidenceon glucosamine as an intervention forosteoarthritis is mixed: High qualitystudies demonstrated thatglucosamine improves pain more thanplacebo using one type of pain scale,but not using a different scale. 3 Meta-analyses of clinical trials on chondroitin for osteoarthritis4and glucosamine and chondroitin for kneeosteoarthritis 5found that chondroitin improved pain andfunction compared to placebo. 6 The Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT)provides the most current evidenceon the effects of a combinedglucosamine/chondroitin supplementon knee osteoarthritis. Findingsdemonstrated that 79 percent ofsubjects with moderate to severe painhad a 20 percent or greater reductionin pain when taking the supplement,compared to those taking theplacebo; however, for those subjectswith mild pain, no statisticallysignificant effects were observed. 7 4. Apply your findings. Now that you have the findings, how can theybe applied in the clinical setting? As indicated earlier, it is important to make use of your clinical expertiseand consider individual patient needswhen determining whether or not youwill prescribe a given intervention. For example: If the patient presents with knee osteoarthritis, has recentlyexperienced moderate to severe pain,cannot tolerate NSAID treatment dueto gastrointestinal side-effects, is seekingan alternative to taking NSAIDS forpain, and you have treated a similar casewith successful results, perhaps this is theright clinical presentation for prescribingthe glucosamine/chondroitinsupplement (along with other successful,evidence-based interventions such asexercise or weight control measures). 5. Discuss the treatment plan. Your next challenge is to discuss thetreatment plan and its underlyingfoundations with your patient. Youneed to translate the research so thatthe patient will understand it. In evidence-based practice, communicating research findings topatients can be an effective way ofdeveloping cooperative partnershipswith your patients so that togetheryou can make sound clinicaldecisions. Communicating thisevidence, however, is not always easy,considering there is great variationamong patients in terms of theirability to understand information andmake informed healthcare decisions. Research suggests, though, that informed and involved patients aremore likely to participate in theircare, which leads to better healthoutcomes. 8, 9, 10 Using our example, one way to communicate the scientific evidenceon glucosamine/chondroitin might bethe following: \"Much research has been conducted separately on the use of glucosamineand chondroitin for osteoarthritis. Theresults are unclear for glucosamine;however, the results show thatchondroitin can be effective intreating pain and improving functionfor knee osteoarthritis. \"Studies on the combined supplement are few; however, a large-scale clinical trial measured the effectsof a combined glucosamine/chondroitin supplement on patientswith knee osteoarthritis and found thatTable 2: Evidence-based review resources Cochrane database, www.cochrane.org; Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/darehp.htm; National Guidelines Clearinghouse, www.guideline.gov; ACP Journal Club, www.acpjc.org; Natural www.naturalstandard.com; Linus Pauling Micronutrient Information www.chiroaccess.com; and Alternative Medicine Homepage, www.pitt.edu/~cbw/database.html.

T wenty-first century behaviors, such as the use of antibiotics and processed foods, emotional stress, andchlorinated water, put your patient's GI flora at risk bycreating an unsuitable intestinal environment for normalmicroflora to flourish in. Probiotic research has led to an appreciation of the role microbes play in health and disease, as well as specificsregarding their application to improve clinical outcomes.Science has provided a better understanding of the intimaterelationship between the gastrointestinal tract and theimmune system. This has prompted clinical interest inutilizing specific probiotics to meet specific needs. You now have the opportunity to assist patients with a wide variety of conditions with specific, high-qualityprobiotics. Keep in mind: Probiotics are not a single item. A surge of information has opened the door to effective clinicalprobiotic applications central to improving the lives ofpatients. To select the right probiotics to help your patients, understand the differences among probiotics that arefoundational, restorative, and designer. FOUNDATIONAL PROBIOTICS Probiotics provide a number of benefits to your patients: A decrease in toxin production from pathogenic bacteria; Antibacterial properties towards pathogens; Prevention of intestinal infections; Improved immune-system balance; Reduced inflammatory and/or allergic reactions; Anti-cancer properties; Positive effects on blood lipids and heart disease; Antihypertensive effects; and Reduction in the occurrences of urogential infections. 2, 3, 4, 5 The 400 different GI flora species balance each other and perform functions that include preventing pathogensfrom establishing a foothold. Among the foundational (health-promoting) probiotics are those in the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria genus. 6 Those in the Lactobacillus genus include L. plantarum L. casei, L. rhamnosus, L. brevis, L. paracasei and salivarius. Bifidobacteria genus includes B. bifidum, B. breve, B. lactis and B. longum. Studies on L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and B. lactis have shown that they enhance numerous indices ofimmunity and are considered beneficial for \"optimizingimmunocompetence in healthy, immuno-suppressed orimmunocompromised subjects.\" 7 Lactobacillus salivarius has been demonstrated to modulate the immune system in a balanced fashion, toreduce intestinal inflammation and to modulate intestinalmucosal immune response in inflammatory situations. 8 What you can do: Help your patients take a positive step toward disease prevention and to help reverse existingproblems by utilizing a combination of probiotics such asthose listed.

Start withSacchromyces boulardii during antibiotic therapy and employ a foundationalprobiotic afterwards. DESIGNER PROBIOTICS Immune imbalances leading to allergies, autoimmune conditions, andinfectious diseases have led to thedevelopment of specific probiotics tomeet individual patient needs. T helper cells Type I (Th1) and T helper cells Type II (Th2), modulateallergic responses. 22Allergic conditions are thought to be due toan imbalance caused by modernlifestyles that affect Th1-type andTh2-type immune responses. Depending on the distribution of T helper cells, the immune systemcarries out two inflammatoryresponses (Th1 and andpro-inflammatory, whereas Th2responses promote allergic reactivity. These responses balance which are believedmediated via excessive Th1 responses. Probiotic administration can favorably influence Th1 and Th2balance. 24You can select probiotic bacteria to enhance or suppress Th1or Th2, based on the conditionpatients present with. Differentprobiotics influence the immunesystem in varied ways and can beutilized to support specific needs. What you can do: You now have probiotic options to fit the patient.Are the problems primarily allergic orinflammatory in nature? In each caseyou can choose the best probioticsuited to patient needs. Whether it is to re-balance the flora from antibiotic disruption, torestore homeostasis in conditions ofallergy and/or autoimmunity, or totake preventive measures, modernprobiotics offer options for thepractitioner to utilize in meeting theneeds of 21st-century patients inpromoting good health and incombating illness.

ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007We live in a toxic soup of pollution from emissions andindustrial waste released into our environment. And people arebecoming increasingly aware of thedangers of heavy-metals that invade andreside in the body. Toxic heavy metals have been scientifically linked to health challenges, such as cancer, candida, cardiovascular ailments, arthritis, sexual dysfunction, infertility,fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, depression, multiplesclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.Heavy metals also accelerate the aging process, thusdecreasing quality of life. WHY METALS ARE A PROBLEM The human body is not designed to rid itself of heavy metals by itself; it stores them in areas, such as bones,ligaments, and the large intestine. Toxic heavy metals are extremely potent free-radical factories. In technical terms, a \"free radical\" is anunbalanced molecule with an odd, unpaired electron. Thisunbalanced molecule tries to balance itself by bombardingother molecules in the body in an effort to capture theother molecule's electron. When it \"steals\" the electron from the other molecule, that molecule then becomes a free radical and goes intoattack mode on other molecules, causing a chain reaction.This chain reaction \u2014 called oxidation \u2014 ultimatelyresults in the degeneration of cells, tissues, organs, andsystems within the body. Over time, heavy metals that have accumulated in the body migrate to other parts of the body and stimulate thedevelopment of degenerative disease through free-radicalformation. Your patients may present with initial signs of toxicity that include fatigue, an inability to think clearly, musclepain, and poor circulation. The longer heavy metals areleft alone in the body, the more damage they are giventhe chance to do. THE SOLUTION: CHELATION The classic solution to detoxifying the (IV) EDTA chelation EDTA \u2014 ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid, a synthetic, or man-made,amino acid \u2014 is very effective in removing heavy metals,such as lead, mercury, and arsenic from the body. As effective as this therapy is, it has downsides for patients \u2014 and for you: Cost. The typical cost for each IV chelation is approximately $100, and typically 30 treatments areneeded, for a total cost of $3,000. Time. Each EDTA IV chelation takes from two to three hours, plus travel time. Possible complications. IV chelation is an invasive therapy. Many consumers find this unappealing and risky,especially considering the number of times required for afull EDTA chelation regimen. The downside for you is that IV chelation is generally not an option, because this type of treatment is not in yourscope of practice. To provide the benefits of chelation toyour patients, you have to refer them to clinics \u2014 and witheach referral goes lost potential income.

And by doing so, you can create a viableservice and profit center for yourpractice. Instead of IV services, though,you prescribe oral or suppositorychelation therapy \u2014 neither of whichrequires a medical doctor's supervision. You should examine the research of each option and decide which form ofchelation (oral or suppository) is bestfor your practice and patients. Eachhas advantages and disadvantages: Oral chelation products. These are easy for patients to use, andpatients accept them more easily thanthey do suppositories. Oral products have to pass through the digestive system, which reducesthe amount of EDTA that enters thesystem. Suppositories. Patients are not as accepting of suppositories.However, the suppository deliverysystem allows the agent to remain inthe body for a longer period of timeand provides more opportunity to pullout more metals. Many of your patients have lost faith in their medical doctors and theallopathic system of medicine. This iswhy they are turning to you as thealternative since chiropractors.Chelation therapy is one tool to use tohelp your patients attain optimal health. And consider this: In generally accepted industry standards, oral andsuppository chelation are \"keystoneproducts\" \u2014 which means theirrelative retail price is twice that ofthe cost to the doctor. That translatesinto a healthy source of income foryour practice. Ronald E Partain, Sr. is a pharmacist and a certified clinical nutritionist.

This statistic reflects the focus ofchiropractors who embrace a totalhealthcare philosophy. As desirable as it is to include nutrition in your practice, to provide the most benefit to your patients (and the most income to the clinic), doing it right is more than setting upa display of supplements and hoping patients will buy them. Some people equate nutrition with weight management. A nutrition component in your practice ismuch more than weight management. It is acomprehensive approach to feeling better, increasingenergy levels, and maintaining health and vitality. It involves:1. Defining a patient's goals, 2. Taking a medical history, 3. Giving a physical exam, 4. Ordering or conducting tests, and 5. Recommending an appropriate dietary and supplement protocol. GOALS Every patient has different goals. Some want to lose weight; some, to gain weight; others, to improve staminaand energy levels. Patients who come into your practice may have their own preconceived goals in mind, based on theircomplaints. Others may determine goals after a thoroughassessment of their status. Set goals so that patients know their baseline as well as what they are aiming to achieve. MEDICAL HISTORY Conduct a complete medical history of the patient to identify current and past medical problems, plus familyhistory of medical conditions. Find out about prescriptionmedications being taken, to avoid suggesting anythingthat may have a contraindication. PHYSICAL EXAM Conduct a complete nutritional physical examination that includes objective measurements you can repeat overtime. These measures provide reliable data as a foundationto revise the treatment protocol. They also help you todetermine appropriate and practical goals with your patient: Measure height, weight, percentage of body fat, and BMI. You can take these measures quickly in your office with specialized electronic scales. Why take these measurements? These are baseline measurements that will help you in future exams todetermine if and where the patient is losing weight,drinking enough water, and exercising. Measure key body parts. These include the ankles, calves, thigh, hips, abdomen, chest, wrist, forearm, andupper arm. Why take these measurements? The wrist measurement of the dominant hand correlates to body-frame type. Matchthis measurement to the individual's height and bodyframe on a chart, to identify the ideal weight range. Divide the waist measurement by the hip measurement to identify the patient's risk of cardiovascular disease.(Normal is considered 0.75 for women and 0.80 for men.Higher ratios mean higher risk.) Take the patient's blood pressure. Do this while the patient is sitting, standing, lying down, and risingquickly. Why take this measurement? Blood pressure measurements help you evaluate kidney function, adrenal,risk for arteriosclerosis, and calcium absorption. Thesystolic pressure should drop six to 12 points from the first CONTINUED Patient Relations How to do 'nutrition' right! By Donald F. Relations HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007measurement to the last. If it does not, the patient may not be drinkingenough water or may be seriouskidney problems. The ankle systolic divided by the arm systolic should be above 0.9 ifblood flow to the extremities isadequate. If it is below 0.9,arteriosclerosis may be suspected. A patient should be able to accept a blood-pressure cuff pumped to 220at the mid calf. Inadequate calciumabsorption may cause cramping in theleg with the cuff at less than 220.(Note: Do not do these leg exams if you see varicose veins or the patienthas a history of recent surgeries onthat leg.) Take the patient's pulse. Inquire about his activity level. Why take this measurement? Use pulse rate along with standing bloodpressure to calculate basal metabolismrate. When you know the patient's weight and activity level, you candetermine the correct number ofcalories for them to lose weight. Listen to the heart. Have the patient sit down comfortably on yourexam table and listen to heart sounds. Why listen to the heart sounds? This can be a great help in determiningnutritional needs. Heart sounds thatcome very close together mayindicate a need for vitamin E. If thesecond heart sound is louder than thefirst, adrenal fatigue may beapparent. If the first heart sound islouder than the second, calciumdeficiency may be a problem. Measure the patient's cervical rotation. Use an arthrodial protractor. Then have the patientbreathe in and out of a small paperbag three or four times. Remeasurethe patient's range of motion. Why take this test? If the range of motion increases on rotation, thepatient may be eating too fast becausethe top of the diaphragm is locked. Measure lung capacity with a spirometer. Why take this measurement? If the spirometer shows less than 80 percent capacity, prescribe breathing exercises. Explain to the patient thatinadequate oxygen flow lowers thebasal metabolism rate and thus makesit harder to lose weight. Measure trace minerals, vitamin C, and B6, B9 and B12 absorption. Use zinc assay, lingual ascorbic tests, and homocysteine tests. Why take these measurements? Assay tests indicate deficiencies. Assess the surface of the tongue. Count the taste buds on a millimeter of the surface area of thepatient's tongue. Why take this measurement? The tongue should have at least 50 tastebuds per millimeter of the surface. Ifthe patient has significantly fewertaste buds, his brain will not producethe chemicals in the brain that causesatiation. A decreased number oftaste buds may be caused by a lack ofvitamin B1 and B2 absorption,chewing food too fast, or fromwhitening or fluoride toothpaste. Monitor acidity/alkaline balance. Send your patient home with a form and a kit to monitor theirsaliva and urine pH for a week toevaluate their acid/alkaline balance. Consider blood tests. Blood tests can give additional informationon nutritional deficiencies and can betaken at a certified laboratory. PROTOCOLS Once you have collected information from the test results andhave studied the patient's medicalhistory and complaints, schedule anutrition counseling session. Reviewall your material including yoursuggestions for supplements. Set up atime in the future when you willrepeat the process to determine theirprogress or possibly lack of progress. Make recommendations on diet, exercise, and supplementation, basedon your objective findings. A numberof supplement companies providecomplete protocols designed toaddress specific conditions. Discuss the value of physician-grade supplements with your patient and whyyou make certain recommendations. Schedule regular follow-up visits with the patient, which includeappropriate reassessments, to measureprogress toward his or her goalattainment. Nutrition is a valuable service to your patients. The correct approachcan benefit you both. Donald F. Feeney DC, DACBN, CCN, runs a chiropractic andnutrition practice inWilmington, Del. He is also president of the Council on Nutrition ofthe American Chiropractic Association. Hecan be contacted at chirodoc71@aol.com.The downside of a nutrition component As beneficial as nutritional supplementation is to your patients (and your practice, from the vantage of added revenues), a nutritioncomponent has some downsides, which you should consider carefully: Time. Explaining nutritional needs takes time and disrupts your adjusting schedule. Patient compliance. Patients remember only less than 10 percent of what you tell them, and may or may not buy the supplement from your office. If they go to a health food store with your suggestion, they mayoften find the supplement for less money \u2014 or possibly (unknown tothem) for poorer quality. If they try the retail supplement and it does nothing or worse makes them feel worse, they will remember you suggested it and will tend to doubt your nutrition knowledge.

They change jobs, move away, or havepersonal issues that affect their desire or ability to seek chiropractic care. And, of course, some patients leave because they are unhappy. That's because they have unfulfilled expectations. Even though you lose patients, keep in mind that you cannot please 100 percent of patients all of the time. You cannot be all things to all people. Often patients who are dissatisfied do not tell you why. You only find out about the dissatisfaction when they (oranother doctor) request x-rays or records. As distressing as it is to lose patients, your goal is to \"lose\" your dissatisfied patients in a positive manner so they willnot speak about you in a negative way. (An unhappycustomer is prone to telling at least six other people abouthis or her experience.)One of the best ways to acknowledge a patient's dissatisfaction is to write a letter. Here is an example: Dear Mrs. Miller:Recently, we were requested to send your records to Dr. _______. Although we are happy to comply with yourrequest, we want you to know that you will be missed! My staff and I enjoyed having you as a patient. I certainly respect your decision to try another doctor, but I want you toknow that we will welcome you back to our office at any timein the future. If there are any particular issues you would liketo discuss with me personally, please give me a call. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.In addition to the letter, enclose (or follow up with another letter) a practice survey, which can help youidentify specific problems in the office that may affectpatient satisfaction. Here is a sample survey form: Dear Mrs. Miller:Please help us help others. Enclosed is a questionnaire about our practice, along with a self-addressed envelope.

Thosereasons may include convenience andquality assurance. But aside from benefiting your patients, products can also add to your practice's profitability. How you display products depends upon your business strategy and vision. T wo typical sales approaches affect location and display: Client-interactive sales (a \"touchy-feely\" approach), and Doctor-recommended purchase. Establishing which of these sale philosophies is right for you determines whether you are creating a productdisplay, providing product distribution, or combining bothof these things: Client-interactive displays. Also known as point-of- service (POS) sales, this type of display is similar to thoseyou see at the checkout counter in a supermarket. You place the most attractive items directly at the checkout portion of the desk to spark customer interest.The goal of any POS display is to encourage interactionwith your patients. It should be located in a place thatputs products in view at the time someone may decide topurchase them. Another type of client-interactive display is the \"touch and feel\" arrangement. Products that fall into thiscategory are support pillows, mattress models, orthoticdisplays, and any other products you want the patient todiscover and explore on their own. Another type of interactive display is the education kiosk that combines video, hands-on interactivity, andvisual-display features into one space-saving center. You can build this kiosk to hold a computer station that plays educational videos and provides patients with adirect Internet link to the supplement manufacturer forin-office product ordering. Because patients can orderwhat they want in the quantity they want, you do nothave to keep an inventory on hand. Doctor-recommended product distribution. If you provide product through your recommendation only, thedisplay area is dedicated to the storage of product and haslittle \"show value\" or need for visual attraction. Although the display does not have to be \"catchy,\" it should look professional, be near the checkout section ofyour front desk area, and be easily accessed by your CAs. DISPLAY BASICS As you design your display area, keep in mind a few basics:Display your products to optimize their profitability By Glen David CONTINUED Wellness center \u2014 Consider dedicating an entire wall to a wellness display area.CHEC4p73.ps 2/19/07 9:44 PM Page 73 Use display cases appropriately. In the case of showing off your wares, less is more. Do not store your inventory behindthe glass doors. Glass cabinetry is noplace to store your inventory. Onlyshow vignettes of the product lines. Never make a customer wait to pay. This is rule No. 1 in retailing. Simplify the bookkeeping process.Whether you suggest a product or thepatient requests it, use order formswith all product purchases or orders. Order forms allow your CA to account for product sales when thefront-desk CA is not busy. You canpurchase two-part forms from anyprinter or office-supply store. Theforms look professional, help inbookkeeping, and allow staff to keeppatient flow moving when needed. Watch sight lines. Locate the products appropriately within thedisplay. Place large, bulky items, suchas sleeping pillows as well as mattressmodels, down low. Put supplementsand orthotics between knee- and eye-level heights. Keep eye level in mind. The eye level of patients who are sitting isbetween 36 inches and 54 inchesfrom the floor. Eye level for patientswho are standing is between 48inches and 78 inches above the floor. Create a wellness area. With the trend toward the \"think well, eatwell, and move well\" solution tohealth, consider dedicating an entirewall of your reception room to thisconcept. Just as a carefully designed office will simplify your daily activities,establishing the product-salephilosophy that is right for you willmake your product sale a vital benefitto your patients and a wonderful\"back end\" income stream for you.

Just as the windows in Macy's paint the picture of vitality and fun, your productdisplay should do so, too. For instance: If you offer a large number of different products, do notoverwhelm the customer's senses.Display only a limited variety to sparkinterest. Have order forms or full-linebrochures that describe the entireproduct line available. Remember that only a few of your patients really know what they need.Most turn to you or your staff forguidance. Avoid cheap cardboard racks. Everything in your practice shouldreflect your professionalism.Displaying a high-end product on acardboard rack detracts from its valueand screams bargain basement. Keep the display linked to your beliefs. Ensure that the product distribution area reflects thebenefits of chiropractic as well as thebenefits that the product will bring tothe patient.

Savvy practitioners, however, have longunderstood the efficacy that can resultfrom complementing their practices withnutrition. Developing a nutritional component of your practice is a logical, low-overhead solution to increasing the average dollar-per-visit and patient outcomes. To do thiseffectively requires understanding and following simplepatient psychology and marketing paradigms of: Creating credibility, Writing prescriptions, Starting small, and Providing what patients want. CREATING CREDIBILITY If your want your patients to take your recommendations seriously, you must take nutritionseriously. Be prepared to: Talk about your own personal nutrition plan at a moment's notice. If you \"talk the talk,\" you must \"walkthe walk;\" Tailor nutritional plans to individual patients. Needs vary; assess each person's and address them specifically;and Carry premium-grade supplements. Provide physician-grade supplements that are available exclusivelythrough healthcare providers. You lose credibility if yourpatients can Google your recommendations and purchasethe same brand at less cost on the Internet or in retailstores.WRITING PRESCRIPTIONS When patients visit their medical doctors with a problem, they expect to leave with a prescription. Leaving the officewith that slip of paper validates their health concerns andconfers authority and credibility to the doctor. The public perceives that \"real\" doctors prescribe. You can take advantage of this perception by treatingnutraceuticals like the powerful substances they are. Havenutritional prescription pads printed and use the padswhen prescribing supplementation to patients. By judiciously giving your recommendations on an official Rx pad and having your office staff providefulfillment, you achieve several things: You gain credibility; You appear indifferent \u2014 not a pushy sales person; and You follow the medical model your patients are familiar with, which happens to be the most efficient wayto put them at ease. Trusting patients are ultimately complaint-free patients. STARTING SMALL It is difficult for nutrition-minded practitioners to wear both their clinician's hat and a marketing hat because thehats often do not fit well together. What you believewould benefit a patient and what is mentally and fiscallyprudent for a patient may be two different things. For example: You may want to send a new patient home with a multitude of supplements, or a large complexprotocol. You know this would greatly benefit the patient,but doing this would violate two patient psychology factors: Trust. First, you have not earned the patient's trust yet, so he will be more apt to question your advice. Prevalent mentality. Second, the prevalent one-per- day mentality of patients ensures that most are not used totaking large quantities or even therapeutic doses of nutrients.Use patient psychology to launch your nutrition business By Miranda Jorgenson, DC CONTINUED CHEC4p77.ps 2/19/07 9:47 PM Page 77Practice Management C HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL53: I SSUE 4 M ARCH 13, 2007If they are reticent about taking their supplements, the supplements will sit untouched on their kitchen counter. Ultimately, patients tend to blame a lack of progress ontheir practitioner, not their inability to follow your advice. It is much more pragmatic to guide your patients into nutrition with baby steps. For example: Patients generally come in to see you because of neuromusculoskeletal complaints. If thesepatients visisted an allopath instead of a chiropractor, theMD would likely prescribe a painkiller or a musclerelaxant as a remedy to the pain. You can prescribe your own natural equivalent with a nutritional supplement. Introducing nutrition in a baby-step manner with a simple formula is affordable for thepatient and increases your dollar-per-visit. (See sidebar, \"A slow but good start.\") This is especially important on the first visit when you may not give an adjustment and eitherdiscount or write off the patient visit. PROVIDING WHAT PATIENTS WANT Americans want (and buy) multivitamins and essential fatty acids. Evidence of this is clear: In a 2006 poll commissioned by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), 54 percent of respondentsover 50 years of age, and 39 percent of respondents youngerthan 50 years of age, reported using a daily multivitamin. In the June 19, 2002, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, two Harvard researchersstated the need for vitamin supplementation, indicating,\"Most people do not consume an optimal amount of allvitamins by diet alone ... it appears prudent for all adultsto take vitamin supplements.\" 1 The Nutritional Business Journal reported that in 2005Many patients present with muscle pain or spasms on their first visit. Prescribing a quality magnesium supplement is a good way to help relieve the pain andget the patient started on a nutrition regimen. Magnesium has the distinction of being a natural anesthetic, analgesic, and muscle relaxant. 1It also has natural joint lubricant properties and acts as a gentlesleep aid. With comparatively few contraindications,magnesium is a natural complement to chiropractictreatment, with a typical prescribed dosage of 200 mg- 300 mg taken in the morning, and an additional 300mg - 400 mg taken before bed. 1Guptha K, Vohra V, Sood J. The role of magnesium as an adjuvant during general anesthesia.

The FDA estimated that 48 percent of those sales were frommultivitamin formulas. Clearly, patients are taking multivitamins. If they are not getting them from you, they should be. You have theopportunity to generate a potentially huge stream ofrevenue by simply prescribing a superior quality, broadspectrum, bioavailable multivitamin, or a comprehensivebone supportive. The public is also rallying behind the need for essential fatty acid supplementation which is being recognized as anessential component in the treatment of inflammation. 2,3 Marine lipid concentrates are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, while products that combine marine lipids,flaxseed oil, and borage oil to provide optimal ratios ofoleic acid, ALA, EPA, DHA, and GLA are also excellent. If you educated your patients on the need and superiority of physician-grade supplements, and only 30percent chose to purchase their multivitamins from you,you could add from $13,000 to $20,000 per year inrevenues to your practice, with minimal effort. Nutrition and the supplement industry are developing in direct proportion to the ever-growing pharmaceuticalindustry. The public is inundated with advertisements andmedia reports on healthcare, and despite the fact that theaverage American fills more than 10 prescriptions per year,Americans are as unhealthy as ever and are now demandingsafer alternatives to pharmacological medications. No segment of the healthcare industry has taken ownership of supplementation. This void leaves a hugeopportunity for the chiropractic profession. At a timewhen scope of practice and clinical identity are beingchallenged, you have a major opportunity not only toimplement nutrition, but also to be recognized aspreeminent nutritional specialists. The facts are simple: Your patients are taking supplements. Shouldn't they be buying quality andreliable ones from you?

Test your knowledge of neurodiagnostic-testing basics with this quiz. Which of the following statements about neurodiagnostic testing are true? (a) As a chiropractor you may perform and interpret NCV tests in some states. (b) It makes good business sense to use a testing company that will split the technical and professionalcomponent of the test with you, instead of adding anexpensive medical specialist to do your testing. (c) When you document the medical necessity for NCV/EMG testing, the patient's subjective complaints oftingling and numbness are most important to emphasize. (d) It is better to have these tests performed by a neurologist than a physiatrist, because neurologists havemore specialty training in this area. (e) The NCV test is best for diagnosing lesions of the peripheral nerves, while the EMG is more useful for thediagnosis of spinal nerve root lesions. The correct answers are (a) and (e). (a) True. In some states chiropractors may become board-certified in electrodiagnostic testing by taking a rigorous program of special training.Typically these courses are given on weekends and maytake a year or longer to complete. After becoming certified, a chiropractic physician may perform and interpret NCV tests in states that recognizethis type of certification. Keep in mind, however, that some payers do not reimburse for these tests. And if you become certified, youwill be creating yet another job for yourself, and will be moving one step away from having a practice that can runeffectively without you. (b) False. Reimbursement is generally very poor when you split the technical and professional components of thesetests. In addition, doing so raises a flag with most payers, andwill subject your claim to extra scrutiny and review. Some testing companies propose to pay you a rental fee for the use of your space, and they collect the reimburse-ment for the test. For this arrangement to be legal, the rentmust be so small it would not be worth the trouble. Eventhough hiring a medical specialist introduces moreoverhead, it is more profitable to do your testing this way. (c) False. For purposes of documenting medical necessity, the patient's subjective complaints are much lessimportant than objective findings. This applies to mostmedical and chiropractic procedures, and neurodiagnostictests are no exception. Objective criteria, such as positive findings on the neurological exam, MRI showing nerve-root compression,or past history of positive electrodiagnostic findings, arethe kinds of things insurance companies look for whenthey ask you for medical necessity. Remember, also, that if you established medical necessity when you ordered the test, a negative result fromthe test is not in itself a justification for an automaticdenial by the insurance company. You should challengethese denials if they occur. (d) False. Neurologists and physiatrists both have subspecialty fellowships in electrodiagnostic testing, and it iswithin the scope of each of these specialties to do these tests. (e) True. Typically these tests are done together, because usually the diagnostic challenge is to determine whethersymptoms are caused by a problem in the peripheralnerves (such as carpal tunnel syndrome), a problem in thenerve roots (such as radiculitis), or a combination of thetwo, often referred to as \"double crush.\" The information these tests provide is invaluable in making diagnostic decisions and often leads to importantchanges in the treatment plan. For example: If damage tothe median nerve is occurring, you could refer the patientfor surgical treatment that would preserve the function ofthe nerve, whereas a less serious case of carpal tunnelsyndrome can be managed with wrist splints and therapy.

What is it, what does itdo, and how would it benefit me? A CORF (comprehensive outpatientrehabilitation facility) is a non-residentialhealthcare provider that furnishes diagnostic, therapeutic, and restorative services under a physician'ssupervision, to injured, disabled, or sick people in need ofrehabilitation, on an outpatient basis. A CORF must supply, at the very least, physician services, physical therapy, and social or psychologicalservices. It is permitted to supply other services, such asoncology, transplants, AIDs therapy, and renal dialysis. In order to establish a CORF , the facility must have adequate space and the necessary equipment to furnishthe services it elects to provide. A CORF must be ableto provide all the services required by the patient, asestablished in the patient's treatment plan. On thosedays that the CORF is being operated in your officespace, you are not permitted to conduct yourchiropractic practice. Private insurance companies reimburse for CORF services on a reasonable-cost basis. Medicare pays forCORF services under the physician-fee schedule. CORFsare subject to Medicare Part B co-insurance anddeductible requirements. Assignment is mandatory. Some states have their own licensure requirements for CORFs, which must be complied with in addition to theMedicare requirements. All CORF services must be furnished to a patient who is under a physician's care. The services must be renderedon the facility's premises, except for a single, home-evaluation visit. In order for CORF services to berendered, the patient must be referred by a physician whocertifies that the patient requires skilled rehabilitationservices. Several years ago, a number of chiropractors formed CORFs and got into serious trouble for violating Starkanti-referral rules. They referred patients from theirchiropractic practices to CORF facilities that they ownedor in which they had a financial interest. CORFs must comply with all Stark requirements. Thismeans that you may not refer patients from your practiceto the CORF and patients from the CORF cannot bereferred to your practice. (Note: Do not try to skirt the rules by having a family member own the CORF . Theamount of money you will spend in fines and legal feeswill far exceed any profit you make.) The referring doctor (who, again, must have no financial interest in the CORF) must provide the CORFwith the following information concerning the patient ator before the CORF services are to begin: The patient's significant medical history; Current medical findings; Diagnosis(es) and contraindications to any treatment modality; and Rehabilitation goals, if determined. A CORF physician must review the written plan at least every 60 days and consult with the professionalpersonnel who furnished the services. The reviewingphysician must certify or recertify that the written plan isbeing followed, that progress is being made, and that thetreatment is not causing any harmful effects to thepatient. Running a CORF may be a profitable venture for you, but make certain that you get the advice of competentlegal counsel. CORFs are highly regulated entities and youmust be sure that you are operating legally. Finally (and I cannot stress strongly enough), make sure you know your new business partners. Remember that youare the one with the professional license and that youcould possibly lose it if the rules are broken. Your non-professional partners would simply find a new business. The penalty to you could be a lot more drastic. Deborah A. Green is a practicing health attorney, licensed in New York and Florida.

If you haven't decided, now isthe time. Your \"dream location\" is the perfect chiropractic office in the perfect city for you. To find your perfect location, start with the country in which you want to practice, then zoom down to the region, then to a specific state or province, and then to the city. Be clear about your purpose \u2014 you are searching first for a place where you will enjoy living and second for a good place to practice chiropractic. You can practice anywhere, but if you go somewhere for a practice and you don'tenjoy living there, youwon't be content, andyou'll soon be sellingyour practice and moving to the location you should havechosen in the first place. When you have narrowed your search to a state or province, it's time to start wandering around. This soundsobvious, but some graduates have actually waited untilgraduation to visit where they think they want to practice! TRIP PREPARATION Here are some tips to make your visit more worthwhile: 1. Research the chiropractors in that area. Go to Google Local (local.google.com) and type in the city andthe word \"chiropractor\" to identify who practices there. 2. Check out career opportunities. Check with a job-search or practice-search service to see if anyone inthe area is looking for an associate or to sell a practice. 3. Request information about the city. Go to the Web site of the chamber of commerce or to the localeconomic development organization. Review informationabout the economic situation, schools, and employers. 4. Read online editions of local newspapers. Get to know the community and find out about housing costs. 5. Inquire about your favorite activities. If you are interested in a specific sport or activity, find out if you canenjoy that activity in the area you will be visiting. When you get to the area, drive around to get the \"feel\" of the place. Eat at local dining establishments, not chainrestaurants. Find the local parks and shop in the stores. You will quickly begin to sense which cities or towns feel right and which don't. Don't be afraid to talk with people to hear what they sayabout the town \u2014 orabout chiropractic. When you find a city that looks promising according to your list of criteria,check out the local chiropractors. Talk with them aboutthe town; you'll be able to tell whether they consider youan asset to the community or a potential threat. Plan at least one trip to the while you are in school and then another trip close to graduation. The focus of the second trip will be different. You will want to meet chiropractors with whom you've talkedabout potential employment or practice purchase; you willbe looking for a place to live; or you'll be searching for anoffice location. Going through this process of selecting a location may seem intimidating because you've never done it before.You are making a major life decision, so take the time tobe sure.
