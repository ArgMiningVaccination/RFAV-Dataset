Numbers in the text and tables may not add to totals because of rounding. ERRATA In the print version of this report, option 400-03 (Eliminate the Essential Air Service Program) states in the test that eliminating the program would save $4.8 billion from 2000 to 2009. Thatestimate is incorrect. The correct estimate is $480 million, as shown in the table accompanyingthe option. This electronic version contains the corrected text for the option.This study and other CBO publications are available at CBO's Web site. http://www.cbo.gov/Preface This volume compiles 250 specific policy options for reducing federal spending or increasingrevenues in a wide variety of programs. Prepared at the request of the House and SenateBudget Committees, it is intended to help policymakers maintain budgetary discipline and accomplish related po licy goals. The report is sim ilar to the compendiums of policy options for reducing the deficit that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) prepared from 1980 to 1997. The policy options included in this report come from many sources, and the Congress has considered most of them at some time in the past. In keeping with CBO's mandate to provideobjective and impar tial analysis, the discussion of each option presents the cases for and against it as fairly as possible. CBO does not endorse the options included, nor does exclusion of any pro-posal imply a recommendation for or against it. The report begins with an introductory section that discusses the major rationales for budgetary discipline and explains how to use the information presented in this volume. Part One includesmore than 200 options for reducing spending, organized by the functional categories of thebudget\u2014national defense; international affairs; general science, space, and technology; and so on.Each functional category is introduced by a page of background data and information on recent spending trends within that function. Part Two presents more than 50 options for generatingrevenues. The report concludes with an appendix listing the scorekeeping guidelines used toenforce the discretionary spending limits and pay-as-you-go requirement of the Budget Enforce-ment Act of 1990 (as amended). All divisions of the Congressional Budget Office contributed to this report, which was coordi- nated by Sandy Davis, Steve Lieberman, and Barry Anders on. Sandy Davis also prepared the introductory section. The spending options were coordinated by David H. Moore, R. Mark Musell,R. William Thomas, and Bruce Vavrichek. The revenue options were coordinated by Diane LimRogers and Roberton Williams. Budget authority and outlay estimates were coordinated by Tom B.Bradley, Paul R. Cullinan, Peter H. Fontaine, and Michael A. Miller. The staff of the Joint Com-mittee on Taxation prepared most of the revenue estimates. The background pages for each func-tion were prepared by David H. Moore and Peter H. Fontaine, with assistance from Keith Mattrick.Laurie Brown designed the interactive version of the report, with technical support from FrankGibbs. Barry Anderson designed the cover. Sherry Snyder supervised the editing of the report, and Kathryn Quattrone oversaw production. Major portions were edited by Leah Mazade, Christian Spoor, and Liz Williams. The authors owethanks to Sharon Corbin-Jallow, Judith A. Cromwell, Denise Jordan, Ang ela Z. McCollough, Ronald Moore, L. Rae Roy, and Simone Thomas, who typed the early drafts. Kathryn Quattroneprepared the report for publication, and Laurie Brown prepared the electronic versions for CBO's World Wide Web site, both assisted by Martina Wojak-Piotrow. Dan L.

SCOREKEEPING GUIDELINES 281 Introduction Until recently, large and persistent deficits domi- nated the federal budget. For most of the pasttwo decades, lawmakers struggled to find com- mon ground on new policies that would eliminate thosedeficits. In the 1980s, their efforts met with little suc-cess; but in the 1990s, a strong economy and the endof the Cold War combined with a series of three multi-year budget agreements\u2014in 1990, 1993, and 1997\u2014to produce a dramatic reversal in the federal budgetaryoutlook. The reversal happened with stunning speed, well in advance of predictions. Fiscal year 1998 endedwith a sizable surplus of about $70 billion in the totalbudget (that is, including Social Security and thePostal Service, which are off-budget). The Congres-sional Budget Office (CBO) projects that under cur-rent policies and current assumptions about the econ-omy, surpluses in the total budget will continue andwill grow substantially. Over the 1999-2009 period,they are expected to total about $2.7 trillion. Exclud-ing off-budget spending and revenues, small on- budget deficits continue through 2000 but give way thereafterto growing on-budget surpluses that are projected tototal about $800 billion through 2009. 1 Yet the emergence of projected surpluses, even sizable ones, does not mean that budgetary disciplineshould be abandoned. For at least four reasons,choices and trade-offs must be made, even in an era ofsurpluses.o If the economy weakens significantly, projected surpluses in the total budget could diminish ordisappear, and the emergence of on-budget sur-pluses could be delayed. Major new budgetarycommitments that were not offset would onlyhasten such a trend. o Maintaining budgetary discipline would help ease the long-term budgetary pressures that willemerge with the aging of the baby-boom genera-tion. In fact, annual deficits are projected to re-turn as those pressures mount after 2010. 2 o The discretionary spending limits and pay-as- you-go (PAYGO) requirement established by theBudget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) are stillin force. 3 In particular, the limits for 2000 allow for less spending than was appropriated for1999. Trade-offs will be necessary to keepspending within those limits and still fund prior-ity programs. o Trade-offs will also be necessary to allow paying down the national debt. Reducing federal debtincreases national savings and thereby promotesthe economic growth that will be needed to helpmeet the long-term budgetary challenges facingthe nation. The likely effects of a particular pol-icy on the future growth and size of the economyis a key fiscal consideration for policymakers. In 1. Congressional Budget Office, An Analysis of the President's Budget- ary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2000 (April 1999), Table A-3, p. 68.2. For a discussion of the long-term outlook, see Congressional Budget Office, Long-Term Budgetary Pressures and Policy Options (May 1998). 3. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 extended BEA procedures gener- ally through 2002.2 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 particular, major budgetary proposals\u2014whether to reduce debt, cut taxes, increase spending, oraddress the long-term structural imbalances ofMedicare or Social Security\u2014should take thoselikely effects into account. Although burgeoning surpluses may seemingly widen the range of policy options, they do not makethem easy or obvious. For example, some policymak-ers would use surpluses (or a portion of them) to covercosts that are associated with certain proposals to re-form Social Security or Medicare for the long term.Others favor proposals to overhaul the tax code.Those changes will be controversial and complex.Reaching a consensus on them is likely to be a diffi-cult and protracted process. As lawmakers considerthe various options, maintaining budgetary disciplinewill help preserve projected surpluses and lower thefederal debt. The prospect of continuing surpluses also does not dispense with the need to examine the effectivenessand efficiency of federal programs. Emphasizing theobjectives underlying the Government Performanceand Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) will assist policy-makers in evaluating existing federal programs and injudging whether new programs should be substitutedfor outmoded or ineffective ones. Some policymakersfavor converting the annual budget process to a bien-nial cycle in which an entire session of Congresswould be devoted mainly to the oversight, evaluation,and reauthorization of federal programs. 4 As policymakers consider these and other issues, they are likely to need a full range of budgetary op-tions that produce savings. This volume lists spendingand revenue options that would produce budgetarysavings, either by cutting spending or increasing re-ceipts. 5 The options generally are intended to help lawmakers maintain budgetary discipline. Some alsocan be used to satisfy other rationales for budgetarysavings, such as limiting the overall size of the federalgovernment, restructuring programs to achieve policygoals at lower cost, or improving the efficiency andeffectiveness of federal programs to reach GPRA per- formance goals. Others can be used to eliminate nar-row tax preferences or promote greater economic effi-ciency. The Limits on Discretionary Spending in 2000 to 2002 For discretionary spending, which is controlled in an- nual appropriation acts, the Budget Enforcement Actestablishes dollar limits for budget authority and out-lays. In some years, separate limits have been set forbroad categories of discretionary spending (such asdefense, domestic, and international); in others, a sin-gle set of consolidated caps has covered all discretion-ary spending. 6 For fiscal year 2000, most discretion- ary spending is consolidated into an overall discretion-ary category. Separate caps are set for spending onhighways, mass transit, and violent crime control.(Only outlay caps are established for the highway andmass transit categories.) After 2000, the violent crimecategory is combined with all other discretionaryspending for enforcement purposes. The limits on discretionary spending for 2000 cap total appropriations for the year below the levelenacted for 1999, largely because of the recordamount of emergency appropriations enacted last year.The amount of the shortfall depends on whether, or towhat extent, those emergency appropriations are re-peated as nonemergency appropriations for 2000 (seeTable 1). For 2001 and 2002, total discretionary out-lays are capped at or just below the limit for 2000. 7 Thus, relative to the levels enacted for 1999, spendingcuts or offsets will be necessary to comply with thecaps for 2000 and possibly for 2001 and 2002. 4. For data on program authorizations that expire in 1999, see Congres- sional Budget Office, Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations (January 8, 1999). 5. This volume is similar to the annual volumes CBO produced from 1980 through 1997 that listed options for reducing the deficit.6. Separate discretionary categories are sometimes referred to as \"fire- walls\" because they are created in part to preserve an overall level ofspending for programs in that category. In general, spending cuts oroffsets in one discretionary category may not be used to offset in-creases in another. 7.

NOTE: Amounts to freeze 1999 dollar resources have no adjustment for inflation.a. In 1999, $15.8 billion in discretionary appropriations was desi gnated as emer gency spendin g. The totals here exclude the estimated bud get authority and outlays that result from assumin g that those appropriations are repeated in 2000. About $6 billion of 1999 emer gency appropriations funded certain mandatory pro grams and therefore are not reflected in this table. b. The caps reflect discretionary spendin g limits as specified by the Office of Mana gement and Bud get in the sequestration preview report included in the President's bud get, adjusted for CBO's estimate of contin gent emergency releases that the President has not yet desi gnated. c. In 1999, an appropriation of $17.9 billion was provided for the International Monetary Fund to meet a periodic commitment for which fundin g was last provided in 1993. Such appropriations result in no outlays. The domestic and international totals here exclude the estim ated budget authority that results from assumin g that the appropriation is repeated in 2000. d. This level does not include mass transit budget authority, which is not subject to a cap. Mass transit budget authority tota ls $1.1 billion in 1999.4 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 During the mid-1990s, lawmakers constrained overall discretionary spending levels by making signif-icant cuts in defense outlays, which now account forroughly half of total discretionary spending. The endof the Cold War made sizable defense cuts possible.Since 1990, defense discretionary outlays have fallenabout 25 percent, while nondefense discretionary out-lays have grown about 20 percent (in constant 1992dollars). 8 Some lawmakers are concerned that further defense cuts would be ill-advised and believe that de-fense levels should be increased. Some also advocatereestablishing separate caps for defense and non-defense discretionary spending, a move that wouldprevent trade-offs between the two categories. 9 Reaching a consensus on discretionary spending levels that do not exceed the caps will be difficult.The lure of growing surpluses may exacerbate theproblem. Consequently, some lawmakers fear thatconditions may be ripe for efforts to evade rather thancomply with the discretionary caps for 2000 and be-yond. As proof, they point to the record amount ofemergency appropriations enacted for 1999. The BEA permits the President and the Congress to designate new spending or revenues as emergencyrequirements, which are effectively exempt from thediscretionary spending limits and PAYGO. Typically,the emergency designation is used to provide appropri-ations for unforeseen or unpredictable events, such asnatural disasters or international emergencies. Underthe BEA, emergency appropriations not related to thePersian Gulf War have ranged from about $1.5 billion(1991) to $22 billion (1999), averaging just under $9billion annually. In some years, those amounts havebeen partially or entirely offset with rescissions ofother discretionary appropriations. However, most ofthe record amount of emergency spending enacted for1999, which was provided for a variety of purposes,was not offset, thus increasing concern that the emer-gency safety valve has become a loophole for sus- tained higher spending. 10 CBO estimates that the President's budgetary proposals for 2000 would cause total discretionaryoutlays to exceed the outlay limit for that year byabout $30 billion. The President proposes to partiallyoffset that excess amount with certain new taxes andcuts in mandatory spending programs\u2014proposals thatthe current BEA rules would count under the PAYGOrequirement, not the discretionary spending limits. 11 Those proposals would require changes in BEA proce-dures, which the President also proposes. Some ana-lysts contend, however, that such changes wouldweaken budgetary discipline since total discretionaryspending would remain well above the capped levels. Other Rationales for Budgetary Savings Although all of the options included in this volume would produce budgetary savings that could be usedto maintain budgetary discipline, some could also beused to promote other policy goals. Some options, for example, could be used to re- duce the size of government, limit its rate of growth,or scale back activities for which a federal role isquestioned. Certain options, such as the one to reducefunding for the arts and humanities (option 500-12),would produce savings by eliminating a program orprograms that some policymakers may consider to beinappropriate federal activities. Others, such as theone to eliminate funding for new empowerment zonesand enterprise communities (option 450-06), wouldcancel programs or spending that may duplicate otherfederal or state programs. Several options would can- 8.Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2000: Histori- cal Tables , p. 118. 9. Separate caps for defense spending were in place in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1998, and 1999.10. For a discussion of trends and issues relating to emergency spending, see Congressional Budget Office, Emergency Spending Under the Budget Enforcement Act , CBO Memorandum (December 1998). 11. Congressional Budget Office, Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2000 , p. 5.INTRODUCTION 5 cel or cut back spending that many people believe is more appropriately undertaken by the private sector\u2014for example, the option to eliminate the Departmentof Energy's applied research program for fossil fuels(option 270-01). The option to eliminate the EssentialAir Service program (option 400-03) would end anactivity that benefits certain localities but may notserve the wider public. Other options would enable lawmakers to elimi- nate programs that may have outlived their usefulness,may have achieved the purposes for which they werecreated, or might be better performed outside the fed-eral government. For example, the option to eliminatecertain subsidies provided by the Rural Utilities Ser-vice (option 270-05) would end a program that manypeople assert has accomplished its original objectives.One goal of the option to sell federal assets that sup-port the Southeastern Power Administration (option270-07) would be to end a federal activity that the pri-vate sector may be able to perform more efficiently.Some people support the option to eliminate antidrugadvertising (option 800-05) because they argue thatthere is no clear evidence that such advertising works. Lawmakers may also want to consider options that would restructure programs to achieve programgoals at lower cost. A number of national defense op-tions may offer such opportunities. Option 050-24,for example, would consolidate military exchange sys-tems and introduce incentives for more efficient opera-tions. The option to restrict eligibility for studentloans by using home equity to determine financial need(option 500-07-C) would improve the targeting of fed-eral assistance under the student loan program. An-other option, to simplify and limit Medicare's cost-sharing requirements (570-13-A), is meant to encour-age beneficiaries and providers to use medical servicesmore prudently. A number of options would establishcost-based user fees for businesslike services that thegovernment now provides without charge. Certain revenue options would produce savings by eliminating preferential treatment in the tax codefor particular activities or forms of income and byproviding more evenhanded treatment of taxpayersgenerally. For example, options REV-09 throughREV-12 would restrict the tax-favored treatment ofnonretirement fringe benefits.Many of the options are relevant to the require- ments of the Government Performance and ResultsAct of 1993 in that they could be used to improve theefficiency and effectiveness of federal programs. Thatact requires federal agencies to prepare annual perfor-mance plans that establish measurable goals for pro-gram performance and that match expected goals witha certain level of funding. Performance measures arenow included with agency budget requests in the Presi-dent's annual budget submission. They are intendedto help policymakers hold departments and agenciesaccountable for programs that do not effectively andefficiently accomplish their objectives, as indicated bytheir performance measures. If programs fall short ofthose measures, the law intends that policymakers beconfronted with certain critical decisions, includingwhether those programs should be restructured or havetheir funding reduced or eliminated. Exclusions and Limitations The options for budgetary savings in this volume stemfrom various sources, including legislative proposals,the President's budget, past CBO deficit reductionvolumes, Congressional and CBO staff, other govern-ment entities, and private groups. Although the op-tions are intended to reflect a broad range of possibili-ties, they are neither ranked nor comprehensive. Theinclusion or exclusion of a specific option does notrepresent an endorsement or rejection of that option byCBO (see Box 1). As a nonpartisan Congressionalstaff agency, CBO does not make policy recommenda-tions. The options exclude policy changes that are not counted under the Budget Enforcement Act. Thus,options that would affect off-budget programs (SocialSecurity and the Postal Service) or that fully fund ex-isting deposit insurance commitments are not included.Also excluded are options affecting any program orrequirement for which the discretionary spending lim-its are automatically adjusted. Those programs andrequirements include spending designated as an emer-gency requirement (also excluded from PAYGO),appropriations for continuing disability reviews of cer-tain benefit payments, the International MonetaryFund, international arrearages, and initiatives to com-6 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 Box 1. Changes in Options from Previous Volumes Not all of the options included in the Congressio- nal Budget Office's last published compilation(1997) of spending and revenue options appear inthe current volume. Some of the options, or verysimilar ones, have been enacted into law. Anexample is the option to extend and broaden theFederal Communications Commission's authorityto auction licenses to use the radio sp ectrum. Other options\u2014for example, a proposal affectingassistance to people who rent housing in ruralareas\u2014have been dropped because programswere modified to improve their effectiveness. Since the 1997 volume was issued, pro- jected surpluses have replaced projected deficits.A number of revenue options that had the sole orprimary purpose of raising revenues to close thebudget deficit have therefore been dropped. In-creasing marginal tax rates on individuals andcorporations and imposing a value-added tax aretwo examples. Other revenue options in the pre-vious volume\u2014for example, options to limit pen-sion contributions or to tax capital gains fromhome sales\u2014have been dropped because recentlyenacted measures indicate movement toward in-creasing rather than decreasing tax benefits inspecific areas. ply with the earned income tax credit. Further, asset sales that CBO estimates would result in net costs tothe federal government are excluded. For example,selling the assets of the Tennessee Valley Authority(TVA) may result in net federal costs because a pri-vate operator may not be able to charge prices forelectricity that are sufficiently high to pay the TVA'soutstanding debt to the government. 12The volume focuses on options that would pro- duce near-term budgetary savings; it excludes broadpolicy options or integrated approaches for budgetarysavings\u2014for example, comprehensive proposals toreform major programs, such as Social Security orMedicare, or those proposals to revise the tax code.Such options generally make more fundamentalchanges that take longer to carry out and are directedprincipally at the longer-term budgetary or economichorizon. The options in this volume facilitate the case-by- case review of individual programs. The volumetherefore excludes certain types of governmentwideoptions that would produce savings in many programsor agencies. Such options would, for example, freezespending across the board, eliminate an entire depart-ment or major agency, or make an across-the-boardcut in federal salaries. Savings for such options can-not always be reliably estimated because they mayaffect numerous programs and may simply result in ashift in spending among programs or accounts. More-over, such options cut effective and ineffective pro-grams alike. Some of the options affecting states, localities, or the private sector may involve federal mandates. TheUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 establishesprocedures intended to control such mandates. It alsorequires CBO to estimate the costs to states and locali-ties of any mandates imposed by new legislation thatthe Congress is considering. Individual options in thisvolume do not include estimates of any potential man-dates. However, they may discuss that issue whereappropriate. The calculations accompanying the individual options do not include savings in federal interest costs.Interest savings typically are estimated as part of acomprehensive budget plan, such as the Congressionalbudget resolution, but such adjustments usually arenot made for individual options of the type discussedin this volume. 12. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) changed the treatment of asset sales under the BEA. Previously, asset sales were not countedfor any purpose under the BEA. Therefore, the proceeds from the saleof a government asset could not be counted under the discretionaryspending limits or the PAYGO requirement and could not be used tooffset spending increases or tax cuts under those disciplines. The BBAmodified that rule to prohibit counting only asset sales that wouldresult in a net cost to the federal government. Guidelines for calculat-ing the net cost of an asset sale are included in the BEA scorekeepingguidelines contained in the BBA conference report (see U.S. House of Representatives, Balanced Budget Act of 1997 , conference report to accompany H.R. 2015, Report 105-217 (July 30, 1997), p. 1012). The scorekeeping guidelines are reprinted in the appendix. For a dis-cussion of issues raised by the sale of power assets, such as the TVA, see Congressional Budget Office, Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity , CBO Study (November 1997).INTRODUCTION 7 Finally, subsequent CBO cost estimates, which generally accompany any bill reported by a Congres-sional committee, may not match the savings estimatesshown in this report. The policy proposals on whichthe cost estimates are based may not precisely matchthe specifications used in developing the options. Fur-ther, the budget baseline estimates or levels againstwhich the proposals ultimately are measured may havebeen updated and thus would differ from those usedhere. Using This Volume Part One of this volume lists options to reduce spend-ing, and Part Two lists options to increase revenues.Spending options are categorized according to thefunctional categories of the budget\u2014national defense(050), international affairs (150), general science,space, and technology (250), and so on. Each spend-ing option is further identified as affecting either man-datory or discretionary spending. For each function,an introductory page provides summary informationand historical data on overall mandatory and discre-tionary spending trends within that function. The options are numbered individually and in- clude, where appropriate, references to related optionsin the volume and to relevant CBO publications.Spending options are numbered beginning with thenumber for the functional category within which theyare grouped. For example, defense spending optionsare numbered 050-01, 050-02, and so on. Closelyrelated options are grouped together under a singlenumber, with individual options identified by a lettersuffix. (For example, 050-01-A and 050-01-B bothcut strategic nuclear force levels.) For each option, the volume provides general background, discusses the pros and cons of the pro-posal, and estimates the annual budgetary savings(that is, the cut in spending or the increase in reve-nues) for the 2000-2009 period. Cumulative savingsare summed for the first five years of that period(2000-2004) and for all 10 years. The projected sav-ings for mandatory spending and revenue options arecomputed from baseline levels estimated to occur un-der current law. 13 Savings for discretionary spending options generally are calculated from the level appro-priated for 1999. Savings for a few discretionaryspending options, principally those affecting certainhousing subsidies, are calculated from adjusted base-line levels explained in the background discussion forthose options. New or increased fees may be classi-fied as offsets to spending (offsetting receipts or col-lections) or as new revenues (governmental receipts). 14 Scorekeeping Guidelines The BEA includes scorekeeping guidelines to ensurethat the budgetary effects of legislation are measuredconsistently and in accord with standard conventions(see the appendix). Among other things, those guide-lines identify discretionary and mandatory accounts,specify how to account for legislation that crosses be-tween the discretionary spending and PAYGO en-forcement categories, provide for the scoring of assetsales and lease purchases, and set forth rules for vari-ous other budgetary transactions. The guidelines, however, are subject to interpre- tation, and CBO and the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) sometimes view them differently.Those differing interpretations may affect how certainoptions are counted under BEA procedures. OMB estimates are final for the purpose of BEA enforce-ment. CBO estimates are advisory under the BEA butgenerally are used in the Congressional budget pro-cess. 13. For cost estimates of revenue legislation, CBO is required by law to use estimates provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation. JCTestimated most of the revenue options included in this volume. CBOprepared the estimates for the option to expand Medicare coverage tocertain state and local government employees (REV- 18) and the op- tion involving taxable Social Security and Medicare wages for theself-employed (REV-19). 14. The term \"user fee\" is not a formal budget category. It is an informal term that generally refers to collections from individuals or ent ities that benefit from or are regulated by some federal program, and thecollections are used solely to support that program. In general, if thefee supports a business-type activity, it is classified as an offset tospending. If it is based on the government's sovereign power to tax, itis classified as a revenue. User fees classified as spending offsets maybe further classified as either mandatory or discretionary, dependinggenerally on the type of spending legislation in which the fee is in-cluded.8 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 The Interactive Budgetary Discipline Volume An interactive version of this report is available on CBO's Web site (www.cbo.gov) in HTML. That ver-sion allows users to search the options in four ways,singly or in combination: o By type of option\u2014spending (by budget func- tion) or revenue, o By spending category (discretionary or manda- tory),o By agency (the federal agency whose programs would be affected by the option), and o By word or phrase.For example, a user could search for all options re- lated to natural resources and the environment (budgetfunction 300) that affect discretionary spending; alloptions that would produce savings in mandatoryspending within the Department of Health and HumanServices; all options that deal with submarines; or alloptions that eliminate something (a program, somekind of assistance, or some other key factor).Part One Spending Options 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999-75075150225300375Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory050 National Defense Budget function 050 comprises spending for national defense. Although 95 percent of that spending falls within the Department of Defense, function 050 also includes the atomic energyactivities of the Department of Energy and smaller amounts in the budgets of other federal de-partments and agencies. CBO estimates that discretionary outlays for function 050 will be about$274 billion in 1999. Discretionary budget authority of $280 billion was provided for nationaldefense in 1999. Mandatory spending in that function usually shows negative balances because ofpayments made to federal agencies. In 1991, those receipts were unusually large because ofreimbursements by foreign governments for some of the costs of the Persian Gulf War. Over thepast decade, outlays for national defense have declined from 27 percent of federal governmentspending to 16 percent.12 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-01-A REDUCE U.S. FORCES TO START II LEVELS BY 2007 Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 570 90 2001 580 2602002 1,560 5902003 : 050-01-B, 050-02, and 050-03 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Letter to the Honorable Thomas A. Daschle regarding the estimatedbudgetary impacts of alternativelevels of strategic forces , March 18, 1998.The second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) will require the United States to cut its long-range nuc lear forces to 3,500 warheads by 2003\u2014roughly one-third of the 1990 level. START II was ratified by the Sen ate in 1996, but it faces an uncertain future in Russia's parliament, the Duma. Presidents Clintonand Yeltsin have agreed to delay full implementation of the treaty until Decem-ber 31, 2007, in an effort to encourage ratification by the Duma. However, theforces to be dismantled by that date must be made inoperable by the end of 2003. The Clinton Administration decided in 1994 to begin cutting its forces to START II levels to save money and to encourage Russian ratifi cation of the treaty. But those plans were thwarted after several years of Russian inaction andCongressional directives prohibiting further cuts in U.S. forces. As a result,today's forces remain largely consistent with the START I treaty, and the Admin-istration has decided to keep them at those levels until the Duma ratifies STARTII. Currently, the Un ited States deploys 500 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with three warheads each, 50 Peacekeeper ICBMswith 10 warheads each, 18 Trident submarines (each carrying 192 warheads on24 missiles), and 94 B-52H, 94 B-1B, and 21 B-2 bombers. Once the Duma ratifies START II, the Administration plans to achieve the 3,500-warhead limit by eliminating all 50 Peacekeepers, four Trident subma-rines, and 23 B-52H bombers by the end of 2007. It will also reduce the numberof warheads on Minuteman III miss iles from three to one and on Trident D5 missiles from eight to five and will redesignate its B-1B bombers as conventionalbombers. This option would follow the Administration's plan to reduce U.S. forces to START II levels even if the Duma does not ratify the treaty. Those cuts wouldbe made by the end of 2007, the treaty's modified implementation date. Theprimary motivation would be financial; those changes would save $570 millionin 2000 and nearly $13 billion through 2009 relative to START I levels. Most ofthe savings would come from avoiding three substantial investments: buying D5missiles, refueling the four oldest Trident submarines and converting them tocarry D5s, and manufacturing more Peacekeeper missiles. (This option wouldnot save any money relative to the Administration's plan since that plan alreadyassumes the cuts.) Savings could be $700 million higher through 2009 if theforces were retired by 2003, the original implementation date for START II. Supporters of this approach argue that keeping long-range forces at today's levels is unnecessary. According to several reports, Russia will have troublemaintaining its forces at START I levels. Many of its missiles and submarinesare nearing the end of their service life, and production of replacements hasslowed to a trickle or stopped altogether. For that reason, several prominentformer opponents of START II in the Duma have recently urged r atification. Some advocates of this option also argue that adopting it will encourage theDuma to ratify the treaty. Critics argue that U.S. forces should remain at START I levels. They op- pose any unilateral disarmament. They also worry that Russia might build up itsnuclear forces if a hard-line government came to power. In their view, the Dumawill only ratify the treaty if it is faced with a robust U.S. START I force.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 13 050-01-B REDUCE NUCLEAR DELIVERY SYSTEMS WITHIN OVERALL LIMITS OF START II Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 1,250 190 2001 1,340 5902002 2,500 1,2602003 : 050-01-A, 050-02, and 050-03 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Letter to the Honorable Thomas A. Daschle regarding the estimatedbudgetary impacts of alternativelevels of strategic forces , March 18, 1998.This option would go one step farther than the previous alternative (050-01-A). It would reduce the number of missiles and submarines below the levelsplanned by the Administration for START II but keep the number of warheadsat START II levels. Specifically, it would retire four additional Trident subma-rines and 200 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2003, retain- ing 10 Tridents and 300 Minuteman IIIs. To keep the same number of war- heads, the smaller Trident force would carry seven warheads on each missileinstead of five (see option 050-02). Minuteman III missiles would carry one warhead. This option would keep the same number of nuclear bombers asoption 050-01-A, each carrying an average of 16 warheads. In all, those forceswould carry nearly 3,500 warheads\u2014almost the same number that the Admin-istration proposes for START II. Compared with keeping U.S. forces at START I levels, this option would save $1.3 million in 2000 and $20.9 billion through 2009. Most of thosesavings\u2014which were outlined in option 050-01-A\u2014would come from reducingforces to the START II levels planned by the Administration and thus do notrepresent savings from the Administration's budget plan. However, this optionwould save an additional $680 million in 2000 and $8.1 billion through 2009compared with the Administration's plan; those extra savings would come fromreduced operation and support costs (from retiring 200 Minuteman ICBMs andfour additional Trident submarines) and lower levels of investment spending(from canceling production of the D5 missile after buying five in 1999, extend-ing the service life of fewer Minuteman missiles, and forgoing the Administra-tion's plans to reconfigure four Trident submarines under START II so they cancarry new D5 missiles). During the Cold War, this option might have raised concerns about stabil- ity. By putting more nuclear \"eggs\" in fewer baskets, the United States wouldhave increased its vulnerability to a surprise attack. But today those concernshave become less acute. The United States may now decide that it can savemoney safely by deploying its warheads on fewer weapon systems. However,this option would retain three types of nuclear systems (the so-called nucleartriad) and thus provide a margin of security against an adversary's developing anew technology that would render other legs of the triad more vulnerable toattack. This option has a number of potential disadvantages, including those raised in option 050-01-A about cutting forces below START I levels beforeRussia ratifies START II. Carrying more warheads on D5 missiles wouldreduce the targeting flexibility of U.S. planners, and deploying fewer subma-rines might increase their vulnerability to Russian antisubmarine forces. Uni-laterally cutting forces would also limit the United States' ability to increasethe number of warheads it deployed if Russia decided not to abide by STARTII. Indeed, some critics argue that unilateral cuts would reduce U.S. leverage toget Russia to ratify START II.14 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-02 TERMINATE PRODUCTION OF D5 MISSILES AFTER 1999 Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 1,120 160 2001 1,120 13,010 CATEGORY : 050-01-A and 050-01-B RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Rethinking the Trident Force (Study), July 1993.Under the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), the Navy plans to de- ploy a force of 18 Trident submarines. Each one will carry 24 D5 missiles\u2014themost accurate and powerful submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) in theU.S. inventory. Today, the Navy has 10 Trident submarines armed with D5s andeight armed with older C4 missiles. To keep 18 submarines, it must convert theeight older subs to carry D5s as well. To arm that force, CBO estimates, the Navywill have to purchase a total of 540 D5 missiles, 360 of which it has already bought. If Russia ratifies START II, the Administration plans to reduce the Navy's Trident submarines to 14 by 2007 to comply with that treaty. It will probably cut thenumber of warheads on each missile from eight to five (for a total of 1,680) to keepthe number of U.S. warheads near the ceiling allowed by START II. This option would terminate production of D5 missiles after 1999 and retire all eight C4 submarines by 2005. The Navy would then have 360 D5s\u201413 more thanit says it needs to support a 10-submarine force. Like the Administration's plan forSTART II, this option would wait to retire the C4 submarines until after the turn ofthe century to encourage Russian compliance with START II and to give the UnitedStates flexibility to stay at higher START I levels if Russia does not comply. Toretain 1,680 warheads, the option would increase the number of warheads on eachD5 missile from five to seven. Compared with keeping today's START I forces\u2014as the Congress is requiring until Russia ratifies START II\u2014this option would save $1.1 billion in 2000 and$13.5 billion through 2009. The savings would come from canceling missile pro-duction ($8 billion), retiring all eight C4 submarines rather than upgrading them($3.3 billion), and operating fewer subs ($2.2 billion). Compared with the planassumed in the Administration's 1999 budget, which would retire only four C4 sub-marines, this option would save $5 billion through 2009. Terminating production of the D5 has several drawbacks. Loading more war- heads on existing missiles would reduce their range by roughly 20 percent, limitingthe areas in which submarines could operate. It would also reduce the flexibility ofthe force, since missiles with fewer warheads can cover more widely dispersed tar-gets. Deploying D5 missiles with seven warheads would also constrain the UnitedStates' ability to expand its SLBM force by adding back the extra warheads if Russiaviolated or never ratified START II. In addition, reducing the fleet to 10 submarinescould increase its vulnerability to attack by Russian antisubmarine forces. Nevertheless, some people may consider the capability retained under this option sufficient to deter nuclear war. Although the missiles' range and the subma-rines' patrol areas would be smaller, they would still exceed the levels planned dur-ing the Cold War\u2014when Russia had more antisubmarine forces and the UnitedStates intended to deploy the D5 with eight large warheads (W-88s). Moreover, lesstargeting flexibility might not reduce the nuclear deterrent: 1,680 warheads deployedon 336 missiles might not deter an adversary any more than if they were on the 240missiles called for in this option. Also, the smaller likelihood of nuclear war andRussia's atrophying nuclear forces may have weakened the rationale for the UnitedStates to be able to increase its forces rapidly by adding warheads to the D5. In fact,since the U.S. ability to do that is one of Russia's biggest concerns about START II,adopting this option could make passage of the treaty more likely.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 15 050-03 REMOVE PEACEKEEPER MISSILES AHEAD OF START II RATIFICATION Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 10 102002 60 502003 140 1102004 400 220 2005 1,090 460 2006 940 6802007 960 8302008 980 9302009 1,000 960 Cumulative 2000-2004 610 390 2000-2009 5,580 4,250 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 050-01-A and 050-01-BThe second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) requires both Russia and the United States to eliminate land-based missile systems that carry thelargest numbers of warheads apiece. Those systems include the Peacekeepermissile for the United States and the SS-18 for Russia\u2014the so-called heavyintercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Many analysts consider STARTII's eradication of all ground-based missiles with multiple warheads a majoraccomplishment. They argue that those warheads\u201410 on each heavy ICBM\u2014are inherently more vulnerable to attack than warheads mounted on submarine-launched missiles, and therefore their very existence is destabilizing. Although START II was ratified by the U.S. Senate in January 1996, it is stalled in the Russian Duma. Duma watchers suggest various explanations forthe delay, including protests against NATO expansion, worries about the finalstatus of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and the perception of inequalities inthe START II treaty that favor the United States. Other analysts suggest thatRussia's economic difficulties will result in unilateral reductions in the coun-try's nuclear arsenal independent of any treaty. The Administration has stated that it intends to continue deploying Peace- keeper until Russia ratifies START II. This option, by contrast, would elimi-nate those missiles by the end of 2003 regardless of the status of START IIratification. Maintaining the 50 deployed Peacekeepers costs a total of about$200 million a year. However, this option would save approximately $5.6billion over a 10-year period compared with remaining at today's START Ilevels. A large part of those savings would come from not buying additionalmissiles for future flight tests. Compared with the Administration's plans forSTART II, which assume the elimination of Peacekeeper by 2007, savings fromthis option would total $800 million. Opponents of this option might argue that only the United States' determi- nation to maintain its stockpiles at START I levels can ensure that Russia willratify START II. Also, unilaterally eliminating Peacekeeper missiles wouldreduce the U.S. arsenal by 500 warheads\u2014or 8 percent of the 6,000 deployedwarheads allowed under START I. Moreover, since the warheads on Peace-keeper are some of the most accurately and quickly delivered ones in the U.S.arsenal, their deterrent value may be greater than that percentage indicates. Conversely, unilateral elimination of Peacekeeper might have a signifi- cant influence on the Russian Duma in ratifying START II. Russia's perceptionof the threat posed by Peacekeeper is probably greatly increased by the coun-try's lack of reliable early-warning information. Thus, getting rid of Peace-keeper could produce a disproportionate increase in Russia's sense of security.For precedent, proponents could cite President Bush's unilateral withdrawal ofsubstantial numbers of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in 1991. Within days ofthat event, Secretary Gorbachev made a similar pledge to remove large num-bers of Soviet tactical weapons.16 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-04 REDUCE THE SCOPE OF DOE'S STOCKPILE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 100 60 2001 150 1202002 220 1902003 290 2602004 360 320 2005 370 360 2006 380 3702007 390 3802008 400 3902009 410 400 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,120 950 2000-2009 3,070 2,850 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-05 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Preserving the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Under a ComprehensiveTest Ban (Paper), May 1997.The Department of Energy (DOE) has developed the Stockpile Stewardship Program to preserve the long-term reliability and safety of U.S. nuclear weap-ons without testing them by exploding them undergro und. To carry out the program, DOE plans to continue operating both of its weapons-design laborato-ries (Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore) and its engineering lab (Sandia). Itwill also construct several new facilities to provide data on the reliability andsafety of nuclear weapons as they age. In addition, DOE will conduct \"zero-yield\" tests at the Nevada Test Site so it can keep enough skilled techniciansthere to be able to resume testing nuclear weapons by exploding them under-ground if the United States decides that doing so is in the national interest\u2014acapability that the President has ordered DOE to retain. DOE plans to spend an average of $2.6 billion a year over the next 10 years on what has historically been known as weapons research, development,and testing. Adjusted for inflation, that amount exceeds spending in 1980,when the United States was maintaining an arsenal of some 25,000 warheadsand designing and building new ones. To some observers, a budget of that sizetoday is excessive and unnecessary. This option would reduce the scope of the stewardship program by consol- idating the two design laboratories and halting all testing activities at the Ne-vada Test Site. However, it would preserve the other elements of the steward-ship program, including the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrotest (DARHT)facility at Los Alamos and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at LawrenceLivermore. Taken together, the changes in this option would reduce employ-ment by about 2,000 people. They would also save $100 million in 2000 andalmost $3.1 billion through 2009 compared with the Administration's 1999budget. Those savings assume that weapons-design activities would be consoli- dated over five years at Los Alamos, which developed most of the weapons thatare likely to remain in the stockpile. Lawrence Livermore's primary focuswould become other scientific research. To ensure that the warheads it devel-oped could be reliably maintained, some designers from Lawrence Livermorewould be relocated to Los Alamos. However, a cadre of wea pons scientists would remain at Livermore to act as an independent review team for Los Al-amos's efforts. To provide them with challenging work, Livermore would keeplarge computational facilities for modeling the complex pr ocesses inside nu- clear weapons and would build NIF as currently planned. (Alternatively, stew-ardship activities could be consolidated at Lawrence Livermore, but the savingswould be lower.) To some people, this option would cut the planned stewardship program too deeply. They believe that the program is the minimum effort necessary tomaintain the nuclear stockpile without underground testing. In their view,scientists will need new facilities to obtain data on reliability that were for-merly provided directly by such testing. They also contend that consolidationwould reduce competition and peer review, result in the loss of some facilitiesFUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 17 that could not easily be transferred, and eliminate Law- rence Livermore's central unifying mission (and thus itsmotivation for excellence). For those reasons, the Presi-dent has directed DOE to retain both labs. Closing theNevada Test Site would increase the time needed to re-sume underground testing if Russia started a new armsrace or the United States discovered a serious problemwith its stockpile that could only be corrected by testing.Closing the test site would also stop scientists from con-ducting \"subcritical\" experiments to learn more abouthow aging affects the plutonium components in nuclearweapons. To other people, this option would not cut deeply enough. In their view, keeping part of a second lab andbuilding DARHT and the $1.2 billion NIF are unneces-sary to support the nuclear stockpile. Furthermore, theyclaim, those facilities might allow DOE scientists to con-tinue designing and testing weapons and circumvent thetest ban. Even if DOE has no such intentions, the per-ception of such a capability could make it difficult toconvince countries such as India, which are critical of the United States' plans to preserve its nuclear weapons un-der a test ban, that the United States has really given updesigning new weapons. Critics also argue that NIFshould be funded outside the nuclear weapons program ifit can help scientists understand how to harness fusion forcivilian energy, as supporters claim. Finally, some analysts are fundamentally opposed to a U.S. moratorium on testing (which will become per-manent if the United States ratifies the ComprehensiveTest Ban Treaty). They contend that the only way to en-sure the reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons is to explodethose weapons underground. They also worry that byhalting the development and testing of new types ofweapons, the United States will lose the skilled peoplenecessary to preserve the stockpile. This option does notaddress the test ban directly, but the cuts it would maketo the laboratories would probably be resisted by test-banopponents.18 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-05 CANCEL DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRITIUM PRODUCTION ACCELERATOR Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 240 150 2001 220 2002002 130 1702003 30 802004 0 20 2005 0 0 2006 0 02007 0 02008 0 02009 0 0 Cumulative 2000-2004 620 620 2000-2009 620 620 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-04 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Estimated Budgetary Effects of Alternatives for Producing Tritium (Letter), August 27, 1998. Preserving the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Under a ComprehensiveTest Ban (Paper), May 1997.Tritium gas is an essential ingredient for nuclear weapons. B ecause the gas, which is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year,the Department of Energy (DOE) must replenish the tritium in U.S. nuclearweapons every several years. That means the department must have access to areliable supply of the gas. The United States has not produced tritium since 1988, when it shut down its last production reactor for safety reasons. Since then, cuts in the size of theU.S. nuclear arsenal have allowed DOE to recycle tritium from weapons that arebeing dismantled. However, if the United S tates keeps its arsenal at the levels specified in the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I)\u2014which is itscurrent policy\u2014it will need new tritium after 2005. For the past several years, DOE has examined several alternatives for pro- ducing tritium, including building a new production accelerator or using com-mercial nuclear reactors owned by utility companies. Recently, it decided infavor of the second approach, using one or more existing reactors operated by theTennessee Valley Authority. But to ensure that the United States w ill have a backup source of tritium if that approach experiences difficulties, DOE willcontinue to design and develop an accelerator, stopping short of actual construc-tion. This option would cancel DOE's efforts to develop the tritium production accelerator as a backup source and ins tead rely entirely on reactors for the na- tion's tritium needs. Doing that would save $240 million in 2000 and about $620million through 2009 compared with DOE's most r ecently released estimate of the cost to develop the accelerator as a backup. Advocates of canceling the ac celerator point out that the technology for producing tritium in nuclear reactors has been well proved over decades. Theycontend that the United States should not continue to fund a technology that has yet to be proved at full scale and is several times more expensive than the reactorapproach. In addition, using commercial reactors allows DOE to produce only asmuch tritium as it needs, when it needs it, wit hout having to invest in costly infrastructure. Canceling further work on the accelerator, however, would eliminate the nation's backup source for tritium. DOE says doing that would be prematureuntil it is certain that all regulatory and political hurdles to using commercialreactors can be addressed. For example, the United States and other proponentsof the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty have for decades encouraged other coun-tries to avoid using commercial reactors for nuclear weapons purposes. A studyby DOE argues that the proliferation issues raised by using a commercial reactorare \"manageable,\" but many people in the nonproliferation community disagree.Besides avoiding that sensitive issue, the accelerator has several other advan-tages. It offers the potential for producing new types of medical isotopes and forconverting nuclear waste to less radioactive forms that are more easily stored andhandled. That potential can only be gauged through further research.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 19 050-06 REDUCE PROCUREMENT OF THE VIRGINIA CLASS NEW ATTACK SUBMARINE Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 0 02002 220 102003 360 802004 610 170 2005 1,850 390 2006 2,050 2,300 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryAs a result of the Quadrennial Defense Review, the Navy is reducing its force of attack submarines from 80 in 1996 to 50 by 2003. To meet that ambitious sched-ule, the Navy is decommissioning some of its Los Angeles class (SSN-688) sub-marines before they reach the end of their 30-year service life. Even as it isdiscarding older subs, though, the Navy is building newer ones. It ordered threeSeawolf class submarines in the late 1980s and 1990s and is procuring the Vir-ginia class New Attack Submarine (NSSN) to be their lower-cost successor. Thereason for the additions is that the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the Navy willneed 10 to 12 very quiet submarines by 2012 to compete with Russia's newestsubs, which have become quieter, making them harder to locate and track. The Virginia class submarine is designed to be as quiet as the Seawolf but will be smaller and slower, carry fewer weapons, and not be able to dive as deep.Although the Seawolf was designed primarily to counter the more severe threatposed by Russian submarines in the open ocean, the Virginia is being developedto operate in coastal waters close to potential regional foes. The Navy ordered the third and last Seawolf in 1996 and the first Virginia in 1998. It plans to buy one Virginia class submarine in 1999, none in 2000, oneeach in 2001 and 2002, none in 2003, and one each in 2004 and 2005. Begin- ning in 2006, the Navy will purchase two or three subs per year. Under thatplan, 14 Virginia class submarines would be authorized between 2000 and 2009.(The President's 2000 budget would add the purchase of one sub in 2003.) This option would save money by keeping the Los Angeles class subma- rines in service until the end of their normal 30-year life and slowing procure-ment of the Virginia class. To help maintain the industrial base for buildingsubs and to modernize the fleet, the option would produce a Virginia in 2001 and2002 as now planned, skip 2003, and then build one per year from 2004 to 2009.At that pace, eight Virginia class subs would be authorized between 2000 and2009. Producing the Virginia at low annual rates would save a total of almost $12 billion over the next 10 years. Most of those savings would occur after 2004,when the submarines would be produced at a lower rate. (The savings shownthrough 2004 reflect fewer long-lead items that would be purchased in thoseyears.) A lower production rate, however, would increase the cost of each sub-marine by roughly $200 million for the eight authorized between 2000 and 2009. During the Congressional debate on producing the third Seawolf, the Navy emphasized that although Russia is financially strapped and therefore cannotoperate its nuclear submarine fleet up to potential, it is s till investing money to buy new, very quiet attack submarines at low rates. The Seawolf and the Vir-ginia would both be quiet enough to m eet the Joint Chiefs' goal of competing with those new Russian subs. Procuring a total of 10 Virginias in addition to thethree Seawolfs would enable the Navy to field a force of 13 very quiet submarinesby 2012, meeting the Joint Chiefs' requirement.20 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-07 REDUCE THE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND AIR WINGS TO 10 Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 1,310 480 2001 4,420 OPTIONS : 050-08 and 050-09 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Improving the Efficiency of Forward Presence by Aircraft Carriers (Paper), August 1996.The aircraft carrier is the centerpiece of the U.S. Navy. The Administration's defense plans call for a fleet of 12 carriers\u201411 active ships plus one, mannedpartly by reserves, that can also be used for training. Those ships will require atotal of 10 active and one reserve air wings to provide combat capability. Theywill also be accompanied by a mix of surface combat ships (usually cruisers anddestroyers) and submarines to attack planes, ships, and subs that threaten thecarriers. The surface combatants and submarines can also attack targets on land. In the aftermath of the Cold War, some policymakers have argued that the United States does not need a force of 12 carriers. The total capability of U.S.tactical aircraft in the Navy and Air Force w ill substan tially exceed that of any regional power that seems potentially hostile. Moreover, the capabilities of U.S.ships are unsurpassed worldwide. This option would immediately r etire one convention ally powered aircraft carrier and one nuclear-powered carrier. By the end of 2000, the Navy wouldhave 10 carriers (nine active ships and one partial reserve carrier for trainingpurposes). In addition, this option would eliminate one active air wing, leaving nine active and one reserve wings to match the number of carriers. Compared with the Administration's planned forces, those cuts could save $1.3 billion in 2000 and $21 billion over the next 10 years. Of that amount, $9 billion would result from not buying new carriers in 2001 and 2006, as nowplanned. The remaining savings of $12 billion would come from reduced operat-ing costs associated with retiring two carriers and an air wing. Those estimatesinclude the cost of decommissioning the retiring ships\u2014roughly $100 millionapiece. (Reducing the number of carriers could also lower the number of surfacecombatants, submarines, and aircraft that the Navy would need to accompanythem. Thus, the Navy might save additional money on procurement and opera-tions by not having to purchase and operate as many other new ships and air-craft. Conversely, the Navy might need those ships to perform other missions,such as forward presence, once it had fewer carriers.) Although reducing the force to 10 carriers might not impair the United States' ability to fight and win two regional wars (according to one analysis bythe Department of Defense), having fewer ships would limit the Navy's ability tokeep three carriers deployed overseas most of the time. That could substantiallyincrease the strain put on the carrier force as long as policymakers continued touse aircraft carriers to respond to crises or to provide U.S. presence overseas asextensively as they have in recent years. With fewer ships av ailable, the time that those ships spent at sea could increase. The high-quality sailors the Navyneeds would therefore spend more time away from their homes and families,perhaps making them less inclined to stay in the service. The Navy might be able to maintain more overseas presence with carriers by bringing new crews to the ships while they were at their foreign posts ratherthan waiting for them to return home. (The Navy does that with some mine-sweepers.) In addition, the Navy could use ships other than carriers (such aslarge flat-deck amphibious vessels or Aegis cruisers) to help maintain U.S. pres-ence overseas.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 21 050-08 REDUCE PROCUREMENT OF DDG-51 DESTROYERS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 810 40 2001 820 2502002 840 4402003 1,060 6402004 0 700 2005 0 530 2006 20 3902007 70 2402008 120 2302009 170 230 Cumulative 2000-2004 3,530 2,070 2000-2009 3,910 3,690 CATEGORY : OPTION : 050-07The DDG-51 destroyers of the Arleigh Burke class would be used in a war to protect aircraft carrier battle groups and to attack land- and sea-based targets.The ships incorporate the Aegis combat system, which is designed to stop attackson a battle group by large numbers of enemy aircraft with antiship missiles, andthe Tomahawk missile, which would attack targets on land. Compared withprevious classes of destroyers, the DDG-51 incorporates other improvements inspeed, weapons, armor, and (to some degree) stealth. The Administration plans to buy 12 more DDG-51s from 2000 through 2003\u2014at a r ate of three per year\u2014before the program ends. Under this option, by contrast, only eight DDG-51s would be bought from 2000 through 2003, at arate of two per year. Purchasing four fewer ships during that period could save $810 million in budget authority in 2000 and $3.9 billion over 10 years\u2014a bout $3.6 billion in procurement costs and $300 million in operating costs. Reducing the number of DDG-51s by four would still leave the Navy with a highly capable force of surface combatants to counter regional threats. With the80 Aegis ships that would eventually be available under this option (27 CG-47Ticonderoga class cruisers, the 45 DDG-51s funded through 1999, and eightfuture DDG-51s), two could be assigned as escorts to each of the 12 aircraftcarrier battle groups, leaving 56 available for independent operations. The Navywould also have large numbers of DD-963 Spruance class destroyers and FFG-7Oliver Perry class frigates for additional antisurface, antisubmarine, and land- attack missions. Some analysts argue, however, that the DDG-51 is not optimally designed to fight in coastal areas. In their view, investing in a new class of ship that isbetter suited for coastal warfare could make more sense than continuing to buyships designed to fight and defeat the Soviet navy. The Navy is designing such anew ship: the DD-21 land-attack destroyer. It is intended to be highly s tealthy, operate relatively close to the shore, and be armed with large numbers of land-attack and antisubmarine weapons. The Navy expects to order the first DD-21 in 2004. The Congress could end the DDG-51 destroyer program now instead of reducing procurement ratesuntil then, as this option envisions, but the industrial base for surface combatantscould suffer. The two shipyards that build destroyers would probably have toreduce their workforce, losing the know-how specific to producing those ships.Rebuilding that workforce or subsidizing it until the DD-21 was ready for pro-duction could prove expensive, especially if the new ship encountered delays inthe design stage. Nevertheless, reducing the number of DDG-51s could have some disadvan- tages as well. It would give the Navy fewer ships that can perform multiplemissions such as strike and antiair, antisurface, and antisubmarine warfare. (TheDD-21 will not have the Aegis antiair combat system.) In addition, although theU.S. Navy is less likely now to confront an opponent (like the Soviet Union)capable of launching saturation attacks against it, combat with regional powers islikely to bring its ships into coastal areas, where they have less time to r eact to threats. In that situation, the Navy could benefit from the quicker reaction of theAegis system.22 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-09 REDUCE PURCHASES OF THE NAVY'S F/A-18E/F Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 874 165 2001 673 3892002 595 5962003 489 5972004 489 552 2000-2009 OPTIONS : 050-07, 050-10, and 050-12 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : A Look at Tomorrow's Tactical Air Forces (Study), January 1997. Letter to the Honorable Curt Weldon regarding the estimatedcost of three tactical aircraft pro-grams to reflect changes resultingfrom the 1997 Quadrennial DefenseReview, July 1998.The F/A-18 is the workhorse of the Navy's fleet of carrier-based fighter air- craft. It has operated from the decks of aircraft carriers since the early 1980sand now makes up almost three-quarters of the fighters in the Navy's air wings.The Marine Corps also uses F/A-18s to provide fighter cover for its expedition-ary forces. The earliest model of the aircraft, the F/A-18A/B, has been gradu-ally replaced with the F/A-18C/D. The last eight C/D models were ordered in1998; those planes will keep the C/D production line open at least through2000. Potential foreign sales might keep that model in production after 2000,but no contracts have been signed. In 1991, the Navy announced plans to develop an E/F variant of the F/A-18, which it began purchasing in 1997. Over the next 10 years, the Navyintends to replace all of its C/D models with E/Fs, for a total purchase of 548E/F models. The E/F features several modifications: a longer fuselage, larger wings, and more powerful engines than the C/D. Those changes should enable the E/Fto carry a larger load of weapons, or carry a combat load a bout 40 percent farther, while retaining most of the speed and maneuverability of the earlierversion. According to Boei ng, the plane's manufacturer, the E/F also has a smaller \"signature\" than its predecessor, which should make it less visible toenemy sensors. With that greater capability comes greater cost. By the Congressional Budget Office's estimate, the E/F version will be 69 percent more expensivethan the C/D model. That higher cost will contribute to the problems that theDepartment of Defense (DoD) is expected to have affording its long-term plansfor tactical aircraft: in addition to buying F/A-18E/Fs for the Navy, the depart-ment plans to purchase sophisticated and costly F-22 fighters for the Air Forceand large numbers of Joint Strike Fighters for both of those services as well asthe Marine Corps. Buying those three types of aircraft would push the share ofservice budgets spent on fighters well above past levels. The Navy could save money by purchasing fewer E/F models and filling out its fleet requirements with F/A-18C/Ds. The resulting, less capable forcemight be acceptable since the fighter fleets that potentially hostile countries canfield for the foreseeable future will have limited capabilities. If the Navy bought no more than 154 F/A-18E/Fs (92 aircraft between 2000 and 2009), it could replace a small part of its fleet with those and replacethe rest with C/Ds. That option would save almost $5.2 billion over the next10 years. Although such savings would make DoD's plans for fighter aircraftmore affordable, losing the increased range and other improvements of the F/A-18E/F could be an unacceptable price. The United States relies solely oncarrier-based aircraft for some of its missions. And the Navy may need planeswith long ranges that can survive in hostile environments for a regional con-flict.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 23 050-10 DEFER PURCHASES OF THE MARINE CORPS'S V-22 AIRCRAFT Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 0 02002 0 02003 0 02004 26 5 2005 637 137 2006 548 3102007 554 4832008 586 5352009 601 560 Cumulative 2000-2004 26 5 2000-2009 2,952 2,030 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-09 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Moving the Marine Corps by Sea in the 1990s (Study), October 1989.The V-22 aircraft, which entered production in 1997, will help the Marine Corps perform its amphibious assault mission (seizing a beachhead in hostile territory)and its subsequent operations ashore. The plane's tilt-rotor technology enables itto take off and land vertically like a helicopter and, by tilting its rotor assembliesinto a horizontal position, to become a propeller-driven airplane when in forwardflight. As a result, the V-22 will be able to fly faster than conventional helicop-ters. The Marine Corps argues that the plane's increased speed and other designfeatures will make it less vulnerable when flying over enemy terrain and willprovide over-the-horizon amphibious assault capability. Despite all of those advantages, the Bush Administration tried to cancel the V-22, largely because of its price tag. Each aircraft bought for the Marine Corpsis expected to have a procurement unit cost of $62 million, on average\u2014consid- erably more than most conventional helicopters. Notwithstanding that cost, theCongress has continued to f und the V- 22, and the Marine Corps plans to buy a total of 360 planes. (The Air Force may eventually buy 50 V-22s for its special-operations forces, and the Navy plans to buy 48 for combat search-and-rescuemissions and for logistics support of its fleet.) The Marine Corps expects, however, to acquire several other planes at the same time. During many of the years that it is purchasing V-22s, the servicealso plans to buy large numbers of Joint Strike Fighters (JSFs) to replace itsshort-range bomber, the AV-8B, and its F/A-18 fighter attack aircraft. JSFs areexpected to be relatively inexpensive as tactical fighters go\u2014costing perhaps 60percent of the price of the Air Force's sophisticated F-22. But when bought in quantity and combined with the cost of the V-22, their purchase would bring peak annual spending on the V-22 and JSF to almost $6 billion\u2014nearly fivetimes the amount requested for Marine Corps combat aircraft in this year's bud-get. If the Marine Corps cannot increase funding for those aircraft, it may haveto modernize either its fighter fleet, its airborne amphibious assault fleet, or bothmore slowly. This option would halve the Marine Corps's annual procurement of V-22s during the 2004-2009 period, when both V-22s and JSFs would be bought. As aresult, the service's average funding requirements during those years woulddecrease to a little over $5 billion. That sum may be more manageable than theMarine Corps's current plan and would save almost $3 billion over 10 years. Deferring purchases of V-22s would have some drawbacks, however. The current amphibious assault fleet is made up of CH-46 and CH-53 helicopters thatare more than 30 years old, on average. The CH-46s would remain in the fleetuntil their average age approached 50 if the V-22s deferred under this optionwere bought beginning in 2013, when V-22 purchases decrease sharply undercurrent plans. (If the Marines had to engage in an extensive modification effortto retain those helicopters longer, the savings shown at left would be lower.)Plus, the amphibious assault fleet provides more unique services than the Corps'sfighter attack fleet. The Marines can probably count on the Navy's carrier-basedF/A-18 aircraft to provide them with additional firepower, but they cannot getaerial amphibious assault assets anywhere else. Also, cutting V-22 purchasesmight decrease the Corps's ability to perform humanitarian missions and otherpeacekeeping activities, which have grown more common in recent years.24 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-11 REDUCE AIR FORCE TACTICAL FORCES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 305 242 2001 629 5432002 649 6152003 2000-2009 6,442 CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-12 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : A Look at Tomorrow's Tactical Air Forces (Study), January 1997.Today's Air Force includes about 20 tactical air wings\u2014roughly 13 on active duty and seven in the part-time reserves. (An Air Force tactical air wing tradi-tionally consists of 72 combat planes, plus another 28 for training and mainte-nance purposes.) Substantial disagreement exists about whether all of those airwings are necessary, since U.S. tactical aircraft enjoy overwhelming superioritycompared with the forces of any regional power that appears potentially hostile tothe United States. This option would reduce the Air Force's tactical fighter forces to 18 air wings by the end of 2000. That pace of reductions should be feasible inasmuchas the Air Force has cut the size of its fleet quickly in the past: it eliminated sixair wings between 1990 and 1992 and another six by the end of 1996. Reducingthe number of Air Force wings from 20 to 18 would lower the service's operatingcosts by $305 million in 2000 and $6.7 billion through 2009. Further savings might be possible if the Air Force accompanied the force reduction with a reorganization that increased the number of planes per squadronand eliminated more squadrons. That practice (known as \"robusting\") allocatesresources more efficiently, since each squadron or wing has high fixed costs.Increasing all Air Force squadrons to 24 planes could add significantly to thesavings shown at left, though only if the Department of Defense (DoD) restruc-tured units and bases to reduce overhead costs. A reduction to 18 Air Force wings might leave the United States with an acceptable number of capable fighters. Even in terms of simple numbers, U.S.fighter inventories exceed those of any potential regional aggressor. Also, U.S.aircraft are more sophisticated than those of potential enemies. However, retaining only 18 wings in the Air Force would not meet the mili- tary's current estimate of its requirements. Today's force planning assumes thatthe United States needs to be able to fight virtually simultaneous wars in tworegions of the world\u2014one in the Middle East and another, perhaps, in Asia.Winning two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts would require a minium of 20air wings, DoD has suggested. Some analysts would also argue that additional cuts in Air Force wings ignore a major lesson from the Persian Gulf War: that aerial bombardment bytactical aircraft can be very effective and may greatly accelerate the end of a war,thus reducing loss of life among U.S. ground troops. A sizable inventory of tacti-cal aircraft\u2014perhaps more than would be maintained under this option\u2014mighttherefore be a wise investment.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 25 050-12 REDUCE PURCHASES OF THE AIR FORCE'S F-22 Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 113 11 2001 268 622002 440 : 050-09, 050-11, and 050-14 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : A Look at Tomorrow's Tactical Air Forces (Study), January 1997.The F-22 is being developed as the Air Force's next premier fighter aircraft. It is scheduled to enter the fleet in about seven years and will replace the F-15. TheAir Force wants the F-22 to cruise at supersonic speeds as well as to be stealthy(that is, more difficult for enemy sensors to detect). F-22s will also have highlyeffective avionics that could make them more capable than other fighters in manytypes of combat. However, the F-22 has experienced repeated delays, reductions in quantity, and increases in price over its almost 20-year development. Early in the pro-gram, the Air Force expected the plane to begin entering its fleet in 1995. Buton the basis of current plans, the aircraft will not be fielded before 2006. Like-wise, in early program plans the Air Force expected to buy more than 700 F-22s.After a series of cuts, the latest plan would buy only 339 aircraft\u2014enough forabout three air wings. That reduction occurred in part because the Air Force cutits number of tactical air wings, but cost increases played a role as well. Suchcuts have increased the unit cost of the F-22. In an early study of the afford-ability of its plans, the Air Force estimated that each F-22 would cost about $75million (in 2000 dollars). Now the service may well pay almost $125 millionapiece (in 2000 dollars) for the plane, even if it makes no further cuts to plannedpurchases. Despite all of those problems, the F-22 is the only tactical fighter program to survive from the Cold War period. The other two fighters that the Departmentof Defense has on its plate\u2014the Joint Strike Fighter and the Navy's F/A-18E/F\u2014entered development after 1990. That fact, combined with the F-22's complexdesign, has led some people to suggest that the F-22 is a legacy of the Cold War\u2014a plane designed to fight hordes of sophisticated Soviet fighters rather than themodest regional fighter forces it is more likely to encounter today. As a result,they recommend canceling the F-22, or at least making further reductions toplanned procurement. This option would follow in the Air Force's footsteps and decrease the quantity procured, in this case by 219 planes. As a result, a total of 120 F-22swould be bought under this option, enough to let the Air Force field an air wingof the sophisticated fighters. The option assumes that the 219-plane cut wouldbe evenly distributed over the F-22's purchase period. Cutting those planeswould save $113 million in budget authority in 2000 and about $21 billion overthe 2000-2009 period. Such a \"silver-bullet\" purchase could still provide enough F-22s to perform those missions for which the service might need the plane's level of stealth andother performance advantages over existing Air Force aircraft. It might alsopermit the manufacturer and the Air Force to learn how to build and operate aplane as complex as the F-22. But it would make the Air Force's fighter fleets,which are already aging under current plans, even older. Buying 219 F-15s toreplace the cut in F-22 purchases would remedy that problem, however. Al-though the F-15 is much less capable than the F-22, it is far more capable thanthe fighters of almost any of the United States' regional adversaries. A one-for-one offset of F-15s for F-22s would lower the total savings from this option to$9 billion.26 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-13 CREATE COMMON NATO AIRLIFT AND CUT U.S. C-17 COSTS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 0 02002 1,879 1802003 909 6972004 380 934 2005 286 786 2006 215 5862007 190 403 2008 196 316 248 Cumulative 2000-2004 3,168 1,811 2000-2009 4,258 4,150 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-14 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Moving U.S. Forces: Options for Strategic Mobility (Study), February 1997.

Because it is designed to land at sm all airfields with short runways, the C-17 could help meet trans port needs within a th eater of combat as well as over long distances. The current plan for transporting U.S. forces to regional conflictscalls for a fleet of 120 C-17s. At the same time, seven of the United States' Euro-pean allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are planning tobuy a total of 289 transport aircraft to carry reaction forces to crisis spots outsidethe territory of NATO members, in accordance with NATO's Strategic Concept. This option would create a common NATO airlift fleet of 20 C-17s (similar to the common NATO AWACS fleet based in Germany, for which the UnitedStates pays 41.5 percent of oper ating and modernization costs). Twenty C-17s that the Air Force plans to buy in 2002 and 2003 would be transferred to NATO,which would reimburse the Air Force for them by the beginning of each year inorder to comply with full-funding requirements. The average cost of thoseplanes is about $200 million apiece. A common NATO airlift fleet would enable the allies to deploy forces to a crisis zone, while allowing the Un ited States to draw on those assets for non- NATO missions under the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept approvedin 1996. That concept allows NATO members\u2014with consensus from the alli-ance\u2014to use NATO assets for missions other than defense of a member state. Assuming that the United States paid 41.5 percent of the cost of the NATO airlift fleet, this option would achieve net savings for the country of $3.2 bi llion over five years and $4.3 billion over 10 years, including net savings of $200million per year in operation and support costs once all 20 aircraft were deliv-ered. It also would give the European allies faster access to str ategic airlift than would otherwise be the case. This option would face two main obstacles, however. The first is the Euro- pean countries' desire to protect their defense industries by building their ownstrategic transport plane. The seven countries involved have committed to a jointprogram to develop the Future Large Aircraft (FLA), to be produced by theAirbus consortium. That plane would carry less cargo than the C-17 and becheaper (at $75 million ap iece). Alternatively, the Europeans could consider buying Airbus commercial aircraft, although such planes are more difficult to load and unload, cannot carry very large cargo, and cannot land on some shorteror unpaved runways. Enthusiasm for developing the FLA is waning, however.In an indication that they will consider alternatives, Britain, France, Spain, andBelgium have all solicited bids from U.S. firms for a total of 143 aircraft, andBritain intends to lease four C-17s or their equivalent. The second obstacle involves the political ramifications of relying on NATO to provide part of the U.S. Air Force's lift capability. The CJTF concept,designed to let European coalitions act without U.S. involvement, is new andevolving. Conceivably, if a NATO member opposed a mission (such as Franceopposing military action against Iraq), it might be able to veto U.S. use of NATOassets. Some Members of Congress might find that saving money would notoutweigh the risk of diminishing the U.S. ability to act unilaterally if necessary.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 27 050-14 DEFER PROCUREMENT OF TACTICAL AIRLIFT Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 195 19 2001 199 822002 138 1342003 143 1432004 0 130 2005 0 84 2006 0 432007 0 222008 0 82009 0 4 Cumulative 2000-2004 675 508 2000-2009 675 669 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 050-12 and 050-13The C-130 Hercules is an airlift plane that the Air Force uses to transport cargo and supplies within a theater of operations. The C-130 is much smaller thanstrategic airlifters like the C-17 or C-5, which can carry about three times moreweight over much longer distances, and it cannot carry the largest types of equip-ment. Still, the C-130 remains the critical element of the Air Force's tactical air-lift fleet, with 236 E models (some dating back to the early 1960s) and 286newer H models in service. To produce the version that the Air Force is now buying, the J model, Lockheed Martin took the basic airframe of the C-130 and upgraded some of theplane's systems. For example, the C-130J includes a new engine that is morepowerful and fuel efficient and an integrated avionics system that eliminates theneed for a flight engineer. The Air Force plans to replace the least reliable 150 of its current C-130s with J models and modernize the rest through the so-calledC-130X program. That modernization would standardize the C-130 fleet byinstalling a common cockpit and would upgrade avionics, including a naviga-tional system required by international air traffic management accords. For 1999, the Congress continued a pattern of authorizing a larger pur- chase of C-130s than the Administration requested\u2014three J models rather thanthe one that the Air Force asked for. The Air Force has not adjusted its plans toreflect those additional aircraft. Its plans call for no C-130Js in 2000 and 2001, two each in 2002 and 2003, eight in 2004, and 10 in 2005. This option would postpone procurement of C-130Js until 2004. Compared with the recent history of Congressional appropriations for the aircraft, thatpostponement would save a total of $675 million in budget authority, resulting inoutlay savings of $508 million over five years and $669 million over 10 years. The C-130J is now being produced for foreign sales, but Lockheed is close to completing those orders. The President's 2000 budget does not call for anyC-130J purchases by the Air Force in 2000 or 2001, despite reports that large-scale procurement might be accelerated from 2004 to 2000 to avoid possiblecosts from shutting down and reopening the production line. The Air Force saysa temporary shutdown of C-130J production would also affect the cost of theF-22 fighter, which is built at the same plant. (Any additional costs for F-22s arenot included in the estimates of savings from this option.) Critics of deferring C-130J acquisition might argue that it would leave the Air Force with a less capable fleet of intratheater airlift planes. Ultimately, anolder fleet could prove more expensive to operate and support. Lockheed Martincontends that the annual cost of operating and supporting a C-130J will be lowerthan for older C-130s because it has a smaller crew and is easier to maintain. Although the average C-130E is more than 30 years old, it has flown an average of 21,875 hours\u2014well below its planned 40,000-hour service life. TheAir Force had not planned to begin retiring those older C-130s until 2002, butthe additional unrequested authorizations by the Congress have led to decisionsto retire some of the planes with years of service life remaining. Since the AirForce flies its C-130Es an average of 567 hours per year for active-duty forcesand 425 hours to 450 hours per year for reserve crews, it should be able to retainmost of those planes well past 2004.28 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-15 CANCEL THE ARMY'S COMANCHE HELICOPTER PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 80 94 2001 326 2962002 353 3952003 291 3792004 285 322 2005 : Discretionary RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : An Analysis of U.S. Army Helicop- ter Programs (Study), December 1995.Many of the Army's helicopters are beyond the end of their useful service life. Initially, the Army had planned to replace some of those older scout, attack, andutility helicopters with more than 5,000 new Comanche (RAH-66) helicopters.Comanche has had a troubled development program, however. The utilityversion of the helicopter was dropped in 1988 because the program had becometoo costly. In 1990, the size of the planned purchase was reduced from morethan 2,000 aircraft to just under 1,300. Later, the Army delayed the projectedstart of Comanche production from 1996 to 2005. And last December, theArmy requested another restructuring of the program, which could further af-fect its schedule. Those changes in the objectives and size of the Comanche program have caused the procurement cost per helicopter to nearly double since the programbegan\u2014from $11.5 million (in 1999 dollars) in 1985 to $21.2 million, based oncurrent Army estimates. With that cost growth, Comanche is now more expen-sive than the Army's Apache (AH-64) attack helicopter. That cost increase isparticularly significant for a helicopter whose development was originally justi-fied on the basis of its being less expensive to buy, operate, and maintain thanother attack helicopters. Moreover, the General Accounting Office and theDepartment of Defense's Inspector General (DoD IG) have stated that costscould grow by as much as another 30 percent. Comanche's high cost calls intoquestion the prudence of pursuing this as-yet-undeveloped aircraft instead ofcontinuing to buy existing, less costly helicopters. The primary advantage of Comanche over existing aircraft is its sophisti- cated stealth, avionics, and aeronautics technologies. However, some analystswould argue that the helicopter, which was conceived at the height of the ColdWar, will no longer face threats of the same scale or sophistication as those forwhich it was designed. According to the DoD IG, the Army has not reexam-ined the mission requirements for Comanche in any depth since the end of theCold War. Comanche is intended both to serve as a scout for Apache and to fillthe scout and light attack role independently. But whether Comanche reallydoes have a unique role to play in Army aviation is unclear. The Army is plan-ning to use Apaches in both scout and attack roles for the next 15 to 20 years,as it did successfully during the Persian Gulf War. The Army also used armedscout helicopters, known as Kiowa Warriors, in the Persian Gulf both as scoutsfor Apache and as light attack aircraft. This option would cancel the Comanche program. The Army has already purchased enough Apaches to fill the attack role assigned to 13 of its 18 divi-sions, but it does need to replace the aging Cobras assigned to the attack avia-tion units of the remaining divisions. This alternative would buy 519 KiowaWarriors by the end of 2009 to replace the Cobras still in service. Net savingswould total about $6.2 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Some of the savingscould be used to fund a program to continue development of advanced helicop-ter technologies. Abandoning the Comanche program, however, would meanthat the Army would have to rely on helicopters designed in the 1960s and1970s for years to come.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 29 050-16 CANCEL THE ARMY'S CRUSADER ARTILLERY PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 170 98 2001 429 3052002 453 3812003 428 3552004 626 439 2005 589 430 2006 832 5242007 595 6662008 623 CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Army plans to invest $13.5 billion (in 1999 dollars) to develop and procure the Crusader artillery system for rapidly deployable and forward-deployed forces. The Crusader\u2014which includes a self-propelled howitzer and a resup-ply vehicle\u2014is considered by the Army to be technologically advanced andsignificantly more effective than the service's current artillery systems. Supporters cite several reasons why Crusader is needed. The Paladin, the Army's most modern artillery system, is too slow to keep up when armoredforces advance. Its range is shorter than that of several foreign systems avail-able to potential adversaries. And Paladin's peak firing rate of four rounds perminute is significantly slower than the 10 to 12 rounds per minute that theArmy says it needs. Crusader's current design includes an automated resupplysystem, which makes a higher firing rate possible and reduces the crew size tosix from Paladin's nine. Crusader is also designed with more sophisticatedautomation and better crew protection. Some observers, however, question whether a heavy system such as Cru- sader has a role in the lighter, more mobile force envisioned for the futureArmy. Some analysts also question how much improvement Crusader willactually deliver. Crusader may only be 9 kilometers per hour faster than Pala-din. And it has already encountered some technical difficulties. The originalconcept called for a gun using liquid propellant. The Army had to abandon thattechnology in 1 996 because of technical and schedule problems. Some Cru- sader subsystems embody technological innovations that have not yet beenproved, and some have no backups in case of failure. For example, if the auto-matic munition reloader fails, Crusader will not be able to fire at all si nce it cannot be loaded manually. Those technical risks could prevent Crusader frommeeting some of the Army's key requirements. If it failed to do so, Crusadercould be no more effective than currently available systems. Although no existing alternative system meets all of the Army's require- ments, some could meet many of those requirements and offer significant im-provements over Paladin. A recent report by the General Accounting Officeidentified the German PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer or an improved Pala-din system as viable alternatives to Crusader. The PzH 2000, for example,fires eight to 10 rounds per minute, and its cross-country speed of 45 kilometersper hour is within the range required for Crusader. This option would cancel the Crusader program and provide funds to procure 815 PzH 2000 systems with resupply vehicles. That purchase of a newsystem could hedge against potential threats while freeing $5.3 billion for theArmy to pursue other promising technologies. For fire support in fast-movingadvances, the Army could rely on those newer systems or on the multiple-launch rocket system, which it used successfully in that role during the PersianGulf War.30 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-17 CANCEL THE ARMY'S TANK UPGRADE PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 642 94 2001 356 3442002 495 4182003 513 4512004 197 441 2005 101 298 2006 -12 1542007 -9 2,263 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Alternatives for the U.S. Tank Industrial Base (Paper), February 1993.The shrinking of the U.S. military\u2014coupled with the disappearance of a long- time foe and the unprecedented peacetime investment in modern weapons thatoccurred in the 1980s\u2014has sharply reduced the n eed for new wea pons. In particular, the Army now has enough of the latest type of tank, the Abrams, toequip the forces it plans to field for the foreseeable future. As a result, theArmy does not intend to buy new tanks for at least the next 15 years. Instead, the Army has proposed upgrading about 1,000 M1s (the first model of the Abrams) to a later configuration, designated the M1A2. Theupgrade program, which began in 1991 and ends in 2003, has two major goals:to increase the capability of Army tanks and to keep the facilities that producetanks in business pending the need for a new tank to repl ace the Abrams. (Most of those facilities are owned by the government and operated by privatecontractors.) During the Bush Administration, the Army advocated closing the tank production line and pu tting it in mothballs. In March 1992, General Colin Powell, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified that the Army'scurrent tank was the best in the world. That statement runs counter to theArmy's current rationale for upgrading tanks, which is that it needs better ones.Indeed, although the M1A2 is 20 percent more capable than the M1 model (asmeasured by one scoring system developed for the Defense Department), con-verting 1,000 M1s to M1A2s would increase the total capability of the Army's7,880 Abrams tanks by only 3 percent. That slight increase in capability wouldcome at a high price\u2014a total of about $3 billion over the next 10 years. This option would cancel the Army's upgr ade program but would keep some of the major components of the tank industrial base in a mothballed sta-tus. By preserving production facilities, the United States would retain thecapability to make new or existing types of tanks in the future. Mothballing thegovernment-owned facilities would require an initial investment. But aftertaking those costs into account, this option would still save $642 million in2000 and a total of $2.3 billion over 10 years. Closing the tank production line would have some disadvantages, how- ever. Without an upgrade program, the U.S. inventory would include fewer ofthe most capable M1A2 tanks. As regional powers acquired better tanks, theabsence of M1A2s might erode the United States' advantage in a war, eventhough the M1A1 remains a highly capable tank. Perhaps the most importantdrawback of this option is that some companies that manufacture tank compo-nents might close and thus be unavailable to produce tanks in the event of acrisis. A related concern is the potential loss of workers whose skills areunique to tank manufacturing.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 31 050-18 RESTRUCTURE OFFICER ACCESSION PROGRAMS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 69 67 2001 128 1262002 183 1812003 221 2202004 228 228 2005 234 234 2006 240 2402007 247 2472008 253 2532009 259 259 Cumulative 2000-2009 2,062 2,055 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryIn recent years, the military services have slightly increased their annual num- ber of officer accessions (new officers who enter the service). This optionwould keep overall accessions at the level planned by the Department of De-fense but would alter the sources of new officers. Specifically, it would drawmore officers from lower-cost commissioning programs\u2014the Reserve OfficerTraining Corps (ROTC) and Officers Candidate Sc hool/Officer Training School (OCS/OTS)\u2014and fewer from the more costly service academies. Inaddition, it would place a ceiling on the amount that could be spent on each ROTC scholarship recipient. Those changes would save $69 million in 2000and a total of nearly $2.1 billion through 2009. At present, each service academy graduates slightly fewer than 1,000 second lieutenants or ensigns a year. This option would reduce that number to625 by cutting the size of the entering class for the three academies from acombined total of nearly 3,000 to 1,875. The estimated savings from that ac-tion reflect only the costs that would change in the near term, such as operatingexpenses and pay for faculty and cadets. (Those savings would be partiallyoffset by additional costs of about $122 million over five years to procure offi-cers from OCS/OTS and ROTC to replace those from the academies.) In thelonger term, savings might also accrue from changes in the academies' physicalplant. Supporters of the service academies have contended that they are neces- sary to produce future military leaders. That argument has not persuaded mostMembers of Congress, but past attempts to impose cuts at the academies havebeen only partly successful. Although class size has declined modestly, acad-emy graduates account for a larger share of officer accessions now than in theearly 1980s (14 percent versus 9 percent). This option would restore the acces-sion percentage of academy graduates to its 1980 level by 2002. There is littleevidence that the academies have already reduced their class size to the mini-mally efficient level, as supporters have claimed in arguing that further cutswould not produce savings. Proponents of the option point out that taking a smaller share of the offi- cer corps from the academies would lead to more diversity, since relativelymore officers would come from ROTC and OCS/OTS. Moreover, they con-tend, the military has drawn much greater percentages of its officers from thosesources in the past without any loss of effectiveness.32 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-19 REVISE COST SHARING FOR MILITARY HEALTH BENEFITS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 460 388 2001 584 5522002 591 5802003 598 Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-20 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Restructuring Military Medical Care (Paper), July 1995.Some 7.7 million active-duty service members, military retirees, and their fami- lies in the United States are eligible to use the military health care system, yetonly 5.4 million actually do. Because the Department of Defense (DoD) does notrequire users to enroll, many of them choose to seek military care on a case-by-case basis to augment other insurance coverage. Thus, military planners facemajor uncertainties about their patient load and health care costs each year. The military health system offers three types of coverage: Tricare Prime, a plan similar to health maintenance organizations; Tricare Standard, a traditionalfee-for-service insurance program; and Tricare Extra, a preferred provider op-tion. Beneficiaries must enroll in Tricare Prime if they wish to use it, but theymay use Tricare Standard or Extra without enrolling. This option would make three changes to that system. First, all beneficia- ries (except those on Medicare) would have to enroll in either Tricare Prime orStandard before using the military health care system. The annual enrollment feefor Tricare Prime would remain the same (zero for active-duty personnel andtheir families and $230 for single coverage or $460 for family coverage for retir-ees). Under Tricare Standard, however, active-duty personnel would pay no feebut retirees would pay $115 a year for single or $230 for family coverage. Sec- ond, DoD would adjust enrollment fees for inflation by the annual rate of changein the consumer price index. Thi rd, users of Tr icare Prime would pay copay- ments at military facilities for outpatient care and prescription drugs, just as theydo at civilian providers. In addition, all retirees (regardless of the plan theyused) would pay small copayments if they received care at military facilities. Together, those three changes would lower discretionary appropriations by $460 million in 2000 and $6 billion through 2009. The savings would stem fromenrollment fees, increased copayment charges, and more prudent use of care bybeneficiaries. This estimate assumes that the Congress would reduce DoD'sappropriations by the amount of revenue collected under the option. However, ifthe Congress revoked DoD's automatic reimbursement authority, the estimatewould take the form of an offset to mandatory spending. By requiring beneficiaries to enroll, this option would help DoD identify who uses its system. Military providers need to plan for the health care needs ofa defined population to develop per capita budgets and build cost-effective deliv-ery networks. (Such savings, however, are not included in this estimate.) Proponents could argue that the value of DoD's health benefits has risen with advances in medical technology, so users should expect to bear some of theassociated cost, just as employees of private firms have. In addition, chargingcopayments would help curb excessive use of services by creating the same incen-tives for beneficiaries who receive care on-base as for those who use civ ilian providers. It would also eliminate the inequity of providing more generous bene-fits to people who live near a military hospital or clinic. On the negative side, military families and retirees would view higher charges as an erosion of their benefits. Retention and morale might suffer, eventhough this option would still offer service members and their families moregenerous health benefits than many government or private-sector employers do.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 33 050-20 DOWNSIZE THE MILITARY MEDICAL SYSTEM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 247 98 2001 847 Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-19 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Restructuring Military Medical Care (Paper), July 1995.The extensive medical system run by the Department of Defense (DoD) is the chief source of health care for some 5.4 million people in the United States.DoD argues that the system is necessary to ensure care for service members inwartime. During peacetime, military medical personnel train for war and pro-vide care for active-duty members, their dependents, and retirees and their fami-lies. This option would substantially reduce the size of the military health sys-tem and instead rely on the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) programfor most peacetime care. During the Cold War, military medical requirements for wartime were based on the scenario of a large conventional conflict in Europe. But DoD'smore recent planning scenarios have led to sharp reductions in medical require-ments. Today, between military facilities, hospitals run by the Department ofVeterans Affairs (VA), and civilian facilities that have agreed to provide beds inthe event of a national emergency, the United States has more than twice thehospital capacity needed to meet wartime demand. According to a 1995 study by RAND, DoD could eliminate all but 11 of its 80 U.S. hospitals (reducing the wartime capacity by more than two-thirds)and still be able to meet about 60 percent of its total wartime requirement for9,000 beds. That is a much higher percentage than it met during the Cold War.Civilian and VA hospitals, which only fill about 60 percent to 70 percent of theircapacity, on average, would provide the remaining beds during wartime. Carrying out such an aggressive restructuring of the military medical sys- tem would offer substantial savings: $98 million in outlays in 2000 and nearly$35 billion through 2009. Those estimates reflect both the savings from operat-ing a smaller military system and the costs of providing coverage under theFEHB program for beneficiaries other than active-duty service members. (DoDwould pay the same share of the premiums for FEHB health plans that the fed-eral government pays for employees at other agencies.) DoD has no plans to make such deep cuts to its health care system. Mili- tary medical officials argue that their facilities and the care they provide inpeacetime are essential for recruiting and training physicians and ensuring medi-cal readiness. Downsizing that system to such an extent would require DoD tomodify the way it trains and prepares for wartime. For example, it would need tostrengthen ties with the civilian sector to provide wartime training for militarymedical personnel and to ensure an adequate supply of wartime beds. Critics of this option might also point out that enrolling in a plan offered by the FEHB program would require beneficiaries to pay substantially more outof pocket, on average, than they do now for care in the military system. Never-theless, some FEHB plans would offer improved coverage and so might beworth the higher out-of-pocket costs. Moreover, the value of DoD's health bene-fits has grown dramatically with advances in technology and medical practices.Thus, it might be reasonable for military beneficiaries to share more of the costsassociated with those advances\u2014as many people covered by employer-spon-sored plans in the private sector already do.34 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-21 CLOSE AND REALIGN ADDITIONAL MILITARY BASES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 0 02002 -539 Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-25 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Review of The Report of the Department of Defense on BaseRealignment and Closure (Letter), July 1998. Closing Military Bases: An Interim Assessment (Paper), December 1996.Beginning in the late 1980s, the Department of Defense (DoD) sought to re- duce its operating costs by closing unneeded military bases. Significant reduc-tions in force structure at the end of the Cold War made many bases unneces-sary. Because political and procedural difficulties had long made closing basesnearly impossible, the Congress set up four successive independent commis-sions on base realignment and closure (or BRAC). Those commissions recom-mended shutting or realigning (moving departments and facilities at) hundredsof military installations in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Guam. When allof the actions from the four BRAC rounds are completed, DoD will save about$5.6 billion a year in operating costs, it estimates. This option would authorize two additional rounds of base closures and realignments. In the long run, such actions can produce substantial savings.However, they require some up-front investment, so costs would increase in theshort run. Between 2000 and 2009, this option would reduce DoD's costs by anet total of $4 billion. Beginning in 2012, the department could realize recur-ring savings of around $4 billion per year. Those estimates are based on DoD'sexperience and current projections for the four earlier rounds of base closings.(The estimates do not include the costs of environmental cleanup, since DoD isobligated to incur such costs regardless of whether it operates or closes bases.) Closing and realigning additional military bases is consistent with DoD's overall drawdown of forces. By several measures, planned force reductionssignificantly exceed the projected decrease in base capacity. For example, thedepartment intends to cut the number of military and civilian personnel by 34percent from the 1990 level. But according to DoD, when all of the previouslyagreed base closures and realignments have been carried out, the military willstill have about 23 percent more base capacity than it needs. The Secretary of Defense asked the Congress in early 1998 to authorize two more rounds of base closures. In The Report of the Department of De- fense on Base Realignment and Closure of April 1998, DoD stated that oppor- tunities exist for further cutbacks and consolidations at several types of bases\u2014such as defense laboratories, test and evaluation installations, training facili-ties, naval bases, aircraft installations, and supply facilities. Although some analysts believe that DoD should further reduce the num- ber of military bases, others feel that the BRAC cuts have gone far enough inmatching the planned reductions in forces. The base structure, they say, shouldretain enough excess capacity to accommodate new risks to national securitythat could require a surge in the number of military forces. Opponents of moreclosures also cite the possible economic effects on local communities. Somesuggest that savings could be made by demolishing certain buildings or byachieving other operating efficiencies short of closing bases.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 35 050-22 INCREASE COMPETITION BETWEEN DoD AND PRIVATE-SECTOR HOUSING Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 576 29 2001 588 2502002 601 4172003 614 4992004 : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-26 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Military Family Housing in the United States (Study), September 1993.Most military fam ilies receive cash allowances for housing and rent or purchase dwellings in the private sector. About one-third, however, live rent-free in on-basehousing provided by the Department of Defense (DoD). It costs the federal govern-ment about 35 percent more to provide a housing unit than it costs to rent a compara-ble unit in the private sector. Despite the cost, DoD does not plan to phase out itsinventory of housing. Instead, the department is experimenting with public/privatepartnerships that could provide private capital to replace or revitalize on-base hous-ing units, many of which are nearing the end of their service life. Those partnershipsare proceeding more slowly than planned, however, leaving many families in sub-standard units. Moreover, it is uncertain whether such partnerships will reduce thelong-run costs to DoD of providing housing. One reason that DoD provides housing is that on-base units are in high demand among military families. That demand partly reflects the benefits of the on-baselifestyle. But survey data show that the low cost of on-base units to service membersis an even more important factor. The allowance that families living in DoD housingforfeit (in effect, the rent they pay) equals only about 60 percent of the costs that thefederal government incurs in providing a unit. This option would reduce the demand for on-base housing by requiring it to compete with private-sector housing. All m ilitary fam ilies would receive the cash allowance and be free to choose between DoD and private-sector units. DoD\u2014andany firms providing housing in partnership with it\u2014would act like a private landlord,setting rents for on-base units at market-clearing levels (levels at which there wouldbe neither excess vacancies nor waiting lists). They would revitalize or replace anon-base housing unit only if its value to service members (the market-clearing rent itcould command) was sufficient to cover both operating costs and amortized capitalcosts. That criterion would limit DoD to revitalizing or replacing only about 25percent of its existing housing stock, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.Over the long run, DoD and its partners would cease to provide units in marketswhere they could not successfully compete with private-sector housing. Total savings from this option could amount to more than $6 billion through 2009. The primary source of savings would be lower revitalization and replacementcosts as DoD retired aging units rather than investing in ones that could not covertheir costs in competition with private-sector housing. Additional savings mightresult from more efficient management as on-base units were forced to compete withprivate housing. The housing costs that service members pay out of pocket wouldnot change. If the rents paid to DoD exceeded the housing allowances paid to mem-bers living in DoD units, the excess would be returned to service members as awhole through an increase in allowance rates. This option would let DoD focus on its warfighting mission rather than on real estate management. The change would eliminate waiting lists for on-base units andequalize the value of the housing benefits that DoD provides to families living on-and off-base. Nonetheless, families that chose to live on-base would face highercosts than they do today. In addition, this option would represent a significant breakwith military tradition. As a result, it could have a negative impact on morale unlessit received strong public support from senior military leaders.36 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-23 TRANSFER COMMISSARY OPERATIONS TO A DoD-WIDE EXCHANGE SYSTEM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 930 709 2001 Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-24 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : The Costs and Benefits of Retail Activities at Military Bases (Study), October 1997.The Department of Defense (DoD) operates two separate retail systems on its military bases for the benefit of current and retired service members and theirfamilies. One is a system of commissaries (supermarkets) that relies on an an-nual appropriated subsidy of about $1 billion. The other system, which doesnot directly receive appropriated funds, consists of the military exchanges thatprovide general retail stores and consumer services. Commissaries are part of afederal agency (the Defense Commissary Agency), whereas exchanges (which areorganized under the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Navy ExchangeCommand, and the Marine Corps's exchanges) are nonappropriated-fund instru-mentalities of the federal government. As a result, the employees of exchangesare not members of the civil service, and their managers are not constrained byall of the rules that govern federal agencies. This option would save almost $12 billion between 2000 and 2009 by consolidating all exchanges and commissaries under a DoD-wide nonappro-priated-fund retail entity and then gradually phasing out the commissary subsidy.Greater efficiency in DoD's retail operations would offset much of the lost sub-sidy. Consolidation would eliminate duplicative systems for distribution, pur-chasing, and personnel management. It would also free on-base grocery storesfrom the requirement to employ civil service personnel and from appropriated-fund acquisition rules, thus reducing their operating costs by between $140million and $280 million annually. More efficient operations would not entirely make up for the loss of the appropriated subsidy; some price increases at on-base stores would also beneeded. Thus, one major disadvantage of this option is that it would reduce thebenefits that on-base shopping provides to military personnel. Nonetheless,recent trends in costs and sales at commissaries suggest that the benefits theyoffer may no longer justify the cost of their subsidy. Between 1990 and 1998,the appropriated-fund subsidy rose from 17 percent of commissary sales to 19percent. Moreover, the level of commissary sales\u2014perhaps the most candidindex of the stores' value to their customers\u2014continues to fall. Sales declined bymore than 20 percent between 1994 and 1998 (after adjusting for inflation),although the number of patrons with un limited access to commissaries fell by only about 2 percent during that period. Co mmissaries in some parts of the country are finding it hard to compete with private grocers who offer store-brandproducts at low prices, warehouse format, long hours, and varied services. One recent survey found that commissaries pay significantly more than the Army and Air Force Exchange Service for the same goods. Thus, much of thecommissary subsidy may be going to benefit commissary suppliers rather thanpatrons. Military families might be attracted to a system of exchange-operatedgrocery stores that could obtain goods at lower prices and offer consumers theirchoice of name-brand or store-brand items, a variety of products and services ina single location, and convenient hours. Over the long run, this option might bea way to ensure continued access to on-base shopping for current and retiredservice members.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 37 050-24 CONSOLIDATE AND ENCOURAGE EFFICIENCIES IN MILITARY EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 59 45 2001 83 742002 109 1002003 112 1092004 116 114 2005 119 118 2006 123 1222007 127 1262008 131 1302009 134 133 Cumulative 2000-2004 479 440 2000-2009 1,115 1,068 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-23 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : The Costs and Benefits of Retail Activities at Military Bases (Study), October 1997.The Department of Defense's (DoD's) three military exchange systems\u2014the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Navy Exchange Command, and theMarine Corps system\u2014provide a wide array of retail stores and consumer ser-vices at military bases. With combined annual sales of approximately $9 billion,operating costs of about $2 billion, and 80,000 employees, the exchanges consti-tute one of the largest retail businesses in the United States. The Congress does not directly appropriate funds to the exchanges, but DoD provides them with about $400 million worth of free services each year.Those services include maintaining the exterior of exchange buildings (such asroofs, windows, and heating and cooling systems), transporting goods overseas,and providing utilities at overseas stores. The exchanges' federal status offersother advantages as well: DoD exchanges are exempt from state and local excisetaxes, have a monopoly over on-base sales of goods and services, and have ac-cess to free land and interest-free capital. Those exemptions and other subsidiesare worth more than $1 billion a year, the Congressional Budget Office esti-mates. A portion of that annual subsidy is translated into lower prices for military personnel and their families and into exchange earnings that support the services'morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) programs. Yet another portion is ab-sorbed by inefficiencies. Private retailers in the United States must be efficientto survive in the face of competition. The subsidies that exchanges receive, bycontrast, alleviate the pressure of competition and allow the exchanges to operatein ways that private retailers could not afford to. For example, although econo-mies of scale in the private sector often force private retailers to merge, DoD'sthree exchange systems remain separate\u2014despite studies that have repeatedlyshown that consolidation would reduce operating costs. Subsidies also distortthe incentives that exchange managers face. Because DoD provides free utilitiesoverseas, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service can operate an ice creamproduction line in Germany without regard to utility costs. And because DoDpays to transport goods overseas, the exchanges can ship beer and carbonatedbeverages abroad rather than buying them locally. This option would consolidate the three exchange systems into a single entity and introduce incentives for more efficient operations. Rather than receiveDoD support services free of charge, the exchanges would receive a lump-sumappropriation equal to the historical cost of those services and would (like DoD'sindustrially f unded activ ities) reimburse the providers of those services. Over the long run, consolidating the three exchange systems could save about $50million a year in overhead costs. Requiring the exchanges to reimburse DoD forsupport services would save another $40 million a year if it induced the ex-changes to reduce the costs of those activities by 10 percent. In all, savingswould total $1.1 billion between 2000 and 2009. Initially, the savings mightprovide additional funding for MWR activities. Over the long run, the increasein exchange earnings would allow DoD to provide its planned level of MWRactivities with less support from appropriated funds.38 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-25 DEMOLISH OBSOLETE AND EXCESS STRUCTURES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 -49 -36 2001 -37 -392002 -24 -262003 -11 -132004 51 36 2005 52 52 2006 53 532007 54 542008 56 552009 57 56 Cumulative 2000-2004 -69 -79 2000-2009 203 192 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 050-21This option would accelerate the demolition and disposal of various excess, obsolete structures owned by the Department of Defense (DoD). Such struc-tures include military family housing, defense agency facilities, and runways,piers, towers, and fuel tanks. Although demolition would entail up-front costs,DoD would eventually save money because of the reduced costs for mainte-nance, utilities, and security. Estimates by DoD suggest that demolition pro-jects pay for themselves in just five years and then continue to produce savings. The defense drawdown has left excess structures at military bases. Many are in poor repair and have no remaining asset value. In some cases, they aredangerous eyesores; in others, the structures attract marginal users who benefitfrom occupying them only because the users are not required to pay the fullcosts of the utilities and other support that the base provides. DoD currentlymaintains about 32 percent more square feet of facilities per full-time worker(active duty and civilian) than it did in 1989. In accordance with a management reform initiated by the Office of the Secretary of Defense in 1997, each of the military services has developed ademolition program. Those programs could result in the elimination of 80million square feet of excess, obsolete buildings by 2003 and lead to annualrecurring savings of $160 million. However, that initiative did not addressexcess, obsolete facilities occupied by the defense agencies (including the De-fense Health Agency), the services' family housi ng, or structures other than buildings (such as piers, runways, and towers). This option would provideadditional up-front funding of $60 million a year from 2000 to 2003 to demol-ish and dispose of those types of excess structures. The Congressional BudgetOffice estimates that this option would yield annual recurring savings of about$50 million beginning in 2004. Over the 2000-2009 peri od, CBO estimates, the additional demolitions could provide total net savings of approximately$200 million. If it chose to, the Congress could allow DoD to use the savings from this option to repair and revitalize other military facilities. Although that approachwould not result in any easily identifiable budgetary savings, it might nonethe-less be a worthwhile investment because deferring r epairs on buildings can ultimately result in higher annual costs for maintenance.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 39 050-26 CREATE INCENTIVES FOR MILITARY FAMILIES TO SAVE ENERGY Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 4 4 2001 27 272002 60 602003 75 752004 77 77 2005 78 78 2006 80 802007 82 822008 83 832009 85 85 Cumulative 2000-2004 244 244 2000-2009 652 652 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 050-22 and 050-27 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Military Family Housing in the United States (Study), September 1993.The Department of Defense (DoD) spent almost $360 million last year on gas, electricity, and water for the approximately 230,000 family housing units that itowns in the United States. DoD's efforts to reduce those costs by promotingresource conservation have met with limited success. One reason is that ser-vice members living in DoD-owned housing do not pay for their utilities andmay not even know how much gas, electricity, and water they use. Landlordsin the private sector have found that utility use typically declines by about 20percent when tenants are responsible for their own utility bills. This option would install utility meters in DoD housing units, provide cash utility allowances to the families living there, and then charge for utilitiesbased on actual use. Residents who spent less than their allowance could keepthe savings; those who spent more would pay the extra cost out of pocket. Thebudget for allowances would be set equal to the expected cost of utilities underthe new system, or about 80 percent of what DoD now spends. The departmentwould allocate that amount among the different housing units on the basis oftheir size, energy efficiency, and geographic location. Once the program wasestablished, the allowance budget for each year could be set equal to the previ-ous year's actual utility charges plus an adjustment for inflation. Because families that conserved aggressively would receive more in al- lowances than they would be charged for u tilities, this option would reward people who made an effort to conserve energy. Families that did not economizewould face utility bills in excess of their allowance. However, there is a riskthat the allowances for some units might not accurately reflect their characteris-tics. People living in such a unit might find that the allowance did not cover allof their utility costs even after they had made reasonable efforts to conserveenergy. (At their next duty assignment, however, they might benefit from anallowance that was too generous given the characteristics of their housing unit.) The principal advantage of this option is that it would reduce DoD's costs by giving military families who live on-base the same incentives for conserva-tion as most homeowners and renters\u2014including military families living off-base. After an initial phase-in period (during which DoD would incur the up-front costs of determining allowance amounts, setting up a billing system, andinstalling meters), this option could provide DoD with total savings of about$650 million from 2000 through 2009. Many DoD housing units already include a connection where a meter could be installed. Nonetheless, a temporary exemption from the meteringrequirement (and from the utility allowances and charges) could be given forsome older units if the Secretary of Defense certified that metering them wasnot feasible.40 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-27 ALLOW FEDERAL AGENCIES TO BARGAIN FOR ELECTRICITY Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 158 158 2001 155 1552002 133 1332003 85 852004 26 26 2005 26 26 2006 26 262006 26 262008 26 262009 26 26 Cumulative 2000-2004 556 556 2000-2009 684 684 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 050-26 and 270-07 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Electric Utilities: Deregulation and Stranded Costs (Paper), October 1998. Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity? (Study), November 1997. The federal government spends more than $2 billion per year in the United States on electricity, of which about 50 percent is purchased through the De-partment of Defense (DoD). Although the government is a large consumer ofelectricity, it pays full retail prices. A provision in a continuing appropriationact for fiscal year 1988 (Public Law 100-202, section 8093) requires federalagencies to conform to state laws regarding electricity purchases. Some stateshave already allowed retail customers to choose their electricity supplier andnegotiate lower prices. This option would let the federal government realizesuch savings in all states, regardless of state regulations on retail customers.The resulting savings could total around $684 million over 10 years if agencies'appropriations were reduced by the expected decrease in electricity bills. The federal government would face lower electricity prices if it purchased power on a competitive basis. In that situation, suppliers would have an incen-tive to provide electricity at the lowest possible cost and offer new services.Under traditional regulation, utilities generally gave customers the same prod-uct: reliable electricity at a fairly high, but uniform, price. If the federal gov-ernment was allowed to negotiate for electricity, suppliers would be encouragedto furnish a greater variety of electricity services\u2014with different prices anddifferent degrees of reliab ility, depending on what the federal government wanted or needed. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts, Pennsylva-nia, and Rhode Island, have already introduced retail competition, allowing allretail customers\u2014including federal agencies\u2014to choose their electricity pro-vider. Any reduction in federal spending because of Congressi onal action would have to take into account that those states already allow price competi-tion and others will allow it before 2009. Several bills to restructure the electricity industry were introduced in the 105th Congress. They would have allowed all customers, not just the federalgovernment, to buy electricity in a competitive market. A comprehensiveelectricity-restructuring bill like one of those may be needed for the federalgovernment to realize all of the savings from negotiating lower prices for elec-tricity. Otherwise, an electricity provider that once served the federal govern-ment might be reluctant to lose so large a customer and could try to impede thegovernment's choice of suppliers. (In some parts of the country, no alternativesuppliers may be available.) Also, the federal government could be subject tosurcharges if it broke a contract with its old supplier. Such surcharges woulddiminish the savings from this option. The federal government might also beperceived as unfair if it was allowed to choose suppliers but no other retailcustomer was. Prices to other consumers could rise if the federal governmentchose a new supplier and the utility that once served it could not search foralternative buyers for the electricity.FUNCTION 050 NATIONAL DEFENSE 41 050-28 SELL SURPLUS REAL PROPERTY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 3 32002 3 32003 3 32004 3 3 2005 1 1 2006 1 12007 1 12008 1 12009 1 1 Cumulative 2000-2004 12 12 2000-2009 17 17 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe Department of Energy (DOE) controls about 2.4 million acres of land, much of it surrounding sites in the West and Southeast that have contributed tothe nation's efforts to develop nuclear weapons. DOE's Office of InspectorGeneral (IG) recently identified 309,000 acres that it considers no longer es-sential to carrying out the department's core missions of weapons dismantling,environmental cleanup, technology development, and scientific research. Thatacreage is part of the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, the Hanford Site inWashington, and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Additional realproperty that may be excess but was not evaluated in the IG report exists atsuch DOE facilities as the Nevada Test Site, the Los Alamos National Labora-tory in New Mexico, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, andthe Savannah River Site in South Carolina. To demonstrate the potential savings from disposing of those properties, this option would require DOE to sell at market value 16,000 acres at the OakRidge Reservation that the IG has identified as excess. (The IG proposedtransferring other excess property to the Department of the Interior for manage-ment as a natural resource.) That sale\u2014conducted over four years to minimizethe effect on local land values\u2014could bring in $17 million during the 2000-2009 period. That sum excludes any savings associated with reducing DOE'sliabilities for payments to local governments in lieu of taxes or the costs ofcleaning up future accidents. The estimate also assumes that the sale would beexempted from requirements of the Federal Property Administrative ServicesAct to first offer surplus property to state and local governments. Proponents of keeping that land argue that DOE's mission is changing to include the stewardship of land as a valuable national resource. Most of theacreage in question was used as buffer lands and has been little touched in thepast 50 years. In line with that land's unique qualities, DOE has establishedenvironmental research parks at seven of its properties to protect various spe-cies and cultural sites and to provide a natural laboratory for research andenvironmental monitoring. It has also made agreements with the Fish andWildlife Service and the Bureau of Reclamation to manage certain areas.Moreover, some of the land (excluding the acres at Oak Ridge to be sold in thisoption) may be contaminated by hazardous materials or unexploded ordnance,which would have to be disposed of before transfer could occur. (Such dis-posal would diminish the savings from this option.) In addition, DOE stillneeds buffer lands to control the future spread of contaminants from its nuclearsites. On the positive side, selling unneeded property would not only save money but also make the land available for more uses, including agriculture,recreation, and residential or commercial development. According to the IG,cleanup will be necessary at only a small part of the acreage. Moreover, thegovernment would still have to pay clea nup costs if it kept or transferred the property rather than selling it.42 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 050-29 ELIMINATE CARGO PREFERENCE Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 166 123 2001 179 1702002 192 1852003 205 1992004 218 212 2005 218 216 2006 218 2162007 218 2172008 218 2172009 218 217 Cumulative 2000-2004 960 889 2000-2009 2,050 1,972 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Cargo Preference Act of 1904 and other laws require that U.S.-flag vessels be used to carry certain government-owned or government-financed cargo thatis shipped internationally. Eliminating cargo preference would lower federaltransportation costs by allowing the government to ship its cargo at the lowestavailable rates. That would reduce the government's costs by $166 million in2000 and a total of $2 billion over the next decade. Four federal agencies\u2014the Department of Defense (DoD), the Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA), the Agency for International Development (AID),and the Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014account for about 97 percent (byweight) of the government shipments subject to cargo preference laws. Thepreference applies to nearly all DoD freight, three-quarters of the USDA'sshipments of food aid, foreign assistance associated with AID, and oil ship-ments for DOE's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Roughly 70 percent of the sav-ings from eliminating cargo preference would come from defense discretionaryspending, with the other 30 percent from nondefense discretionary spending. Supporters of cargo preference argue that it promotes the economic viabil- ity of the nation's maritime industry. That industry has suffered at the hands offoreign competition in recent decades. Under federal law, U.S. mariners mustcrew U.S. vessels, and in general, U.S. shipyards must build them. BecauseU.S.-flag ships face higher labor costs and greater regulatory responsibilitiesthan foreign-flag ships, they generally charge higher rates. Without guaranteedbusiness from cargo preference, up to two-thirds (by tonnage) of the roughly130 U.S.-flag vessels still engaged in international trade would leave the fleet.They would do so either by reflagging in a foreign country to save money or bydecommissioning if they could not operate competitively. Supporters also arguethat cargo preference helps bolster national security by ensuring that U.S.-flagvessels and U.S. crews are available during wartime. Finally, eliminatingcargo preference could cause U.S. ship operators and shipbuilders to default onloans guaranteed by the government. Such defaults could increase mandatoryspending by about $10 million over the next several years. Critics of cargo preference say it represents a subsidy of private industry by taxpayers, which simply helps a handful of carriers preserve their marketshare and market power. That subsidy equals about $1.5 million per ship peryear. Opponents also point out that even DoD officials question the nationalsecurity importance of the Merchant Marine fleet. DoD has invested in a fleetof its own specifically for transporting military equipment. It also contractswith foreign-flag ships when needed. In addition, critics of cargo preferenceargue that the U.S. government is at a competitive disadvantage in selling sur-plus agricultural commodities abroad because it must pay higher costs to trans-port them.1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999-10-50510152025Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory150 International Affairs Budget function 150 covers all spending on international programs by various departments and agencies whose missions concern international affairs.

Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL) broadcast country-specific news to Eastern Europe andthe former Soviet Union, respectively. The Voice of America (VOA) overseesradio broadcasts that provide news and U.S.-related information to audiencesworldwide. The United States Information Agency (USIA) oversees televisionbroadcasting services similar to VOA's radio broadcasts and also manages abroadcasting service to Cuba. In 1996, the Congress consolidated the appropri-ations for VOA, RFE/RL, and USIA's television and film service into the inter-national broadcasting operations account. Funding for radio and televisionbroadcasting to Cuba and for construction of broadcast facilities was providedin separate appropriations. This option would eliminate VOA and RFE/RL and end broadcasting services to Cuba, all overseas construction of broadcast facilities, and U.S.overseas television broadcasting. Compared with the 1999 funding level, thosecuts would save more than $3.5 billion over 10 years\u2014$3.2 billion from termi-nating the international broadcasting operations account, $208 million fromending broadcasts to Cuba, and $98 million from terminating construction ofbroadcast facilities. (Those savings are net of the near-term costs of termina-tion, such as severance pay for employees.) Proponents of ending overseas broadcasting by the U.S. government claim that RFE/RL and VOA are Cold War relics that are no longer necessary. RFEand RL continue to broadcast to former Communist countries in Europe eventhough those countries now have ready access to world news. With the adventof satellite television broadcasting, most nations can receive news about theUnited States and the world from private broadcasters, such as the Cable NewsNetwork (CNN). Some proponents of termination also argue that the primarytechnology used by VOA and RFE/RL\u2014shortwave radio\u2014limits the audiencesand thus the effectiveness of U.S. overseas broadcasting. Finally, proponentssay, foreigners may distrust the accuracy of broadcasts sponsored by the U.S.government. Critics of this option would argue that the current level of broadcasting should continue or even increase. The process of change in Eastern Europe andthe former Soviet Union needs nurturing, they say, and U.S. broadcasting canhelp in that process. In addition, many countries in other parts of the worldremain closed to outside information. Supporters of VOA and RFE/RL arguethat shortwave radio is the best way to reach audiences in closed countriesbecause very few people there own satellite dishes, which are needed to receivetelevision broadcasts such as those of CNN. Moreover, they note, VOA andRFE/RL are broadcasting more programs over AM and FM frequencies. Sup-porters of U.S. government broadcasting also argue that it should be sharply in-creased to some countries, such as China and North Korea. Further, they main-tain, television is a powerful communications tool, and private television net-works cannot adequately communicate U.S. policy and viewpoints.FUNCTION 150 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 45 150-02 REDUCE ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL AND EGYPT Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 220 183 2001 380 318 2002 540 4632003 700 6142004 860 769 8,433 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : The Role of Foreign Aid in Development (Study), May 1997. Enhancing U.S. Security Through Foreign Aid (Study), April 1994. Limiting Conventional Arms Exports to the Middle East (Study), September 1992.As part of the 1979 Camp David peace accords, the United States agreed to provide substantial amounts of aid to Israel and Egypt to promote economic,political, and military security. That aid, which totaled $5.1 billion for the twocountries last year, is paid t hrough the Ec onomic Support Fund (ESF) and the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program. Of that to tal, Israel received $3 billion ($1.2 billion in ESF payments and $1.8 billion from the FMF program),and Egypt received $2.1 billion million from the ESF and $1.3 billionfrom the FMF program). This year, U.S. aid to the two nations will total $5 bil-lion ($100 million less than in 1998)\u2014an amount that represents more thanfour-fifths of discretionary spending for U.S. security assistance and more thanone-third of the foreign operations budget for 1999 (excluding appropriatedfunds for the International Monetary Fund). In January 1998, Israel proposed phasing out its $1.2 billion a year in ESF payments while increasing its FMF assistance by $600 million a year. Theconference report for the 1999 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act endorsedthat proposal with a 10-year phase-in. As a result, it cut ESF aid to Israel by$120 million and increased FMF aid by $60 million. The conference reportalso reduced economic assistance to Egypt from $815 million in 1998 to $775million in 1999\u2014and proposed cutting it to $415 million by 2008\u2014while keep-ing military aid constant. This option would forgo the proposed increase in military funding for Israel (main taining that aid at its 1998 level) wh ile continuing to cut economic assistance to both Israel and Egypt each year through 2008. The reductions inIsraeli aid would save $180 million in 2000, compared with this year's fundinglevel, and a total of $2.1 b illion over five years and almost $7.1 billion over 10 years. Adding in the cuts to Egyptian aid would bring total savings in outlaysto $183 million in 2000, $2.3 billion over five years, and $8.4 billion over 10 years. The conference report asserted that increased m ilitary assistance to Israel was necessary because \"the [country's] security situation, particularly with re-spect to weapons of mass destruction, has worsened.\" But desp ite reports of weapons technology being transferred to Iran, critics could argue that Israel'ssecurity situation has improved. Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destructionhas been reduced, though not eliminated, by U.N. inspections; Israel has con-cluded a peace treaty with Jordan; and peace talks with the Palestinians havemade progress. In addition to those developments, Israel's per capita income(in excess of $17,000) approaches that of the United States' European allies,who have long been prodded by the Congress to assume greater responsibility for their own defense. As for Egypt, some analysts say U.S. assistance to that country is not being spent wisely or efficiently. Critics note that high levels of appropriationshave exceeded Egypt's ability to spend the funds, leading to the accumulation oflarge undisbursed b alances, inefficient use of assistance, and delays in making the reforms needed to foster self-sustaining growth. Furthermore, many othercountries and organizations contribute substantial amounts of money to Egypt,which could make reducing U.S. assistance more feasible.46 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 150-03 ELIMINATE THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK, OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION, AND TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCY Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 850 94 2001 856 2422002 866 3942003 876 5362004 881 655 2005 881 750 2006 881 7992007 881 8272008 881 2000-2009 : 350-02, 350-08, and 350-09 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : The Domestic Costs of Sanctions on Foreign Commerce (Study), March 1999.

Eximbank offers subsidized direct loans,guarantees of private lending, and export credit insurance; OPIC provides in-vestment financing and insurance against political risks; and TDA funds feasi-bility studies, orientation visits, training grants, and other forms of technicalassistance. Appropriations in 1999 for Eximbank, OPIC, and TDA are $815million, $85 million, and $44 million, respectively. Those organizations are only three of the various U.S. government agen- cies (some of which are part of the Department of Agriculture) that promotetrade and exports. Moreover, their impact on exports may be limited. Accord-ing to the annual reports of OPIC, Eximbank, and TDA, those three agenciessupported about 2 percent of total U.S. exports in 1995. This option would eliminate TDA and the subsidy appropriations for Eximbank and OPIC. The latter two agencies could not make any new financeor insurance commitments but would continue to service their existing portfo-lios. Those changes would save $94 million in outlays in 2000, $1.9 billion through 2004, and almost $6 billion over 10 years compared with the 1999funding level. Supporters of promoting exports argue that those agencies play an impor- tant role in helping U.S. businesses, especially small businesses, understandand penetrate overseas markets. They level the playing field for U.S. exportersby offsetting the subsidies that foreign governments provide to their exporters,thereby creating jobs and promoting sales of U.S. goods. By encouraging U.S.investment in areas such as Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union,those agencies may also serve a foreign policy objective. Critics dispute the claim that promoting exports creates U.S. jobs. They assert that by subsidizing exports, the government distorts business decisionsthat are best left to free markets. OPIC and Eximbank finance programs thathave trouble raising funds on their own merit. Similarly, those agencies' insur-ance programs may encourage moral hazard\u2014the practice of companies invest-ing in riskier projects than they would if more of their own funds were at stake.Finally, critics argue, those agencies encourage highly risky projects in vulnera-ble areas. Although emerging countries like South Korea, Mexico, and Polandare important markets for U.S. exports, they can also be dangerous: firmsoperating there may face considerable political, currency, and business risks.FUNCTION 150 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 47 150-04 CEASE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 1,148 : DiscretionaryEstablished to finance the reconstruction of Europe after World War II, the World Bank and its regional counterparts (the Inter-American DevelopmentBank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and theEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development) are now important sourcesof financing for developing nations. Those multilateral development banks areowned by member countries, which purchase the banks' stock, promise to backtheir debts, or directly contribute funds\u2014all of which enable the banks to makeloans to developing nations on highly concessional terms. Under this option, the United States would continue to be a member of the multilateral development banks but would not make new stock purchases orcontributions. Ceasing to do so would save $66 million in outlays in 2000, $3.5billion over the next five years, and $10.4 billion over 10 years compared withthe 1999 funding level. Critics claim that the multilateral banks are more interested in generating loans than in determining whether the loans are invested well. The banks' incen-tive systems, they argue, create a preoccupation with getting loans approved.After years of internal reforms, the World Bank still reports that between one-quarter and one-third of the projects that it funds are uns atisfactory at comple- tion. Limiting U.S. par ticipation in new lending might cause the banks to pay more attention to the success of their lending activities. Some critics also claim that the banks' lending harms the economies of developing countries. Large amounts of aid can overvalue a recipient country'sexchange rate, opponents say, thereby increasing the relative costs of its domesticproducts and reducing their competitiveness in world markets. In addition, aconstant infusion of concessional lending can weaken financial discipline anddepress domestic saving and private investment, which destroys the incentivesthat foster sound business practices. Besides economic harm, environmentalgroups charge that the large-scale projects funded by the banks too often damagethe environment and marginalize indigenous peoples. Supporters, by contrast, argue that the banks are the most effective instru- ment in promoting policy reform in developing nations and in countries under-going the transformation to a free-market democracy. Supporters might alsonote that harmful effects on indigenous peoples, the envi ronment, and the econ- omy were common to all past development efforts, not just the banks' projects,and that the banks have adopted policies to reduce the adverse environmentaland social impact of their projects. Furthermore, supporters argue, the poorperformance of the banks' portfolios is exagger ated: development is a risky business, and if the banks were making only safe loans, they would not be serv-ing their main function of taking risks that profit-oriented investors shun. The banks' advocates also note that developing countries constitute the most rapidly expanding market for exports, and the financing that the banksprovide is an important source of support in expanding U.S. exports to thosecountries. The banks promote U.S. interests around the world on a scale that theUnited States, acting alone, could not afford. If the United States stopped con-tributing to the banks, its ability to shape their policies would be weakened. 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 199905101520Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary250 General Science, Space and Technology Budget function 250 includes funding for the National Science Foundation, more than 90 percent of the spending of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and general scienceresearch by the Department of Energy.

Under current plans, the facility will be completed in 2005.By that time, an estimated $25 billion will have been spent to develop, build,and assemble the space station. The General Accounting Office (GAO) esti-mates that the life-cycle cost of the entire project, including operation, mainte-nance, and transportation to and from orbit, will be over $95 billion. The Con-gress's yearly decision about whether to continue funding the program hingesnot on the money already spent but on whether the program's benefits are suffi-cient to justify spending an additional $70 billion through 2013. People who would cancel the international space station program assert that its benefits are unlikely to justify additional spending and that costs arelikely to increase above those estimated by GAO. To support their position,critics cite the general lack of enthusiasm for the space station among individ-ual scientists and scientific societies. The program's opponents also note thatthe costs of the program have continually increased, although its capabilitiesand scope have decreased. Moreover, opponents hold that under current bud-getary conditions, any cost overruns would be paid for through additional cutsin the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) science,technology, and aeronautical activities. Critics point to the uncertainty sur-rounding the costs of operating and supporting the facility once it has beendeveloped and launched. Regarding that issue, opponents are skeptical ofNASA's assurance that the station's operating costs will be low, noting that theagency made similar claims about the space shuttle that proved overly optimis-tic. Finally, Russia's failure to meet its obligation to provide parts of the spacestation will require that the United States pay those costs. Advocates of continued spending for the space station reject critics' claim that the program's benefits do not sufficiently justify its costs. Supporters placea high value on the role of the station as a stepping stone to future human explo-ration of the solar system. They also contend that the program will deliver bothscientific advances and perhaps even commercial benefits. S upporters also argue that Russia's participation has strengthened the foreign policy reason forcontinuing the program. They assert that drawing Russia, and particularly itsaerospace industry, into a cooperative venture will help to stabilize the Russianeconomy and provide incentives for Russia to adhere to international agree-ments on the spread of missile technology. Advocates also point out that theproject's cancellation would force the United States to renege on agreementssigned with European nations, Japan, and Canada. That could hurt the pros-pects for future international cooperative agreements on space, science, andother areas of mutual interest.FUNCTION 250 GENERAL SCIENCE, SPACE AND TECHNOLOGY 51 250-02 ELIMINATE THE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE RESEARCH Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 90 23 2001 113 712002 113 982003 113 1072004 113 111 2005 113 112 2006 113 1132007 113 1132008 113 1132009 113 113 Cumulative 2000-2004 542 410 2000-2009 1,107 974 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), a partnership between states and several research-oriented federal agencies, wasdesigned to encourage more investment by states in science and technology.EPSCoR was created in response to a concentrated distribution among thestates of federal research and development (R&D) funding: a large number ofstates receive little funding. Currently, federal agencies spend about $113 mil-lion on EPSCoR. Eighteen states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico currently take part in EPSCoR. Between 1980 and 1998, the National Science Foundation pro-vided roughly $270 million to more than 60 colleges, universities, and laborato-ries that had not received significant federal R&D f unding in the past. State governments, local industry, and other nonfederal sources provided an addi-tional $300 million to those institutions. The entire effort has supported 2,000scientists and engineers. Opponents of EPSCoR contend that the nation must make optimal use of its limited research dollars. That principle would argue for supporting research-ers whose proposals are judged superior through a process of peer review,without regard to geographical distribution. Furthermore, critics doubt whethernewcomers to the research enterprise can sustain a top-level effort, which re-quires substantial ongoing investments by the states and regional institutions.Even with matching funds from the states and other nonfederal organizations,novice research institutions might find it difficult to succeed. Critics also argue that EPSCoR was supposed to be an experimental pro- gram, not a permanent source of R&D support for selected states. They notethat after nearly 15 years of EPSCoR support, the program's recipients continueto attract only about 7 percent of the federal funding for academic R&D. Op-ponents point to the corresponding lack of improvement in state shares of suchfunding: participating states that began the 1980s in the bottom half of the national rankings were still in the bottom half in 1993. Advocates maintain that EPSCoR promotes a more equitable geographic distribution of the nation's science and technology base. They assert that statepolicymakers invest more in R&D than they would without EPSCoR's incen-tives, and those investments promote equity in higher education by givingstudents in those states the research experience and training necessary for ca-reers in scientific fields. Proponents also contend that the program fosterstechnology-related industries in the states by involving local firms in selectingresearch topics. Supporters note that 15 of the EPSCoR states experiencedabove-average growth in federal funding for academic R&D over the 1980-1993 period. They claim that the EPSCoR states have improved their rankingsin their chosen \"niche\" fields, even if such changes are not apparent in the over-all statistics. They argue as well that the quality of EPSCoR-funded research isequivalent to other federally funded R&D because awards are based on meritreviews.52 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 250-03 REDUCE NSF FUNDING FOR SOCIAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE RESEARCH Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 48 12 2001 60 382002 60 512003 60 552004 60 57 2005 60 57 2006 60 572007 60 572008 60 572009 60 57 Cumulative 2000-2004 288 213 2000-2009 588 498 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryClarifying the mission of the National Science Foundation (NSF) is an impor- tant task, since the Congress is moving toward increasing research and develop-ment (R&D) spending in general. Otherwise, the federal government might beincreasing the funding for a broader range of programs than it intends. To thisend, the NSF could reduce its funding of social, behavioral, and economic sci-ence research. Currently, the NSF spends $137 million per year on such re-search. Only 55 percent of the research at the NSF Division of Social, Behav-ioral, and Economic Research (SBER) is for archaeology, physical anthropol-ogy, primate studies, and the like; the rest is research on economics, manage-ment, and political science. Critics of the NSF's spending on social and economic science research argue that such research does not belong in an agency devoted to funding andpromoting an underst anding of the physical sciences. Eliminating NSF re- search in social and economic sciences would leave NSF funding for simianstudies and the like intact. It would also leave intact the Science ResourcesStudies program, which gathers and produces federal science statistics, includ-ing the widely used Science and Engineering Indicators . Opponents of the spending believe that research in economic and related fields is more appropriately funded by the agencies devoted to studies of theeconomy\u2014for example, the Federal Reserve Board, which has published work-ing papers on the contribution of R&D to the economy. In addition, regulatoryagencies with res ponsibility for financial markets might be more appropriate for studying issues of risk-taking behavior, which the NSF has funded. Further-more, research agencies governmentwide regularly study economic and othersocial science phenomena to prove the worth of their individual programs.Reducing NSF's funding for such research would lessen duplication. A recent study found that NSF funding of economists did little to increase the number of publications written by them. The study accounted for both thenumber of academic articles published and the reputation of the journals thatfeatured the articles. Applicants who received NSF grants published no morenew articles, taking into account the reputation of the journal, than their peerswho did not receive NSF funding. (The major exception was investigatorsearly in their careers, whose productivity seemed to increase with the receipt ofan NSF grant.) The study suggests that most of the economic research fundedby NSF would have been performed without NSF funding. Supporters of NSF's research on social, behavorial, and economic science argue that the research has value in its own right. They cite as evidence the factthat at least one of the researchers f unded by the programs has won a Nobel prize for his work. In addition, the focus and approach taken by NSF-fundedresearch is designed to bring a scientific approach to topics, such as law andlaw-like systems, not usually considered from that perspective.1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999-50510Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory270 Energy Budget function 270 includes funding for the nondefense programs of the Department of Energy as well as for the Tennessee Valley Authority, rural electrification loans, and the Nuclear Regula-tory Commission.

CBO estimates that discretionary outlays for function 270 will be $3.2 billionin 1999; discretionary budget authority provided for this year totals about $3 billion. Negativebalances in mandatory spending for the function result from repayment of loans, receipts from thesale of electricity produced by federal entities, and charges for the disposal of nuclear waste.54 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 270-01 ELIMINATE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S APPLIED RESEARCH PROGRAMS FOR FOSSIL FUELS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 307 123 2001 DiscretionaryThe Department of Energy (DOE) currently spends over $350 million to im- prove the applied technologies for finding and using fossil fuels (petroleum,coal, and natural gas). With the deregulation of first the petroleum market thenthe natural gas and electricity markets, the appropriateness of federal govern-ment funding for such research and development (R&D) is questionable. One reason for deregulating prices in energy markets is to provide suppli- ers with incentives to develop newer and better technology and bring it to mar-ket. The recent deregulation of electrical generation markets, for example, hasalready brought a great deal of low-cost generating capacity on line, displacinghigher-cost power plants. In addition, private entities are more attuned to which new technology has commercial promise than are federal officials. Federal programs in the fossilfuel area have a long history of f unding tec hnologies that, while interesting technically, had little chance of commercial feasibility, even after years offederal investment. As a result, much of the federal spending has been irrele-vant to solving the nation's energy problems. Critics of the programs argue that DOE should concentrate on basic en- ergy research and reduce the department's involvement in applied technologydevelopment. They contend the federal government has a comparative advan-tage in developing the basic science for a new energy source but has a compar-ative disadvantage in developing and demonstrating the costly technology.Because of general agreement on the benefits of the basic energy research, theCongress appropriated $2.7 billion for DOE's basic energy science program for1999, up from $2.5 billion in 1998. That program allows university research-ers and scientists at the national laboratories to better understand the materialsand other sciences underlying energy use. Finally, because energy prices are low, potential users of such technology have little incentive to invest in implementing it. Consequently, the technologydeveloped by the program may well sit on the shelf until it becomes obsolete. Defenders of the programs argue that federal R&D in those areas helps offset several existing failures in energy markets and that the programs there-fore represent a sound investment for the nation. Current energy prices, theyargue, do not reflect the environmental damage done by excessive reliance onfossil fuels, including the potential for global warming. In addition, currentenergy prices do not reflect the military and economic risks posed by relianceon Middle East oil. Although the DOE R&D programs cannot correct marketfailures in the short term, they may moderate the consequences of such failuresover the long term.FUNCTION 270 ENERGY 55 270-02 ELIMINATE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S APPLIED RESEARCH FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 382 95 2001 477 3292002 477 4392003 477 4722004 477 477 2005 477 477 2006 477 4772007 477 4772008 477 2000-2009 OPTIONS : 270-03, 270-04, and 270-08In 1999, the Department of Energy (DOE) will spend $477 million on pro- grams to develop energy conservation technology. Those efforts include thePartnership for the Next Generation Vehicles (discussed in option 270-08) forautomobile research as well as industrial and residential energy-efficiencyresearch on, for example, more efficient lighting. (DOE separately providesgrants to state and local agencies for energy conservation. Those grants arediscussed in option 270-04.) Phasing out such research and development(R&D) would save $1.8 billion over the next five years. Opponents of federal spending for energy conservation R&D make sev- eral arguments. Generally, they argue that the federal government should stayout of applied energy technology development and concentrate on basic re-search in the science underlying those areas. Specifically, they note that manyprojects funded through this research effort are small and discrete enough\u2014and, in many cases, have a clear enough market\u2014to warrant private invest-ment. In such instances, DOE may be crowding out or preempting private-sector firms. In other instances, such programs conduct R&D that the intendedrecipients are likely to ignore\u2014often because it is too expensive or esoteric toimplement. Critics of the programs also note that other federal policies encourage the introduction of some of the technologies. Utilities, for instance, are encouragedto subsidize consumers' purchases of conservation technologies by underwritingthe purchase of efficient home appliances. In addition, the tax code favorsinvestments in conservation technology. Thus, federal government R&D pro-grams may be duplicative given such other avenues of support. Defenders of the programs argue that federal R&D in the energy conser- vation area helps offset several existing failures in energy markets. Currentenergy prices, they argue, do not reflect the environmental damage done byexcessive reliance on fossil fuels, including the potential for global warming.In addition, current energy prices do not reflect the military and economic risksposed by reliance on Middle East oil. Although those DOE R&D programscannot correct market failures in the short term, they can moderate the conse-quences of the market failures over the long term. One advantage such programs have had over other DOE R&D efforts in the energy technology area is that many of the individual programs are small.Over the years, many of the best outcomes of the research efforts, such as thinfilms to make windows more energy efficient, have come from small researchinvestments. Defenders also note that the rapid growth of such research thatoccurred in the early 1990s has ceased. Appropriations for 1999 are only 5percent higher than appropriations for 1995. (Because energy conservation R&D and the Partnership for the New Generation Vehicles overlap, the savings from eliminating both of them wouldbe less than the sum of the two options.)56 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 270-03 ELIMINATE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S APPLIED RESEARCH FOR SOLAR AND RENEWABLE ENERGYRESOURCES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 269 202 2001 336 3192002 336 3362003 336 3362004 336 336 2005 336 336 2006 336 3362007 336 3362008 336 2000-2009 3,209 CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 270-02 and REV-34In 1999, the Department of Energy (DOE) will spend $336 million on research and development (R&D) for solar and other renewable energy sources. Thelargest technology development efforts by far are those for developing alterna-tive liquid fuels from biomass and electricity from photovoltaic cells. Smallerefforts involve electric energy storage and wind energy systems. Phasing outthe research would save $1.5 billion over the 2000-2004 time frame. Opponents of federal support for such research argue that the federal government should stay out of applied energy technology development and concentrate on basic research in the science underlying those areas. Federallysponsored researchers lack the complex market feedback that helps researchersin private companies realize when their technologies become too esoteric orexpensive for the market. Another criticism shared by the conservation R&D programs (discussed in option 270-02) is that many of the research projects funded by the programare sufficiently small and discrete and have a clearly enough defined market toattract private funding. (Of course, with oil at its currently low price, many ofthose alternative energies are simply not economical.) The biggest single solar energy program\u2014photovoltaics\u2014has largely suc- ceeded, and program opponents might argue that it may now be time for anorderly withdrawal of federal s upport. Several large factories are producing photovoltaic cells, mainly for the export market, or are under construction.After nearly three decades of federal support, the market may well be becominga purely private concern, and the government may wish to withdraw its support.Foreign firms, critics note, are likely to dominate the market because of their countries' higher domestic energy prices and consequent higher likely demandfor alternative energy sources. U.S. consumers may let foreign companies andgovernments bear the cost of developing the energy sources and then buy thetechnology when it is cheap and perfected. For liquid fuels derived from renewable resources (such as biomass), especially, the federal tax code already provides incentives for developing thetechnology. Ethanol fuels receive special treatment under the federal highwaytax (see option REV-34). Furthermore, federal regulations authorized by manydifferent statutes favor alcohol fuels, which now usually mean corn-based fuels.Such fuels could be derived from other biomass sources, however, with theright technology. Defenders of the programs argue that energy markets are still far from perfect. The energy prices consumers pay fail to incorporate both the environ-mental and national security risks posed by the nation's dependence on fossilfuels. Furthermore, the United States also plays the role of international R&Dlaboratory for less developed countries, which often have much higher energycosts. Program defenders also note that funding has been constant since 1995.FUNCTION 270 ENERGY 57 270-04 ELIMINATE ENERGY CONSERVATION GRANT PROGRAMS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 121 30 2001 151 1042002 151 1392003 151 1492004 151 151 2005 151 151 2006 151 1512007 151 1512008 151 1512009 151 151 Cumulative 2000-2004 725 573 2000-2009 1,480 1,328 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 270-01, 270-02, and 270-03 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity?

Institutional conservation grants sup-ported by the office help reduce the use of energy in educational and health carefacilities by adding federal funds to private and local public spending to encour-age local investment in building improvements. The Office of State and Com-munity Programs also supports the energy conservation programs of states andmunicipal governments that, for example, establish energy-efficiency standardsfor buildings and promote public transportation and carpooling. The DOEprograms are independent of a similar block grant activity, the Low IncomeHome Energy Assistance Program, administered by the Department of Housingand Urban Development. This option would halt new appropriations for the block grant programs that support energy conservation activities by the states. It would save $1.3billion in outlays from 2000 through 2009. Federal grants to promote less energy consumption reflect the widespread concerns about energy-supply security\u2014for all sources, including oil, naturalgas, and coal\u2014prevalent in the mid-1970s. Today, those concerns are morecorrectly focused on imported oil supplies. State grant programs that helpreduce residential and institutional demand for natural gas and coal-generatedelectricity have little benefit for the cause of oil-supply security. And althoughthe government has urged the reduction of energy use for environmental rea-sons, federal support for reducing the use of gas and coal through conservationgrants for security or environmental needs conflicts with other federal policiesthat promote the production and use of those fuels. Discontinuing the grant programs could impose hardships on states that wish to continue their energy conservation efforts but are financially stressed.Many states still rely heavily on such grants to help low-income households andpublic institutions. In addition, the voluntary energy savings those programseffect are an important part of the President's Climate Change Action Plan forreducing greenhouse gas emissions. Such considerations may result in contin-ued federal support for the energy conservation grants.58 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 270-05 ELIMINATE ELECTRIFICATION AND TELEPHONE CREDIT SUBSIDIES PROVIDED BY THE RURAL UTILITIES SERVICE Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 43 1 2001 43 82002 43 192003 43 302004 43 37 2005 43 39 2006 43 422007 43 422008 43 422009 43 42 Cumulative 2000-2004 215 95 2000-2009 430 302 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 270-06, 270-07, 450-01, and REV-41 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity?

Electric Utilities: Deregulation and Stranded Costs (Paper), October 1998.The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) is an agency within the Department of Agri- culture that, among other activities, offers financial assistance in subsidizedloans and grants to electric and telephone companies serving primarily ruralareas. This option addresses only the credit subsidies provided through loans forelectrification and telephone service that were previously administered by theRural Electrification Administration (REA). The former REA programs werecombined with other loan and grant programs in 1994 to form the RUS. (Addi-tional potential savings from cutting other RUS programs are described in option450-01.) For 1999, RUS subsidies to electric and telephone companies total about $43 million. In addition, the agency spends nearly $30 million per year adminis-tering those programs. Eliminating the credit subsidies for loans made or guar-anteed by the RUS would reduce outlays by an estimated $302 million between2000 and 2009. The savings shown in the table could result from either of two scenarios: discontinue lending and require RUS borrowers to use private sources of capitalfor all of their loan needs, or continue a federal loan program but eliminate subsi-dies. A loan program with no subsidy costs would require raising the interestrates on loans to rural electric and telephone companies to the level of the Trea-sury's cost of borrowing; it would also mean charging small loan origination feesto cover the cost of defaults for certain classes of loans. In addition to savings insubsidy costs, some savings in administrative costs could result if all such lend-ing was discontinued. Some of the nearly $30 million per year in current salariesand expenses would be required to administer existing loans, but those costscould be gradually reduced under a no-new-lending option. Additional adminis-trative savings over the 2000-2009 period could be achieved by eliminating theprogram, but those additional savings are not counted in this option. The loan program for rural electrification and telephone service has largely fulfilled its original goal of making those services available in rural communi-ties. Most of the communities that the RUS subsidizes are now much larger thanthe original service area requirement of no more than 1,500 inhabitants. RUSborrowers serve about 10 percent of U.S. electricity customers and 4 percent oftelephone customers. In addition, more than 95 percent of rural America haselectric service. Moreover, most RUS borrowers already use some private fi-nancing. Because the cost of interest accounts for only a small percentage of thetypical customer's bill, eliminating the remaining federal subsidy would havelittle effect on the utility rates that most borrowers charge their customers. Proponents of the RUS claim that many borrowers still depend on federal loans to maintain and expand those utilities. Increasing the interest rates orcharging origination fees on some loans would raise the rates that such borrow-ers charged their customers, especially in the rural regions that are most affected.Borrowers argue that they need some level of subsidization to keep their serviceand utility rates comparable with those in urban areas.FUNCTION 270 ENERGY 59 270-06 RESTRUCTURE THE POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS TO CHARGE HIGHER RATES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 130 1302002 130 1302003 130 1302004 130 130 2005 130 130 2006 130 1302007 130 1302008 130 1302009 130 130 Cumulative 2000-2004 520 520 2000-2009 1,170 1,170 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 270-05, 270-07, and REV-41 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity? (Study), November 1997.The three smallest power marketing administrations (PMAs) of the Department of Energy sell about 1 percent of the nation's electricity: the Western AreaPower Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, and the South-eastern Power Administration. That power comes largely from hydropowerfacilities that the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamationhave built and continue to operate. Current law requires that those sales bemade at cost\u2014a situation intended to ultimately reimburse taxpayers for ashare of the costs of construction, costs of current operations, and interest onthe portion of total costs that has not been repaid. Interest charges are gener-ally below the government's cost of borrowing, which, along with the low costof generating electricity from hydropower, result in power rates for federalcustomers that are significantly below the rates that other utilities charge. Theprocess results in average revenues that are about 40 percent below whatnonfederal utilities receive from their sales to wholesale distributors across thecountry, according to a General Accounting Office analysis of Energy Informa-tion Administration data. Current law also requires that PMAs first offer thatpower to rural electric cooperatives, municipal utilities, and other publiclyowned utilities. Restructuring would require that those three PMAs sell electricity at mar- ket rates to any wholesale buyer. Implementing higher rate charges wouldbring in about $130 million in 2001 and increase total receipts by about $500million through 2004 relative to the 1999 level. The current beneficiaries of the federal power program argue that restruc- turing could greatly increase the electric utility rates for the many small andrural communities served by PMAs. They also argue that continuing low-costfederal power is necessary to counter the uncompetitive practices of investor-owned utilities and to support the economies of certain regions of the country. The rationale for federal power subsidies is not as strong as it once was. The market power of private utilities is checked by federal and state regulationof the power supply, by federal antitrust laws, and, increasingly, by competitionfrom independent power sources. In addition, the disparity of incomes in differ-ent regions of the country has diminished. In many cases, nei ghboring com- munities\u2014some receiving federal power and some not\u2014have no discernibledifferences. Except for households in the Northwest, federal sales of powerreduce electric bills only slightly; therefore, the impact of increased federalrates on average costs is small. In addition, the prospect of significant futurecosts of producing electricity from hydropower further supports the case forincreasing power rates now. Such costs are for long-deferred maintenance andupgrades and for addressing the environmental needs of threatened species.The opportunity to earn additional revenues from federal power sales may beshort lived: new power sources are becoming increasingly competitive withfederal power.60 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 270-07 SELL THE SOUTHEASTERN POWER ADMINISTRATION AND RELATED POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 0 02002 1,600 401 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory (excludes discretionary savings for operations) RELATED OPTIONS : 270-05, 270-06, and REV-41 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity? (Study), November 1997. Electric Utilities: Deregulation and Stranded Costs (Paper), October 1998.The Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA) of the Department of Energy sells electricity that comes from hydropower facilities that the Army Corps ofEngineers has constructed and operates. SEPA pays private transmission com-panies to deliver that power to over 300 wholesale customers: rural coopera-tives, municipal utilities, and other publicly owned utilities. In 1997, SEPAsales met about 1 percent of the total power needs in the 11 states where itoperates. Its biggest customer, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), pur-chased 37 percent of SEPA power that year. Power rates are designed to re-cover for taxpayers a share of the costs of construction, costs of current opera-tions, and a nominal interest charge on the portion of total costs that have notyet been recovered. The average revenues from SEPA power (for sales otherthan to the TVA) are about 2.7 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), compared withaverage revenues in the region of 4.7 cents per kWh. Selling assets that directly support the production of electricity would save about $1.3 billion over the 2000-2004 period. That estimate reflects sale pro-ceeds of about $1.6 billion minus a loss of budgetary receipts for that period ofabout $170 million annually. Those figures do not include discretionary bud-getary savings of about $75 million annually from ending appropriations toSEPA and the Corps for operations. The estimate of sale proceeds is based onrecent sales of hydroelectric assets in the United States. Corps assets to betransferred would include equipment, such as turbines and generators, but notthe dams, reservoirs, or waterside property. The sale would also include rightsof access to that equipment and to the water flows necessary for power genera-tion, subject to the constraints of competing uses of water. The original reasons for establishing SEPA\u2014marketing low-cost power to promote competition and fostering economic development\u2014are no longercompelling to many because of the small amount of power SEPA sells andbecause of competitive and regulatory constraints on power rates. The Con-gress has considered legislation to sell SEPA, and the President has included itssale in past budget proposals. The details involved in such a sale may be some-what tricky, however. Many Corps facilities serve multiple purposes, for ex-ample, managing water resources for navigation, flood control, or recreation aswell as for power generation. Prop onents of maintaining federal ownership believe that nonfederal entities lack the proper incentives to perform all thosefunctions. They also argue that increased power rates could accompany sellingSEPA. But selling federal facilities does not mean transferring all water resource functions. The Corps could retain direct responsibility for managing waterflows for all uses, including the upkeep of basic physical structures and sur-rounding properties. Or, as with other nonfederal dams, the terms of the federallicense to operate the facility (issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-mission) could dictate the management of water flows for competing purposes.The General Accounting Office has estimated that the impact of the sale on thepower bills of consumers would be negligible.FUNCTION 270 ENERGY 61 270-08 ELIMINATE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP FOR NEW GENERATION VEHICLES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 191 54 2001 240 1612002 240 2142003 240 2322004 240 235 2005 240 235 2006 240 2362007 240 2362008 240 2000-2009 2,075 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 270-02The Partnership for New Generation Vehicles (PNGV) is a joint federal/private research effort that performs cooperative, precompetitive automotive research,mainly focusing on energy-efficient vehicles. The partnership draws on theresources of five federal agencies, most notably the Department of Energy(DOE). Within DOE, the partnership primarily falls under energy conserva-tion, where it received $129 million for 1999. Total federal funding is $240million. Eliminating the program would save $896 million over the 2000-2004time frame. (Because the P GNV and the energy conservation programs\u2014 option 270-02\u2014are related, the savings from eliminating both of them wouldbe less than the sum of the two options.) Critics of the program argue that the federal government benefits little from conducting such applied research. Accordingly, society would be betterserved, they argue, if the federal government focused on basic research and didnot try to develop technologies intended to be commercialized in the next fewyears. Critics also point out that the partnership has not succeeded in its statedgoal of using federal dollars to attract more research funds to the area. Theintent of the joint federal/private partnership was to leverage federal dollarsinto increasing such research. A recent National Academy of Sciences evalua-tion of the program \"found no evidence that the PNGV program has stimulatedan increase in resources for the development of these alternative systems anddevices for automotive applications . . .\" except for some work in the area offuel cells. U.S. automakers\u2014all industrial giants\u2014have adequate access tocapital; they could easily fund research into new generation vehicles, if they sodesired. Their annual advertising budgets are 15 times the size of the program. Finally, opponents of the program note that both Honda and Toyota have announced their intention to sell a next generation vehicle in the United Statesbeginning this year or next. (The Toyota vehicle is already sold in Japan.)Both vehicles are powered by hybrid power systems, including both a gasolineengine and an electric motor. The companies claim that the vehicles will de-liver fuel efficiency in excess of 65 miles per gallon and that emissions will besubstantially reduced. If those models succeed in the U.S. market, U.S. automakers will have every incentive to rapidly develop such cars, even without federal funding. Ifthe hybrid cars do not succeed in the U.S. marketplace, additional federal dol-lars would not necessarily succeed in revoking the judgment of the market. Supporters of the program argue that continuing imperfections in energy markets and environmental considerations make the development of the tech-nology a public policy matter.

The Department of Energy (DOE) can sustain a maximum drawdown ofabout 4 million barrels per day (20 percent of the nation's current petroleumuse) for 90 days. The department has released oil from the SPR in emergencycircumstances only once\u201417 million barrels during the Persian Gulf War. Thegovernment's net investment in the SPR is about $16 billion for oil and about$4 billion for storage and transportation facilities. The current value of that oilis about $7 billion. This option would require DOE to reduce the size and excess capacity of the SPR by closing the smallest storage site, Bayou Choctaw, and selling thesite's 68 million barrels of oil over a five-year period. It would place at least 10million but no more than 20 million barrels on the market each year to mini-mize the impact of reducing the SPR on world oil prices. The CongressionalBudget Office estimates that receipts from the oil sales would total $873 mil-lion over the 2000- 2004 period and appropriations for operating the reserve could be reduced after the site is decommissioned toward the end of the decade.The option conforms with past Congressional actions: in 1996 and 1997, theCongress directed DOE to sell SPR oil to offset spending on the SPR and otherprograms and has authorized DOE to reduce its excess capacity by leasing it toforeign governments or private entities. Thus far, however, efforts to leaseexcess capacity have not succeeded. The argument for reducing the SPR is supported by changes in program benefits and costs since 1975. Structural changes in energy markets and the economy at large have reduced the potential cost of disrupting oil supplies andconsequently the benefits from releasing oil in a crisis. The increasing diversityof world oil supplies and the growing integration of the economies of oil-producing and oil-consuming nations lessen the risk of such disruptions. More-over, the experience of DOE in its Persian Gulf War sale and in recent salesindicates that the process of deciding to release oil and the sales mechanism cancontribute to market uncertainty, further diminishing the benefits of release.The rising costs of maintaining the SPR also strengthen the case for reducing it:many of the SPR's facilities are aging and have required unanticipated spendingfor repairs to maintain drawdown capabilities. Arguments against closing the site and selling the oil stress logistical and pricing concerns. Closing Bayou Choctaw could reduce DOE's flexibility indistributing oil if a drawdown occurred, especially in the Mississippi Valleyregion. With oil prices currently at 12-year lows, selling the oil now wouldsignificantly lessen its value relative to its average acquisition cost of about$27 per barrel. Another argument against this option concerns the effect ofselling SPR oil on domestic oil producers, which prompted the Congress torepeal legislation in 1998 requiring oil to be sold.FUNCTION 270 ENERGY 63 270-10 ELIMINATE THE ANALYSIS FUNCTION OF THE ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 16 10 2001 16 162002 16 162003 16 162004 16 16 2005 16 16 2006 16 162007 16 162008 16 162009 16 16 Cumulative 2000-2004 80 74 2000-2009 160 154 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 350-01The Energy Information Administration (EIA), created by the Congress in 1977, is a statistical agency of the Department of Energy. EIA's mission is todevelop data and analyses on energy resources and reserves, production, de-mand, and technologies as well as related financial and statistical informationon the adequacy of energy resources n ecessary to meet U.S. energy demand. Eliminating the analysis function would save $16 million in 2000 and reduceoutlays by $154 million through 2009 relative to the 1999 funding level. The Congress created EIA when many people thought that the United States would deplete its reserve of fossil fuels. Because that concern has beenalleviated, some argue that eliminating EIA's analysis function is appropriate.Furthermore, some critics of EIA assert that independent analysis is alreadydone by academicians, the Department of Energy's Policy Office, the Congres-sional Research Service, and the General Accounting Office. In addition, somecritics note that industry's willingness to fund specific research activitiesthrough trade associations, such as the Ameri can Petroleum Ins titute and the Edison Electric Institute, suggests that EIA is providing a service that the pri-vate sector would perform on its own. EIA supporters claim that information collecti on, analysis, and dissemina- tion should be done by an independent party. They claim that access to infor-mation is important to a competitive market. Although concerns about energysupplies have been alleviated, the Congress is now addressing such issues asglobal warming. Without independent analysis, the Congress would have tochoose between analysis done by environmental groups and analysis done byindustry sources. Additional savings could be obtained by eliminating some of EIA's data collection or moving EIA's data collection responsibilities to other agenciessuch as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commision. Much of the informationcollected and distributed by the EIA is available through newspapers and tradesources. Natural gas and electricity futures prices are traded on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, among others, and published daily in the Wall Street Journal. Although EIA conducts its own statistical surveys, it also develops reports based on information collected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-mission. 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999-5051015202530Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory300 Natural Resources and Environment Budget function 300 supports programs administered by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency,and the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

RELATED OPTION : 300-07The Forest Service (FS) manages federal timber sales from 119 national for- ests. In fiscal year 1997, the FS sold roughly 3.7 billion board feet of publictimber. Purchasers may harvest the timber over several years and pay the FSupon harvest. The total fiscal year 1997 harvest, approximately 3.3 billion board feet, represented a continuing decline in volume from previous years.According to Timber Sales Program Annual Reports published by the FS, in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the FS spent more on the timber program than itcollected from companies harvesting the timber. In 1997, the timber expensesreported by the FS exceeded timber receipts by about $90 million. The annualreports exclude receipt-sharing payments to states from the calculation of tim-ber expenses. When such payments are included, timber expenses exceededreceipts by more than $160 million (or almost 30 percent) in fiscal year 1997. The FS does not maintain the data needed to estimate annual timber re- ceipts and the expenditures associated with each individual timber sale. There-fore, it is hard to determine precisely the possible budgetary savings from phas-ing out all timber sales in the National Forest System for which expendituresare likely to exceed receipts. To illustrate the potential savings, however, thisoption estimates the reduction in net outlays in the federal budget from elimi-nating all future timber sales in five National Forest System regions for whichimbalances between cash receipts and expenditures were prominent in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. In those five regions (the Northern, Rocky Mountain, Southwestern, Inter- mountain, and Alaska regions), cash expenditures exceeded cash receipts by atleast 30 percent in 1996 and 1997. Eliminating all future timber sales fromthose regions would reduce the FS's discretionary outlays for the 2000-2009period by about $1,495 million; timber receipts (which are categorized as man-datory) would fall by about $600 million after subtracting payments to states,producing net savings of $890 million. (Hence, the savings estimates are thenet effect of changes in both discretionary and mandatory budgets.) Timber sales for which spending exceeds receipts have several potential drawbacks. They may lead to reductions in the federal surplus, excessive de-pletion of federal timber resources, and destruction of roadless forests that haverecreational value. Potential advantages of the sales include community stab ility in areas dependent on federal timber for logging and other related jobs. Timber salesalso improve access to the land\u2014as a result of road construction\u2014for fire pro-tection and recreation.FUNCTION 300 NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT 67 300-02 IMPOSE A FIVE-YEAR MORATORIUM ON LAND PURCHASES BY THE DEPARTMENTS OF AGRICULTUREAND THE INTERIOR Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 319 109 2001 319 2242002 319 2962003 319 3192004 319 319 2005 319 319 2006 319 3192007 319 3192008 319 2,862 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryFor 1999, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior have received appro- priations of about $329 million to buy land that is generally used to create or expand designated recreation and conservation areas, including national parks,national forests, wilderness areas, and national wildlife refuges. This optionproposes placing a 10-year moratorium on future appropriations for land acqui-sition by those departments. It would provide for a small annual appropriation($10 million) to cover emergency acquisition of important tracts that becameavailable on short notice, compensation to \"i nholders\" (landholders whose property lies wholly within the boundaries of an area set aside for public pur-poses, such as a national park), and ongoing administrative expenses. Proponents of this option argue that land m anagement agencies s hould improve their stewardship of the lands they already own before taking on addi-tional management responsibilities. In many instances, the National Park Ser-vice, the Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management find it difficult tomaintain and finance operations on their existing landholdings. Furthermore,given the limited operating funds of those agencies, environmental objectivessuch as habitat protection and access to recreation might be best met by im-proving management in currently held areas rather than providing minimalmanagement over a larger domain. Supporters of this option also argue that thefederal government already owns e nough land. Currently, about 650 million acres\u2014approximately 30 percent of the United States' land mass\u2014belong tothe government, according to the General Services Administration. The senti-ment that that amount is sufficient is particularly strong in the West, where thegovernment owns about 62 percent of the land area in 11 states. Opponents of this option argue that future land purchases are necessary to achieve ecosystem management objectives and fulfill existing obligations fornational parks. Much of the land targeted by the Congress for new and ex-panded federal reserves is privately held, and acquiring it will r equire pur- chases. Furthermore, encroaching urban development and related activitiesoutside the boundaries of national parks and other federal landholdings may bedamaging the federal resources. Land acquisition is an important tool for miti-gating that problem. Acquisitions that consolidate landholdings may also helpimprove the efficiency of public land management.68 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 300-03 ELIMINATE FEDERAL GRANTS FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 2,527 Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 450-01 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : The Economic Effects of Federal Spending on Infrastructure andOther Investments (Paper), June 1998.The Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) require municipal wastewater and drinking water systems to meet certain performance stan-dards to protect the quality of the nation's waters and the safety of its drinking watersupply. The CWA provides financial assistance so communities can construct waste-water treatment plants that comply with the act's provisions. The 1996 amendmentsto the SDWA authorized a state revolving loan program for drinking water infra-structure. For 1999, the Congress appropriated a bout $2.5 billion for water infra- structure programs, including funds for wastewater programs and the new programfor drinking water facilities. Ending all funding of new water infrastructure projectsafter 1999 would save $18.3 billion through 2009 measured against the 1999 fund-ing level. Title II of CWA provides for grants to states and municipalities for construct- ing wastewater treatment facilities. As amended in 1987, the CWA phased out titleII grants and authorized a new grant program under title VI to support state revolvingfunds (SRFs) for water pollution control. Under the new system, states continue toreceive federal grants, but now they are responsible for developing and operatingtheir own programs. For each dollar of title VI grant money a state receives, it mustcontribute 20 cents to its SRF. States use the combined funds to make low-interestloans to communities for building or upgrading municipal wastewater treatmentfacilities. Although authorization for the SRF program under CWA has expired, theCongress continues to provide annual grant appropriations. As amended in 1996, the SDWA authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants to states for capitalizing revolving loan funds for treatingdrinking water. As with CWA's wastewater SRF program, states may use thosefunds to make low-cost financing available to public water systems for constructingfacilities to treat drinking water. In 1999, the Congress appropriated $775 millionfor capitalization grants for drinking water SRFs. Proponents of eliminating federal grants to water-related SRFs say such grants may encourage inefficient decisions about water treatment by allowing states to loanmoney at below-market interest rates. Below-market loan rates could reduce incen-tives for local governments to find less costly alternatives for controlling water pollu-tion and treating drinking water. In addition, federal contributions to wastewaterSRFs were intended to help move toward full state and local financing of the fundsby 1995. Thus, proponents of ending federal grants to those SRFs argue that theprogram was intended to be temporary and may have replaced, rather than supple-mented, state and local spending. Opponents of such cuts argue that states and localities could have trouble meeting the federal treatment deadlines without continued federal support\u2014bothbecause repayments to the SRFs would be too small to fund new projects and be-cause states would be unable to handle the additional cost of offsetting decreasedfederal contributions. Opponents of the cuts also have concerns about helping small and economi- cally disadvantaged communities that have had the most difficulty complying withCWA and SDWA requirements. Some people who oppose eliminating the federalgrants maintain that doing so would increase the burden of unfunded federal man-dates on state and local governments.FUNCTION 300 NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT 69 300-04 SPEND THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THE SUPERFUND TRUST FUND AND TERMINATE THE PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 1,500 3752002 1,500 9002003 1,500 1,2002004 1,500 1,350 2005 1,500 1,425 2006 1,500 1,4252007 1,500 10,950 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionarySince 1981, the Superfund program of the Environmental Protection A gency (EPA) has been charged with cleaning up the nation's worst hazardous wastesites, particularly those on the National Priorities List (NPL). The programmade progress in the 1990s, especially in increasing the number of sites in thefinal phase of the cleanup process, but more work remains. As of the end offiscal year 1998, EPA had identified 585 of 1,361 current and former NPL sitesas \"construction complete,\" meaning that all physical construction work re-quired for the cleanup effort (capping a landfill, installing a groundwater treat-ment system, and the like) was done. Conversely, remedy construction hadbegun but had not been completed at 457 current NPL sites and had not yet started at 319 sites. In addition, EPA has proposed that another 66 sites beadded to the list, and hundreds more sites with NPL-caliber problems probablyremain to be identified. Although the Congress could choose to end the program at any time, one notable occasion to do so might be the forthcoming depletion of the HazardousSubstance Superfund, the trust fund that has been the main source of the pro-gram's appropriations. The trust fund balance has declined since Superfund's\"environmental income tax\" on corporations and excise taxes on oil, petroleumproducts, and certain chemicals expired in 1995. The trust fund is projected toend fiscal year 1999 with an unappropriated balance of roughly $1.5 billion,more than enough for fiscal year 2000 given current levels of spending andappropriations from the general fund. If the end of 2000 is too close at hand toallow a safe and orderly program shutdown, the Congress could reduce annualspending to stretch the same total funding for additional months or years. The argument for spending the trust fund balance and terminating the program proposes that Superfund efforts are not worthwhile, at least not at thefederal level. Superfund's critics argue that the program's cost is disproportion-ate to the threat represented by hazardous waste sites and that its system ofretroactive, joint-and-several liability is irremediably inefficient and unfair.They also argue that waste sites are local problems that are more appropriatelyhandled by the states, almost all of which have their own hazardous wastecleanup programs for sites not addressed under federal law. In addition, al-though depleting the trust f und has no budgetary significance, it provides a near-term opportunity to shut the program down\u2014unlike, for example, merelyclosing the NPL to new sites, which would require maintaining some federalprogram for most or all of the next decade. Superfund's defenders point to evidence linking Superfund sites to human health problems, including birth defects, leukemia, cardiovascular abnormali-ties, respiratory illnesses, and immune disorders, and note that the public placesa high priority on waste cleanup. They argue further that Superfund has re-duced costs and completed more cleanups in recent years and that modest legis-lative reforms can improve the program. Finally, they note that states varywidely in their capacity to handle NPL-caliber problems.70 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 300-05 CHARGE MARKET RATES FOR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 2 2001 22002 22003 22004 2 2005 2 2006 22007 22008 22009 2 Cumulative 2000-2004 10 2000-2009 20 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 300-06The National Weather Service (NWS) provides weather and flood warnings, public forecasts, and severe-weather advisories to protect lives and reduceproperty damage from those hazards. The annual budget for such services,including operating weather satellites, is about $1 billion. Currently, the NWS allows open access to all of its weather data and information services. Access to that information has contributed substantiallyto the growth of the weather service information industry, which transformsNWS data and general forecasts for large areas into marketable specific fore-casts. Estimates suggest that the private weather information industry has reve-nues ranging from $300 million to $400 million a year. Commercial users\u2014such as the Weather Channel and Accu-Weather\u2014pay fees only for the costs ofcomputer hookups and transmission of NWS data. Such fees are a small frac-tion of the fair market value of those services. Moreover, the NWS chargesnothing for information received from its satellite broadcasts or Internet site. Charging fees that are based on the fair market value of access to that information, except for severe-weather warnings, could raise $2 m illion in 2000, $10 million over five years, and $20 million over 10 years. Chargingmarket value for general weather information would lessen its disseminationbut encourage the production and presentation of more useful information thanis now available. Supporters of this option contend that charging market-basedfees would not substantially reduce the public's access to weather reports. Forexample, as long as the news media will pay for private forecasts, the marketwill demand NWS products. In addition, because the fees would not apply tosevere-weather warnings, the safety of the general public would not be compro-mised. Many European nations routinely charge users for weather informationprovided by their satellites. For example, the British Meteorological Officeraises over $30 million a year from commercial customers. In the past, the NWS viewed charging fair market fees as a significant barrier to the public's access to its information. The Omnibus Budget Reconcil-iation Act of 1990 attempted to set fees based on the fair market value of NWSdata and information, except for information related to warnings and watches,information provided under international agreements, and data for nonprofitinstitutions. However, the NWS received approval from the Office of Manage-ment and Budget to reset the user fee to recover only the cost of disseminatingthe information.FUNCTION 300 NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT 71 300-06 ELIMINATE THE NOAA WEATHER RADIO NETWORK Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 12 8 2001 12 112002 12 112003 12 122004 12 12 2005 12 12 2006 12 122007 12 122008 12 122009 12 12 Cumulative 2000-2004 60 54 2000-2009 120 114 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 300-05The National Weather Service (NWS) uses the National Oceanic and Atmo- spheric Administration's (NOAA's) Weather Radio Network to s ound the alarm when it broadcasts emergency messages. The Weather Radio Network broad-casts official warnings and hazard information, as well as local forecasts, 24hours a day using a national network of over 480 transmitters. Weather radios,which cost from $25 to $100, have a special signal receptor and automaticallyturn on when the NWS issues a warning. The radio signals also alert weatherspotters, who provide supplemental information that enables forecasters toissue more accurate and more timely warnings and advisories to the publicregarding hazardous weather. A 1983 Booz-Allen & Hamilton study recommended eliminating the Weather Radio Network, which would lower discretionary outlays by $8 mil-lion in 2000, $54 million over the 2000-2004 period, and $114 million over 10years. The study argued that the private media were widely disseminatingweather forecasts and NWS products and that less than 5 percent of the popula-tion relied on the network as their main source of information. Because trans-mitters' signals extend only a distance of 40 miles, many rural areas do notreceive broadcasts of NWS weather and flood warnings. Moreover, becausemost of the advance tornado warnings issued are false alarms, many owners ofweather radios have disengaged the warning beeps. Eliminating the Weather Radio Network, however, could lead to more deaths from severe weather. The Administration believes that the NOAA net-work performs an essential public safety role that cannot be easily assumed bycommercial radio and wants to make the weather radios as common in thehome as smoke detectors. The President's 1997 budget proposed replacing andmodernizing the NOAA Weather Radio Network transmitters to strengthen thesystem after a tornado killed 20 people in a rural Alabama church despite a 12-minute warning issued by the Birmingham weather office. The NWS is in-creasing coverage to 95 percent of the population from the current 70 percent to80 percent and now issues warnings for about 60 percent of tornadoes, a sharpincrease in the last 10 years. In fact, warnings issued in 1998 with as much asa 15-minute lead time saved lives in three states.72 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 300-07 CHANGE THE REVENUE-SHARING FORMULA FROM A GROSS- RECEIPT TO A NET-RECEIPT BASIS FOR COMMERCIALACTIVITIES ON FEDERAL LANDS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 185 185 2001 185 1852002 185 1852003 185 1852004 190 190 2005 190 190 2006 190 1902007 195 1952008 195 1952009 200 200 Cumulative 2000-2004 930 930 2000-2009 1,900 1,900 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 300-01 and 300-09The federal government owns about 650 million acres of public lands\u2014nearly one-third of the United States' land mass. Those lands contain a rich supply ofnatural resources: timber, coal, forage for livestock, oil and natural gas, andmany nonfuel minerals. Private interests have access to much of the federal landto develop its resources and generally pay fees to the federal government depend-ing on the commercial returns realized. In many cases, the federal governmentallots a percentage of those receipts to the states and counties containing theresources, as compensation for tax revenues they did not receive from the federallands within their boundaries. The federal government typically calculates thoseallotments on a gross-receipt basis before accounting for its program costs. Thepractice sometimes causes the federal government's costs to exceed its share ofreceipts. Shifting payments to a net basis would reduce federal outlays. In most cases, the Forest Service is required to allot 25 percent of its gross receipts from commercial activities in the national forests to the respective statesand counties. The Department of the Interior allots 4 percent of its timber re-ceipts, an average of 18 percent of its grazing fees, and 4 percent of its miningfees from \"common variety\" materials to the states; the department's MineralsManagement Service (MMS) allots 50 percent of its adjusted onshore oil, gas,and other mineral receipts to the states. The MMS deducts 50 percent of itsadministrative costs from the gross-receipt calculation before distributing thosepayments. In effect, the states share 25 percent of the burden of those adminis-trative costs. On certain federal lands\u2014specifically, national forests affected byprotection of the spotted owl and the Oregon and California grant lands\u2014pay-ments to states and counties are guaranteed on the basis of an average of pastpayments. (Such guaranteed payments expire after 2003. This option assumesthat administrative costs would be deducted from the guaranteed payments on thebasis of past receipts and from other state payments on the basis of current re-ceipts.) Federal savings would be substantial if the Congress required those agen- cies to deduct their full program costs from gross receipts before paying thestates. The regional jurisdictions would continue to receive the same allottedpercentage of net federal receipts and accrue receipt shares totaling about $645million in 2000. The projected savings do not include potential federal cost increases under the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, which was estab-lished to offset the effects of nontaxable federal lands on local governments'budgets. Payments in lieu of taxes are partially reduced by the amount ofrevenue-sharing payments from federal agencies. Payments under the PILTprogram would increase by about $30 million a year beginning in fiscal year2000 if net program receipts were shared and the Congress appropriated such anincrease. Changing the revenue-sharing formula to a net-receipt basis would proba- bly cause economic hardship to the respective states and counties, greatly reduc-ing their revenue. That might lead to severe cuts in state and county spending.To help alleviate that hardship, the formula could switch gradually to the net-receipt basis over several years.FUNCTION 300 NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT 73 300-08 CHARGE ROYALTIES AND HOLDING FEES FOR HARDROCK MINING ON FEDERAL LANDS Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 36 2001 442002 412003 412004 41 2005 41 2006 412007 412008 412009 41 Cumulative 2000-2004 203 2000-2009 408 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee.

Alternative Proposals for Royalties on Hardrock Minerals (Testimony), May 1993.The General Mining Law of 1872 governs access to hardrock minerals\u2014in- cluding gold, silver, copper, and uranium\u2014on public lands. Any holder of morethan 10 mining claims on public lands must pay an annual holding fee of $100per claim, and all claimholders must pay a $25 location fee when recording aclaim. But unlike producers of fossil fuels and other minerals from public lands,miners do not pay royalties to the government on the value of the hardrock min-erals. In addition, authorization to collect the holding and location fees expiresin 2000. Estimates place the current gross value of hardrock minerals produc-tion at about $650 million annually (excluding claims with so-called first-halfpatents). That sum has diminished greatly in recent years because of patentingactivity. (In patenting, miners gain title to public lands by paying a one-time feeof $2.50 or $5.00 an acre.) The Congress has debated reforming the GeneralMining Law for the past several years. Legislation calling for royalties wasintroduced in the 105th Congress and passed (but not enacted) in the 104thCongress (H.R. 2491) and the 103rd Congress (H.R. 322). The royalty rate andthe basis for royalties varied in that legislation. This option considers an 8 percent royalty that the Congress could impose on the production of hardrock minerals from public lands. The royalty would beon net proceeds as defined in H.R. 2491 (that is, sales revenues minus costs thatinclude mining, separation, transportation, and other items). The option wouldalso reauthorize the current holding fee and location fee and assumes such feeswould be recorded as offsetting receipts to the Treasury. (They currently arecounted as offsetting collections to appropriations.) Total budgetary savingsfrom those actions would be $408 million over the 2000-2009 period. Of thattotal, royalty collections account for about $78 million, and reauthorization ofholding and location fees, about $330 million. Those estimates assume thatstates in which the mining takes place receive 25 percent of the gross royaltyreceipts. They also assume that no further patenting of public lands takes place.(In comparison, royalties based on gross proceeds would raise more. In general,the costs of administering any net proceeds royalty would exceed those for agross proceeds royalty.) People in favor of reforming mining law\u2014including many in the environ- mental community\u2014argue that low holding fees and zero royalties make it lesscostly to produce on federal lands than on private lands (where payment of royal-ties is the rule). That policy encourages overdevelopment of public lands, whichmay cause severe environmental damage. Reforming the law could promoteother uses of those lands, such as recreation and wilderness conservation. Opponents of reform argue that wit hout free access to public resources, exploration for hardrock minerals in this country\u2014especially by small miners\u2014would decline. They also argue that royalties would diminish the profitabilityof many mines, leading to scaled-back operations or closure and adverse eco-nomic consequences for mining communities in the West. Because many min-eral prices are set in world markets, miners would be unable to pass along newroyalty costs to consumers.74 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 300-09 RAISE GRAZING FEES ON PUBLIC LANDS Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 2 2001 42002 62003 82004 10 2005 11 2006 132007 142008 152009 16 Cumulative 2000-2004 30 2000-2009 100 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collection ora mandatory offsetting receipt de-pending on the specific language ofthe legislation establishing the fee. RELATED OPTION : 300-07 and 300-08The federal government owns and manages about 650 million acres of U.S. land. The land has many purposes, including grazing of privately owned livestock.Cattle owners compensate the government for using the land by paying grazingfees; the fees, however, may not give the public a fair return. The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administer livestock grazing on public rangelands in the West. In 1997, ranchers wereauthorized to use about 17 million animal unit months (AUMs)\u2014a standardmeasure of forage\u2014for grazing on those lands. In 1990, the appraised value ofpublic rangeland in six Western states varied between $5 and $10 per AUM. A1993 study indicated that the Forest Service and BLM spent $4.60 per AUM inthat year to manage their rangelands for grazing. The 1993 permit fee, however,was $1.86 per AUM. Thus, the current fee structure may subsidize ranchers.(The 1999 fee is $1.35 per AUM under the current fee formula.) The Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 established the current formula for grazing fees. It uses a 1966 base value of $1.23 per AUM andmakes adjustments to account for changes in beef cattle markets and productioninput markets. The Congress has considered various proposals to increase graz-ing fees. The increase in federal receipts resulting from any such proposal de-pends on the degree to which ranchers reduce their use of AUMs in response tohigher fees. One proposal is to allocate grazing rights through a bidding processas long as competition is not too limited. Another option is to follow the states'lead. The federal government would determine grazing fees for federal lands ineach state the same way the particular state determines grazing fees on state-owned lands. The government would implement this proposal over 10 years asexisting permits expired. The savings estimate is net of additional payments tostates of about $28 million. It does not include any additional appropriations forrange improvements that could result from added receipts. Proponents of this option believe that low fees that subsidize ranching contribute to overgrazing and deteriorated range conditions. They support theapproach of following decisions made at the state level and reject the one-size-fits-all nature of the current federal fee. State grazing fees and the means ofcalculating them vary widely by state and sometimes even within a state. Sup-porters of this approach also point out that states' interest in the revenue receivedfrom both state and federal fees lessens any incentive to manipulate state fees tolower federal fees. Opponents of this approach note that state rangelands may be more valu- able than federal lands for grazing purposes. Some systems used by states toestablish fees may not reflect those differences in land quality and conditions ofuse when applied to federal lands. For example, that concern does not exist instates using auction or appraisal systems for fee setting. People in states usingfee formulas, however, have that concern. Opponents also point out that theadministrative costs of using different procedures to establish federal grazingfees in each state will be higher than those incurred under the current uniformfederal fee structure. (This option does not consider possible differences in ad-ministrative costs.)FUNCTION 300 NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT 75 300-10 RECOVER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADMINISTERING THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS PERMITTING PROGRAMS Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 7 2001 142002 142003 142004 14 2005 14 2006 142007 142008 142009 14 Cumulative 2000-2004 63 2000-2009 133 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collection ora mandatory offsetting receipt de-pending on the specific language ofthe legislation establishing the fee. RELATED OPTION : 300-13 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Regulatory Takings and Proposals for Change (Study), December 1998.The Department of Army, through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, adminis- ters laws pertaining to the regulation of U.S. navigable waters, includingwetlands. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires that any private,commercial, or government actor desiring to dredge or place fill material in U.S.waters or wetlands must obtain a permit from the Corps. By increasing permitfees, the Corps could recover a portion of its annual regulatory costs. Imposingone type of fee structure for section 404 permitting\u2014a cost-of-service fee oncommercial applicants\u2014would generate $7 million in 2000 and $14 million in2001 and each of the following years. From rather inauspicious beginnings, section 404 of CWA has grown to become the core of the nation's effort to protect wetlands. As legally interpreted,the terms \"dredge\" and \"fill\" encompass virtually any activity on a wetland inwhich dirt is moved, effectively granting the Corps permitting jurisdiction overall wetlands, including those not associated with traditionally navigable water-ways. In fiscal year 1999, the Corps's regulatory program budget is $106 mil-lion, which mainly funds permitting activ ities. In fiscal year 1996 (the most recent year for which data are available), the Corps received about 65,000 appli-cations for section 404 permits for discharging dredged or fill materials. Undersection 404, the Corps is required to evaluate each permit application and grantapproval or denial on the basis of expert opinion and statutory guidelines. Thebulk of the permits are quickly approved through outstanding general or regionalpermits, which grant authority for many low-impact activities. Evaluation ofpermits not covered by outstanding per mits may require the Corps to c onduct detailed, lengthy, and costly reviews. Currently, fees levied for commercial and private permits are $100 and $10, respectively. Government applicants do not pay a fee. The fee structurehas not changed since 1977. Total fee collections fall far short of covering thecosts of administering the permitting program, particularly for applications re-quiring detailed review. The Administration has proposed changing the permitfee structure: its Wetland Plan would increase permit fees for commercial proj-ects and eliminate the fees for private, noncommercial projects. Proponents of higher fees argue that parties pursuing a permit should bear the cost of the permit\u2014not the general taxpaying public. Since permit seekersare advancing a private interest whose benefits accrue to a private party, thecosts should be borne by that party. Taxpayers should not have to pay for some-thing that advances the interests of a comparative few. Permit seekers oppose such fees because they do not want to fund some- thing that may ultimately deny them the right to use their land in the way theychoose. The goal of the section 404 permitting program is to advance a publicinterest by protecting wetlands. Since society benefits from wetlands protection,often at the perceived expense of property owners, society should pay. Further-more, the regulatory process that property owners must navigate is already oner-ous, and raising the permit fees would add yet another cost, further infringing onproperty owners' rights.76 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 300-11 IMPOSE USER FEES ON THE INLAND WATERWAY SYSTEM Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 170 2001 4502002 4702003 4702004 470 2005 2000-2004 2,030 2000-2009 4,380 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee. RELATED OPTION : 300-13 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Paying for Highways, Airways, and Waterways: How Can Users BeCharged? (Study), May 1992.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Congress annually appro- priates about $650 million for the nation's inland waterway system. Of thattotal, about $475 million is for operation and maintenance (O&M) and about$175 million is for construction. Current law allows up to 50 percent of inlandwaterway construction to be funded by revenues from the inland waterway fueltax, a levy on the fuel consumed by barges using most segments of the inlandwaterway system. All O&M expenditures are paid by general tax revenues. Imposing user fees high enough to recover fully both O&M and construc- tion outlays for inland waterways would reduce the federal deficit by $170million in 2000 and $2.0 billion during the 2000-2004 period. The receiptscould be considered tax revenues, offsetting receipts, or offsetting collections,depending on the form of the implementing legislation. Receipts could be in-creased by raising fuel taxes, imposing charges for lockage, or imposing feesbased on the weight of shipments and distance traveled. The estimates do nottake into account any resulting reductions in income tax revenues. Imposing higher fees on users of the inland waterway system could im- prove the efficiency of its use by forcing shippers to choose the most efficienttransportation route rather than the most heavily subsidized one. Moreover,user fees would encourage more efficient use of existing waterways, reducingthe need for new construction to alleviate congestion. Finally, user fees sendmarket signals that identify the additional projects likely to provide the greatestnet benefits to society. The effects of user fees on efficiency would depend largely on whether the fees were set at the same rate for all segments of a waterway or on the basis ofthe cost of each segment. Since costs vary dramatically by segment, system-wide fees would offer weaker incentives for cost-effective spending becausethey would cause users of low-cost segments to subsidize users of high-costsegments. Fees based on the cost of each segment, by contrast, could cause users to abandon high-cost segments of the waterways. One argument against user fees is that they may repress regional eco- nomic development. Imposing higher user fees would also lower the income ofbarge operators and grain producers in some regions, but those losses would besmall in the context of overall regional economies.FUNCTION 300 NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT 77 300-12 OPEN THE COASTAL PLAIN OF THE ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE TO LEASING Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 0 2001 02002 02003 02004 1,150 2005 1 2006 12007 12008 12009 1 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,150 2000-2009 1,155 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 300-08The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) consists of 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska, of which 1.5 million acres are coastal plain. The coastalplain is the yet-to-be-explored onshore area with perhaps the country's mostpromising oil production potential. It is also the least disturbed Arctic coastalregion\u2014valued for species conservation and subsistence use. ANWR was established by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conserva- tion Act of 1980. The refuge serves to conserve fish and wildlife habitats, fulfillrelated international treaty obligations, provide opportunities to continue indige-nous lifestyles, and protect water quality. The act prohibits industry activity inANWR unless specifically authorized by the Congress. This option would open ANWR's coastal plain to leasing and development. Leasing would be likely to result in bonus bid payments, ongoing rental pay-ments, and (once production begins up to 10 or more years after leasing) royal-ties. As in recent proposals, the Congressional Budget Office assumes the fed-eral government would receive one-half of the offsetting receipts from thosesources; the state of Alaska would receive the other half. The Department of the Interior's most recent assessment of the area's eco- nomically recoverable undiscovered petroleum resources is expressed in proba-bilities and assumptions about the price of oil at the time of production. Forthis estimate, CBO assumed an average price of $18 per barrel (in 1996 dollars)during the 2010-2030 period, partly on the basis of the Energy InformationAdministration's price forecast for 2020. At $18 per barrel (delivered to theWest Coast), the Department of the Interior estimates a 50 percent probabilitythat at least 2.4 billion barrels of oil will be produced. Using that mean resourceassessment and assuming ANWR lease sales are held within the next 10 years,CBO estimates that leasing ANWR would generate about $2.3 billion frombonus bids over the 2000-2009 period (with half of that amount going toAlaska). Conversely, if oil prices were to grow only at the rate of inflation after2010, the Department of the Interior's mean resource assessment indicates thatno oil would be economically recoverable from ANWR. At an expected price of$15 per barrel, leasing might not generate any significant proceeds for the gov-ernment. Arguments in favor of this option include the national security advantages of reducing dependence on imported oil. Most of ANWR would remain closedto development, and the part of the coastal plain that would be directly affectedby oil drilling and production represents less than 1 percent of ANWR. More-over, technological changes in the industry have improved its ability to safeguardthe environment. Arguments against this option include the short-term nature of the still uncertain gain from extracting a nonrenewable resource: it will not providelasting energy security. The coastal plain is ANWR's most biologically produc-tive area and sustains the biological productivity of the entire refuge. Industrialactivity poses a threat to wildlife and the environment despite efforts to mitigateits impact.78 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 300-13 IMPOSE A NEW HARBOR MAINTENANCE FEE Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 180 2001 3122002 2602003 2442004 205 of revenues lost from repealing the exist-ing harbor tax.

RELATED OPTIONS : 300-10, 300-11, 400-06, and400-07On March 31, 1998, the Supreme Court found that the harbor maintenance tax (as it applied to exports) violated the constitutional restriction that \"No tax orduty shall be laid on articles exported from any State.\" Collection of the tax asapplied to exports ceased on April 25, 1998. One way to replace the revenueformerly generated by the harbor maintenance tax is to develop a new system ofharbor fees that is constitutional. Under such a system, the commercial users ofU.S. ports would pay a fee based on port use rather than a payment based oncargo value. Such fees would apply to imports, exports, and domestic ship-ments. Taxes currently levied on imports and domestic shipments would berescinded. Moneys generated by the fee would help support harbor operation,construction, and maintenance. The Administration has proposed such a pro-gram. The Army Corps of Engineers now spends about $875 million annually for costs associated with operating, constructing, and maintaining commercialports nationwide. A major part of those activities is maintaining adequatechannel depths. Replacing what remains of the harbor maintenance tax with amore comprehensive fee on commercial port users would generate $180 millionin 2000, $312 million in 2001, and $1.2 billion over the 2000-2004 period. Two arguments can be made for imposing a harbor maintenance fee pro- gram. First, harbor maintenance activities, such as dredging by the Corps ofEngineers, provide a commercial service to identifiable beneficiaries. Modernand well-maintained ports save shippers money through lower unit costs ofshipping on larger vessels and by minimizing inland transport costs. Exporterscurrently make no payments directly associated with their use of port facilities.Second, imposing a harbor fee program would have little effect on port usebecause the fees would result in charges on users similar to the ones users re-cently paid under the rescinded tax. Whether the imposition of a harbor fee system will pass constitutional muster is uncertain. The establishment of such a system might be viewed bythe Supreme Court as an unconstitutional export tax disguised by another name.A second legal concern with a fee program is whether it would violate interna-tional trade agreements, as several international trading partners allege of theharbor maintenance tax. Another drawback of the proposed fee system is thatafter several years, the cash it would generate would not keep pace with therevenue that the rescinded taxes would have generated. That is b ecause tax collections based on the value of the goods shipped are projected to increasemore quickly than the proposed fees, which would be tied to the costs of operat-ing, constructing, and maintaining harbors.FUNCTION 300 NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT 79 300-14 TERMINATE ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUND PAYMENTS UNDER THE SOUTH PACIFIC FISHERIES TREATY Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 0 02002 0 02003 14 142004 14 14 2005 14 14 2006 14 142007 14 142008 14 142009 14 14 Cumulative 2000-2004 28 28 2000-2009 98 98 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe South Pacific Fisheries Treaty is formally known as the Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Governmentof the United States of America. Signed in April 1987, it lays out terms andconditions under which up to 55 U.S. flag commercial fishing vessels may usepurse seine methods to catch tuna in territorial waters of 16 Pacific Islandstates, including Kiribati, Micronesia, and Papua New Guinea. Japan, Korea,and Taiwan have similar treaties providing access to the waters for their tunafleets. Associated with the treaty is an agreement on annual economic assistance paid by the United States to the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency. Theagreement provides for amending, extending, or terminating that arrangementby written agreement. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement bygiving the other party one year's written advance notice. An amended agree-ment went into effect in 1993 providing for $14 million annually from June1993 to June 2002. This option would terminate the U.S. government's pay-ments to the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency at the end of the currentagreement in 2003. Currently, the treaty also provides for an annual industry payment that covers license fees for up to 55 vessels as well as technical assistance to thePacific Island parties. In addition, the treaty calls for the U.S. tuna industry tocover the cost of the observer program. From June 1993 to June 1998, indus-try payments for licenses and technical assistance under the treaty were $4million annually. For that same period, on average, 40 U.S. flag vessels hadaccess to tuna in the territorial waters of the South Pacific Isl and states each year. Thus, industry payments per vessel, excluding the cost of the observerprogram, averaged nearly $100,000 annually. People in favor of terminating the economic support fund payments under the treaty believe that taxpayers are supporting the access of private vessels tothe territorial waters of the party states at an annual rate of over $340,000 pervessel. If those payments accurately reflect part of the value of that access tothe fisheries, such subsidization may encourage the overexploitation of fisher-ies. People who oppose this option believe that the treaty is merely an expedi- tious vehicle, and the only vehicle, through which the United States providesfinancial assistance in keeping with its foreign policy interests to the nations inthe South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency. They argue that it is not a sub-sidy\u2014the fishing industry's own payments under the treaty are comparablewith those made by non-U.S. fleets. Those fleets obtain yearly licenses on abilateral basis with any Pacific Island state of interest at a cost of 5 percent ofthe value of the previous year's catch. 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 199905101520Outlays in Billions of Dollars DiscretionaryMandatory350 Agriculture Budget function 350 funds programs administered by the Department of Agriculture.

In particular, the Agricultural Research Service, the de-partment's internal research arm, focuses on maintaining and increasing theproductivity of the nation's land and water resources, improving the quality ofagricultural products and finding new uses for them, and improving humanhealth and nutrition. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Exten-sion Service (CSREES) participates in a nationwide system of agriculturalresearch and educational program planning and coordination between stateinstitutions and USDA. CSREES also takes part in the Cooperative ExtensionSystem, a national educational network that combines the expertise and re-sources of federal, state, and local partners. The Economic Research Servicecarries out economic and other social science research and analysis for publicand private decisions about agriculture, food, natural resources, and ruralAmerica. The 1999 appropriations for those three USDA units total $1.9 billion. Reducing the funding by 10 percent would save $834 million in outlays from2000 to 2004 and $1.75 billion in outlays from 2000 to 2009. Federal funding for agricultural research may, in some cases, replace private funding. If federal funding was eliminated in those instances, the pri-vate sector would finance more of its own research. Moreover, federal fundingfor some extension activities under CSREES could be reduced without under-cutting its basic services to farmers. For example, funding for the Nutrition andFamily Education and Youth at Risk Programs totaled $68 million under the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for FiscalYear 1999. Opponents of reducing funding for research and extension activities argue that the programs play important roles in developing an efficient farm sector.Reducing federal funding could compromise the sector's future development andits competitiveness in world markets. If the private sector assumed the burdenof funding, agricultural research, which contributes to an a bundant, diverse, and relatively inexpensive food supply for U.S. consumers, could decline. More-over, some federal grants are used to improve the health of humans, animals,and plants by funding research that promotes better nutrition or more environ-mentally sound farming practices. If federal funding was cut back, the publicmight have to bear some of that cost in higher prices, forgone innovations, andenvironmental degradation.FUNCTION 350 AGRICULTURE 83 350-02 REDUCE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE SPENDING FOR EXPORT MARKETING AND INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 31 21 2001 31 282002 31 312003 31 312004 31 31 2005 31 31 2006 31 312007 31 312008 31 312009 31 31 Cumulative 2000-2004 155 142 2000-2009 310 297 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 150-03, 350-06, and 350-09The Department of Agriculture (USDA) promotes exports and international activities through the programs of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). Forexample, in the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program, FAS acts asa partner in joint ventures with \"cooperators,\" such as agricultural trade associ-ations and commodity groups, to develop markets for U.S. exports. FAS alsocollaborates on other ventures, one of which, the Cochran Fellowship Program,provides training to foreign nationals with the objective of improving commer-cial relationships that will benefit U.S. agriculture. Eliminating funding forthose two programs would reduce outlays by $142 million over the 2000-2004period and $297 million over the 2000-2009 period. The Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program, also known as the Cooperator Program, typically promotes generic products and basic commodi-ties, such as grains and oilseeds, but the program also covers some high-valueproducts, such as meat and poultry. Some critics of the program argue thatcooperators should bear the full cost of foreign promotions because the cooper-ators benefit from them directly. (How much return, in terms of market devel-opment, the Cooperator Program actually generates or the extent to which itreplaces private expenditures with public funds is uncertain.) Some observersalso cite the possibility of duplicative services because the USDA provides funding for marketing through its Market Access Program and other activities. Eliminating the Cooperator Program, however, could pl ace U.S. e xporters at a disadvantage in international markets, depending in part on the amount ofsupport other countries provide to their exporters. Regarding the issue of dupli-cative services, some advocates note that the Cooperator Program is distinctfrom other programs in part because it focuses on services to trade organiza-tions and technical assistance. People concerned about U.S. exports of genericproducts and basic commodities consider the program useful for developingmarkets that could benefit the overall economy. The Cochran Fellowship Program brings foreign midlevel managers to the United States for training in agriculture and agribusiness. Although the pro-gram is popular among recipients and their sponsors, its direct benefits to U.S.agriculture are unknown; thus, it may be marginally val uable to taxpayers. However, eliminating the Cochran Fellowship Program could hurt U.S. agricul-ture to the extent that the program builds commercial relationships, introducesforeign professionals to U.S. products, and creates new opportunities for U.S.exports.84 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 350-03 REINSTATE ASSESSMENTS ON GROWERS, BUYERS, AND IMPORTERS OF TOBACCO Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 8 8 2001 29 292002 29 292003 30 302004 30 30 2005 30 30 2006 30 302007 30 302008 30 302009 30 30 Cumulative 2000-2004 126 126 2000-2009 276 276 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe federal government aids tobacco producers by su pporting domestic tobacco prices above world-market levels. That support involves a combination ofmarketing quotas, price-supporting loans, and restrictions on imports. Thesupport program benefits about 125,000 growers and 300,000 holders of mar-keting quotas and allotments. Some quota holders actually raise tobacco, andsome rent their quota to others. For producers, tobacco is an important sourceof income, particularly in some states. The value of the 1997 tobacco crop wasestimated at $3.1 billion. The crop is produced in 16 states, and nearly two-thirds of its acreage lies in North Carolina and Kentucky. Tobacco is a controversial crop because of the health hazards of smoking, and federal support for producers has also been controversial. The price sup-port program has been modified over time to reduce its costs to the taxpayer,even though it does nothing to encourage tobacco use. In fact, it raises the priceof tobacco products to U.S. consumers but by a small amount. The Departmentof Agriculture estimates that the program may increase the price of a pack ofcigarettes by less than 2 cents. The cost of the tobacco price s upport program varies from year to year. The program may have substantial outlays in a given year, but if it functions asintended, it should have no net cost to the government over time. The reason isthat growers and purchasers of tobacco contribute to \"no-net-cost accounts\"that are used to reimburse the government for costs (excluding administrativecosts) of the price support program. Starting with the 1991 crop, growers andpurchasers each paid an additional assessment of 0.5 percent of the value ofsales (for a total collection of 1 percent of sales). Those assessments, whichwere introduced to reduce federal farm program costs and cut net federal out-lays, are set to expire with the 1998 tobacco crop. A related assessment onimported tobacco expired at the end of calendar year 1998. This option wouldreinstate those assessments beginning with the 2000 crop. Doing so wouldbring in receipts of $126 million over the 2000-2004 period. The main benefit of reinstating the assessments is reducing net federal outlays. Proponents argue that the price support program gives tobacco produc-ers substantial benefits and that the assessment recoups a portion of those bene-fits for the taxpayer. Opponents would argue that since the tobacco programcosts the government little, assessments are unfair.FUNCTION 350 AGRICULTURE 85 350-04 ELIMINATE MANDATORY SPENDING FOR THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF THE FUNDFOR RURAL AMERICA AND THE INITIATIVE FOR FUTUREAGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 150 15 2001 150 602002 150 1052003 150 1352004 0 135 2005 0 90 2006 0 452007 0 152008 0 02009 0 0 Cumulative 2000-2004 600 450 2000-2009 600 600 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 350-01The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (FAIR) estab- lished the Fund for Rural America as a mandatory program to support ruralcommunities nationwide. FAIR provided the fund with $100 million in fiscalyears 1997, 1999, and 2000\u2014one-third of which is dedicated to research, edu-cation, and extension grants administered by the Department of Agriculture's(USDA's) Cooperative State Resear ch, Educati on, and Extension Service (CSREES). The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Actof 1998 (Public Law 105-185) provided the fund with an additional $100 mil-lion, so $60 million will be provided annually for fiscal years 2000 through 2003. In addition, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 created and provided mandatory funding for the Initiative for Fu-ture Agriculture and Food Systems as a competitive grants program supportingresearch, extension, and education activities in critical emerging areas. Admin-istered by CSREES, the initiative is mandated to receive $120 million annuallyfor fiscal years 2000 to 2003 to target food genome research, food safety, hu-man nutrition, alternative uses for agricultural commod ities, biotec hnology, and precision agriculture. Eliminating those activities would reduce direct spendingby $600 million from 2000-2009. Mandatory funding is usually reserved for entitlement programs, for which funding needs may be too immediate or undisputed to warrant annual review by the Congress in the appropriation process. Supporters of this optionargue that the programs should hardly be grouped with other entitlements andshould be left where they have always been: as part of USDA's discretionaryfunding budget. Because providing the programs with mandatory funds mayavoid the spending jurisdiction and annual review of the appropriations com-mittees, supporters of the option argue that the programs do not necessarilyprovide funding for intended activities. In addition, they argue, existing discre-tionary programs can meet the agricultural research program goals. Further-more, they contend that federal funding for agricultural research may, in somecases, replace private funding. If federal f unding was eliminated in those in- stances, the private sector would finance more of its own research. Opponents of this option argue that if producers gradually receive less federal support under FAIR's new commodity policies, then the federal govern-ment should provide them with a steady flow of new technologies to improveproductivity and profitability. Opponents of the option argue that the programis necessary to address future food productivity, environmental quality, andfarm income. They also contend that reducing federal funding could compro-mise U.S. agriculture's future development and its competitiveness in worldmarkets.86 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 350-05 LIMIT FUTURE ENROLLMENT OF LAND IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE'S CONSERVATIONRESERVE PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 27 27 2001 162 1622002 253 2532003 347 3472004 429 429 2005 452 452 2006 484 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe Conservation Reserve Program promotes soil conservation, improves water quality, and provides wildlife habitat by removing land from active agriculturalproduction. Landowners contract with the program to keep land out of produc-tion, usually for a 10-year period, in exchange for annual rental payments.Such land is referred to as \"enrolled\" in the program. The federal governmentalso pays part of what farmers spend to establish approved cover crops on theland. The Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Commodity Credit Corpora-tion funds the program and spends about $1.5 billion per year on it. The pro-gram now has roughly 31 million acres enrolled; the law limits enrollment to atotal of 36.4 million acres. The Congressional Budget Office baseline assumesthat future net enrollments of land will reach the limit by 2009. Stopping newenrollments beginning October 1, 1999, would reduce outlays by $1.2 billionover the 2000-2004 period and by $5 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Some critics of the conservation reserve program see it as corporate welfare\u2014unnecessarily and inefficiently supporting farm income. Others see itas an expensive and poorly focused conservation program and believe that otheruses of the money would yield greater environmental benefits. Still other criticsworry about the loss of economic activity in areas where much crop land isretired. Demand for seed, fertilizer, and other farm supplies drops in suchareas, hurting rural communities. The Conservation Reserve Program enjoys widespread support, however. Landowners appreciate the payments, which often exceed profits from contin-ued agricultural pr oduction and are more certain. Conservationists and envi- ronmentalists recognize the program's benefits and note USDA's plans to acceptthe most environmentally sensitive land in future enrollments. Those plansinvolve special provisions for enrolling land devoted to the most effective con-serving practices such as the use of filter strips, grass waterways, and riparianbuffers. Those and several other practices yield high returns per dollar spent inenhanced wildlife habitat, water quality improvement, and reduced soil erosion.In fact, even most critics of the program recognize the need to take at leastsome environmentally sensitive land out of production for some time.FUNCTION 350 AGRICULTURE 87 350-06 ELIMINATE ATTACH \u00c9 POSITIONS IN THE FOREIGN AGRICULTURAL SERVICE Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 29 20 2001 39 332002 39 382003 39 392004 39 39 2005 39 39 2006 39 392007 39 392008 39 392009 39 39 Cumulative 2000-2004 185 169 2000-2009 380 364 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 350-02 and 370-02U.S. agricultural attach\u00e9s, located at about 60 posts worldwide, provide U.S. agricultural producers and traders with information on foreign governmentpolicies, supply and demand conditions, commercial trade relationships, andmarket opportunities.

The attach\u00e9 positions were developed to promote U.S.commodities and to help U.S. farmers, processors, distributors, and exportersadjust their operations and practices to meet world conditions. This optionwould eliminate the attach\u00e9 positions and reduce outlays by $169 million from2000 to 2004 and $364 million from 2000 to 2009. Proponents of eliminating the attach\u00e9 positions argue that the federal government should not be collecting and distributing information that directlyaids large private traders of agricultural commodities and products. Instead,they argue, private firms could collect such information. In addition, Depart-ment of State or Commerce personnel could assume the attach\u00e9s' other func-tions. Although trade is vitally important to U.S. agriculture, according to thatargument the industry no longer warrants the special treatment it receives. Opponents of eliminating the agricultural attach\u00e9 positions contend, how- ever, that because att ach\u00e9s represent the U.S. government, they have more access to information than representatives of private firms would have. Oppo-nents also maintain that if agricultural producers and traders do not receivequality agricultural information in a timely manner, the sector's responsivenessto changes in world demand for U.S. products could be compromised.

Insurance policies that farm-ers buy through the program are sold and serviced by private insurance firms,which receive an administrative cost reimbursement according to the totalamount of insurance premiums they handle. Firms also share underwriting riskwith the federal government and can gain or lose depending on the value ofcrop losses relative to claims made. Overall, the companies typically gain. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has widely studied the crop insur- ance program and, in particular, the amount paid to the firms that service andsell the insurance policies. In a 1997 study, GAO concluded that the amountthe program has paid the firms has historically exceeded the reasonable ex-penses of selling and servicing the crop insurance. Partly on the basis of thatinformation, the 105th Congress cut the reimbursement rate from 27 percent ofpremiums to 24.5 percent. This option would reduce that rate to 22.5 percent,resulting in savings of $306 million over the 2000-2009 period. Arguments for cutting the reimbursement rate hinge on the belief that the 105th Congress could have cut the reimbursement rate more deeply withoutsubstantially affecting the quantity or quality of services provided to farmers.In addition to relying on GAO's analysis, proponents of further cuts point to thedramatic expansion in business that followed enactment of the Federal CropInsurance Reform Act of 1994. Total insurance now in force totals more than$24 billion, which is about twice that of the early 1990s. Total premiums grewcorrespondingly, but because of economies of scale, the costs of selling andservicing the policies probably grew by less. Thus, proponents argue, the pro-gram could tolerate further cuts. Finally, even if cuts caused firms to curtailsome services to farmers, proponents claim that the results would not be cata-strophic or irreversible. The industry argues, however, that the cuts enacted last year will impair its ability to sell and service insurance and will threaten farmers' access toinsurance. If farmers lack insurance, the industry argues, the Congress wouldmore likely resort to expensive, special-purpose disaster relief programs whendisaster strikes, negating any apparent savings from cutting the reimbursementrate. That argument\u2014perhaps made more forcefully\u2014applies to any furtherprogram cuts. Moreover, falling crop prices reduce total premiums (and reim-bursements) but hardly affect companies' costs. Cutting reimbursement rateswould further reduce company profits, making it harder for them to maintain theservices now provided to farmers.FUNCTION 350 AGRICULTURE 89 350-08 ELIMINATE PUBLIC LAW 480 TITLE I SALES AND TITLE III GRANTS AND LIMIT THE SECRETARYOF AGRICULTURE'S AUTHORITY Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 219 115 2001 219 2002002 219 2122003 219 2122004 219 212 2005 219 212 2006 219 2122007 219 2122008 219 2122009 219 212 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,095 951 2000-2009 2,190 2,013 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 150-03The U.S. Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480) was enacted to promote commercial exports of surplus agriculturalcommodities, foster foreign markets, and aid developing countries. The lawincluded commodity sales for foreign currencies, concessional credit, andgrants. In the 45 years since the law was passed, the program may have become obsolete and inefficient. This option would eliminate sales under title I of theact and grants under title III beginning in 2000. It would also constrain author- ity provided by the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act of 1948 andother acts that allow the Secretary of Agriculture to use Commodity CreditCorporation or other funds to purchase and ship U.S. commodities abroad.Such constraints are necessary, some analysts believe, because without them,the Secretary of Agriculture could offset the effects of a cut in the program (adiscretionary one) by using Commodity Credit Corporation or other funds(mandatory spending) to purchase and ship agricultural commodities. In fact,the Secretary is using such authority in 1999 to provide about $2 billion of foodaid to Russia and other countries. This option would reduce outlays by $950 million over the 2000-2004 period and by $2 billion over the 2000-2009 peri od. Title II of the act and section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, which fund humanitarian andemergency feeding programs, would not be affected by this option. The program's effectiveness in promoting agricultural exports is question- able for two reasons: exports under titles I and III are a small portion of totalU.S. agricultural exports, and the countries currently receiving those commodi-ties are unlikely to become commercial customers. In fact, countries that re-ceive commodities under titles I and III are typically those in which the United States has a security or foreign policy interest rather than those likely to be-come commercial customers in the near term. Providing assistance to developing countries is also a goal of the programs but may not always be an efficient use of U.S. resources. Many commoditiesthat foreign countries buy with P.L. 480 assistance are resold to generate localcurrency. Those funds are used in turn to support local budgets and local devel-opment. But the inexpensive food may discourage local investment in agricul-ture, lower rural employment and income, and discourage the development oflocal stockpiles. Supporters of titles I and III argue that the programs are a flexible, fast means of providing assistance to friendly countries. They also note that theprograms reduce the likelihood that agricultural surpluses will depress prices inthe United States, and they stress the programs' humanitarian benefits: U.S.agricultural products are exported, and hungry people are fed.90 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 350-09 ELIMINATE THE MARKET ACCESS PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 5 5 2001 76 762002 90 902003 90 902004 90 90 2005 90 90 2006 90 902007 90 902008 90 902009 90 90 Cumulative 2000-2004 351 351 2000-2009 801 801 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 150-03 and 350-02The Market Access Program (MAP), formerly known as the Market Promotion Program, was authorized under the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation, andTrade Act to assist U.S. exporters of agricultural products. The program hasbeen used to counter the effects of unfair trading practices abroad, but the Uru-guay Round Agreements Act of 1994 eliminated the requirement that it be usedfor such purposes. Payments are made to partially offset the costs of marketbuilding and product promotion conducted by trade associations, commoditygroups, and some profit-making firms. On the basis of current law, the Con-gressional Budget Office assumes that $90 million will be allocated annuallyfor the program. Eliminating MAP would reduce outlays by $351 million overthe next five years. The program has been used to promote a wide range of mostly high-value products, including fruit, tree nuts, vegetables, meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, andwine. About 40 percent of MAP funding goes to promote brand-name prod- ucts. The 1996 farm bill prohibits direct MAP assistance for brand promotionsto foreign companies for foreign-produced products or to companies not recog-nized as small businesses under the Small Business Act, except for coopera-tives and nonprofit trade associations. Some critics of the program argue that participants should bear the full cost of foreign promotions because they benefit directly from them. (The extentto which the program has developed markets or replaced private expenditureswith public funds is uncertain.) In addition, some critics note the possibility ofduplication because the Department of Agriculture provides marketing fundsthrough the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program of the ForeignAgricultural Service and other activities. Many people also object to spendingthe taxpayers' money on advertising brand-name products. Eliminating MAP, however, could place U.S. exporters at a disadvantage in international markets, depending in part on the amount of support providedby other countries. Responding to concerns about duplication, some MAPadvocates note that the program differs from other programs partly because itfocuses on foreign retailers and consumer promotions. People concerned aboutU.S. exports of high-value products consider the program useful for developingmarkets and benefiting the overall economy.1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999-10-50510Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory370 Commerce and Housing Credit Budget function 370 funds programs administered by the Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Administration, and the Small Business Administration, among others.

Under the Fed-eral Credit Reform Act of 1990, the credit subsidy for those programs is theestimated net present value cost of projected defaults (excluding administrativecosts) to the SBA of guaranteeing loans over their lives. SBA's largest businesscredit programs are the general business loan guarantee, or 7(a) program; thecertified development company, or 504 program; and the small business invest-ment company (SBIC) equity capital programs. One of the programs, the certi-fied development company loan program, now operates with a zero subsidy rate.Equalizing the subsidy rate of all major SBA business loan guarantee programsat zero would reduce outlays by $1.2 billion for the 2000-2009 period measuredagainst the 1999 funding level. Under the 7(a) loan guarantee program, the federal government guarantees 80 percent of the principal for business loans up to $100,000 and 75 percent ofthe principal for larger ones. Small business investment companies in the SBICprogram are private investment firms licensed by the SBA. They make equityinvestments and long-term loans to small firms, using their own capital supple-mented with SBA-guaranteed debentures. In 1996, the Congress amended both the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act to reduce subsidy rates and improve the performance ofthe SBA's business loan programs. One of the most significant changes theCongress made was to increase the fees paid by loan recipients for most businessloans. Those increases help to reduce program costs because the revenues fromthe fees cover some of the expenses if a borrower defaults. The Congress alsocut the percentage of each loan amount that the government guarantees under theSBA's largest loan program\u2014the 7(a) program\u2014from about 90 percent to about80 percent. Reducing the guarantee rate should induce banks to more carefullyevaluate loan applications because the banks will share more responsibility forany losses from defaults. If banks use more care in approving SBA loans, thedefault rate should decline, and the program's cost to the government shoulddecrease. Adjusting fees (and changing loan guarantee levels) to cover potentialdefault losses could make the major SBA business loan programs financiallysound. As the subsidy rate declined to zero, the Congress would no longer haveto appropriate funds to cover the government's expected losses. Critics of this option believe SBA assistance aids small businesses by filling a gap in financing when banks and other traditional sources do not pro-vide loans for the purposes, in the amounts, and with the terms required by smallbusiness borrowers. Some critics argue against increasing program fees or re-ducing guarantee rates because such changes would reduce access to credit forsmall businesses. Others argue that subsidies are not necessary because the loanprograms provide the mechanism to pool risk so that the private sector will makefinancing available. Some supporters of this option argue, however, that SBAassistance serves only a tiny fraction of the nation's small businesses and thatmost of the program's borrowers could obtain financing without the SBA's help.FUNCTION 370 COMMERCE AND HOUSING CREDIT 93 370-02 REDUCE COSTS OF THE ITA BY ELIMINATING TRADE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES OR CHARGING THE BENEFICIARIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 58 40 2001 231 1732002 231 2132003 231 2312004 231 231 2005 231 231 2006 231 2312007 231 2312008 231 2312009 231 231 Cumulative 2000-2004 982 888 2000-2009 2,137 2,043 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 350-06 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Antidumping Action in the United States and Around the World: AnAnalysis of International Data (Paper), June 1998. How the GATT Affects U.S. Anti- dumping and Countervailing-DutyPolicy (Study), September 1994.The International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce has four major program activities: the Import Administration, which investi-gates antidumping and countervailing-duty cases; the trade development pro-gram, which assesses the competitiveness of U.S. industries and runs exportpromotion programs; the market access and compliance (MAC) unit, whichworks to unlock foreign markets for U.S. goods and services; and the U.S. andforeign commercial services, which counsel U.S. businesses on exporting. TheMAC unit, and perhaps the countervailing-duty program against foreign subsi-dies, may be necessary to maintain public support for free-trade policies, and insome cases, they can be defended on economic grounds. The ITA's exportpromotion, marketing, and counseling activities could be eliminated, however,or the beneficiaries could be charged fees to cover more of the programs' costs.The ITA already charges some fees for some services, but those fees do notcover the cost of all such activities. Some people argue that such activities are better left to the firms and industries involved rather than to the ITA. Others argue that those activitiesmight have some economies of scale, especially for small firms. If so, havingone entity (the federal government) counsel exporters on foreign legal and otherrequirements, disseminate knowledge of foreign markets, and promote U.S.products abroad might make sense. In that case, net federal spending could bereduced by charging the beneficiaries of those programs their full cost. Fully funding the ITA's trade promotion activities through charges that are voluntary for all beneficiaries may not be possible, however. For example, inmany cases, promoting the products of selected firms in a given industry thatwant and pay for such promotion may be impossible without also encouragingdemand for the products of all other firms in that industry. In those circum-stances, all the firms have an incentive not to purchase the services becausethey know that they are likely to receive the benefits whether they pay for themor not. Consequently, if the federal government wanted to charge beneficiariesfor the ITA's services, it might have to require that all firms in an industry (orthe industry's national tr ade group) decide together whether to purchase the ITA's services. If the firms decided to purchase them, all firms in the industrywould be required to pay according to some equitable formula. When beneficiaries do not pay the full cost of services, the ITA's activities effectively subsidize the industries involved. Those implicit subsidies are aninefficient means of helping the industries because they are partially passed onto foreigners in the form of lower prices for U.S. exports. Because the current-account balance is determined by total saving and investment in the U.S. econ-omy, over which the ITA has no influence, the agency's activities do not im-prove the current-account balance. As a result of the changes they cause inexchange rates and other variables, some combination of reduced exports inother industries and increased imports completely offsets all increases in ex-ports resulting from ITA activities. Thus, the ITA's export promotion activitieshurt other U.S. firms.94 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 370-03 ELIMINATE THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 158 16 2001 197 592002 197 1322003 197 1872004 197 197 2005 197 197 2006 197 1972007 197 1972008 197 1972009 197 197 Cumulative 2000-2004 946 591 2000-2009 1,931 1,576 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-04The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 established the Ad- vanced Tec hnology Program (ATP) within the Commerce Department's Na- tional Institute of Standards and Technology. This option would eliminate theATP, whose objective is to further the competitiveness of U.S. industry byhelping convert discoveries in basic research more quickly into technologicaladvances with commercial potential. The program awards research and devel-opment (R&D) grants on the basis of merit to individual companies, independ-ent research institutes, and joint ventures. The grants support research in ge-neric technologies that have applications for a broad range of products as wellas precompetitive research (preceding product development). The ATP's grants are limited to $2 million over a three-year period when awarded to a single firm, but they have no dollar limit when awarded to a jointventure over a period of up to five years. Joint ventures must pay at least halfof the R&D costs of each project, however, which helps ensure a project's com-mercial viability. The ATP has awarded 352 grants from its inception through 1997, includ- ing awards to 100 joint ventures. Roughly two-thirds of the firms participatingin awards are small or medium-sized firms, with large firms accounting foronly 20 percent of grant recipients. Universities and other nonprofit organiza-tions account for about 10 percent. Total funding committed to the researchprojects was $2.3 billion, of which the ATP paid roughly half. Starting in 1998, the ATP explicitly required applicants to disclose their prior efforts to secure private financing. ATP officials also made considerationof spillover benefits part of the selection criteria. The ATP was responding toearlier research done by the General Accounting Office (GAO), which foundthat almost two-thirds of applicants had not even sought private capital beforeapplying to the ATP and that half of the proposals the ATP rejected were sub-sequently funded privately. GAO found that the changes in the selection pro-cess, although positive, are insufficient, rely on the self-interested applicants forcrucial information, or are difficult to operationalize. Opponents of the program argue that private investors, not the federal government, are better able to decide which research efforts should be funded.Furthermore, citing the GAO survey, critics argue that even when the federalgovernment chooses \"a winner,\" it is just as likely as not to be displacing pri-vate capital. The U.S. venture capital markets are the best developed in theworld and do an effective job of funding new ideas. Program supporters argue that surveys of the ATP's award recipients indicate that the awards have accelerated the development and commercializa-tion of advanced tec hnology by two years or more in the majority of planned commercial applications. In addition, those surveys reveal that recipients aremore willing to tackle high-risk technology development projects as a result oftheir grants, presumably increasing both the amount and the breadth of theR&D funded.FUNCTION 370 COMMERCE AND HOUSING CREDIT 95 370-04 ELIMINATE THE MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP AND THE NATIONAL QUALITY PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 88 11 2001 110 352002 110 752003 110 1052004 110 110 2005 110 110 2006 110 1102007 110 1102008 110 1102009 110 110 Cumulative 2000-2004 528 336 2000-2009 1,078 886 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-03The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and the National Quality Pro- gram reside in the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The nonprofit centers are not owned by thefederal government but are partly funded by it. The National Quality Programconsists mainly of the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award, which isgiven to firms for achievements in quality. This option would eliminate theMEP. Proponents of MEP point to the economic importance of small and midsize firms, which produce more than half of U.S. output and employ two-thirds ofU.S. manufacturing workers. Small firms, they argue, often face limited budgets,lack of expertise, and other barriers to obtaining the information that MEP pro-vides. Those circumstances and the substantial reliance of larger firms on smalland midsize companies for supplies and intermediate goods lead proponents tocontend that MEP is needed for U.S. productivity and international competitive-ness. Opponents may question the need for government to provide such technical assistance. Small firms thrived long before MEP began in 1989, in part becauseother sources of expertise were available. Many professors of business, science,and engineering are also consultants to private industry, and other ties betweenuniversities and private firms facilitate the transfer of knowledge. In fact, someof the centers MEP subsidizes predate MEP. Furthermore, MEP cannot improve the competitiveness of the economy as a whole. The competitiveness of particular firms helped by MEP may improve,resulting in more exports or fewer competing imports. However, those changesin trade cause the dollar to rise in foreign exchange markets, decreasing the com-petitiveness of other U.S. firms. Overall, the balance of trade is not affected. Finally, one may question MEP's positive effect on the economy's produc- tivity. Federal spending for MEP is a subsidy for the firms MEP helps. In mostcases, subsidies promote inefficiency by allowing inefficient firms to remain inbusiness, tying up capital, labor, and other resources that would otherwise beused more productively elsewhere. In the case of businesses that increase theirexports, part of the subsidy is likely to be passed on to foreign customers in theform of lower prices. Like MEP advocates, defenders of the National Quality Program argue that it promotes U.S. competitiveness. The same counterargument used for MEP alsoapplies to the National Quality Program. Opponents may argue that businessesneed no government incentive to maintain quality\u2014the threat of lost sales issufficient. Furthermore, winners of the Baldridge Award often mention it in theiradvertising, which means they value it. If so, they should be willing to pay con-test entry fees large enough to eliminate the need for federal funding.96 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 370-05 ELIMINATE THE MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 22 6 2001 27 252002 27 272003 27 272004 27 27 2005 27 27 2006 27 272007 27 272008 27 272009 27 27 Cumulative 2000-2004 130 112 2000-2009 265 247 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-01The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) of the Department of Commerce plays the lead coordinating role in all federal programs for minoritybusiness development. Through public/private partnerships, the MBDA pro-vides a variety of direct and indirect business services. It provides managementand technical assistance, expands domestic and international marketing oppor-tunities, and collects and disseminates business information. The agency alsoprovides support for advocacy, research, and technology to reduce informationbarriers. This option would eliminate the MBDA, saving $2.5 billion over the2000-2009 period. The arguments for and against the MBDA mirror in part those of the larger debate over affirmative action. Proponents contend that minority groups,especially African Americans, have historically been, and continue to be, hin-dered by pervasive discrimination. They argue that such discrimination leads tofinancial and educational disadvantage and lack of experience, which meansthat members of minority groups are less competitive relative to (non-Hispanic)whites in the business world. Discrimination also hinders minority businessesin their task of developing business relationships with suppliers and customers.Minorities, according to the program's advocates, need a helping hand to com-pensate for those unfair handicaps. Opponents maintain that discrimination has substantially declined and that which remains is best fought by enforcing civil rights laws in the courts. Al-though, on average, African Americans and certain other minority groups areeconomically and educationally disadvantaged in comparison with whites, in many individual instances the reverse is true: individual African Americans ormembers of other minorities may be quite wealthy and educated and are com-peting with individual whites who are not. In such cases, opponents point out,a desire to help the disadvantaged would argue for helping the white person\u2014not the minority group member. It is unfair, according to that argument, to helpcurrent-generation minority individuals at the expense of current-generationwhites simply because previous generations of whites benefited from discrimi-nation against previous generations of minorities. Opponents contend that suchhelp should be limited to remedies for specific acts of illegal discrimination thathave been proved in court or to general help for anyone who is disadvantaged,regardless of race. If the MBDA was eliminated, the Small Business Adminis-tration would continue to provide assistance to small businesses in general.FUNCTION 370 COMMERCE AND HOUSING CREDIT 97 370-06 ELIMINATE NEW FUNDING FOR THE RURAL RENTAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 55 3 2001 55 282002 55 422003 55 532004 55 54 2005 55 54 2006 55 542007 55 542008 55 542009 55 54 Cumulative 2000-2004 275 180 2000-2009 550 450 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 600-02, 600-05, and REV-29The Section 515 housing program, administered by the Rural Housing Service (RHS), provides low-interest mortgage loans to developers of multifamilyrental projects in rural areas. Those mortgages typically have credits that re-duce the effective interest rate to 1 percent and, in turn, lower rental costs forSection 515 tenants. Under current rules, assisted tenants pay rent equal to the greater of 30 percent of their adjusted income or the minimum project rent. (The minimumproject rent for each unit consists of a proportionate share of the amortizationcosts of the 1 percent mortgage and the project's operating expenses.) Theowner of the housing project keeps the minimum rent, and the RHS collects anypayments above it. Many of the poorest t enants receive additional federal subsidies through the Rural Rental Assistance Payments program that reducetheir rent payments to 30 percent of their income. Eliminating all new commitments for assistance under the Section 515 program would reduce federal outlays by about $450 million over the 2000-2009 period. Support for this option is based on the view that expanding rural rental assistance is inappropriate when other federal programs are being cut. In addi-tion, turnover among current project residents would ensure that the programwould help some new income-eligible families each year. Critics of this option point out that it would reduce the proportion of rural families the program can help as the number of eligible families continues togrow. Moreover, eliminating new funding for the program would slow thegrowth in the supply of standard-quality, low-income rental units in rural areas.98 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 370-07 CHARGE A USER FEE ON COMMODITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS CONTRACT TRANSACTIONS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 15 15 2001 60 602002 60 602003 60 602004 60 60 2005 60 60 2006 60 602007 60 602008 60 602009 60 60 Cumulative 2000-2004 255 255 2000-2009 555 555 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collection,a mandatory offsetting receipt, or arevenue depending on the specificlanguage of the legislation estab-lishing the fee.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) administers the amended Commodity Exchange Act of 1936. The purpose of the commission is to allowmarkets to operate more efficiently by ensuring the integrity of futures marketsand protecting participants from abusive and fraudulent trade practices. A feeon transactions overseen by the CFTC could cover the agency's operating costs.Such a fee would be similar to one now imposed on securities exchanges tocover the operating costs of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A per-contract transaction fee could be imposed and remitted quarterly and adjusted periodically so that the money collected equals the CFTC's cost ofoperation. On the basis of the number of contracts traded in 1998, a fee of 10cents per contract would generate enough money to cover the CFTC's operatingexpenses\u2014$555 million over the 2000-2009 period. The CFTC would collectthe fee. The Congressional Budget Office envisions that authorizing legislationwould establish the fee, but only appropriation language would trigger thecollection of the fee. The fee would then be classified as an offsetting collec-tion. The main arguments for the fee are based on the principle that users of government services should pay for those services. Participants in transactionsthat the CFTC regulates, rather than general taxpayers, are seen as the mainbeneficiaries of the agency's operations and therefore should pay a fee, accord-ing to proponents of the fee. Furthermore, the precedent for charging user feeshas already been established by the SEC and other federal financial regulators,such as the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency. Considerations of equity and fairness suggest that not charging acomparable fee to support CFTC operations could give futures traders an unfairadvantage over securities traders. People who argue against the fee maintain that such charges tend to en- courage evasion by those who have to pay them. Users might try to avoid feesby limiting or shifting transactions to activities that are exempt from charges,which could conceivably cause some market participants to desert U.S. ex-changes for foreign exchanges. Major competing foreign exchanges, however,already charge transaction fees. Even with the proposed 10-cent fee, U.S.futures exchanges may still have a cost advantage over their major foreigncompetitors. CBO expects a fee of 10 cents to cause a negligible decrease in transac- tions because that fee is small compared with fees already imposed by the ex-changes and the industry's self-regulatory organizati on, the National Futures Association.FUNCTION 370 COMMERCE AND HOUSING CREDIT 99 370-08 ELIMINATE FHA MORTGAGE INSURANCE REBATES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 158 158 2001 158 1582002 158 1582003 158 1582004 158 158 2005 158 158 2006 158 1582007 158 1582008 158 1582009 158 158 Cumulative 2000-2004 790 790 2000-2009 1,580 1,580 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures home mortgages made by private lenders. It assumes the default risk on loans to eligible home buyers,who usually make down payments of 5 percent or less and often have debtpayment burdens that are high relative to their income. The agency chargesboth up-front and annual insurance premiums to cover its default losses. Theup-front premium equals 2.25 percentage points of the mortgage amount; theannual premium equals 0.5 percentage point of the outstanding loan balance. The FHA partially refunds the up-front premium if the borrower pays off themortgage in full during the first seven years. If the borrower takes out a newloan that the FHA insures, the refund is credited toward the up-front premiumon the new loan. If the rebate and the equivalent credit were eliminated fornewly insured loans, the government would save $158 million in 2000 and$790 million over five years. Over 10 years, the savings would total $1.6billion. Eliminating the rebate would raise the cost of FHA insurance, which could lead some borrowers to take their business to the private mortgage insur-ance industry rather than to the FHA. Borrowers who pose less default riskthan the average ones served by the FHA would be most likely to do that be-cause they are most likely to exercise their prepayment option. The increase inthe cost of insurance would be fairly small for the average FHA borrower,however, who prepays within seven years only about 20 percent of the time.For the average FHA borrower, eliminating the rebate would be equivalent toincreasing the up-front premium by about $1.70 for every $1,000 borrowed (17basis points). Many borrowers probably do not place a high value on the re-bate when deciding whether to use FHA or private insurance. Eliminating the rebate of the FHA's up-front premium would make it easier for prospective FHA borrowers to evaluate the cost of the agency's insur-ance. It would also have the advantage of better directing FHA insurance toborrowers in need of government assistance. But the resulting increase in therelative cost of FHA insurance could hamper the agency's ability to attract low-risk borrowers, whose presence helps to maintain an actuarially sound insur-ance program. Because eliminating the rebate would probably not cause manylow-risk borrowers to take their business elsewhere, however, it would proba-bly have little effect on the soundness of the program. (The most effective wayto ensure the program's soundness would be to introduce greater variation inFHA premiums based on a borrower's default risk.) In addition, raising thecost of FHA insurance by eliminating the rebate could cause some higher-riskborrowers to delay their home purchases or buy smaller homes. Because theFHA has a strong market prese nce among younger borrowers and low- and moderate-income and minority borrowers and neighborhoods, those home buy-ers and areas would most likely be affected. Whether higher-risk FHA borrow-ers account for the value of the rebate in deciding on the size and timing of theirhome purchases is unclear, however.100 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 370-09 INCREASE THE GINNIE MAE GUARANTEE FEE Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 40 40 2001 40 402002 40 402003 40 402004 40 40 2005 0 0 2006 0 02007 0 02008 0 02009 0 0 Cumulative 2000-2004 200 200 2000-2009 200 200 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, is a govern- ment corporation that facilitates the financing of federally insured and guaran-teed home mortgages. Ginnie Mae guarantees mortgage-backed securities(MBSs) collateralized by home mortgages that are insured by the FederalHousing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of VeteransAffairs or the Department of Agriculture's Rural Housing Service. Ginnie Maenow charges issuers an annual fee of 6 cents for every $100 (6 basis points) ofguaranteed MBSs backed by single-family loans. Under current law, a feeincrease to 9 basis points is scheduled to take effect in 2005. Moving the feehike up to 2000 would save $40 million in 2000 and $200 million over five years. The cost of the fee increase would be shared by two groups: the firms that issue and service the mortgages backing MBSs guaranteed by Ginnie Maeand borrowers who take out such loans. Ginnie Mae issuers would lose incomefrom a reduction in their servicing fee from the current maximum of 44 basispoints to 41 basis points (federal law limits the sum of the Ginnie Mae guaran-tee and servicing fees to 50 basis points). A Ginnie Mae servicing fee of 41basis points would probably still surpass competitive levels, which has thebenefit of inducing issuers to service loans well. Some issuers with low profitmargins would leave the market as a result, but other firms in this highly com-petitive industry would increase their business. Issuers leaving the businesswould prefer to sell their portfolios rather than default, so Ginnie Mae's defaultcosts would probably be unaffected. Alternatively, some issuers of Ginnie Mae MBSs might try to maintain their profit margins by raising the interest rates on new federally insured orguaranteed mortgages they made. Fully passing on to borrowers the cost of anincrease of 3 basis points in the guarantee fee would raise the monthly pay-ments on a $100,000 loan by $2.50. An increase of that size would probablyhave little effect on the demand for federally insured and guaranteed mortgagesor the volume of Ginnie Mae MBSs issued. Borrowers take out such loansmainly because the government accepts lower down payments and has lessstringent underwriting guidelines than do private mortgage insurers. Proponents of raising the Ginnie Mae guarantee fee by 3 basis points argue that the hike would result, at most, in a modest increase in the cost ofusing FHA mortgage insurance that would lead few, if any, borrowers to switchto private mortgage insurance. In addition, proponents argue that a modestreduction in the profitability of issuers of Ginnie Mae MBSs would not ad-versely affect the policy objective of ensuring a steady supply of credit to hous-ing. Opponents of moving up the fee hike argue that any increase in the cost ofusing FHA mortgage insurance is unwarranted. They are also concerned aboutthe precedent of raising the fee, which could open the door to later increasesthat could jeopardize the viability of many Ginnie Mae issuers or hasten theconsolidation of the mortgage banking industry.FUNCTION 370 COMMERCE AND HOUSING CREDIT 101 370-10 REQUIRE ALL GSEs TO REGISTER WITH THE SEC Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 259 2001 2572002 2582003 2582004 249 2005 1,282 2000-2009 the additional receipts would be revenues; a portionof the fees would be offsettingcollections credited againstdiscretionary spending. RELATED OPTION : 920-04 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Assessing the Public Costs and Benefits of Fannie Mae andFreddie Mac (Report), May 1996. Controlling the Risks of Government-Sponsored Enter-prises (Report), April 1991.Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are private financial institutions chartered by the federal government to support the flow of funds to agriculture,housing, and higher education. GSEs achieve their public purposes by borrow-ing on the strength of an implicit federal guarantee of their debt obligations.The implicit guarantee lowers GSEs' cost of borrowing, conveying subsidiesthat give them a competitive advantage in financial markets. The federal gov-ernment also explicitly subsidizes five GSEs\u2014Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, theFederal Home Loan Bank System, the Farm Credit System, and Sallie Mae\u2014by exempting them from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of1933. That statute requires all corporations issuing stock or debt securitieswith maturities of more than nine months to register such offerings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), disclose uniform informationabout the securities, and pay registration fees. A sixth enterprise, Farmer Mac,is not exempt from SEC registration. In 1992, the Department of the Treasury,the Federal Reserve, and the SEC advocated requiring the five GSEs that arenow exempt to register their securities with the SEC, which would save $259million in 2000, $1.3 billion over five years, and $2.1 billion by 2009. Requiring issuers to register their securities with the SEC protects inves- tors by ensuring that all offerings are accompanied by disclosures of uniforminformation. GSEs were originally exempted from the requirement in part torelieve them of the costs of registering until they became accepted names in themarketplace. That rationale no longer applies: the five exempt GSEs are wellknown in financial markets. Repealing the exemption would not impose signif-icant additional regulatory burdens on those GSEs because they now disclosemost of the required information voluntarily. Moreover, it would reduce thecompetitive advant age that the enterprises have over other firms that finance loans by issuing debt or mortgage-backed securities. A more level playing fieldwould likely lead to a more efficient allocation of credit. To register with the SEC, each of the five GSEs would pay about 26 cents for every $1,000 (a bout 3 basis points) in securities it issued in 2000. SEC registration fees are scheduled to decline gradually under current law and willbe less than 1 basis point in 2007 and later years. Competition from whollyprivate firms and between the enterprises would limit the GSEs' ability to re-coup the cost of paying registration fees by raising the interest rates on theloans they finance. Fully absorbing the costs of registration would have littleeffect on either the enterprises' profits or the interest rates paid by the borrow-ers they serve. If Fannie Mae absorbed the full cost of registering its securities,for example, that GSE's after-tax return on equity would probably decline byless than 1 percentage point. But if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac raised therates on the home mortgages they buy so that the rate would cover the full costof registering securities issued to finance such loans, the payments of home-owners with 30-year, fixed-rate loans with an initial balance of $150,000would rise by less than 30 cents per month.102 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 370-11 IMPOSE A LEASE FEE ON ANALOG TELEVISION LICENSEES Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 200 2001 2002002 2002003 2002004 200 2005 200 2006 2002007 1502008 1342009 100 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,000 2000-2009 1,784 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee. RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Two Approaches for Increasing Spectrum Fees (Memorandum), November 1998.In the next several years, new digital television service will be introduced, and the current analog television service will be turned off once the new service iswell established. Analog television broadcasts are tentatively scheduled to endin 2006 but most likely will continue in many markets for awhile. After 2006,the analog licensees have the option of requesting an extension of their licensesin markets where digital television can be used by 85 percent of the households. This option, also proposed in the President's budget, would impose a fee totaling $200 million per year on analog broadcasters, beginning in fiscal year2000. (Television broadcasters now pay a fee of about $10 million per year thatcovers the cost to the Federal Communications Commission of regulating thetelevision industry.) The proposed fee would continue for as long as a broad-caster held a license to broadcast analog television. After 2006, the number ofanalog broadcasters would decline, on a market-by-market basis, as the transi-tion to digital television is completed. CBO estimates that this option wouldraise $200 million in 2000 and almost $1.8 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Proponents of the fee argue that broadcasters receive the right to use valu- able publicly owned airwaves and should compensate the public for that right.In addition, the public has an interest in completing the transition to digital tele-vision by the end of 2006. The fee, which is approximately 20 times the currentfee paid by broadcasters, would create a significant financial incentive forbroadcasters not to extend their analog licenses after 2006. Opponents of the fee argue that it places an undue burden on broadcasters and the television-viewing public and that the collection level set in the Admin-istration's proposal is not supported by an economic rationale. Although thebroadcast industry s hould be able to absorb the cost of the fee, the burden on some individual broadcasters could be significant, depending on how the fee isdistributed among television licensees. Broadcasters may argue that the feewould consume revenues that would otherwise be used to support the transitionto digital television, thus possibly delaying the introduction of the new service.Finally, broadcasters may cease broadcasting analog television in 2006 to avoidpaying the fee even if the market they are in has not sufficiently converted todigital television. (Sufficient conversion means that 85 percent of households ina market would be able to receive the new signal). Consequently, many house-holds may not be able to receive on-air television.1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 199901020304050Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory400 Transportation Budget function 400 funds most programs of the Department of Transportation as well as aero- nautical research by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

TheCongress has appropriated $609 million for Amtrak in 1999; however, accord-ing to Amtrak's strategic business plan, Amtrak should be self-supporting on anoperational basis by the end of 2002. By requiring Amtrak to finance its capi-tal investments without federal assistance, the government would save $3.9billion over the 2000-2009 period. When the Congress established Amtrak in 1970, it anticipated providing subsidies for a limited time only, until Amtrak could become self-supporting.By the late 1970s, however, annual federal subsidies had risen to more than $1billion. In fact, Amtrak has consumed more than $20 billion in federal subsi-dies since its creation. In 1981, the Administration proposed substantial cuts in federal funding. Amtrak subsequently raised fares and reduced costs, and subsidies declined toabout $600 million a year in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, federal subsi-dies rose again, to about $950 million in appropriations in 1995, before declin-ing to the current level. In addition to appropriations, Amtrak received $2.2billion (in credits for tax refunds) under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 forcapital improvements and maintenance. This option would require Amtrak tocontinue on the path of cutting costs and increasing revenues. Proponents of eliminating federal subsidies contend that the time has come for Amtrak to be self-supporting, as initially envisioned. Without federal subsi-dies, Amtrak would have to focus on service that has the greatest potential forfinancial success, such as the Metroliner's high-speed service al ong the con- gested corridor between Washington and New York City, where passengers arewilling and able to pay the full cost of the service. Without subsidies, propo-nents argue, Amtrak would improve efficiency and equity in its operations andinvestments. Regarding equity, people who favor eliminating subsidies claimthat it is unfair for the federal government to subsidize business travelers, whomake up a substantial share of Amtrak passengers in congested corridors, andvacationers with high incomes. Under this option, states or local governmentsthat want to keep Amtrak service in their areas could provide subsidies. Opponents of ending subsidies say that reducing federal support would cause Amtrak to cancel service on lightly traveled routes, possibly leavingpassengers in those areas without alternative transportation. They also notethat subsidizing rail service in congested areas may be justified as a way ofoffsetting the congestion costs imposed on and by users of highways, airports,and airways. Retaining federal subsidies for Amtrak, especially for servingcongested corridors, may help balance those costs. Moreover, improving ser-vice on some corridors could strengthen the national passenger rail system byproviding linkages to better-performing routes.FUNCTION 400 TRANSPORTATION 105 400-02 ELIMINATE GRANTS TO LARGE AND MEDIUM-SIZED HUB AIRPORTS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 858 146 2001 : Budget authority is mandatory. Outlays are discretionary.Under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), the Federal Aviation Adminis- tration (FAA) provides grants to airports for expanding runways, improvingsafety and security, and meeting other capital needs. From 1982 to 1997, nearly 44 percent of AIP funding went to large and medium-sized hub air- ports\u2014the 70 or so airports that together account for nearly 90 percent of pas-senger boardings. This option would eliminate AIP funding for those airportsbut continue funding for smaller airports at levels consistent with those of 1999,assuming that the smaller airports will receive about 56 per cent of the $1.95 billion made available in 1999, or about $1.1 billion. Budget authority for the AIP is provided in authorization acts as contract authority, which is a mandatory form of budget authority. Spending of contractauthority is subject to obligation limitations, which are contained in appropria-tion acts. Therefore, outlays from AIP contract authority are categorized asdiscretionary. Contract authority and obligation limitations allow an agency toenter into financial obligations that will result in future outlays. This optionassumes that both budget authority and obligation limitations are reduced,saving $7.2 billion over the 2000-2009 period. People who want to end the grants maintain that larger airports do not need federal funding and that federal grants simply substitute for funds thatairports could raise from private sources. Because of their large volume oftraffic, those airports generally have been able to finance investments throughbond issues, passenger facility charges, and other user fees. In contrast, smallerairports may have more difficulty raising funds for capital improvements, al-though some have succeeded in tapping the same funding sources as their largecounterparts. Supporters of this option argue that it would focus federal spend-ing on airports that most need federal aid. Proponents of continuing federal grants to larger airports argue that the controls exerted by the FAA as conditions of receiving aid ensure that the air-ports will continue to make investment and operating decisions that are consis-tent with the national interest of providing a safe and efficient aviation system.106 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 400-03 ELIMINATE THE ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 50 30 2001 50 502002 50 502003 50 502004 50 50 2005 50 50 2006 50 502007 50 502008 50 502009 50 50 Cumulative 2000-2004 250 230 2000-2009 500 480 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe Essential Air Service (EAS) program was created by the Airline Deregula- tion Act of 1978 to continue air service to communities that had received feder-ally mandated air service before deregulation. The program provides subsidiesto air carriers serving small communities that meet certain criteria. Subsidiescurrently support air service to 114 U.S. communities, including 26 in Alaska(for which separate rules apply). The number of passengers served annuallyhas fluctuated in recent years, as has the subsidy per passenger, which hasranged from $4 to $400. The Congress has directed that such subsidies notexceed $200 per passenger unless the community is more than 210 miles fromthe nearest large or medium-sized hub airport. This option would eliminate the EAS program, thus providing savings in mandatory outlays of $480 million from 2000 to 2009. To adopt this option,the Congress would have to modify the provision of the Federal Aviation Reau-thorization Act of 1996 that authorized $50 million a year in direct spendingfor the EAS program. That law also authorized the Federal Aviation Adminis-tration (FAA) to collect up to $100 million in fees for specified air traffic con-trol services (for certain aircraft flying over the United States but not taking offor landing at a U.S. airport), of which $50 million was to be made available forthe EAS subsidies. The law further provided that even if the FAA did not col-lect $50 million in fees, it still had to provide that amount for the EAS program.The FAA's initial fee structure was overturned in court, however. While theagency is developing a new fee structure, it is collecting no fees. This optionwould not affect fee collection, but it would sever the link between fees andEAS subsidies. Phasing out the program over several years would mitigatedisruptions. Critics of the EAS program contend that the subsidies are excessive, providing air transportation at a high cost per passenger. They also maintainthat the program was intended to be transitional and that the time has come tophase it out. If states or communities derive b enefits from service to small communities, the states or communities could provide the subsidies themselves. Supporters of the subsidy program claim that it prevents the isolation of rural communities that would not otherwise receive air service. Subsidies arenot available for service to communities located less than 70 miles from a largeor medium-sized hub airport (except in Alaska). The availability of airlinetransportation is an important ingredient in the economic development of smallcommunities. Without continued air service, according to some proponents,some towns might lose a sizable portion of their economic base.FUNCTION 400 TRANSPORTATION 107 400-04 ELIMINATE NASA's SUPPORT FOR PRODUCERS AND USERS OF COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 216 102 2001 270 2242002 270 2592003 270 2692004 270 270 2005 270 270 2006 270 2702007 270 2702008 270 2702009 270 270 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,296 1,124 2000-2009 2,646 2,474 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 250-01The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) funds two pro- grams that develop technology and systems intended for use in commercial airliners to preserve the U.S. share of the current and future world airlinermarket. The first, the Advanced Subsonic Technology program, explores tech-nologies that would create safer, more fuel-efficient, less polluting, and cheaperairliners than today's models. The program also supports the development oftechnologies that could extend the life of existing aircraft. The second program,the High-Speed Research program, involves a cooperative venture with U.S.industry for developing an economically viable commercial supersonic airliner.This option would eliminate both programs, saving $2.5 billion over 10 years. The case for eliminating the programs is that the research and develop- ment (R&D) necessary to maintain U.S. market share is a private rather than apublic responsibility. Aircraft company owners and employees benefit fromsuccess in the world market; therefore, they should pay for the R&D necessaryto produce better aircraft, according to that argument. Sizable investments areneeded to develop, produce, and market a new commercial aircraft\u2014$8 billionto $10 billion by some estimates\u2014and developing new aircraft requires manyyears. Neither of those facts, however, should affect whether the public orprivate sector pays for producing the necessary technologies. Moreover, theBoeing Company's recent decision to withdraw its participation from the High-Speed Research program indicates a lack of private-sector interest. The case for continuing the programs is based largely on the unique com- petitive features of the market for large commercial aircraft. The United Statesand the European Union have a bilateral agreement permitting public supportfor developing commercial airliners. If the federal government failed to grantU.S. aircraft companies support comparable with that provided by the govern-ments of European competitors, advocates of ending the programs argue, U.S.producers would face a severe disadvantage in the global market. A second argument for continuing NASA's expenditures on the programs is that limitations on noise levels and atmospheric pollutants impose an un-funded federal mandate on aircraft producers and airlines. Federal funds spentfor research on noise and pollution abatement, compared with funds spent forenhancing the economic viability of commercial aircraft, might be justifiedbecause those funds cover a cost that federal law imposes on the industry. Theextent to which noise and atmospheric pollutants generated by jet air travelconstitute unpaid \"costs\" that air travelers impose on the public at large, how-ever, diminishes that argument. From that point of view, it is appropriate thataircraft producers, airlines, and, ultimately, air travelers pay the full social costof their activities\u2014including the cost of R&D for current and future jet aircraft.108 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 400-05 ESTABLISH CHARGES FOR AIRPORT TAKEOFF AND LANDING SLOTS Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 500 2001 5002002 5002003 5002004 500 2005 500 2006 5002007 5002008 5002009 500 Cumulative 2000-2004 2,500 2000-2009 5,000 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee.

(Study), May 1992.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established controls on airport takeoff and landing slots at four airports: Kennedy International and LaGuardia in New York, O'Hare in Chicago, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Under this option, the FAA would charge annual fees forslots at those airports. The FAA instituted limits on takeoff and landing slots in 1968 and allo- cated them to airlines without charge. FAA-controlled airports have about3,500 air carrier slots and 1,000 commuter and general aviation slots. Airlinesare allowed to buy and sell slots from and to each other, with the understandingthat the FAA retains ultimate control and can withdraw the slots or otherwisechange the rules for using them at any time. Estimating the revenue from slot charges is difficult. Slot values vary by airport, time of day and season they are available, and other factors. Moreover,both legislative and administrative actions may reduce slot values substantially.Legislation under consideration in the 106th Congress would eliminate slotrestrictions at Kennedy, La Guardia, and O'Hare and would increase the num-ber at Ronald Reagan Washington National. Those provisions would eliminateor greatly reduce the value of existing slots. In addition, in recent years, theSecretary of Transportation has approved several exemptions to the slot rules topermit new service to rural areas or to increase competition. The effect of thoseexemptions on slot values is unclear. On the one hand, the increase in the sup-ply of slots could diminish the value of each slot. On the other hand, exemp-tions for rural service could add to the value of some air carriers' slots by pro-viding feeder traffic for their main routes. The amount of revenue that thegovernment would obtain from annual charges would depend on similar factors.For those reasons, the Congressional Budget Office's revenue estimates aresomewhat equivocal. CBO estimates receipts to be about $500 million annu-ally, but they could be higher or lower depending on the structure of the slots'leasing arrangements\u2014such as length, whether slots could be subleased, andusage requirements\u2014as well as market conditions affecting the airline industry. The main argument for establishing charges for slots is that public air- space is scarce and private firms and individuals s hould pay for the benefits that result from that scarcity. Furthermore, the charges would provide an in-centive for using those scarce resources most efficiently. The main argument against charging for slots is that the scarcity of slots at the four airports mentioned arises mainly from a lack of land and runway space;the fees are not intended to provide more capacity. Furthermore, if the currentprices that airlines already pay in the private sale of slots accurately reflecttheir value, the proposal might not produce more efficient use of those scarceresources; the result would only redistribute the benefits from their use betweenthe private and public sectors.FUNCTION 400 TRANSPORTATION 109 400-06 INCREASE USER FEES FOR FAA CERTIFICATES AND REGISTRATIONS Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 4 2001 42002 42003 42004 4 2005 4 2006 42007 42008 42009 4 Cumulative 2000-2004 20 2000-2009 40 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee. RELATED OPTION : 300-13The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees a large regulatory pro- gram to ensure safe operation of aircraft within the United States. It overseesand regulates the registration of aircraft, licensing of pilots, issuance of medicalcertificates, and other similar activities. The FAA issues most licenses andcertificates free of charge or at a price well below its cost of providing suchregulatory approvals. For example, the current fee for registering aircraft is $5,but the FAA's cost of providing the service is closer to $30. The FAA esti-mates the cost of issuing a pilot's certificate to be $10 to $15, but the agency does not charge for the certificates. Imposing fees to cover the costs of theFAA's regulatory services could increase receipts by an estimated $20 millionover the 2000-2004 period. Net savings could be somewhat smaller than thoseshown if the FAA needed additional resources to develop and administer fees. The Drug Enforcement Assistance Act of 1988 authorizes the FAA to impose several registration fees as long as they do not exceed the agency's costof providing that service. For general aviation, the act allows fees of up to $25for aircraft registration and up to $12 for pilots' certificates (plus adjustmentsfor inflation). Setting higher fees would require additional legislation. TheCongress could provide for them in the legislation currently under considerationthat would reauthorize the FAA. Increasing regulatory fees might burden some aircraft owners and opera- tors. That effect could be mitigated by setting registration fees according to thesize or value of the aircraft rather than to the FAA's cost. FAA fees based onthe cost of service, however, would be comparable with automobile registrationfees and operators' licenses and thus likely to be affordable, especially whencompared with the total cost of owning an airplane.110 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 400-07 ESTABLISH MARGINAL COST-BASED FEES FOR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SERVICES Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 2,000 2001 2,0002002 2,0002003 2,0002004 2,000 2005 2,000 2006 2,0002007 2,0002008 2,0002009 2,000 Cumulative 2000-2004 10,000 2000-2009 20,000 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee. RELATED OPTION : 300-13 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Paying for Highways, Airways, and Waterways: How Can Users BeCharged? (Study), May 1992.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates the air traffic control (ATC) system, which serves commercial air carriers, military aircraft, and suchsmaller users as air taxis and private corporate and recreational aircraft. Traf-fic controllers in airport towers, terminal radar approach control facilities(TRACONs), and air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs) help guide aircraftsafely as they taxi to the runway, take off, fly through designated airspace,land, and taxi to the airport gate. Other ATC services include flight servicestations that provide weather data and other information useful to small-aircraftoperators. This option would impose fees for ATC services that reflect the FAA's marginal costs of providing the services. The marginal cost of a flight equalsthe costs of each ATC service (or contact) provided for that flight. For exam-ple, a commercial flight from New York to San Francisco entails contacts withtwo airport towers, two TRACONs, and seven ARTCCs. Under this option,the airline would pay the sum of the marginal costs of each of those contacts. A1997 FAA study estimated total marginal costs to be about $2 billion a year. The amount of the government's total collections in fees based on mar- ginal costs plus revenues from aviation user taxes could equal either more orless than the FAA's total expenditures. Currently, appropriations from thegeneral fund finance part of the operational cost of the ATC system. The Air-port and Airway Trust Fund, comprising revenues from user taxes (such as theairline passenger ticket tax), finances the rest of the costs. In recent years, thegeneral fund's share of costs has averaged about $2 billion (or about half oftotal ATC costs). The amount provided from the general fund dropped to about$1 billion (or about one-quarter of ATC costs) in 1999. If charging users theirmarginal costs yielded larger federal collections than needed to cover futuregeneral fund contributions, the fees could be lowered or excise taxes reducedaccordingly. Fees based on marginal costs would affect different types of airline opera- tions differently. Carriers mainly using hub-and-spoke networks would proba-bly face higher fees than those providing nonstop origin-destination flightsbecause of differences in the number of contacts with towers and TRACONs. Imposing fees for marginal costs would encourage users to use the ATC system efficiently. Noncommercial users might reduce their consumption ofATC services, freeing controllers for other tasks and increasing the system'soverall capacity. By analyzing the pattern of revenues from user fees, FAAplanners could better decide on the amount and location of additional ATCinvestment, which would improve system efficiency. The main argument against this option is that it would raise the cost of ATC services to users. Such a move could weaken the financial condition ofsome commercial air carriers.FUNCTION 400 TRANSPORTATION 111 400-08 DISCONTINUE FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR HIGHWAY PROJECTS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 132 36 2001 132 912002 132 1142003 132 1212004 132 127 2005 132 129 2006 132 1322007 132 1322008 132 1322009 132 132 Cumulative 2000-2004 660 488 2000-2009 1,320 1,146 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) authorized spending of about $175 billion from the Highway Trust Fund, which providesthe appropriations for construction and maintenance of interstate highways andbridges and a variety of other federal efforts related to highways. That fundinglevel represents an increase from previous authorizations. In 1999, the Con-gress appropriated from the general fund additional funding for highway pro-grams above the level authorized by TEA-21. This option would discontinuemaking appropriations from the general fund for highway programs, saving$1.1 billion over the 2000-2009 period. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) exemplifies one program that would not receive additional funding under this option. It alsoserves as the basis for estimating the amount of money that this option couldsave. The Congress has appropriated $132 million from the general fund forroads in the ADHP. That amount was in addition to TEA-21's authorization of$450 million annually (subject to contract authority to be appropriated from theHighway Trust Fund) for the ADHP. Before 1998, ADHP received about$100 million annually. This option assumes that no additional outlays would beprovided from the general fund after 1999. People who favor discontinuing the use of the general fund for funding highway projects contend that TEA-21 was the appropriate authorizing legisla-tion for the Congress to use in deciding how much to spend on highways andhow to set priorities for road projects. They argue that the additional $132million from the general fund was not scrutinized as much as the funds autho-rized by TEA-21. In addition, proponents of this option maintain that highwayfunding under TEA-21 has increased significantly compared with previousyears, currently providing much more funding for ADHP than in recent years.Opponents of this option argue that the funding is needed to promote economicdevelopment in areas that have lagged behind the rest of the country and thatthe Appalachian region has been short-changed for many years.112 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 400-09 IMPOSE A USER FEE TO COVER THE COST OF THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION'S RAILSAFETY ACTIVITIES Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 61 2001 612002 612003 612004 61 2005 61 2006 612007 612008 612009 61 Cumulative 2000-2004 305 2000-2009 610 SPENDING CATEGORY : This fee could be classified as a discretionary offsetting collectionor a mandatory offsetting receiptdepending on the specific languageof the legislation establishing thefee.The function of the Railroad Safety Program is to protect railroad employees and the public by ensuring the safe operation of passenger and freight trains.Field safety inspectors are responsible for enforcing federal safety regulationsand standards. Other functions include issuing standards, procedures, andregulations; administering postaccident and random drug testing of railroademployees; providing technical training; and managing highway grade-crossingprojects. Railroad safety fees, which had been authorized in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, expired in 1995. Before 1995, railroads weresubject to the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA's) safety oversight userfees that covered the safety enforcement and administrative costs of carryingout FRA's mandated safety responsibilities. Those fees offset a portion offederal spending on safety programs. As of 1995, the FRA does not receiveany funding from user charges for operating its safety program. This option would impose new user fees to offset 100 percent of the costs of the Railroad Safety Program\u2014$600 million over 10 years. Those in favor ofuser fees contend that the specific recipients of government services should bearthe cost of those services. The user fees would relieve the general taxpayer ofthe burden of supporting the Railroad Safety Program. People who oppose having users pay for the service contend that the gen- eral public is the main beneficiary of the Railroad Safety Program. Critics ofthis option also note that other than businesses in the pipeline industry, no otherfreight or transportation businesses pay safety user fees.1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999-5051015Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory450 Community and Regional Development Budget function 450 funds programs that support the development of physical and financial infrastruc- ture intended to promote viable community economies, including activities of the Department ofCommerce and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Funds are generally allocated among thestates on the basis of their rural populations and the number of rural familieswith income below the poverty threshold. Within each state's allocation, thedepartment awards funds competitively to eligible applicants, including state andlocal agencies, nonprofit organizations, and (in the case of loan guarantees forbusiness and industry) for-profit firms. The terms of a particular recipient's assistance depend on the purpose of the aid and, in some cases, the economic condition of the recipient's area. For exam-ple, aid for water and waste-disposal projects can take the form of loans withinterest rates ranging from 4.5 percent to market rates, depending on the area'smedian household income; areas that are particularly needy may receive grants ora mix of grants and loans. For 1999, the Congress appropriated $723 million for RCAP's grants and the budgetary cost of its loans and loan guarantees, which is defined under creditreform as the present value of the interest rate subsidies and expected defaults.The Congress could reduce future spending by capitalizing state revolving loanfunds (SRLFs) for rural development and then ending federal RCAP assistance.The amount of federal savings would depend on the level and timing of the con-tribution to capitalize the SRLFs. Under one illustrative option, the federalgovernment would provide steady funding of $723 million annually for five moreyears to capitalize the funds, then cut off assistance in 2005. The option wouldyield savings of $1.7 billion from 2005 to 2009. That level of capitalizationalone would not support the volume of loans and grants now provided annuallyby RCAP. Accordingly, the Congress could choose to allow the SRLFs to usethe capitalization funds as collateral with which to leverage additional capitalfrom the private sector, as has been allowed with the SRLFs established underthe Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The main argument for replacing RCAP with a system of SRLFs is that the federal government should not bear continuing responsibility for local develop-ment; rather, programs that benefit localities, whether urban or rural, should befunded at the state or local level. On the basis of that argument, a few moreyears of federal funding to capitalize SRLFs would provide a reasonable transi-tion to the desired policy. One argument against converting RCAP is that without annual infusions of new federal money, states will feel a need to stretch their rural developmentfunds by reducing the number of grants and interest rate subsidies, making itharder for needier communities to find affordable assistance. In addition, prece-dent suggests that the estimated federal savings may not materialize: the Con-gress continues to appropriate additional grants to the state funds for wastewatertreatment systems, long past the point at which those funds were originally de-signed to be independent of federal support.FUNCTION 450 COMMUNITY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 115 450-02 ELIMINATE THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 374 23 2001 380 1112002 386 1982003 390 3052004 391 380 2005 392 392 2006 392 3922007 392 2,977 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Economic Development Administration (EDA), an agency within the Com- merce Department, provides grants to state and local governments for publicworks, technical assistance, defense conversion activities, and job programs, aswell as loan guarantees to firms for business development. For 1999, appropri-ations for EDA programs total $392 million. Eliminating EDA would reducefederal outlays by $23 million in 2000 and $3 billion over the 2000-2009 period. The main argument for eliminating EDA\u2014and all federal efforts in local economic development\u2014is that money for activities that mainly benefit locali-ties should be provided by state or local governments, not the federal govern-ment. Even if one accepts a federal role in local development, however, EDA'seffectiveness in accomplishing that mission is questionable. The 1993 NationalPerformance Review found, for example, that the agency had not adequatelyadapted to increased development activity by state and local governments, thatit had an outdated emphasis on public works and infrastructure development,and that the many federal development programs resulted in \"fragmentation,poor quality, and excessive bureaucracy.\" Nonetheless, five years later, publicworks remains the single largest category of EDA assistance, and several fed-eral departments and agencies continue to operate large, distinct developmentprograms. Critics also argue that EDA's broad eligibility criteria, which coverareas containing an estimated 80 percent to 90 percent of the U.S. population,allow the agency to approve grants to communities that are not economicallydistressed. In two examples from 1995, EDA gave Cheyenne, Wyoming, andRapid City, South Dakota, grants totaling $980,000, although the cities' unem-ployment rates were below their states' averages\u20143.3 percent and 2.6 percent,respectively, compared with 4.5 percent and 2.9 percent statewide. Supporters of continued funding for EDA argue that the federal govern- ment has a legitimate role to play in local development, not only in providingneedy areas with more funding than they would receive from their state govern-ments or could raise locally but also in helping communities adjust to suchfederal policies as military base closures and free-trade agreements. EDA'ssupporters also note that the agency has reduced staff from early-1990s' levels,eliminated many regulations, and established performance measures for itsgrant programs. Supporters also cite evidence that agency grants generally dotarget needier areas: a 1997 Rutgers University study of the 203 public worksprogram grants receiving their final payment in 1990 found that poverty andunemployment rates were roughly 40 percent higher and per capita income wasabout 40 percent lower in the median recipient county than nationwide.116 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 450-03 ELIMINATE THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 66 7 2001 66 202002 66 402003 66 502004 66 59 2005 66 66 2006 66 662007 66 662008 66 662009 66 66 Cumulative 2000-2004 330 176 2000-2009 660 506 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe federal government provides annual funding to the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) for activities that promote economic growth in the Appala-chian counties of 13 states. For 1999, the Congress appropriated $66 millionfor ARC. The states are responsible for filing development plans and recom-mending specific projects for federal funding. The commission distributes thefunds competitively according to such factors as the area's growth potential, percapita income, and unemployment rate; the financial resources of the state andlocality; the project's prospective long-term effectiveness; and the degree ofprivate-sector involvement. ARC supports a variety of programs, including the Community Develop- ment Program, mainly to create jobs; the Human Development Program, toimprove rural education and health; and the Local Development District Pro-grams, to provide planning and technical assistance to multicounty organiza-tions. (In 1998, the Congress transferred the responsibility for the AppalachianDevelopment Highway System, previously another main ARC program, to thegeneral Transportation Trust Fund.) Federal funds also support 50 percent ofthe salaries and expenses of ARC staff. Discontinuing the programs f unded through ARC would reduce federal outlays by $7 million in 2000 and by $506million over the 2000-2009 period. The debate over eliminating ARC focuses on two main points. First, ARC's critics argue that the responsibility for supporting local or regional de-velopment basically lies with the state and local governments whose citizenswill benefit from the development, not with the federal government. ARC'ssupporters believe that the federal government has a legitimate role to play inredistributing funds among states to support development in the neediest areasand that reducing federal funding would reduce local progress in job creation,education, and health care. Second, the agency's critics note that all parts of thecountry have needy areas and argue that those areas in Appalachia have nospecial claim to federal dollars. According to such critics, needy Appalachianareas should, like other areas, get federal development aid thr ough national programs, such as those of the Economic Development Administration. ARC'sdefenders respond that Appalachia's size, physical isolation, and severe povertyhave created a unique situation requiring special attention.FUNCTION 450 COMMUNITY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 117 450-04 DROP WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES FROM THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 591 : DiscretionaryThe Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides annual grants, by formula, to metropolitan cities and urban counties through what isreferred to as its entitlement component. The program also allocates funds, byformula, to each state. Those funds are distributed among the states' smaller andmore rural communities, called nonentitlement areas, typically through a compet-itive process. In general, CDBG funds must be used to aid low- and moderate-income households, eliminate slums and blight, or meet emergency needs. Specificeligible uses include housing rehabilitation, infrastructure improvement, andeconomic development. Funds from the entitlement component may also be usedto repay bonds that are issued by local governments (for acquiring public prop-erty, for example) and guaranteed by the federal government under the Section108 program. For 1999, the CDBG program received a regular appropriation of$4.75 billion, including $2.95 billion for entitlement communities, plus supple-mental appropriations totaling $380 million. Under current law, all urban counties, metropolitan cities, and other cities of 50,000 or more are eligible for the CDBG entitlement program. The formulafor allocating entitlement funds includes the following factors: population, the number of residents with income below the poverty level, the number of housingunits with more than one person per room, the number of housing units builtbefore 1940, and the extent to which an area's population growth since 1960 isless than the average for all metropolitan cities. The formula neither requires athreshold percentage of residents living in poverty nor excludes communitieswith high average income. Federal spending for the program could be reduced by focusing entitlement grants on more needy jurisdictions and lowering funding accordingly. Severalalternative changes to the current formula could yield similar results; one simpleapproach, however, would be to exclude communities whose per capita incomeexceeds the national average by more than a certain percentage. Data from theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development on the 1993 grants to entitle-ment cities (but not counties) suggest that restricting the grants to communitieswhose per capita income is less than 112 percent of the national average, forexample, would save 26 percent of the entitlement funds, in part by cutting thelarge grants to New York City and Los Angeles. To illustrate the general idea,the Congressional Budget Office has assumed a somewhat smaller cut of 20percent of entitlement funding, which would save an estimated $12 million in2000 and $4.7 billion from 2000 to 2009. Proponents of that change argue that if the CDBG program can be justified at all\u2014some argue that using federal funds for local development is generallyinappropriate\u2014its primary rationale is redistribution and that redistributingmoney to less needy communities serves no pressing interest. Opponents arguethat such a change would reduce efforts to aid low- and moderate-income house-holds in poverty pockets within those communities because local governmentswould not sufficiently redirect their own funds to completely offset the lostgrants.118 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 450-05 ELIMINATE THE NEIGHBORHOOD REINVESTMENT CORPORATION Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 90 90 2001 90 902002 90 902003 90 902004 90 90 2005 90 90 2006 90 902007 90 902008 90 902009 90 90 Cumulative 2000-2004 450 450 2000-2009 900 900 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) is a public, nonprofit organization charged with revitalizing distressed neighborhoods.

As of 1998, the NeighborWorks \u00ae network had 181 NWO members operating in 825 communities nationwide. For 1999, the NRC's appropriation of $90 million represents 94 percent of its annual income. With those funds, the corporation provides grants, conductstraining programs and educational forums, and produces publications in supportof member NWOs. The bulk of the grant money goes to NWOs, which use thefunds to cover operating costs; conduct projects; purchase, construct, and reha-bilitate properties; and capitalize their revolving loan funds. NWO revolvingloan funds make home ownership and home improvement loans to individuals orloans to owners of mixed-use properties who provide long-term rental housingfor low- and moderate-income households. In addition, the NRC awards grantsto Neighborhood Housing Services of America to provide a secondary market forthe loans from NWOs. Eliminating the NRC would save $900 million over 10years. One argument for eliminating the NRC is that the federal government should not fund programs whose benefits are local rather than national. A sec-ond argument is that the NeighborWorks \u00ae approach duplicates the efforts of programs from other federal agencies (particularly the Department of Housingand Urban Development, or HUD) and government-sponsored enterprises (suchas the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Federal Home Loan MortgageCorporation) that also rehabilitate low-income housing and promote home own-ership and community development. Third, critics of the corporation argue thateven within the NeighborWorks \u00ae approach, the NRC is a redundant funding channel. In 1997, NRC grants accounted for about one-quarter of the NWOs'governmental funding and roughly 6 percent of their total funding. Larger sharescame from private lenders, foundations, corporations, and HUD. The NRC's defenders argue that the large number of federal programs to assist local development is evidence of widespread support for a federal role\u2014particularly in areas where state and local governments may lack adequate re-sources of their own. They further argue that NWOs focus on whole neighbor-hoods rather than individual housing properties, and with their nonhousingactivities\u2014such as community organization building, neighborhood cleanup andbeautification, and leadership development\u2014provide economic and social bene-fits that other federal programs do not. Finally, defenders say that the NRC is avaluable part of the approach because of its flexibility in making grants, whichallows it to fund valuable NWO efforts that do not fit within the narrow criteriaof larger federal grantors, and the services it provides to the NWOs, such astraining, program evaluation, and technical assistance.FUNCTION 450 COMMUNITY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 119 450-06 ELIMINATE FUNDING FOR NEW EMPOWERMENT ZONES AND ENTERPRISE COMMUNITIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 60 1 2001 60 202002 60 462003 60 552004 60 57 2005 60 60 2006 60 602007 60 602008 60 602009 60 60 Cumulative 2000-2004 300 179 2000-2009 600 479 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 authorized a new program under which 104 economically distressed communities could be designated as\"empowerment zones\" or \"enterprise communities.\" The EZ/EC communities,as they are known, must satisfy certain eligibility criteria and are selected in acompetitive review of strategic plans for implementing the program. Desig-nated communities receive federal funding\u2014up to $100 million over 10 yearsfor each urban EZ, $40 million for each rural EZ, and just under $3 million foreach EC\u2014for a broad range of ec onomic and social development activities consistent with their strategic plans, plus access to certain tax preferences forbusinesses locating or expanding in an EZ or EC area. The Congress authorized the designation of 20 new EZs in 1997\u201415 in urban areas and five in rural areas. The first funding for those second-roundEZs appeared in the omnibus appropriation bill for 1999, which provided $55million in grant money\u2014less than the $170 million requested by the Adminis-tration as part of a proposed 10-year mandatory budget item. The bill alsoappropriated $5 million for 20 additional rural ECs but did not grant them thetax preferences provided to previous ECs. If the Congress chose to provide thesecond-round EZs and ECs with the same grant funding as the first-round com-munities, the initial $60 million would effectively be a down payment towardtotal spending of $1.759 billion. CBO estimates that eliminating grant funding for the second round of EZs and ECs would save $1 million in 2000 and about $480 million over the 2000-2009 peri od, assuming that the alternative is continued f unding at the 1999 level. One argument for eliminating the funding is that local economic develop-ment is an inappropriate use of federal dollars and should be left to state andlocal governments. Another is that the federal government already has duplica-tive programs promoting economic development\u2014including Community Devel-opment Block Grants, programs of the Economic Development Administration,and various regional commissions and authorities (see other options under bud-get function 450)\u2014and that the relatively new EZ/EC program should bestopped before developing its own entrenched constituency. Supporters of continued funding for the second round of EZs and ECs argue that early evidence from the first-round communities indicates that theprogram is working well\u2014developing local capacities through its strategicplanning requirements and building public/private partnerships that leveragefederal dollars with private investments. Supporters also note that EZ/ECcommunities are by definition high-poverty areas and require more public re-sources than local and state governments are willing and able to provide. Fur-thermore, they argue that the new EZs and ECs applied for the designationsexpecting that multiyear funding would be available.120 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 450-07 DROP FLOOD INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN REPEATEDLY FLOODED PROPERTIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 71 2001 0 752002 0 792003 0 842004 0 88 2005 0 94 2006 0 992007 0 1052008 0 1122009 0 119 Cumulative 2000-2004 0 397 2000-2009 0 926 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 450-08Data from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) show that a relatively small number of properties subject to repeated flooding account for a large shareof the losses incurred by the program. The Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (FEMA), which administers the NFIP, has focused its attention on prop-erties that have incurred two or more losses of at least $1,000 each in any 10-year period since 1978 (the earliest year for which data are available). The morethan 83,000 properties fitting that definition account for about one-third of allclaims since 1978 and close to 40 percent of the cost of such claims. Many ofthose properties no longer have flood insurance: in some cases, the property hasbeen destroyed or moved; in other cases, the owner dropped the policy\u2014forexample, after FEMA limited coverage under the NFIP for basement losses in1983. The NFIP currently insures roughly 41,000 repeatedly flooded properties,representing about 1 percent of all policies in force but a much larger share ofannual flood losses. The issue of repeatedly flooded properties raises concern in part because they generally are covered at premium rates that do not adequately reflect theirrisk of flood losses. FEMA data show that 96 percent of such properties werebuilt before the development of the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for theirrespective communities\u2014which is not surprising, given the flood mitigationrequirements imposed on post-FIRM construction. Thus, almost all repeatedlyflooded properties are covered under the pre-FIRM premium rates that the gov-ernment explicitly subsidizes. (See the related discussion for option 450-08.) Inaddition, although some properties may incur losses twice in 10 years because ofa bad \"draw\" of storms or other random events, others have flooded four, five, oreven 10 or 20 times since 1978, demonstrating that the gap between the pre- FIRM rates and their true actuarial risk of flood loss is particularly large. One way to reduce federal costs for the flood insurance program would be to deny coverage after the fourth loss of at least $1,000 in any 20-year period.FEMA data indicate that the option would immediately affect 8,300 properties,and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would reduce federal out-lays by $71 million in 2000 and $926 million over the 2000-2009 period. Themain argument for the option is that neither taxpayers nor other policyholdersshould be required to provide an unlimited subsidy for properties known to be athigh risk for frequent flood damage. The loss or threat of losing NFIP protectionwould encourage owners of such properties to take appropriate mitigation mea-sures, such as elevating their structures or rebuilding elsewhere. Opponents of dropping the flood insurance argue that it would be unfair to the property owners to suddenly withdraw their protection from fl ood risk\u2014 especially owners who have occupied their properties since before the localFIRM was developed and cannot readily afford relocation or other costly mitiga-tion measures. Some opponents might prefer a more moderate change fromcurrent policy, such as adding a repetitive-loss surcharge to insurance premiumsor denying coverage only to policyholders who reject offers of mitigation assis-tance.FUNCTION 450 COMMUNITY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 121 450-08 ELIMINATE THE FLOOD INSURANCE SUBSIDY ON PRE-FIRM STRUCTURES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 120 2001 0 3862002 0 5372003 0 5752004 0 617 2005 0 660 2006 0 7062007 0 7512008 0 7902009 0 815 Cumulative 2000-2004 0 2,235 2000-2009 0 5,957 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 450-07The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) offers insurance at heavily subsi- dized rates for buildings constructed before 1975 or before the completion of aparticipating community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Owners of post-FIRM construction pay actuarial rates for their insurance. Currently, about one-sixth of all flood insurance coverage is subsidized. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which administers the flood insurance program, estimates that 32 percent of policyholders are pay-ing subsidized rates for some or all of their coverage. The program subsidizesonly the first $35,000 of coverage for a single-family or two- to four-familydwelling and the first $100,000 of a larger residential, nonresidential, or small business building; various levels of additional coverage are available atactuarially neutral rates. As a result of an April 1996 rate increase, coverage inthe subsidized tier is priced at an estimated 38 percent of its actuarial value. Theprogram also offers insurance for buildings' contents; again, policyholders in pre-FIRM buildings pay subsidized prices for a first tier of coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that eliminating the subsidy would yield about $120 million in new receipts in 2000 and $6 billion over the2000-2009 period, accounting for the likelihood that many current policyholderswould drop their coverage. Purchase of flood insurance is voluntary, except forproperties in special flood hazard areas carrying mortgages from federally in-sured lenders. Only 20 percent of properties in the nine states affected by the1993 midwestern flood are estimated to have had coverage, reflecting both laxenforcement of the mandatory requirements and spotty participation of propertiesnot subject to the requirements. Although enforcement of the requirement hasreportedly improved under new rules legislated in 1994, CBO expects that somemandatory and many voluntary purchasers would leave the program if confrontedwith unsubsidized premiums. Proponents of eliminating the subsidy argue that actuarially correct prices would make all property owners in flood-prone areas pay their fair share forinsurance protection and would give them economic incentives to relocate or takepreventive measures. Supporters of the subsidy argue that it should be maintained to help in- crease the low rates of participation by property owners who are not subject tothe mandatory purchase requirement. Another argument is that people who builtor purchased property before FEMA documented the extent of the flood hazardsshould not face the same costs as those who made decisions after such informa-tion became available. Defenders of the current rates also question the accuracyof the maps on which FEMA bases its estimate that current prices cover only 38percent of long-term costs. For most pre-FIRM properties except a relativelyfew repeatedly flooded structures, premiums now roughly equal average lossesincurred to date. Finally, defenders argue that some of the projected gains willbe offset by increased spending by FEMA and the Small Business Administra-tion on disaster grants and loans to people who drop or fail to purchase insurancecoverage at the higher rates.122 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 450-09 ELIMINATE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY ACTIVITIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 32 26 2001 43 392002 43 422003 43 432004 43 43 2005 43 43 2006 43 432007 43 432008 43 432009 43 43 Cumulative 2000-2004 204 193 2000-2009 419 408 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED PUBLICATION : Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity? (Study), November 1997.The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is a federal agency that operates an elec- tric utility with billions of dollars in annual sales. It is also charged with \"plan-ning for the proper use, conservation, and development of the natural resourcesof the Tennessee River drainage basin.\" The annual federal appropriation forTVA supports its water and land management activities (including maintaining asystem of dams and reservoirs), environmental research center, recreational andeducational programs, and efforts to assist local economic development. In 1997, TVA Chairman Craven H. Crandall Jr. proposed eliminating the federal appropriation in exchange for allowing TVA to sell electricity outside itscurrent service area. Subsequently, the Congress appropriated $70 million forTVA's nonpower activities for 1 998 but included language indicating that the agency was to support those activities without additional federal funds\u2014insteaddrawing on user fees, charges to electricity purchasers, investment returns, andinternal cost savings\u2014beginning in 1999. However, the Congress includedanother $50 million\u2014described as \"final\" in the accompanying report\u2014for TVAin the omnibus appropriation bill for 1999. That bill also directed TVA to trans-fer the Land Between the Lakes Recreation Area (LBL) to the Forest Service onOctober 1 of the first fiscal year for which the Congress gives TVA less than $6million for LBL. Accounting for the transfer and associated shift in costs to theForest Service, eliminating TVA's federal funding as of fiscal year 2000 wouldreduce federal outlays by $26 million then and by $408 million over 10 years. Critics of the funding for TVA's activities argue that the programs provide local or regional benefits and should therefore be financed by state and localgovernments or by charges to beneficiaries\u2014or be discontinued if they are insuf-ficiently valuable. Proponents of continued funding argue that TVA has fewpractical alternatives to federal support if it is to continue promoting proper use,conservation, and development of the region's natural resources. Charging userfees may be appropriate for some of TVA's nonpower activities, such as main-taining navigation locks and recreation facilities, but perhaps not for others. Forexample, because the benefits of reducing flood crests and improving ecologicalstability are spread over time and broad geographic areas, affected state and localgovernments may find it difficult to divide the burden of making up lost federalfunding for such causes. In addition, a small and declining share of TVA's federal appropriation supports its Environmental Research Center in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Thecenter's research involves ozone mitigation, pollution-free agriculture, utilitywaste management, and biotechnology for cleaning up hazardous wastes. Criticsof the center argue that many of its research projects benefit the private sectorand that other projects should be consolidated with research being conducted bythe Department of Agriculture or the Environmental Protection Agency. Thecenter has diversified its funding sources and is in the last year of a four-yearphaseout of federal support.1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 199901020304050Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory500 Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services Budget function 500 primarily includes federal spending within the Departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services for programs that either directly provide, or assist states and localities inproviding, services to young people and adults.

Basic grants allocate federal fundson the basis of the number of children who live in families with income belowthe poverty level in a particular geographic area. Concentration grants provideadditional funds to school districts in counties in which the number of poorchildren exceeds 6,500 or 15 percent of the school-age population. Althoughtitle I distributes funds on the basis of the number of poor students in a district,schools that r eceive the money may use it to provide services to any students who are performing well below their grade level. Title I funds reached about 50,000 schools in 1998 and served approxi- mately 10 million children. About 15,000 schools operated schoolwide pro-grams (which benefit all of the children in a specific sc hool), and another 35,000 participated in targeted assistance programs (which must focus thegrants on the children most in need of title I services). This option would reduce funding for basic grants to local educational agencies by 5 percent, saving $16 million in federal outlays in 2000 and $2.9billion over the 2000-2009 period. To direct cuts toward the schools with theleast need for title I services, the eligibility criteria for receiving funding couldbe altered. Currently, the law restricts title I basic grant funds to school dis-tricts that have 2 percent of their children living in families with income belowthe poverty level and at least 10 poor children. If the Congress raised the lowerbound on the criterion for the percentage of children living in poverty (for ex-ample, to 5 percent or 10 percent), funding could be maintained at its currentlevel for the school districts that satisfied the more restrictive eligibility criteria. Some proponents of eliminating federal funding for elementary and sec- ondary education argue that such support represents federal intervention intomatters that are primarily of state and local concern. Opponents, however,insist that federal funding augments state and local efforts and ultimately makesthem more successful. The primary argument for reducing title I funding in particular is that there is little evidence that it improves the long-term academic performance ofstudents who receive its services. Many studies have compared students receiv-ing title I services with groups of students that are similar by grade and povertystatus. Such studies show that program participants do not improve their aca-demic achievement relative to other students. However, supporters of the pro-gram maintain that title I funds help underachieving students in schools thatserve many poor children. Advocates also note that such funding is a majorfederal instrument for fostering school reform because states applying for thegrants must develop standards specifying what public school children shouldknow and be able to do at various points in their education.FUNCTION 500 EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SERVICES 125 500-02 ELIMINATE FUNDING FOR BILINGUAL AND IMMIGRANT EDUCATION Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 380 46 2001 380 3042002 380 3722003 380 3802004 380 380 2005 380 380 2006 380 3802007 380 3802008 380 3802009 380 380 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,900 1,482 2000-2009 3,800 3,382 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryFederal bilingual education programs authorized under title VII of the Elemen- tary and Secondary Education Act provide grants to s chool districts for in- structing students who have limited proficiency in English (so-called LEP stu-dents). School districts use the funds primarily to support bilingual instruc-tional services, to disseminate information on ways to serve students whoseEnglish is limited, and to train instructors to teach in bilingual classrooms. Bilingual education projects funded through title VII provide a range of services to LEP students. Most schools use English as a S econd La nguage projects to meet those students' needs. In the projects, teachers instruct chil-dren jointly in English and their native language but stress a rapid grasp ofEnglish. No more than 25 percent of federal funding for bilingual educationprograms may be used to support instruction conducted only in English. Eliminating federal funding for bilingual education programs would re- duce federal outlays by $46 million in 2000 and by $3.4 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Supporters of this option contend that bilingual education programs under title VII do not effectively advance literacy in the English language and slowthe integration of LEP students into regular classrooms. They maintain that thefederal government should not fund programs requiring the use of a student'snative language but s hould encourage sc hool districts to move LEP students into regular classrooms as quickly as possible. Many supporters of this optionargue that \"immersion\" programs, in which LEP students are instructed solelyin English, are the most effective means to teach English to such students. Defenders of bilingual education assert that it serves a valuable purpose. By introducing students to the English language while continuing instruction intheir native language, the program helps students acquire knowledge in a vari-ety of academic subjects as they develop their English literacy skills. As aresult, supporters argue, students do not fall behind their schoolmates in othersubjects during their transition to English-only instruction.126 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 500-03 REDUCE FUNDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR IMPACT AID Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 78 64 2001 78 762002 78 782003 78 782004 78 78 2005 78 78 2006 78 782007 78 782008 78 782009 78 78 Cumulative 2000-2004 390 374 2000-2009 780 764 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Impact Aid program, authorized under title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, provides funds to school districts affected by activi-ties of the federal government. The program pays districts for federally con-nected pupils and for school construction in areas where the federal governmenthas acquired a significant portion of the real property tax base, thereby depriv-ing the school district of a source of revenue. For a school district to be eligible for Impact Aid, a minimum of 3 percent (or at least 400) of its pupils must be associated with activities of the f ederal government\u2014for example, pupils whose parents both live and work on federalproperty (including Indian lands), pupils whose parents are in the uniformedservices but live on private property, and pupils who live in federally subsi-dized low-rent housing. In addition, aid goes to a few districts enrolling at least1,000 pupils (and 10 per cent of enrollment) whose parents work on federal property. In 1998, approximately 1,700 local education agencies received Im-pact Aid. This option would restrict Impact Aid to the school districts that are most affected by federal activities\u2014districts with children who live on federal prop-erty and have a parent on active duty in the uniformed services and districtswith children who live on Indian lands. The restriction would reduce federaloutlays by $764 million during the 2000-2009 period. The Administration'sbudget for fiscal year 2000 included this option in its list of recommendations. Proponents of this alternative argue that restricting Impact Aid payments to students whose presence puts the greatest burden on school districts is appro-priate, given the limited funding available for federal discretionary programs.Opponents argue that eliminating payments for other types of children associ-ated with federal activities could significantly affect certain districts\u2014for ex-ample, those in which large numbers of military families live off-base but shopat military exchanges, which do not collect state and local sales taxes.FUNCTION 500 EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SERVICES 127 500-04 LIMIT FEDERAL FUNDING FOR STATE EDUCATION REFORM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 130 6 2001 130 912002 130 1232003 130 1302004 130 130 2005 130 130 2006 130 1302007 130 1302008 130 1302009 130 130 Cumulative 2000-2004 650 480 2000-2009 1,300 1,130 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe federal government currently supports education reform at the state and local levels through two programs that have related purposes but quite differentstructures. The first program, the Innovative Education Program Strategiesstate grants (authorized under title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Educa-tion Act) provides relatively untargeted funding in the form of block grants tosupplement state and local funding for elementary and secondary educationreform. Recipients may use funds from the grants to carry out programs in anumber of broad categories, but those activities need not be tied to any specificreform plan or set of standards. The second program, Goals 2000, requires recipients to pursue a systemic model of reform, which involves setting goals and standards for reform, devel-oping benchmarks to promote progress toward the goals, and pursuing reform atall levels of the education system. Goals 2000 funds may only be used foractivities that are consistent with that model, such as developing state standardsfor reform, aligning local curricula with those standards, paying for profes-sional development activities for teachers and other staff, and purchasing tech-nology. Reducing combined federal funding for the two programs by 15 percent would cut federal outlays by $6 million in 2000 and by $1.1 b illion over the 2000-2009 period. Lawmakers could retain the current relative distribution offunding between the two programs or shift funding to favor one approach or theother. Proponents of decreasing federal funding for both types of educationreform argue that state and local governments are already carrying out schoolreforms on their own and do not need additional federal support. Federal fund-ing for education reform is unnecessary, say those proponents, and constitutesneedless federal intervention into matters that are primarily of state and localconcern. Opponents of limiting federal support insist that federal funds aug- ment ongoing state and local reform efforts and contribute to their faster andmore complete implementation. Among supporters of some federal role in state and local education re- form, opinions differ about which program should receive the larger share offederal funding. Fiscal year 1999 funding for title VI block grants was $375million; funding for the Goals 2000 program totaled $491 million. On the onehand, proponents of more funding for the Goals 2000 program argue that it isbetter designed to foster systemic reform, which they contend is highly effectivein improving teaching and learning. Because Goals 2000 links funding to astate reform plan, supporters maintain that the funds are better directed andhave a greater impact on the quality of schools within a state. On the otherhand, supporters of the title VI block grants insist that those grants are a bettertool for supplementing state education reform. By offering greater flexibility,supporters say, block grants allow states to fund the local reforms that are bestsuited to particular communities\u2014even if those reforms are not tied to a largerstate effort.128 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 500-05 ELIMINATE FUNDING FOR FEDERAL INITIATIVES TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 1,200 60 2001 1,200 6002002 1,200 1,0802003 1,200 1,2602004 1,200 1,320 2005 1,200 1,260 2006 1,200 1,2002007 1,200 1,2002008 1,200 1,2002009 1,200 1,200 Cumulative 2000-2004 6,000 4,320 2000-2009 12,000 10,380 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Department of Education's fiscal year 1999 budget included $1.2 billion to reduce class sizes in elementary schools nationwide. With those funds, the de-partment estimates that school districts will be able to hire as many as 30,000teachers for the 1999-2000 school year. By eliminating funding for the program,the federal government could save $10.4 billion in outlays during the 2000-2009period. In recent reviews of the scientific evidence for the benefits of small classes, the results of one study, Tennessee's Project STAR, are prominent because of thestudy's rigorous experimental design. Children entering kindergarten were ran-domly assigned either to special small classes of between 13 and 17 students orto \"regular\" classes of between 22 and 26 students. With only few exceptions,students remained in the same size class to which they were initially assignedthrough the end of the third grade. Testing showed that students in the small classes outperformed students in the regular classes on both standardized and curriculum-based tests. In the earlygrades, the positive effect of small classes on achievement among minority stu-dents was twice that for nonminority students; later, it was about the same.Beginning in fourth grade, all of the students attended regular classes. Neverthe-less, through eighth grade, students who had been in the small classes showed adecreasing but still significantly higher level of academic achievement than stu-dents in the regular classes. Proponents of eliminating federal funding for class-size initiatives see limitations to Project STAR's success. If education is cumulative, with each yearbuilding on what was learned the year before, children assigned to a small classwould be expected to pull further away from their counterparts in a regular classfor each year they remained in the small class. In fact, the evidence shows suchadvances for youngsters in small classes only at the end of kindergarten and, to alesser extent, at the end of first grade. Critics of a policy advocating small classsizes also point to other evidence suggesting that class size must fall to about 15students before it has an effect. Reducing class sizes to those levels would bequite expensive, and the costs would increase over time. More classrooms wouldhave to be built; new teachers would require services such as staff training; andas they gained experience, those teachers' salaries would increase. Finally, thecritics note that strategies such as providing one-on-one or peer tutoring as wellas cooperative learning achieve results similar to those gained from reducingclass size\u2014but at a fraction of the cost. Supporters of funding for initiatives to decrease class sizes find that ap- proach attractive because it moves resources directly to the classroom and tostudents. Furthermore, many analysts have concluded that enrollment in theearly grades in small classes of about 18 or fewer students can have positiveeffects on a student's academic achievement, compared with enrollment in classesof between 25 and 30 students. Minority students in particular seem to benefitfrom small classes. In addition, most of the benefits students gain from being ina small class appear to persist into later grades.FUNCTION 500 EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SERVICES 129 500-06 CONSOLIDATE AND REDUCE FUNDING FOR SEVERAL ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 280 14 2001 280 1962002 280 2662003 280 2802004 280 280 2005 280 280 2006 280 2802007 280 2802008 280 2802009 280 280 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,400 1,036 2000-2009 2,800 2,436 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryCurrent federal programs to aid elementary and secondary education are gener- ally categorical\u2014that is, they focus on specific populations of students withspecial needs (for example, disabled students or educationally disadvantagedstudents), on subject areas of high priority to policymakers (such as mathematicsor science), or on specific approaches to improving education (for instance,charter schools). The Congress adopted categorical forms of federal aid in cer-tain cases because of a belief that many states would be unable or unwilling tocommit funds to those priorities. The alternative to categorical programs isbroad block grants. For example, H.R. 3248, the Dollars to the Classroom Actintroduced in the 105th Congress, would have consolidated several federal cate-gorical programs for elementary and secondary education into a single blockgrant. The grant would have allowed funds to be used for any of the purposespreviously authorized for the categorical programs. The appropriations for theprograms that the block grant would have replaced totaled $2.8 billion for 1999. To reduce federal outlays, the federal government could trim the consoli- dated block grant proposed in H.R. 3248 by, for example, 10 percent, or $280million. Despite the cut in funding, states might prefer the block grant to cate-gorical funding because the block grant would give them and local educationagencies added flexibility in allocating federal funds among different purposes.In addition, states would probably find savings under the block grant as a resultof fewer administrative duties and reporting responsibilities compared withcategorical aid. Proponents of block grants for education funding point out that they give states and local education agencies the flexibility to direct federal aid toward theschools' greatest needs. Block grants can circumvent the administrative require-ments accompanying categorical aid programs, which may unintentionally limita school's ability to implement comprehensive reforms. Block grants also avoidthe problems created within a school by a proliferation of categorical programsthat often aid the same children. Poor coordination among such programs maylead to fragmentation of a child's instructional program in some areas and dupli-cation in others. Moreover, by requiring that funds be clearly associated with theintended beneficiaries, categorical grants may encourage schools to partiallysegregate children with special needs, track students by achievement level, orperpetuate lower expectations of their performance. Opponents of education block grants argue that they dilute the effect of federal funding on national educational priorities and provide less assurance thancategorical funding that federal aid will be used to meet national objectives.Block grants virtually ensure more variation in how federal funds are used. Inprinciple, accountability for the results of that use could substitute for the target-ing requirements that are traditionally a part of categorical aid programs, butmeasuring the appropriate outcomes is often difficult. Furthermore, as oppo-nents point out, alternative means, such as waivers, are now available to givestate and local education agencies increased flexibility in using funds from cate-gorical programs without sacrificing federal priorities.130 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 500-07-A RESTRICT INTEREST SUBSIDIES ON LOANS TO UNDERGRADUATES Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 325 2001 4852002 4952003 5102004 540 2005 2000-2004 2,355 2000-2009 5,345 : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 500-07-B and 500-07-CFederal student loan programs afford students and their parents the opportunity to borrow funds to attend postsecondary schools. Those programs offer threetypes of loans: \"subsidized\" loans to students who are defined as having finan-cial need, \"unsubsidized\" loans to students regardless of need, and loans toparents of students. Two programs provide all three types of loans; they are theFederal Family Education Loan Program, in which loans made by private lend-ers are guaranteed by the federal government, and the Ford Federal Direct LoanProgram, in which the government makes the loans through schools. With allof the loans, borrowers benefit because the interest rate charged is lower thanthe rates most of them could secure from alternative sources. With subsidizedloans, borrowers benefit further because the federal government pays the inter-est on the loans while students are in school and during a six-month grace pe-riod after they leave. Federal costs could be reduced by limiting eligibility for subsidized loans to undergraduate students. Gra duate students could subs titute unsubsidized loans for the subsidized loans they had received previously. That change wouldreduce federal outlays by $325 million in 2000 and $5.3 billion during the2000-2009 period. Restricting subsidized loans to undergraduate students would direct funds toward achieving the federal goal of universal access to an undergraduate edu-cation. Because graduate students have completed their undergraduate work,they are outside the group of students that constitutes the federal government'sparticular focus. Under this option, graduate students who took unsubsidizedloans to replace the subsidized loans they had lost would ultimately be respon-sible for somewhat higher loan payments. However, the federal student loanprograms have several options for making repayment manageable for studentswho have high loan balances or difficult financial circumstances. Nevertheless, graduate students often amass large student loan debts because of the number of years of schooling required for their degrees. With-out the benefit of interest forgiveness while they were enrolled in school, theirdebt would be substantially larger when they entered the repayment periodbecause the interest on the amounts they had borrowed over the years would beadded to their loan balance.FUNCTION 500 EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SERVICES 131 500-07-B INCREASE ORIGINATION FEES FOR UNSUBSIDIZED LOANS TO STUDENTS AND PARENTS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 120 2001 1852002 2002003 2152004 230 2005 240 Cumulative 2000-2004 950 2000-2009 2,285 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 500-07-A and 500-07-CThe government and guaranty agencies recoup part of the cost of insuring stu- dent loans by collecting 4 percent of the face value of each loan from studentsand their parents as an origination and insurance fee. (In some instances, guar-anty agencies pay that fee themselves.) The fee is charged on subsidized,unsubsidized, and PLUS loans (Parent Loans to Undergraduate Students).Increasing the loan origination fee on unsubsidized and PLUS loans by 1 per-centage point would reduce program outlays by $120 million in 2000 and $2.3billion over the 2000-2009 period. An argument for the change is that even with the higher origination fee, many students would still benefit substantially from the loans, in part becausethe government guarantees them. The guarantee means that lenders are willingto make loans to students who do not have a credit history and to make them atinterest rates below those available on most private loans. Furthermore, duringthe first five years of repayment, many borrowers can subtract the interest onthe loans from their income for the purpose of calculating federal income taxes.And because the change in the origination fee would affect only unsubsidizedand PLUS loans, it would produce savings without affecting the value of subsi-dized loans received by the neediest students. Increasing the origination fee, however, would reduce the net proceeds from any given loan. As a result, students would need to secure larger loans tofinance the same amount of educati on. That could pose a problem for many students who were already borrowing the maximum allowed by law and wouldnot be able to borrow more.132 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 500-07-C RESTRICT ELIGIBILITY FOR SUBSIDIZED STUDENT LOANS BY INCLUDING HOME EQUITY IN THE DETERMINATION OFFINANCIAL NEED Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 55 2001 802002 802003 852004 85 2005 85 2006 852007 852008 852009 85 Cumulative 2000-2004 385 2000-2009 815 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 500-07-A and 500-07-BThe Higher Education Amendments of 1992 eliminated house and farm assets from consideration in determining how much a student's family is expected tocontribute to cover educational expenses\u2014a change that has made it easier formany students to obtain subsidized student loans. The amount a family is ex-pected to contribute is determined by what is essentially a progressive tax for-mula. In effect, federal calculations \"tax\" family incomes and assets above theamounts assumed to be required for a basic standard of living. Since 1992, thedefinition of assets has excluded house and farm equity for all families and excluded all assets for applicants whose income is below $50,000. Under this option, house and farm equity would be included in calculating a family's need for financial aid for postsecondary education. In addition, theincome threshold under which most families are not asked to report their assetswould be lowered from $50,000 to its previous level of $15,000. House andfarm equity would be \"taxed,\" as other assets are now, at rates of up to about5.6 percent after a deduction for allowable assets. The change would result infewer students qualifying for subsidized loans or more students qualifying forsubsidized loans of smaller amounts. Overall, by including house and farmequity, outlays could be reduced by about $55 million in 2000 and $815 millionduring the 2000-2009 period. Not counting home equity gives families who own a house an advantage over those who do not. In today's economy, borrowing against home equity atan affordable interest rate is relatively simple. To the extent that familieswould not take out home equity loans, students could take unsubsidized loans tofinance the family's expected contributi on. That approach would cause rela- tively little difficulty for families' budgets because the interest payments onunsubsidized loans can be postponed while the student is in school. The inter-est is then simply added to the accumulated loan balance when the st udent leaves school and begins repayment. However, because increases in incomes have not always kept pace with increases in housing prices, some families might have difficulty repaying theirmortgage if they borrow against home equity to finance their children's educa-tion. In addition, having to value their home and other assets would complicatethe loan application process for many families.FUNCTION 500 EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SERVICES 133 500-08 REDUCE SPECIAL ALLOWANCE PAYMENTS TO LENDERS IN THE STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 340 2001 5402002 5652003 5002004 0 2005 1,945 2000-2009 1,945 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe largest federal student loan program is the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which guarantees 98 percent reimbursement on defaulted loans madeby private lenders to eligible students. Under the program, students and thefederal government together pay lenders an interest rate each year based onchanges in a reference rate determined in the financial markets. The federalpayments are called special allowance payments; their purpose is to approxi-mate a fair market return to lenders while subsidizing the cost to students offinancing their education. One such payment, which was added by the HigherEducation Amendments of 1998, applies to subsidized and unsubsidized loansmade after October 1, 1998, and before July 1, 2003. Under that provision, thefederal government makes a payment equivalent to 0.5 percentage points abovethe interest rate paid by students. This option would eliminate the 0.5 percentage-point payment on all new subsidized and unsubsidized loans. It would produce savings of $340 million in2000 and $1.9 billion over the 2000-2009 period. An argument for eliminating the 0.5 percentage-point payment is that lenders do not need it to achieve a fair market rate of return on their loans.Nearly the entire loan amount is guaranteed by the federal government. More-over, a 1998 study by the Department of the Treasury concluded that evenwithout the additional 0.5 percentage-point payment, lenders would earn returnson loans made under the program that on average would be sufficient to makethe business attractive. The argument for retaining the payment is that without it, some lenders would, indeed, receive unacceptably low rates of return and leave the program.Such pruning of the lender ranks could create difficulties for financial aid offi-cers who administer student financial aid at postsecondary institutions and forstudents who seek loans. In general, student loans are quite small comparedwith, for example, mortgage loans, but the costs of servicing them are not pro-portionately lower. As a result, the interest rate necessary to yield sufficientincome to cover the costs of servicing needs to be higher. Furthermore, servic-ing costs vary by the size of the loan and the characteristics of the student, soreducing the profit margin for lenders might induce them to stop making loansto some students. Another risk of paying lenders less than a fair market rate ofreturn is that they might substantially reduce their investments in improving thequality of loan servicing or stop adapting their package of loan services to theparticular needs of the institutions that participate in the loan program.134 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 500-09 ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES PAID TO SCHOOLS IN THE CAMPUS-BASED STUDENT AID AND PELL GRANTPROGRAMS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 158 18 2001 158 1532002 158 1582003 158 1582004 158 158 2005 158 158 2006 158 1582007 158 1582008 158 1582009 158 158 Cumulative 2000-2004 790 645 2000-2009 1,580 1,435 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryIn two types of federal student aid programs, the government pays schools to administer the programs or to distribute the funds, or both. In campus-basedaid programs, which include Federal Supplemental Educational OpportunityGrants, Federal Perkins loans, and Federal Work-Study Programs, the govern-ment distributes funds to institutions that in turn award grants, loans, and jobsto qualified students. Under a statutory formula, institutions may use up to 5percent of program funds for administrative costs. Similarly, in the Federal PellGrant Program, the schools distribute the funds, although eligibility is deter-mined solely by federal law. The Higher Education Act provides for a federalpayment of $5 per Pell grant to reimburse schools for a share of their costs ofadministering the program. The federal government could save about $138 million a year if schools were not allowed to use federal funds from the campus-based aid programs topay for administrative costs. The government could save another $20 million ifthe $5 payment to schools in the Pell Grant program was eliminated. Together,those options would produce savings of $18 million in 2000 and $1.4 billionover the 2000-2009 period. Arguments can be made both for eliminating the administrative payments and for retaining them. On the one hand, institutions benefit significantly fromparticipating in federal student aid programs even without the payments be-cause the aid makes attendance at the schools more affordable. In 1999, stu-dents will receive an estimated $10.3 billion in federal funds under the PellGrant and campus-based aid programs. On the other hand, the institutions do, indeed, incur costs for administer- ing the programs. Furthermore, if the federal government does not pay thoseexpenses, schools will simply pass al ong the costs to students in the form of higher tuition or fees.FUNCTION 500 EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SERVICES 135 500-10 ELIMINATE THE LEVERAGING EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 25 5 2001 25 252002 25 252003 25 252004 25 25 2005 25 25 2006 25 252007 25 252008 25 252009 25 25 Cumulative 2000-2004 125 105 2000-2009 250 230 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) program, formerly the State Student Incentive Grant program, helps states provide financiallyneedy postsecondary students with grant and work-study assistance while theyattend either academic institutions or schools that teach occupational sk ills. States must match federal funds at least dollar for dollar and also meet main-tenance-of-effort criteria. Unless excluded by state law, all public and privatenonprofit postsecondary institutions in a state are eligible to participate in theLEAP program. Eliminating the program would save $5 million in 2000 and $230 million over the 2000-2009 period. The extent of the actual reduction in student assis-tance would depend on the responses of states, some of which would probablymake up at least part of the lost federal funds. Proponents of eliminating this program argue that it is no longer needed to encourage states to provide more student aid. When the LEAP program wasfirst authorized in 1972, only 28 states had student grant programs; now, all 50states provide such grants. An argument against eliminating the LEAP program is that not all states would increase their student aid appropriations to make up for the lost federalfunding and some might even reduce them. In that case, some students receiv-ing less aid might not be able to enroll in college or might have to attend a lessexpensive school.136 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 500-11 END NEW FUNDING FOR PERKINS LOANS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 100 10 2001 100 972002 100 1002003 100 1002004 100 100 2005 100 100 2006 100 1002007 100 1002008 100 1002009 100 100 Cumulative 2000-2004 500 407 2000-2009 1,000 907 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe federal government provides student loans through three programs: Federal Family Education Loans, Ford Federal Direct Loans, and Federal PerkinsLoans (formerly National Defense Student Loans). The Perkins Loan programis the smallest, with allocations made directly to approximately 2,000 post-secondary institutions. Financial aid administrators at those schools then deter-mine which eligible students receive Perkins loans. During the 1998-1999academic year, approximately 700,000 students will receive such loans. The money for Perkins loans comes from an institutional revolving fund, totaling approximately $1.1 billion in 1999, that has four sources: collectionsby the schools of payments on prior year student loans ($980 million in 1999),federal payments for loan cancellations granted in exchange for t eaching in high-need areas or for military or public service ($30 million in 1999), federalcontributions from new appropriations ($100 million in 1999), and institutionalmatching contributions that for each school must equal at least one-third of thefederal contribution. Eliminating new appropriations for federal contributions would lower outlays by $907 million during the 2000-2009 period. The extent of the reduc-tion in funds for student loans would depend on the responses of postsecondaryinstitutions, some of which would make up part or all of the lost federal money.If institutions made up none of the lost federal funds but continued to contributeto the program at the level of their previous matching share, approximately66,000 fewer Perkins loans would be made. Reflecting the view that the main goal of federal student aid is to provide access to postsecondary education for needy students, the primary justificationfor this option is that the program may be failing to provide equal access toequally needy students. Federal contributions are allocated, first, on the basisof an institution's 1985 allocation and, second, on the basis of the financial needof its students. Because campus-based aid is tied to specific institutions, stu-dents with greater need at poorly funded schools may receive less than thosewith less need at well-funded institutions. Eliminating new funds for Perkins loans, however, would reduce the dis- cretion of postsecondary institutions in packaging aid to address the special situations of some students. It would also reduce total available aid. More-over, Perkins loans disproportionately help students at private nonprofit institu-tions (whose students get almost half of the aid, compared with about 20 per-cent of Pell Grant aid). Thus, cutting Perkins loans would make that type ofschool less accessible to needy students.FUNCTION 500 EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SERVICES 137 500-12 REDUCE FUNDING FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 110 72 2001 110 1002002 161 1572003 161 1602004 161 161 2005 161 161 2006 161 1612007 161 1612008 161 1612009 161 161 Cumulative 2000-2004 703 651 2000-2009 1,508 1,455 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe federal government subsidizes various activities related to the arts and humanities. In 1999, combined funding for several programs totaled almost $1billion; it included federal appropriations for the Smithsonian Institution ($413million), the Corporation for Public Broadcasting ($250 million), the NationalEndowment for the Humanities ($111 million), the National Endowment for theArts ($98 million), the National Gallery of Art ($64 million), the John F. Ken-nedy Center for the Performing Arts ($32 million), and the Institute of MuseumServices ($23 million). Cutting funding for those programs by 15 percent would reduce federal outlays over the 2000-2009 period by over $1.4 billion. (Savings from a re-duction in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would not berealized until 2002 because the program receives its appropriations two yearsin advance.) The actual effect on arts and humanities activities would dependin large part on the extent to which other funding sources\u2014states, localities,individuals, firms, and foundations\u2014increased their contributions. Some proponents of reducing or eliminating funding for the arts and hu- manities argue that support of such activities is not an appropriate role for thefederal government. Other advocates of cuts suggest that the expenditures areparticularly unacceptable when programs addressing central federal concernsare not being funded fully. Some federal grants for the arts and human ities already require nonfederal matching contributions, and over half of all muse-ums charge or suggest that patrons pay an entrance fee. Those practices couldbe expanded to accommodate a reduction in federal funding. However, critics of cuts in funding contend that alternative sources would be unlikely to fully offset the drop in federal subsidies. Subsidized projects andorganizations in rural or low-income areas might find it especially difficult togarner increased private backing or sponsorship. Thus, a decline in govern-ment support, opponents argue, would reduce activities that preserve and ad-vance the nation's culture and that introduce the arts and humanities to peoplewho might not otherwise have access to them.138 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 500-13 ELIMINATE FUNDING FOR THE SENIOR COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 440 80 2001 440 4002002 440 4402003 440 4402004 440 440 2005 440 440 2006 440 4402007 440 4402008 440 4402009 440 440 Cumulative 2000-2004 2,200 1,800 2000-2009 4,400 4,000 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) funds part- time jobs for people age 55 and older who are unemployed and who meetincome eligibility guidelines. To be eligible to participate in the program in1998, an individual's annual income had to be below roughly $10,000, whichwas 125 percent of the federal poverty guideline for a person living alone. Through SCSEP, which is authori zed under title V of the Older Americans Act, grants are awar ded to several nonprofit organizations, the U.S. Forest Service, and state agencies. The sponsoring organizations and ag encies pay participants to work in part-time community service jobs, up to a maximumof 1,300 hours per year. SCSEP participants work in schools, hospitals, and senior citizen centers and on beautification and conservation projects. They are paid the higher ofthe federal or state minimum wage or the local prevailing rate of pay forsimilar employment. Participants also receive annual physical examinations,training, personal and job-related counseling, and assist ance to move into private-sector jobs when they complete their projects. Eliminating SCSEP would reduce outlays over the 2000-2009 period by about $4 billion. Opponents of the program maintain that it offers few bene-fits aside from income support and that the presumed value of the work expe-rience gained by SCSEP participants would generally be greater if the experi-ence was provided to equally disadvant aged young people, who have longer careers over which to benefit. In addition, the costs of producing the servicesnow provided by SCSEP participants could be borne by the organizations thatbenefit from their work; under current law, those organizations bear only 10percent of such costs. That shift would ensure that only those services thatwere most highly valued would be provided. SCSEP, however, is the major federal jobs program aimed at low- income older workers, providing jobs for nearly 100,000 of them in 1998.Eliminating the program could cause hardship for older workers who wereunable to find comparable unsubsidized jobs. In general, older workers areless likely than younger workers to be unemployed, but those who are takelonger to find work. Moreover, without SCSEP, community services mightbe reduced if nonprofit organizations and states were unwilling or unable toincrease expenditures to offset the loss of federal funds.FUNCTION 500 EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SERVICES 139 500-14 ELIMINATE FUNDING FOR THE NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ACT Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 415 40 2001 430 2252002 430 3502003 435 3952004 435 410 2005 435 420 2006 435 4352007 435 4452008 435 4502009 435 450 Cumulative 2000-2009 4,320 3,620 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryAs a reward for providing community service, students may receive aid from the federal government to attend postsecondary s chools thr ough the National and Community Service Act. The act funds the AmeriCorps Grants Program,the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), Learn and Serve America,and the Points of Light Foundation, with AmeriCorps receiving the majority ofthe total appropriation. Those programs provide assistance for education, pub-lic safety, the environment, and health care, among other services. In manycases, the programs build on existing federal, state, and local programs. TheAmeriCorps Grants Program and NCCC provide participants with an educa-tional allowance, a stipend for living expenses, and, if they need them, healthinsurance and child care. Learn and Serve America participants generally donot receive stipends or education awards but may receive academic credit to-ward their degrees. Much of the total financial resources available for theAmeriCorps Grants Program comes from state and local governments and fromprivate enterprises. Eliminating federal funding for those programs would save $3.6 billion over the 2000-2009 period. (The estimate includes costs associated with termi-nating the program.) Alternatively, some of the savings from eliminating theprograms could be redirected to the Federal Pell Grant Program, which is moreclosely targeted toward low-income students. Some critics who favor eliminating the programs maintain that community service should be voluntary rather than an activity for which a person is paid.An additional justification for this option is based on the view that the maingoal of federal aid to students should be to provide access to postsecondaryeducation for people with low income. Because participation in the programs isnot based on family income or assets, funds do not necessarily go to the pooreststudents. Supporters of the programs argue, however, that in addition to providing valuable services, the programs enable many students to attend postsecondaryschools. Moreover, they believe that opportunities to engage in national servicecan promote a sense of idealism among young people and should be supported. Redirecting some of the savings from eliminating the programs to Pell grants would mitigate the effects of this option on lower-income students. Theappropriations committees could use redirected funds from the national serviceprograms to increase the maximum Pell grant.140 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 500-15 REDUCE FUNDING FOR HEAD START Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 1,091 401 2001 CATEGORY : DiscretionarySince 1965, Head Start has funded grants to local agencies to provide compre- hensive services to foster the development of preschool children from low-income families. The services supported by Head Start address the health,education, and nutrition of the children as well as their social behavior. Fundsare awarded to about 1,630 grantees at the discretion of the Secretary of Healthand Human Services, using state allocations determined by formula. Granteesmust contribute 20 percent of program costs from nonfederal funds unless theyobtain a waiver. In 1997, the program served about 800,000 children, approxi-mately 60 percent of whom were 4 years old. The average cost per child inHead Start that year was about $4,900 (compared with $6,800 per pupil spentby public elementary and secondary schools). Reducing the appropriation for Head Start in 2000 and subsequent years to its level for 1996 would reduce federal costs by about $400 million in 2000and nearly $10 billion over the 2000-2009 period. If grantees maintained thecurrent level of services but were unable to replace federal funding withnonfederal resources, the reduction in federal funding would require the pro-gram to cut enrollment from its 1999 level by about 22,000 children. The primary argument for reducing funding for Head Start is that there is little evidence of its long-term effectiveness. The evidence that does exist sug-gests that Head Start does not improve the prospects of participants over thelong run. Although the program produces gains in children's intellectual, emo-tional, and social development after they have been in the program a year, thosegains diminish and disappear as participants move through elementary school.Some model early-childhood education efforts have provided evidence of long-term improvement in the lives of participants, but those projects were muchmore intensive\u2014and expensive\u2014than Head Start and were initiated severaldecades ago, when the social environment of the country, especially in urbanareas, was different. Furthermore, Head Start enrollment and funding haveexpanded rapidly during the 1990s, and some people question the ability of theprogram to effectively absorb the additional funds and students. Concerns havebeen raised as well about the quality of the program's services, including the limited qualifications of some staff. The main argument against reducing the appropriation for Head Start is that it appears to modestly lessen the probability that participants will be placedin special education programs and to increase the likelihood that students willbe promoted to higher grades. Proponents also argue that Head Start enrollsthe most severely disadvantaged children and consequently should be creditedwith preventing participants from falling even further behind in their cognitive,social, and emotional development before they enter elementary school. Anadditional argument for not cutting Head Start funding is that the program hastaken several steps to improve the quality of services that its grantees provide.For example, 60 percent of new appropriations for 1999 must be used for qual-ity improvement activities. A new data collection system is also being devel-oped to produce longitudinal data on a nationally representative sample ofparticipants.FUNCTION 500 EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SERVICES 141 500-16 REDUCE THE 50 PERCENT FLOOR ON THE FEDERAL SHARE OF FOSTER CARE AND ADOPTION ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 120 100 2001 130 1302002 140 1402003 150 1502004 160 160 2005 180 170 2006 190 1902007 200 2002008 220 2202009 240 230 Cumulative 2000-2004 700 680 2000-2009 1,730 1,690 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 500-17The Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs provide benefits and ser- vices to children who are in need. Foster Care supports eligible low-incomechildren who must reside in foster homes; Adoption Assistance subsidizesfamilies that adopt eligible low-income children with special needs. The federal government and the states jointly pay for the benefits provided by the two programs. The state and federal shares are based on the federalmatching rate for medical assistance programs, which depends on a state's percapita income. Higher-income states pay for a larger share of program benefitsthan do lower-income states. Currently, the federal share for the Foster Careand Adoption Assistance programs can vary between 50 percent and 83 per-cent. The federal government now pays a 50 percent share in 11 jurisdictions:Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland,Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and New York. This option would lower the floor on the federal share of benefits from 50 percent to 45 percent. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that thisoption would save $100 million in 2000 and about $1.7 billion through 2009.Those amounts assume, however, that states would partially offset their highercosts by reducing benefits. With the 45 percent floor on the federal share of benefits, a state's contri- bution would relate more directly to its per capital income. As a result, higher-income states that chose to be relatively generous would pay a larger share oftheir higher benefits. Nevertheless, seven of the 11 jurisdictions would bepaying less than the formula alone would require. In part, however, higher incomes and benefits in the affected jurisdictions reflect higher costs of living and not simply greater wealth and generosity. Toaccommodate the drop in funding, the jurisdictions would have to reduce FosterCare and Adoption Assistance benefits, cut spending for other services, or raisetaxes. If, as CBO's estimates assume, states chose to compensate for theirhigher costs by partially reducing benefits, the programs' beneficiaries wouldbe adversely affected. Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, reductions in federal funding for certain entitlement grant programs\u2014including Foster Care andAdoption Assistance\u2014are considered mandates on state governments if thestates lack authority to amend their programmatic or financial responsibilitiesto offset the loss of funding. Because some states may not have sufficient flexi-bility within the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs to make suchchanges, this option could constitute an unfunded federal mandate on thosejurisdictions under the law.142 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 500-17 REDUCE THE FEDERAL MATCHING RATE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND TRAINING COSTS IN THE FOSTER CARE AND ADOPTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 135 110 2001 145 1452002 160 1552003 175 1702004 190 190 2005 210 205 2006 225 2202007 245 2402008 265 2652009 290 285 Cumulative 2000-2004 805 770 2000-2009 2,040 1,985 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 500-16The Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs provide benefits and ser- vices to eligible low-income children and fam ilies. The federal government pays 50 percent of most administrative costs for the programs, including thosefor child placement services, and states and local governments pay the remain-ing share. However, the costs of certain activities are matched at higher ratesto induce local administrators to undertake more of them than they would if costs were matched at the 50 percent rate. For example, the federal governmentpays 75 percent of the costs of training administrators and participating parents. Reducing the matching rates for all administrative and training expenses to 50 percent would decrease federal outlays by $110 million in 2000 and byalmost $2.0 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Cutting the higher matching rates to 50 percent would be appropriate if the need for special incentives for activities such as training no longer existed.However, states might respond to this option by reducing their administrativeefforts, which could raise program costs and offset some of the federal savings.Specifically, states might make less of an effort to eliminate waste and abuse inpayments to providers. Alternatively, this proposal might encourage states toprovide less training for administrators and prospective foster and adoptiveparents or to reduce the payments and other services that the programs offer.

The largest compo-nent of spending is the federal/state Medicaid program, which pays for health services for somelow-income women, children, and elderly people as well as people with disabilities. CBO esti-mates that in 1999, the federal government will spend $107 b illion on Medicaid and a total of $141 billion on function 550, of which $27 billion will be discretionary. Discretionary budgetauthority of over $30 billion was provided for the function in 1999.

The Corps provides scholarships or loan repayment for healthprofessionals in exchange for the recipients' agreeing to serve in a shortagearea for a specified period. In recent years, over 2,200 health professionalshave been serving with the NHSC\u2014most of them in underserved rural areasbut about a third in inner cities. Over half of the participants are doctors, but asubstantial fraction of Corps practitioners are dentists, nurse-practitioners, orphysician assistants. This option would reduce budget authority for the NHSC by 25 percent, producing savings in outlays of $9 million in 2000. Five-year savings wouldtotal $113 million; savings over the 2000-2009 period would reach $254 mil-lion. Although some people living in underserved areas receive greater access to health services because of the Corps, critics of the program may questionwhether it distributes health professionals efficiently. Concerns center onwhether the services that an NHSC professional provides in an underservedarea outweigh the value of the services that he or she would have provided insome other location by enough to justify the public expense of a scholarship orloan repayment. Moreover, some NHSC participants may displace other healthprofessionals. For example, certain of the more desirable shortage areas mighthave been able to attract health professionals if a number of the potential pa-tients were not already being served by Corps professionals. In addition, someobservers might question whether NHSC funding represents a good return oninvestment. Although retention rates have increased substantially, almost halfof the recruits do not remain in their underserved location beyond their obliga-tion. Reducing funding for the NHSC would lessen access in some underserved areas to the services provided by health professionals, although the Corps mightbe able to mitigate the effects of budget cuts by spending more of its resourceson relatively inexpensive nonphysician providers. But even if the Corps refo-cused its remaining funds on nonphysician practitioners, the services of thoseprofessionals would not fully substitute for the skills and services offered byphysicians. In the event of a cut in funding, community health centers, whichobtain about a quarter of their physicians from the NHSC, would probablyreduce their services. Moreover, lower levels of funding would probably havea disproportionate impact on people from minority groups, who constitute themajority of patients served by Corps professionals.FUNCTION 550 HEALTH 145 550-02 REDUCE THE FLOOR ON THE FEDERAL MATCHING RATE IN MEDICAID Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 3,660 2001 : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 550-03The Medicaid program pays for medical assistance for certain low-income families, for low-income people who receive Supplemental Security Income,and for other low-income individuals\u2014mostly children and pregnant women.The federal government and the states pay for the program jointly, with thefederal government's share generally varying according to a formula that de-pends on a state's per capita income. High-income states pay for a larger shareof benefits than low-income states, but by law, the federal share can be no lessthan 50 percent and no more than 83 percent. In 2000, the 50 percent floor willapply to 10 states: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Mas-sachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and New York. (The floorwould also apply to the District of Columbia, but the Balanced Budget Act of1997 established a permanent special exception for that jurisdiction.) Under this opti on, the 50 percent floor would be reduced to 45 percent, generating savings of about $3.7 billion in 2000 and $21.5 billion through2004. (The option assumes that matching rates for other programs that arejointly funded by the federal and state governments would be unaffected, eventhough some programs have matching rates that are tied to the rate forMedicaid. Savings would be greater if matching rates in those programs alsochanged.) Proponents of this change argue that the allocation formula does not ade- quately address differences in the tax base of the states and that high-incomestates should bear a larger share of the cost of their programs. If the floor wasreduced to 45 percent, federal contributions would be more closely related tothe state's per capita income, and six of the 10 jurisdictions would still be pay-ing less than the formula alone would require. Opponents of reducing the 50 percent floor believe that higher incomes in the affected states partly reflect higher costs of living. If the option wasadopted, those states would have to compensate for the lower matching rates byeither reducing Medicaid benefits, reducing expenditures for other services, orraising taxes.146 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 550-03 REDUCE THE ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCHING RATES FOR CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS IN MEDICAID Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 610 2001 7602002 RELATED OPTIONS : 550-02, 550-04-A, and 550-04-BUnder current law, the federal government pays part of the costs that states incur in administering their Medicaid programs. For most administrative activ-ities, the federal matching rate is 50 percent, but that rate is higher for certainactivities. For example, the federal government pays 75 percent of the costs ofskilled medical professionals who are employed in Medicaid administration, 75percent of the costs of utilization review, 90 percent of the development costs ofsystems for claims processing and management information, and 75 percent ofthe costs of operating such systems. The purpose of enhanced matching rates is to give states incentives to develop and support particular administrative activities that the federal govern-ment considers important for the Medicaid program. But once the administra-tive systems are operational, there may be less reason to continue to pay higherrates. If the federal share of all Medicaid administrative costs was 50 percent,savings would be $610 million in 2000, $4.6 billion over the 2000-2004 period,and $12.1 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Opponents of the reduction might argue, however, that without high matching rates, states would be inclined to cut back on some activities, withadverse consequences for the quality of care and for program management.States might, for example, hire fewer nurses to conduct utilization review andoversee care in nursing homes, or they might undertake fewer improvements totheir management information systems. If the Congress wished to protect cer-tain administrative functions, however, it could maintain the higher matchingrates for some administrative activities and reduce them for others.FUNCTION 550 HEALTH 147 550-04-A RESTRICT THE ALLOCATION OF COMMON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO MEDICAID Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 300 2001 3402002 4102003 4102004 410 2005 2000-2004 1,870 2000-2009 3,920 : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 550-03 and 550-04-BPublic assistance programs have certain administrative requirements that are common to the enrollment process, such as the collection of information on afamily's income, assets, and other characteristics. Before the 1996 welfare reform law, the three major public assistance programs\u2014Aid to Families withDependent Children (AFDC), Food Stamps, and Medicaid\u2014all reimbursedstates for 50 percent of most of their administrative costs. But states usuallycharged the common administrative costs of those programs to AFDC. The welfare reform law replaced AFDC and some related programs with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block-grant program.The block grants that states receive are based on historical federal welfareexpenditures, including administrative costs. Thus, insofar as states had previ-ously paid for the common administrative costs of public assistance programsout of AFDC funds, those amounts are now included in their block grants.Although the welfare reform act is silent about the cost allocation process, theDepartment of Health and Human Services now requires states to charge partof the common administrative costs of Medicaid and TANF to Medicaid, evenif those costs are already included in the states' TANF block grants. This option would reduce federal reimbursement for Medicaid administra- tive costs to reflect the share of those costs that are assumed to be covered bythe TANF block grant; it would also prohibit states from using TANF funds topay for those costs. The amount of the reduction would be about one-third ofthe common costs of administering the Medicaid, AFDC, and Food Stampprograms that were charged to AFDC during the base period used for determin-ing the amount of the TANF block grant. (A similar adjustment has alreadybeen made in the amount the federal government pays the states for the admin-istrative costs of the Food Stamp program.) Savings would be $300 million in2000, $1.9 billion over the 2000-2004 period, and $3.9 billion over the 2000-2009 period. (If, however, the policy permitted the states to use TANF funds topay for those costs, savings would be $70 million in 2000, $510 million overthe 2000-2004 period, and $1.3 billion over the 2000-2009 period.) The reductions would come at a time when states are attempting to expand their outreach activities to enroll more eligible children in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP). Because the share ofS-CHIP spending that can be devoted to administration is capped, states mayseek to increase the share of the administrative burden that Medicaid bears.But states would be less likely to pursue that strategy if Medicaid administra-tive payments were reduced.148 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 550-04-B REDUCE SPENDING FOR MEDICAID ADMINISTRATION Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 1,390 2001 : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 550-03 and 550-04-AAn alternative strategy to limit federal payments for Medicaid's common ad- ministrative costs would base those payments to the states on matching pay-ments for administrative costs in the period before the Temporary Assistance toNeedy Families (TANF) block-grant program was established. Under thisoption, the federal government would cap the amount per enrollee that it paidthe states for Medicaid administration. The per capita limit would grow at 5percent a year from the base-year amount, which would be the administrativecosts per enrollee for which the states claimed matching payments in 1996.Savings would be $1.4 billion in 2000, $8.0 billion over the 2000-2004 period,and $22.5 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Using this approach, states that before TANF allocated Medicaid's com- mon administrative costs to AFDC would not have those costs included in theirprojected Medicaid administrative costs. But states that claimed those coststhrough the Medicaid program would have them built into their Medicaid ad-ministrative cost base. The option would generate large savings because theactual average rate of growth of administrative costs was more than 5 percent ayear in the 1996-1998 period and is also projected to exceed 5 percent in 1999and later years.FUNCTION 550 HEALTH 149 550-05 CONVERT MEDICAID AND MEDICARE DSH PAYMENTS INTO A BLOCK GRANT Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 650 2001 4402002 3402003 5102004 730 2005 830 2000-2004 2,660 2000-2009 7,870 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryUnder current law, states are required to adjust Medicaid payments to hospitals that treat large numbers of low-income and Medicaid patients, which are knownas disproportionate share (DSH) hospitals. In the early 1990s, some states usedcreative financing mechanisms to generate large federal matching paymentsthrough the DSH program, and federal DSH costs soared. To curb that growth,the Congress enacted a series of restrictions on DSH payments, culminating inthose of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). Federal outlays for MedicaidDSH payments were $9.0 billion in 1997 and are projected to decline to $8.4billion by 2002, when they will start to rise with inflation. In addition to Medicaid DSH payments, hospitals that serve a dispropor- tionately large share of low-income patients may also receive higher paymentrates under Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS). Implemented in1986, the Medicare disproportionate share adjustment was intended to accountfor the presumably higher costs of treating Medicare patients in such hospitals.Recently, however, the adjustment has been seen more as a means to protectaccess to care for Medicare and low-income populations by providing financialsupport to hospitals serving large numbers of indigent patients. Outlays forMedicare DSH payments rose rapidly between 1989 and 1997, reaching $4.5billion in that year. Under the BBA, a temporary 5 percent reduction in Medi-care DSH adjustments is being phased in over five years. As a result, paymentsin 2002 will be $5.0 billion. An alternative approach to providing federal financial support for health care institutions that serve the poor and uninsured would be to convert the cur-rent Medicaid and Medicare disproportionate share programs into block grants tothe states. The grants could be constrained to grow more slowly than DSH pay-ments would grow under current law. In exchange for slower growth, statescould be given flexibility to use the funds to meet the needs of their low-incomeuninsured populations in the most cost-effective ways. Under this illustrative option, which assumes a maintenance-of-effort re- quirement for states, the aggregate block grant in 2000 would be the sum ofMedicare DSH payments and Medicaid DSH allotments for 1999, reduced by 10percent. In subsequent years the block grant would be indexed to the increase inthe consumer price index for urban consumers less 1 percentage point. Totalsavings would be $650 million in 2000, $2.7 billion for the 2000-2004 period,and $7.9 billion for the 2000-2009 period. Giving the states more discretion in the allocation of DSH payments could result in those funds being targeted more appropriately and equitably to facilitiesand providers that serve low-income populations. But allowing the states toallocate the payments could cause some large urban safety-net hospitals to re-ceive considerably less public funding than they do now, possibly threateningtheir future survival. In addition, determining how to allocate the block grantfunds among the states would be difficult and controversial.150 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 550-06 REDUCE SUBSIDIES FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 209 63 2001 : DiscretionaryThe Congress provided about $209 million to the Public Health Service in 1999 to fund subsidies to institutions for educating physicians, nurses, and publichealth professionals. Those funds primarily furnish support through grants andcontracts to schools and hospitals for designated training programs in the healthprofessions. The programs promote primary care and community-based train-ing for physicians and other health professionals as well as nursing education: oPrimary care and community-based training . Several programs provide federal grants to medical schools, teaching hospitals, and other trainingcenters to develop, expa nd, or improve graduate medical education in primary care specialties and other allied health fields and to encouragepractice in rural and low-income urban areas. Funding for 1999 is $143million. oNursing education . The subsidies to nursing schools are meant to pro- mote nursing education, including graduate training for nurse administra-tors, educators, and nursing specialists such as nurse-midwives and nurse-practitioners. Funding for 1999 is $66 million. Eliminating those grants and subsidies would save about $800 million over the 2000-2004 period. Savings over the 2000-2009 period would be $1.8 billion. The principal justification for this option is that market forces provide strong incentives for people to seek training and jobs in the health professions.Over the past several decades, the number of physicians\u2014the principal healthprofession targeted by the subsidies\u2014has rapidly increased, rising from 142physicians in all fields for every 100,000 people in 1960 to 274 in 1995. In thecase of nurses, if a shortage indeed existed, higher wages and better workingconditions would attract more people to the profession and more trained nursesto nursing jobs, and would encourage more of them to seek advanced training. The major disadvantage of eliminating the subsidies is that the incentives supplied by market forces may not be strong enough to entirely meet the goalsof the health professions programs. For example, third-party reimbursementrates for primary care may not encourage enough physicians to enter thosespecialties and may not include sufficient financial inducements to increaseaccess to care in rural and inner-city areas. In addition, fewer people mightchoose advanced training in nursing, which could limit the opportunities for theuse of relatively inexpensive physician substitutes.FUNCTION 550 HEALTH 151 550-07 COMBINE AND REDUCE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE BLOCK GRANTS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 383 138 2001 383 3322002 383 3592003 383 3752004 383 376 2005 383 376 2006 383 3762007 383 3762008 383 3,458 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryIn its appropriations for 1999, the Congress provided about $3.8 billion for nine block-grant programs administered by the Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration (HRSA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA). Four of the nine programs\u2014the Maternal and Child Health Care Block Grant, HIV Care Grants to States, the Family Planning Block Grant, and theHealthy Start Initiative\u2014are administered by HRSA. Those grants supportprograms that provide child health services, including immunizations, well-child examinations, and services for children with special health care needs;medical care and social support services for people who have been diagnosedwith the human immunodeficiency virus; family planning services; and infantmortality efforts. CDC administers the Preventive Health and Health ServicesBlock Grant, which is distributed to the states for programs that supportHealthy People 2000, the nation's overall health objectives. The remaining four block grants\u2014the Substance Abuse Performance Partnership Block Grant, the Mental Health Performance Partnership BlockGrant, the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH)program, and the Protection and Advocacy Program\u2014are administered bySAMHSA. The grants fund substance abuse prevention programs, community-based mental health services for adults with serious mental illnesses and chil-dren with severe emotional disturbances, services for mentally ill people withsubstance abuse disorders who are also either homeless or at risk of becominghomeless, and programs that investigate allegations of abuse and neglect infacilities that provide care for people with mental illness. This option would combine all of the block grants into two large grants and reduce funding to 90 percent of the 1999 level. The block grants currentlyadministered by HRSA and the CDC would be combined and administered byHRSA, and the block grants currently administered by SAMHSA would becombined and administered by that agency. The principal justification for this option is that each state would be given added flexibility to direct the grant funds toward programs that the state consid-ers likely to have the most favorable impact. Conditions vary substantially bystate, yet grant requirements often compel states to invest resources in programsthat may or may not meet a given state's needs. By reducing funds for lower-priority programs, states could allocate additional resources to programs thatthey considered more important. The option's major disadvantage is that improved flexibility might not entirely make up for the 10 percent cut in federal funds for state programs. Thestates would have to make difficult decisions to trim programs that benefitedvulnerable population groups. Alternatively, if reducing resources was notfeasible, they might have to raise state taxes or cut other state programs.152 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 550-08 ADOPT A VOUCHER PLAN FOR THE FEHB PROGRAM Savingsa (Millions of dollars) Discre- tionarybManda- tory Annual 2000 0 0 2001 150 1502002 370 3702003 610 6102004 860 a.

SPENDING CATEGORIES : Discretionary and mandatory RELATED OPTION : 550-09 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program provides health in- surance coverage for over 4 million active federal employees and annuitants, aswell as for their 4.6 million dependents and survivors, at a cost to the govern-ment of about $12 billion in 1999. The cost-sharing structure of the FEHBprogram encourages federal employees to switch from high-cost to lower-costplans to blunt the effects of rising premiums; cost sharing also intensifies com-petitive pressures on all participating plans to hold down premiums. The Bal-anced Budget Act of 1997 set the federal government's share of premiums foremployees and annuitants (including family coverage) at 72 percent of theaverage weighted premium of all plans beginning January 1, 1999. (The em-ployer's costs are higher under the U.S. Postal Service's collective bargainingagreement.) The act, which made largely technical changes to the FEHB for-mula for determining the government's contribution, did not signifi cantly change the government's average share of those premiums. Moreover, thegovernment still requires policyholders to pay at least 25 percent of the pre-mium of any particular plan. To reduce expenditures, the government could offer a flat voucher for health insurance premiums. It could pay the first $1,900 of premiums for em-ployees and retirees ($4,350 for family coverage). Those amounts are based onthe government's average expected contribution for nonpostal employees in2000 and would increase annually by the rate of inflation rather than by theaverage weighted rate of change for premiums in the FEHB program. Budget-ary savings would come from indexing the premiums to inflation rather than tothe growth of premiums, which the Congressional Budget Office expects willrise at a rate more than twice that of inflation. Savings in discretionary spend-ing from lower payments for current employees and their dependents would bezero in 2000, $2 billion over five years, and $11 billion over 10 years. Savingsin mandatory spending from reduced payments for retirees would be zero in2000, $2.0 billion over five years, and $11.6 billion over 10 years. The option would strengthen price competition among health plans in the FEHB program because almost all current enrollees would be faced with pay-ing all of the incremental premiums above the voucher amount. In addition,removing the requirement that enrollees pay at least 25 percent of the premiumsshould increase price competition among low-cost plans to attract participants.

The added cost to enrollees could exceed $600 per worker in 2004 andmore in later years.

SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 550-08 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program provides health insur- ance to federal retirees and active employees through participating fee-for-serviceplans and managed care plans. Participants and the government share the cost ofpremiums. The government's share for annuitants and employees is 72 percentof the weighted average premium of all participating plans (up to a cap of 75percent of the total premium). Retirees are generally eligible to continue receiv-ing benefits from the FEHB program if they have been participants during theirlast five years of service and are eligible to receive an immediate annuity. About80 percent of eligible new retirees elect to receive retiree health benefits. Afterage 65, FEHB program benefits are coordinated with Medicare; the programpays amounts not covered by Medicare (but no more than the amount it wouldhave paid in the absence of Medicare). Consequently, many retirees receivebenefits superior to those they received while employed. In 1998, the govern-ment paid $4.3 billion in premiums for 1.9 million annuitants and their depend-ents and survivors. In contrast to federal pensions, retiree health benefits are not based on length of service. Moreover, federal retiree health benefits are significantly moregenerous than those offered by most large private firms, which have been aggres-sively paring and, in some cases, eliminating retiree health benefits in recentyears. A survey of all U.S. employers found that fewer than half provide medicalbenefits to retirees. Federal retiree health benefits could be reduced for those with relatively short federal careers while preserving the right of retirees to participate in theFEHB program. For new retirees only, the government's share of the premiumcould be cut by 2 percentage points for every year of service under 30. For ex-ample, the government's contribution would fall to 52 percent of the averagepremium for a retiree with 20 years of service. In 1998, about 55 percent of theroughly 60,000 new retirees who continued in the FEHB program had less than30 years of service. The average new nonpostal retiree affected by the proposalwould pay 47 percent of the premium rather than 28 percent, an annual increaseof $750 in 2000. The estimated savings to the government in mandatory spend-ing would total $50 million in 2000 and $750 million over five years. Ten-yearsavings would rise to $3.3 billion. The option might make the government's compensation mix fairer and more efficient by improving the link between service and deferred compensation.And even with this change, federal retiree health benefits would remain compara-ble with those offered by firms that continued to provide retiree benefits. A negative aspect of the option is that it would mean a substantial cut in benefits whose effects would be felt most strongly by the roughly 20 percent ofnew retirees with less than 20 years of service. The option could also encouragesome employees with short service careers to delay retirement, whereas othersmight accelerate retirement plans to avoid the new rules.154 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 550-10 ESTABLISH NEW USER FEES FOR MEDICAL DEVICES REGULATED BY THE FDA Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 12 9 2001 28 232002 32 302003 31 312004 31 31 2005 31 31 2006 31 312007 31 312008 31 312009 31 30 Cumulative 2000-2004 134 124 2000-2009 289 277 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA) authorized the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect fees from pharmaceutical manufac-turers to help speed up the review of applications for marketing and approval ofnew drugs. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997(FDAMA) reauthorized the PDUFA user fee program but did not address userfees for medical devices. The Congress considered but did not pass legislationauthorizing user fees for medical devices in 1994. The Administration's 2000budget includes a proposal to impose user fees on medical devices as well as onother products regulated by the FDA. Manufacturers must notify the FDA before they market any new medical device, and for certain products, they must obtain approval before marketingthem. Imposing fees of $7,000 for each new medical device requiring pre-market notification, $3,500 for those devices qualifying for abbreviated orspecial notification processes, and $60,000 for each new medical device need-ing premarket approval would raise $9 million in 2000 and $277 million duringthe 2000-2009 period. Taken together, those fees would ultimately constituteabout 21 percent of the cost of regulating medical devices. The estimates as-sume that only a few exemptions would be granted for small businesses ordevices with very small markets. Establishing new user fees for medical devices would require new autho- rizing legislation. To generate budgetary savings, that legislation would haveto permit user fee collections to offset other FDA appropriations for salariesand expenses. PDUFA does not permit that offset for prescription drug userfees. Proponents of user fees for medical devices argue that regulatory activi- ties benefit both consumers and industry. The FDA's primary function is toensure public safety by monitoring the quality of pharmaceutical products,medical devices, and food. Firms benefit from the public confidence that re- sults from the FDA's regulation, those proponents maintain, and should there-fore bear a share of the costs of those activities. People who oppose levying new user fees on medical devices might argue that the agency's current oversight of medical devices is excessive and unneces-sary. Rather than adding user fees, those opponents might contend that theFDA could cut costs by scaling back its regulatory requirements.1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999050100150200250Outlays in Billions of Dollars DiscretionaryMandatory570 Medicare Budget function 570 comprises spending for Medicare, the federal health insurance program for elderly and eligible disabled people.

Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) pays for physicians' services,outpatient hospital services, home health care, and other services.

Discretionary budget authority provided for function 570 in 1999also totals $3 billion. Over the past 10 years, Medicare outlays have risen from about 7.5 percentof federal spending to nearly 12 percent.156 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-01 REDUCE MEDICARE'S PAYMENTS FOR THE INDIRECT COSTS OF PATIENT CARE THAT ARE RELATED TOHOSPITALS' TEACHING PROGRAMS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 1,200 2001 1,0002002 1,2002003 1,3002004 1,400 2005 2000-2004 6,200 2000-2009 RELATED OPTIONS : 570-02, 570-03, and 570-04 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Medicare and Graduate Medical Education (Study), September 1995.The Social Security Amendments of 1983 established the prospective payment system (PPS) under which Medicare pays hospitals for inpatient services pro-vided to beneficiaries. Higher rates are paid to hospitals with t eaching pro- grams to cover their higher costs of caring for Medicare patients. The addi-tional percentage paid to those hospitals under current law in 2000 will beapproximately 6 percent for each 0.1 increase in a hospital's ratio of full-timeinterns and residents to its number of beds. For 2001 and later, the addition toMedicare's payments will be 5.5 percent for each 0.1 increase in the resident-to-bed ratio. Those adjustments were enacted to compensate hospitals for indi-rect teaching costs\u2014such as the greater number of tests and procedures thoughtto be prescribed by interns and residents\u2014and to cover higher costs caused byfactors that are not otherwise accounted for in setting the PPS rates. Suchfactors might include more severely ill patients, location in inner cities, and amore costly mix of staffing and facilities\u2014all of which are associated withlarge teaching programs. The Prospective Payment Assessment Commission has estimated that a 4.1 percent adjustment to Medicare's payments would more closely match theincrease in operating costs associated with teaching. If the teaching adjustmentwas lowered accordingly, outlays would fall by about $6.2 billion from current-law spending over the 2000-2004 period and by about $15.8 billion over the2000-2009 period. This option would better align payments with the actual costs incurred by teaching ins titutions. Furthermore, since the training that medical residents receive will result in a significant increase in their future income and sincehospitals benefit from using residents' labor, it is reasonable for some or all ofa hospital's indirect training costs to be borne by both residents and the hospi-tal. Some of those costs are now passed on in the form of stipends that arelower than the value of the residents' services to the hospital. A lower teachingadjustment would probably lead to even lower stipends as well as smaller resi-dency programs. Although some people seeking residency positions mightconsider smaller programs to be a disadvantage of this opti on, several health policy groups, including the Council on Graduate Medical Education, believethat a decline in the number of residency positions is desirable. An additionalconsideration is that if the teaching hospitals now use some payments to fundsuch activities as charity care, people without health insurance could have lessaccess to health services.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 157 570-02 REDUCE MEDICARE'S DIRECT PAYMENTS FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 800 2001 9002002 9002003 1,0002004 1,000 2005 1,000 2006 1,1002007 1,2002008 1,2002009 1,200 Cumulative 2000-2004 4,600 2000-2009 10,300 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 570-01, 570-03, and 570-04 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Medicare and Graduate Medical Education (Study), September 1995.Medicare's prospective payment system does not include payments to hospitals for the direct costs they incur in providing graduate medical education(GME)\u2014namely, residents' salaries and fringe benefits, teaching costs, andinstitutional overhead. Instead, Medicare makes those payments separately onthe basis of its share of a hospital's 1984 cost per resident indexed for increasesin the level of consumer prices. Medicare's direct GME payments, which arereceived by about one-fifth of all U.S. hospitals, totaled about $2.1 billion for1998. In effect, this option would reduce teaching and overhead payments for residents but continue to pay their salaries and fringe benefits. Hospitals' directGME payments would be based on the national average of salaries paid toresidents in 1987, updated annually by the consumer price index for all urbanconsumers. Reimbursement would be based on 120 percent of the nati onal average salary. Unlike the current system, under which GME payments varyconsiderably from hospital to hospital, this option would pay every hospital thesame amount for the same type of resident. The option would also continue thecurrent-law practice of reducing payments for residents who have gone beyondtheir initial residency period. The savings from current-law spending wouldtotal about $4.6 billion over the 2000-2004 period and about $10.3 billion overthe 2000-2009 period. The overall reduction in the level of subsidies might be warranted since market incentives appear to be sufficient to encourage a continuing flow of newphysicians. Moreover, since hospitals use resident physicians to care for pa-tients and since residency training helps young physicians earn higher incomesin the future, both hospitals and residents might reasonably contribute more tothose training costs. Residents would contribute more to those costs if hospitalsresponded to the changes in reimbursements by cutting residents' salaries orfringe benefits. If hospitals lowered residents' salaries or benefits, the costs of longer residencies\u2014in terms of forgone practice income\u2014could exert greater influ-ence on the young physicians' decisions about pursuing a specialty. More resi-dents might choose to begin primary care practice rather than specialize further.That outcome could be negative for the individual resident; by contrast, theCouncil on Graduate Medical Education and other groups believe that a rela-tive increase in the number of primary care practitioners would be desirable.Finally, decreasing GME reimbursement could force some hospitals to reducethe resources they commit to training, possibly jeopardizing the quality of theirmedical education programs.158 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-03 ELIMINATE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL-RELATED PAYMENTS FOR HOSPITALS WITH RESIDENCY PROGRAMS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 300 2001 3002002 3002003 3002004 300 2005 300 2006 3002007 3002008 3002009 300 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,400 2000-2009 3,000 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 570-01, 570-02, and 570-04Under the prospective payment system for inpatient hospital services, Medicare pays hospitals an amount for each discharge that is intended to compensate thehospital for capital-related costs. Currently, teaching hospitals receive addi-tional capital-related payments that are based on teaching intensity, measuredas a hospital's ratio of residents to its average daily number of inpatients. Spe-cifically, an increase of 0.1 in that ratio raises the hospital's capital-relatedpayment by 2.8 percent. Eliminating those extra payments would save the Medicare program about $0.3 billion in 2 000. Five-year savings would equal a bout $1.4 billion, and savings over the 2000-2009 period would be $3.0 billion. In contrast to higher operating costs, which analyses indicate are indeed associated with teaching intensity, a hospital's capital costs per case appear tobe unrelated to intensity. Furthermore, paying teaching hospitals more thannonteaching hospitals for otherwise similar patients may discour age efficient decisionmaking by hospitals. In addition, Medicare's payment adjustments forteaching intensity may distort the market for residency training by artificiallyincreasing the value (or decreasing the cost) of residents to hospitals. If resi-dents' training raises the costs of patient care for a hospital, arguably the hospi-tal should bear those costs in order to encourage an efficient amount of training.Hospitals are likely to shift such costs to residents in the form of lower stipendsor greater workloads. Residents will engage in such training if they perceivethat their future productivity, as reflected in their future incomes, will be greatenough to outweigh those costs. Eliminating the special capital-related payments would reduce revenues to teaching hospitals at a time w hen those hospitals already f ace pressures to reduce costs to remain competitive in the growing managed care environment.Teaching hospitals would probably have to reduce some services in response tothe decline in their revenues. Those reductions in services could include lessprovision of public goods, such as research or providing medical care to theindigent.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 159 570-04 CONVERT MEDICARE PAYMENTS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION TO A BLOCK GRANT ANDSLOW THEIR RATE OF GROWTH Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 0 2001 a2002 3002003 5002004 700 2005 900 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,600 2000-2009 8,600 a.

Under provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of1997, teaching hospitals have begun to receive GME payments for participantsin Medicare+Choice health plans in addition to the payments that they havetraditionally received for fee-for-service Medicare patients. Several variablesdetermine the total amount of GME payments that a hospital receives, includingthe number and diagnoses of Medicare discharges and numerical factors usedfor annually updating payments for inpatient operating costs and capital-relatedcosts. Because of changes in those variables over time, the CongressionalBudget Office expects GME payments under current law to grow at an averageannual rate of 5.1 percent between 2000 and 2009. This option would replace the current system with a consolidated block grant to fund the special activities of teaching hospitals. Under the currentsystem, a hospital receives GME payments based on regulatory formulas, andtotal Medicare GME spending is the resulting sum of what Medicare owes eachhospital. The option considered here assumes that a budget-neutral switch to theblock-grant program would occur in 2000 and that the program's future growthwould be limited to the rate of overall inflation. Compared with projectedspending under current law, federal outlays would be reduced by $1.6 billionover the first five years and $8.6 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Establishing a block grant for the three types of GME payments would allow the Congress to better monitor and adjust that funding. Another featureof the option is that Medicare would no longer pay different rates to hospitalsfor inpatient services merely because of differences in the size or presence ofresidency programs. However, because this option would reduce total payments to teaching hospitals below the amounts expected under current law, such hospitals would,on average, receive less revenue than they would otherwise. In response, teach-ing hospitals might reduce the amount or quality of some of their services ortheir provision of some public goods, such as medical research or care for indi-gent people.160 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-05 ELIMINATE MEDICARE'S ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO SOLE COMMUNITY HOSPITALS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 70 2001 802002 802003 902004 100 2005 100 2006 1102007 1102008 1202009 2000-2004 420 2000-2009 990 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryUnder Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services, special rules apply to providers designated as sole community hospi-tals (SCHs). At present, there are more than 600 SCHs, almost all of which arelocated in rural areas. Thus, more than one-fourth of rural hospitals qualify forSCH status. Under the current rules, a hospital may be designated as an SCH ifit meets specific criteria that define a sole provider of inpatient, acute carehospital services in a geographic area. In addition, some SCHs have beenpermitted to retain that status regardless of whether they meet the current sole-provider criteria. Payments to SCHs are equal to the highest of three amounts: the regular PPS payment that would otherwise apply, an amount based on the hospital'scosts in 1982 updated to the current year, or an amount based on the hospital'scosts in 1987 updated to the current year. Hospitals that choose to receive theregular PPS payment\u2014about half of all SCHs\u2014are eligible to receive higherpayment adjustments than other rural hospitals for disproportionate share sta-tus. Hospitals that receive payments based on their updated costs are ineligiblefor those higher adjustments. If all sole community hospitals received the regular PPS payment rather than their updated costs, total PPS payments would be about $70 million less in2000 and $420 billion less for the 2000-2004 period. Those savings assumethat SCHs would continue to be eligible for higher disproportionate share ad-justments. A primary objective of the SCH rules is to assist hospitals in locations where closings would threaten access to hospital care, but the federal support isnot particularly well aimed at such essential providers. Moreover, whether anSCH actually receives higher payments under the special rules that permitpayments to be based on a hospital-specific am ount depends on whether its costs in either of the specified base years (1982 or 1987) were relatively high,not on its current financial condition. If the special payment rules were eliminated, however, revenues of many sole community hospitals would be lower, which might cause financial distressfor some of them. Because many SCHs are the sole providers of hospital ser-vices in their geographic areas, access to health care or the quality of care might be reduced in some rural locations.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 161 570-06 INSTITUTE A SINGLE GLOBAL PAYMENT FOR HOSPITALS' AND PHYSICIANS' SERVICES PROVIDED DURING ANINPATIENT STAY Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 50 2001 602002 602003 602004 60 2005 70 2006 702007 802008 802009 Cumulative 2000-2004 290 2000-2009 670 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryHospitals receive payments under Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) for the operating costs of providing inpatient services to the program's beneficia-ries. The payments are determined on a per-case basis; payment rates vary withthe patient's diagnosis, which Medicare classifies within a system of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), and the characteristics of the hospital. Those rates takeinto account reasonable variations in the treatment of patients with a given DRGand offer an incentive to the hospital to reduce the cost of treatment. PPS pay-ments do not cover all services rendered to patients during the hospital stay. Inparticular, Med icare pays separately for physicians' services provided on an inpatient basis. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has explored the feasi- bility of making a single global payment for high-cost, high-volume inp atient procedures. That payment would be lower than the separate payments that arenow made for hospitals' operating costs and physicians' services. In a recentdemonstration project involving heart bypass surgery, discounted payment rateswere established through negotiations with participating hospitals in conjunctionwith teams of physicians. With a global payment, hospitals and physicians alikehave an incentive to reduce operating costs while maintaining a satisfactorystandard of care. The institutions hoped to offset the discounts in their Medicarepayments by two means: improvements in efficiency (and their resultant costsavings) and increases (using new marketing efforts) in the volume of heart by-pass patients. During the five-year project, Medicare outlays to the seven hospi-tals participating in the demonstration averaged about 14 percent less than wouldhave been spent otherwise. HCFA has also investigated ways to extend the global payment concept. One approach, sim ilar to the heart bypass demonstration, identified other high- cost, high-volume inpatient procedures that might yield negotiated savings.(They included cataract surgery, coronary angioplasty, heart valve replacement,and joint replacement surgery.) That option might be attractive to hospitals,which could market themselves as \"centers of excellence.\" However, such termi-nology would be controversial because it might be construed as suggesting thatother hospitals did not offer high-quality care. Another disadvantage would bethat only a modest number of institutions and high-cost procedures might be-come eligible for global payments. A further approach developed by HCFA would provide global payments for nearly all DRGs, with an average discount of 5 percent that would not be subjectto negotiation. Expanding the use of global payments through such a discountwould yield savings of $50 million in 2000 and $670 million for the 2000-2009period. That approach has the advantage of being available to all hospitalsacross the country, but it could also be unpopular because it would lower pay-ments without giving the institutions much opportunity to expand their market-ing efforts. In addition, its lack of focus on specific clinical conditions mightdilute the incentive to find cost-saving innovations.162 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-07 INCREASE AND EXTEND THE REDUCTIONS IN THE MEDICARE PPS MARKET BASKET Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 60 2001 6902002 1,3502003 3,0402004 : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-08Under Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS), payments for hospitals' operating costs for inpatient services provided to beneficiaries are determinedon a per-case basis, according to preset rates that vary with the patient's diag-nosis and the characteristics of the hospital. Payment rates are adjusted each year using an update factor that is determined, in part, by the projected increasein the hospital market-basket index (MBI), which reflects increases in hospitalcosts. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced hospital update factors for 1998 through 2002. Specifically, the act froze the basic payment in 1998 andreduced the update by 1.9 percentage points in 1999, 1.8 percentage points in2000, and 1.1 percentage points in 2001 and 2002. Without those reductions,the updates would have been 2.1 percent in 1998, 2.4 per cent in 1999, 2.9 percent in 2000, and more than 3 percent each year in 2001 and 2002. (In several states, however, certain hospitals with negative PPS margins received a0.5 percentage-point adjustment in 1998 and a 0.3 percentage-point adjustmentin 1999.) After 2002, the update factor reverts to the full value of the MBI. Ifthe factor was reduced to the MBI minus 1.9 percentage points in 2000 andstayed at that level throughout the 2000-2009 period, total savings during thattime would be $70.9 billion. In 1997, average profit margins for hospitals on Medicare inpatient ser- vices were about 16 percent. Moreover, MedPAC (the Medicare PaymentAdvisory Commission) projects that despite the payment freeze in 1998 and thelarge reduction in the update factor for 1999, average Medicare inpatient mar-gins will exceed 15 percent in both years. Thus, further reductions in updatefactors could be justified. The American Hospital Association, however, main-tains that high inpatient margins reflect major efforts by hospitals to cut costs,which cannot continue indefinitely. Moreover, almost one-quarter of all hospi-tals have negative profit margins on Medicare inpatient services, so furtherreductions in payment update factors could cause considerable hardship forthose facilities, especially as some hospitals are only now beginning to feel theeffects of past payment reductions.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 163 570-08 REDUCE MEDICARE'S PAYMENTS FOR HOSPITALS' INPATIENT CAPITAL-RELATED COSTS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 260 2001 3602002 3602003 3902004 410 2005 2000-2004 1,780 2000-2009 4,120 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-07In 1992, Medicare revised its method of paying hospitals for their inpatient capital-related costs by replacing cost-based reimbursement with a prospectivepayment method. Under the prospective system, hospitals receive a predeter-mined amount for each Medicare patient to pay for capital-related costs, whichinclude depreciation, interest, taxes, insurance, and similar expenses for build-ings and fixed and movable equipment. The prospective system applies toabout 5,000 hospitals paid under Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS)for operating costs. A fully prospective federal payment rate for capital costs is being phased in over 10 years. During the transition period, payments are determined by acomplicated method based on a number of factors, including f ederal and hospital-specific payment rates. The federal and hospital-specific rates areincreased annually. By 2001, all hospitals w ill receive the federal rate, ad- justed for the hospital's mix of patients and certain other characteristics. Analyses conducted by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) suggest that the initial federal and hospital-specific rates were toohigh. The 1992 rates were based on actual 1989 and 1990 data (for the federalrate and hospital-specific rates, respectively) projected to 1992, but more recentdata indicate that the rate of growth of capital costs between 1989 and 1992was slower than expected. Moreover, the initial level of capital costs per casein 1989 was probably higher than would be optimal in an efficient market be-cause of incentives provided by the Medicare payments. Factors such aschanges in capital prices, the mix of patients treated by hospitals, and the \"in-tensity\" of hospital services contributed to the overestimate. On the basis ofHCFA's analysis, the estimated 1992 capital costs would have been reduced byabout 22 percent if those factors had been taken into account. The federal rate was reduced by 7.4 percent in the Omnibus Budget Rec- onciliation Act of 1993 in a provision that expired in 1996. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced the federal rate by 17.8 percent for capital pay-ments made to hospitals for patient discharges occurring in 1998 through 2002.A small part of that reduction will be restored beginning in 2003. A further reduction of 5 percent (bringing the total reduction in capital payments to aboutthe level estimated by HCFA) would yield savings of $260 million in 2000 and$4.1 billion for the 2000-2009 period. Most hospitals would probably be able to adjust to the reductions by lowering their capital costs or partially covering them with other sources ofrevenue because Medicare's payments for capital costs are a small share ofhospitals' revenues\u2014less than 5 percent of their total revenues from all sources.Hospitals that are in poor financial condition, however, might have difficultyabsorbing the reductions. As a result, the quality of the care they offer mightdecline, and they might provide fewer services to people without insurance.164 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-09 ELIMINATE MEDICARE'S PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS FOR ENROLLEES' BAD DEBTS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 450 2001 5802002 6102003 6702004 730 3,030 : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-10Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for certain deductible and coinsurance amounts when they receive hospital services. In calendar year 1999, the de-ductible amount is $768 per spell of illness, and beneficiaries must make coinsurance payments for inpatient care in excess of 60 days and for servicesfurnished on an outpatient basis. Before enactment of the Balanced BudgetAct of 1997 (BBA), if the hospital made a reasonable effort to collect the cost-sharing amounts from patients, Medicare would reimburse it for any remainingunpaid amounts. The BBA phased in a reduction in those bad-debt payments to55 percent of the amount that hospitals did not collect from beneficiaries.Eliminating all reimbursement for enrollees' bad debts would reduce Medicare'spayments by $450 million in 2000 and $3.0 billion over the 2000-2004 period. This option would give hospitals incentives to improve their collection efforts, but they would not be able to collect all of the money that theirMedicare patients owed. In particular, low-income enrollees who were notcovered by Medicaid might not be able to pay their hospital bills. As a result,this option would reduce revenues the most for those hospitals that were mostlikely to serve low-income Medicare patients. Moreover, a drop in theirMedicare payments might lead some hospitals to cut back on the quality of theirservices or the amount of uncompensated care that they provide or to raise therates that they charge for the care of other patients.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 165 570-10 ELIMINATE MEDICARE'S PAYMENTS TO NONHOSPITAL PROVIDERS FOR ENROLLEES' BAD DEBTS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 520 2001 6902002 7302003 7902004 860 2005 950 Cumulative 2000-2004 3,600 2000-2009 9,130 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-09The Medicare program pays a variety of providers, in addition to hospitals, for the bad debts of their Medicare patients. Providers incur such debts whenMedicare patients do not pay the cost-sharing amounts that the program re-quires. Patients in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), for example, must pay adaily coinsurance amount of $96 in calendar year 1999 for care received fromthe 21st through the 100th day following discharge from a hospital. Providersthat are eligible for bad-debt payments include SNFs, rural health clinics, andcomprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities. The Balanced Budget Act of1997 reduced Medicare's payments for hospitals' bad debts but did not affectbad-debt payments for nonhospital providers. This option would eliminate suchpayments for nonhospital providers, saving $520 million in 2000 and $3.6billion over the 2000-2004 period. As with hospitals, eliminating bad-debt payments would increase provid- ers' incentives to improve their collection efforts, but some bad debts wouldremain. The policy could, therefore, cause financial problems for providers thatserve a large number of low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Faced with unpaidbad debts, such providers might reduce the quality of their care or the amountof uncompensated care that they provide.166 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-11 REDUCE MEDICARE EXPENDITURES FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 260 2001 4402002 4902003 6502004 : MandatoryMedicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) paid providers over $2.5 billion in 1998 for certain outpatient drugs. Prescription drugs are covered underPart B when they must be administered under a physician's supervision, as is thecase with many drugs requiring injection or infusion. Medicare also pays fordrugs that must be delivered by durable medical equipment covered under theprogram. In addition, some oral chemotherapy and antinausea drugs for cancerpatients as well as immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplant recipients arecovered, as are certain vaccines. Medicare payment policies for prescription drugs have evolved in recent years. Before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), the amount thatMedicare allowed as a reasonable charge was based on the average wholesaleprice, or AWP, which is a published list price set by the manufacturer. Forsingle-source drugs, the allowed charge was the AWP; for multisource drugs, theallowed charge was the median AWP among all generic suppliers of multisourcedrugs. The BBA, however, set the allowed charge for each covered single-sourcedrug at 95 percent of the AWP. For multisource drugs, the allowed charge is 95percent of either the median AWP among generic suppliers or the lowestbrand-name AWP when that price is less than the median generic AWP for theproduct. Because the AWP is a list price and not the actual price providers pay for drugs, pegging Medicare's payment to the AWP has meant that providers andsuppliers could profit from administering or dispensing Medicare-covered drugs.The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services hasreported that actual wholesale drug prices available to physicians were about 30percent less than the AWP in 1997. The BBA changes may reduce those mark-ups by 5 percentage points in the near term, but manufacturers can restore pre-BBA profit margins for physicians by raising list prices. This option would limit Medicare's reimbursements for prescription drugs by decreasing the allowed charge from 95 percent to 85 percent of the AWP andby limiting increases in the allowed charge for covered drugs to changes in therate of inflation. (Changes in the allowed charge would track the consumer priceindex for all urban consumers, excluding food and energy.) As a result, Medi-care Part B outlays would decrease by $11.5 billion between 2000 and 2009. One disadvantage of the option is that it would encourage manufacturers to introduce new drugs at AWPs that were higher than they would otherwise be inorder to restore the profit margins available to physicians and other suppliers.Physicians would prescribe newly introduced drugs more quickly as a result.Therefore, the option's effectiveness in limiting Part B spending growth wouldgradually erode as new drugs replaced older ones in the mix of covered drugs.Critics of this kind of proposal also claim that some physicians would sometimesbe unable to obtain drugs at a price at or below the allowed charge, especially ifactual acquisition prices were to rise faster than the rate of inflation. However,such problems should be infrequent.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 167 570-12 INDEX MEDICARE'S DEDUCTIBLE FOR PHYSICIANS' SERVICES Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 110 2001 3602002 5502003 8302004 RELATED OPTIONS : 570-13-A, 570-13-B, 570-14, and 570-15One way to achieve federal savings in Medicare's Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program is to increase the deductible\u2014that is, the amount thatenrollees must pay for services each year before the government shares respon-sibility. The deductible is now $100 a year and has been increased only threetimes since Medicare began in 1966, when it was set at $50. In relation to average annual per capita charges under the SMI program, the deductible hasfallen from 45 percent in 1967 to about 3 percent (projected) for 1999. Increasing the SMI deductible for 2000 and later years according to the growth in SMI charges per enrollee would save $110 million in 2000, $3.0billion over the five-year period, and $13.9 billion over the 10-year period. In2000, the deductible would be $107. An increase in the amount of the deductible would enhance the economic incentives for prudent consumption of medical care while spreading the impactof an increase in cost sharing among most enrollees. No enrollee's out-of-pocket costs would rise by more than $7 in 2000. However, the additional out-of-pocket costs under this option might dis- courage some low-income enrollees who are not eligible for Medicaid fromseeking needed care. In addition, costs to states would increase because theirMedicaid programs pay the deductibles for Medicare enrollees who also re-ceive benefits under Medicaid.168 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-13-A SIMPLIFY AND LIMIT MEDICARE'S COST-SHARING REQUIREMENTS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 690 2001 1,1102002 1,0802003 5802004 520 3,980 RELATED OPTIONS : 570-13-B and 570-15 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Restructuring Health Insurance for Medicare Enrollees (Study), August 1991.Medicare's cost-sharing requirements in its fee-for-service sector are varied and difficult for beneficiaries to understand. Moreover, in contrast to most privateinsurance plans, Medicare places no limit on the cost-sharing expenses forwhich enrollees may be liable. As a result, most fee-for-service enrollees seeksupplementary coverage (either through their employers or by purchasing indi-vidual medigap plans) to protect them from the potentially catastrophic ex-penses they might be left with under Medicare. Those enrollees with thenearly first-dollar coverage that medigap plans provide no longer have financialincentives to use medical services prudently. Consequently, Medicare's costsare higher than they would be if there were no medigap supplements. Medicare could simplify and limit cost-sharing requirements in the fee- for-service sector while also reducing federal costs. For example, the currentcomplicated mix of cost-sharing requirements could be replaced with a singledeductible, a uniform coinsurance rate of 20 percent for amounts above thedeductible, and a cap on each beneficiary's total cost-sharing expenses\u2014 whether they arose from Part A or Part B of the Medicare program. If thoseprovisions were in place beginning in January 2000 with a deductible of $750and a cap on total cost sharing of $2000, federal savings would be $0.7 billionfor 2000, $4.0 billion over five years, and $8.2 billion over 10 years. Thoseestimates assume that both the deductible and the cap would be indexed togrowth in per capita benefits paid by Medicare. For three reasons, such changes in Medicare's cost-sharing requirements would increase the incentives for enrollees to use medical services prudently.First, because about 40 percent of the medigap plans purchased do not nowcover the deductible, more of the services used by those policyholders would beexempt from medigap coverage under Medicare's higher deductible. Second,over time, fewer enrollees would purchase medigap plans because their cost-sharing expenses would be capped under Medicare. Third, the uniform coinsur-ance rate on all services would encourage enrollees without supplementarycoverage to consider relative costs appropriately when choosing among alterna-tive treatments. Although this option would generally reduce out-of-pocket costs for en- rollees who had serious illnesses or were hospitalized during the year, it wouldincrease out-of-pocket costs for most enrollees. On average, enrollees' cost-sharing expenses under Medicare would increase by about $50 a year in 2000.Expenses would fall for about 10 percent of enrollees, rise for about 70 percent,and be unchanged for all others. The option would also introduce cost-sharingrequirements for services\u2014such as home health care\u2014that are not now subjectto them, increasing administrative costs for the affected providers.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 169 570-13-B RESTRICT MEDIGAP COVERAGE Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 2,600 2001 4,1502002 570-12, 570-13-A, 570-15, and 570-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Restructuring Health Insurance for Medicare Enrollees (Study), August 1991.Savings from option 570-13-A could be substantially increased by restricting or prohibiting medigap coverage in addition to changing Medicare's cost-sharingprovisions. Alternatively, some or all of the additional savings from restrictingmedigap coverage could be used to improve Medicare's coverage by reducingthe deductible or cap. If, for example, medigap plans were prohibited from covering any part of Medicare's new deductible (as discussed in option 570-13-A), savings would be$19.2 billion over five years and $46.2 b illion over 10 years. By raising Medicare's deductible and prohibiting medigap plans from covering it, theincentives for more prudent use of health care services would be appreciablystrengthened for enrollees who now have medigap plans. Those incentiveswould be still greater if medigap coverage was prohibited altogether. However,despite Medicare's new copayment cap, which would protect enrollees againstvery large cost-sharing expenses, some enrollees would object to any policythat denied them access to first-dollar coverage.170 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-14 COLLECT DEDUCTIBLE AND COINSURANCE AMOUNTS ON CLINICAL LABORATORY SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 590 2001 9902002 1,0502003 1,1302004 1,240 2005 2000-2004 5,000 2000-2009 13,330 : Mandatory RELATED OPTIONS : 570-12 and 570-15Medicare currently pays 100 percent of the approved fee for clinical laboratory services provided to enrollees. Medicare's payment is set by a fee schedule,and providers must accept that fee as full payment for the service. For mostother services provided under Medicare's S upplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program, beneficiaries are subject to both a deductible and a coinsurancerate of 20 percent. Imposing the SMI program's usual deductible and coinsurance require- ments on laboratory services would yield appreciable savings. If this policywas in place beginning on January 1, 2000, federal savings would be $590 million in 2000, $5.0 billion over five years, and $13.3 billion over 10 years. In addition to reducing Medicare's costs, this option would make cost- sharing requirements under the SMI program more uniform and therefore easierto understand. Moreover, enrollees might be somewhat less likely to undergolaboratory tests with little expected benefit if they paid part of those costs. However, enrollees' use of laboratory services would probably not be substantially affected because decisions about what tests are appropriate aregenerally left to physicians, whose judgments do not appear to depend on en-rollees' cost-sharing liabilities. Hence, the Congressional Bu dget Office as- sumes that a small part of the expected savings under this option would stemfrom more prudent use of laboratory services, but the greater part would reflectthe transfer to enrollees of costs now borne by Medicare. Billing costs forsome providers, such as independent laboratories, would be higher under theoption because they would have to bill both Medicare and enrollees to collecttheir full fees. (Currently, they have no need to bill enrollees directly for clini-cal laboratory services.) In addition, states' Medicaid costs would increase forenrollees who also received Medicaid benefits.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 171 570-15 IMPOSE A COPAYMENT REQUIREMENT ON HOME HEALTH VISITS UNDER MEDICARE Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) With $5 Copay- mentWith $10 Copay- : 570-12, 570-13-A, 570-13-B, and 570-14The use of home health services and the resulting costs are growing rapidly under Medicare. One reason for the unrestrained growth of such costs is thatthe services are free to enrollees\u2014enrollees are not currently required to payany portion of the cost of home health services under Medicare. If a copayment of $5 was required for each home health visit covered by Medicare beginning in January 2000, net federal savings would be $1.1 billionin 2000, $8.6 billion over five years, and $21.5 billion over 10 years. If the copayment was $10, five-year savings would be $15.5 billion and 10-yearsavings would be $39.2 billion. Those estimates assume that the copaymentwould be indexed to the consumer price index after 2000. This option would reduce Medicare's costs for home health care not only by shifting a small part of the cost per visit to users but also by reducing en-rollees' use of the service\u2014at least among the 15 percent of fee-for-serviceenrollees with no supplementary coverage for their cost-sharing expenses.However, little or no drop in use would be expected among the 85 percent ofenrollees who have either Medicaid, medigap, or employment-sponsored sup-plementary coverage. Further, the option would increase private insurancepremiums for the 35 percent of enrollees with medigap supplements, and itwould increase Medicaid program costs on behalf of the 15 percent of enrolleeswho also receive Medicaid benefits. Moreover, it would increase the risk ofvery large out-of-pocket costs for those with no supplementary coverage.172 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-16 PROHIBIT FIRST-DOLLAR COVERAGE UNDER MEDIGAP POLICIES Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 4,210 Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-13-B RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Restructuring Health Insurance for Medicare Enrollees (Study), August 1991.About 35 percent of Medicare's fee-for-service enrollees purchase individual supplementary private insurance (medigap coverage) that covers all or most ofthe cost-sharing that the Medicare program requires. On average, medigappolicyholders use at least 25 percent more services than they would if they didnot have first-dollar coverage. However, the federal government throughMedicare and not medigap insurers pays most of the costs of those additionalservices. Federal costs for Medicare could be reduced if medigap plans were pro- hibited from offering first-dollar coverage for Medicare's cost-sharing require-ments. If, for example, medigap plans were barred from paying any portion ofthe first $1,500 of an enrollee's cost-sharing liabilities for calendar year 2000,use of medical services by medigap policyholders would fall and federal sav-ings in 2000 would total $4.2 billion. Assuming that the medigap limit waslinked to growth in the average value of Medicare's costs for later years, sav-ings over the 2000-2004 period would total $33.6 billion. Over 10 years, sav-ings would total $85.6 billion. Only enrollees who have medigap policies would be directly affected by this option, and most of them would be financially better off under it. Becausetheir medigap premiums would decrease more than their out-of-pocket liabili-ties would increase, most medigap enrollees would have lower yearly expensesunder this approach. Indirectly, all enrollees might be better off because Medi-care's premiums would be lower than under current law. Medigap policyholders, however, would have to assume a higher level of financial risk for Medicare-covered services than they do now. Because theymight feel more uncertain about their expenses, some policyholders might ob-ject to eliminating their option to purchase first-dollar coverage, even if in mostyears they would be financially better off. Moreover, in any given year, abouta quarter of people with medigap policies would actually incur higher expensesunder this option, and those with expensive chronic conditions might be worseoff year after year. Finally, the decrease in use of services by medigap policy-holders that would generate federal savings under this option might not belimited to unnecessary care, so the health of some of them might be adverselyaffected.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 173 570-17 INCREASE THE PREMIUM FOR PHYSICIANS' SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE TO 30 PERCENT OF PROGRAM COSTS Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 2,950 2001 Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 570-18Benefits under Medicare's Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program are partially funded by monthly premiums paid by enrollees, with the remainderfunded by general revenues. Although the SMI premium was initially intendedto cover 50 percent of the cost of benefits, premium receipts between 1975 and1983 covered a declining share of SMI costs\u2014falling from 50 percent to lessthan 25 percent. That drop occurred because premium increases were limitedby the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits (which isbased on the consumer price index), but the per capita cost of the SMI programrose faster. Since 1984, premiums have been set to cover about 25 percent ofaverage benefits for an aged enrollee, a provision that was made permanent inthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997. If the SMI premium was set to cover 30 percent of costs for 2000 and all years thereafter, outlay savings would be $3.0 billion in 2000, $23.1 billionover five years, and $61.7 billion over 10 years. The premium for 2000 wouldbe $59.40 a month instead of $49.50. Those estimates assume a continuationof the current hold-harmless provision, which ensures that no enrollee's monthlySocial Security benefit will fall as a result of the Social Security COLA (whichis based on the whole benefit) being smaller than the SMI premium increase. Most SMI enrollees would pay a little more under this option, in contrast to proposals\u2014such as increasing cost-sharing requirements\u2014that could sub-stantially raise the out-of-pocket costs of those who become seriously ill. Thisoption need not affect enrollees with income below 120 percent of the federalpoverty threshold because all of them are eligible to have Medicaid pay theirMedicare premiums. (Some people who are eligible for Medicaid do not applyfor benefits, however.) Low-income enrollees who are not eligible for Medicaid could find the increased premium burdensome. A few might drop SMI coverage and either dowithout care or turn to sources of free or reduced-cost care, which could in-crease demands on local governments. In addition, states' expenditures wouldrise because states would pay part of the higher premium costs for thoseMedicare enrollees who also receive Medicaid benefits.174 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-18 TIE THE PREMIUM FOR PHYSICIANS' SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE TO ENROLLEES' INCOME Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 400 2001 1,3902002 RELATED OPTIONS : 570-17 and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Staff Working Paper), October 1988.

Forexample, people with modified adjusted gross income of less than $50,000 andcouples with income lower than $75,000 would pay only the basic premium, setat 25 percent of SMI costs per aged enrollee. Premiums would rise progres-sively for higher-income enrollees, however. The maximum total premiumwould be set to cover 50 percent of costs for people with income ex ceeding $100,000 and for c ouples with income exceeding $150,000. The income- related premiums would have to be collected through the income tax system sothat rates could be aligned with income. Current premiums are deducted auto-matically from Social Security checks for most enrollees. If this option was in place in calendar year 2000, savings would total $400 million in fiscal year 2000, $7.5 billion over five years, and $26.0 billionover 10 years. Those estimates assume that the current hold-harmless provi-sions would continue only for people subject to the basic 25 percent premium.(The hold-harmless provisions ensure that no enrollee's Social Security checkwill decrease because an increase in the SMI premium exceeds the cost-of-living adjustment.) Most SMI enrollees would be unaffected by tying a portion of the pro- gram's premium to income. Roughly 88 percent of enrollees would face thebasic 25 percent premium, about 3 percent would pay the maximum premium,and 9 percent would pay a premium somewhere in between. Enrollees subject to the income-related premium would pay substantially more, however. The maximum monthly premium for 2000 would be $99.00instead of the $49.50 premium projected under current law. That increase might lead some enrollees to drop out, although it is estimated that fewer than0.5 percent would do so. Those with retirement health plans that do not requireMedicare enrollment (mainly, retired government employees) would be mostlikely to drop out. Some healthy enrollees who have no other source of healthinsurance might do so as well, if they were not averse to the risk that they mightincur large health care costs.FUNCTION 570 MEDICARE 175 570-19-A INCREASE MEDICARE'S AGE OF ELIGIBILITY TO MATCH SOCIAL SECURITY'S NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 0 2001 02002 02003 4102004 RELATED OPTIONS : 570-19-B and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Long-Term Budgetary Pressures and Policy Options (Report), May 1998, Chapter 4.Under current law, the normal retirement age (NRA) for Social Security will gradually increase from 65 to 67 in the first quarter of the next century. How-ever, eligibility for Medicare based on age will remain at 65. Because the twoprograms affect the same population and because eligibility is based on thesame work history, some people have argued that the age requirements shouldbe the same. If the age at which a person became eligible for Medicare was raised in step with increases in the NRA for Social Security, the first c ohort to be af- fected would be people who turned 65 in 2003\u2014for that group, eligibility forMedicare would be delayed by two months. The age of eligibility would beincreased by an additional two months each year through 2008 and then remainat 66 for 12 years. Beginning in 2020, the age of eligibility would again in-crease by two months a year until it reached 67 in 2025. Under that option,federal budget savings would total $410 million in 2003, $1.5 billion through2004, and $23.0 billion through 2009. Reduced spending for Medicare wouldbe partially offset by increased spending under Medicaid, the Federal Employ-ees Health Benefits program, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program ofthe Uniformed Services (reflected in the savings estimates). In addition, off-budget outlays for Social Security would fall by $6.8 billion over the 10-yearperiod because some people who were affected would delay retirement. (Thatdrop in costs is not reflected in the estimates.) The same reasons that have been used to justify increasing the NRA for Social Security apply to this option as well. Life expectancy has increasedsubstantially since Social Security and Medicare began, and a majority ofworkers now live well beyond the age of eligibility. When Social Security wasestablished in 1935, aver age life expectancy at birth was less than 65 years; now average life expectancy is greater than 75 years. Unless changes are madein those programs, longer expected lifetimes, together with the population bulgeof the baby- boom generation, will increase costs enormously under Social Security and Medicare after 2010. Only three general options for change areavailable: reduce the number of people eligible for benefits, reduce benefits pereligible person, or increase taxes. As a practical matter, it is likely that allthree options will be called into play. However, about 70 percent of Social Security beneficiaries retire before the normal retirement age\u2014generally at Social Security's early retirement ageof 62, which entitles them to benefits at a reduced level. Increasing Medicare'sage of eligibility would also raise the number of years during which early re-tirees would be at risk of having no health insurance\u2014just when their need forhealth care would be expected to increase significantly and their access to pri-vate individual insurance would be limited.176 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 570-19-B PERMIT EARLY BUY-IN TO MEDICARE ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NORMAL AGE OF ELIGIBILITY Outlay Savings (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 -40 2001 -3402002 -3702003 02004 RELATED OPTIONS : 570-19-A and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for FiscalYear 1999 (Report), March 1998, Appendix B. Long-Term Budgetary Pressures and Policy Options (Report), May 1998, Chapter 4.One way to alleviate the problem that early retirees may have in continuing health insurance coverage until they are eligible for Medicare would be to intro-duce an early age of eligibility (62) for nondisabled retirees. (Disabled peopleare already eligible for Medicare regardless of their age.) That change wouldmake the conditions for age-based eligibility under Medicare wholly consistentwith those for Social Security. Allowing people to \"buy in\" to Medicare at age 62 beginning in January 2000, together with the gradual move to a later normal age of eligibility (67),described in option 570-19-A, would increase federal costs by $0.1 billion overthe 2000-2004 period but then r educe costs by $17.8 billion through 2009. Social Security costs would also increase in the early years when only the buy-inwas in place, but (off-budget) savings would occur after 2004 as delays in re-tirement due to the increase in the eligibility age for Medicare more than offsetearlier retirement among those taking advantage of the buy-in option. Thoseestimates assume that people who used the early buy-in option would pay anactuarially fair premium for their age group during the buy-in years. The esti-mates also assume that once buy-in participants reached the normal age of eligi-bility, they would pay a premium surcharge to compensate for any excess costsincurred during their buy-in years. (Buy-in participants are likely to be morecostly to Medicare than the average person in their age group.)1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999050100150200250Outlays in Billions of Dollars DiscretionaryMandatory600 Income Security Budget function 600 covers federal income-security programs that provide cash or in-kind bene- fits to individuals.

Discretionary budget authority of $33 billion was provided for the function in 1999.Over the past 10 years, outlays under function 600 have grown slightly as a share of federalspending, from just under 12 percent to just under 14 percent.178 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-01 END TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 250 185 2001 305 2802002 310 3102003 315 3152004 320 320 2005 330 330 2006 335 3352007 340 3402008 350 3502009 360 360 Cumulative 2000-2009 3,215 3,125 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program offers income-replacement benefits, training, and related services to workers who are unemployed as a result of import competition. To obtain assistance, such workers must petitionthe Secretary of Labor for certification and then meet other eligibility require-ments. Cash benefits are available to certified workers receiving training, butonly after their unemployment insurance benefits are exhausted. Authorizationfor the program expired on October 1, 1998, and was subsequently extendedfor nine months by the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency SupplementalAppropriations Act of 1998. Ending the TAA program would reduce federal outlays by about $200 million in 2000 and by $3.1 billion during the 2000- 2009 peri od. Affected workers could apply for benefits under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998(WIA), which authorizes a broad range of employment and training services fordisplaced workers regardless of the cause of their job loss. (Because fundingfor WIA is limited, however, TAA cash benefits alone could be eliminated, andthe remaining TAA funds for training and related services could be shifted toWIA. Doing so would reduce the total savings by about one-quarter during the10-year period.) The rationale for this option is to secure under federal programs more equivalent treatment of workers who are permanently displaced as a result ofchanging economic conditions. Since WIA provides cash benefits only underlimited circumstances, workers who lose jobs because of foreign competitionare now treated more generously than workers who are displaced for otherreasons. Eliminating TAA cash benefits would, however, cause economic hardship for some of the long-term unemployed who would have received them. In addi-tion, TAA now compensates some of the workers adversely affected by changesin trade policy. Some people argue, therefore, that eliminating TAA benefitscould lessen political support for free trade, which economists generally viewas beneficial to the overall economy.FUNCTION 600 INCOME SECURITY 179 600-02 END THE EXPANSION OF PROGRAMS FOR BUILDING NEW HOUSING UNITS FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLEDPEOPLE Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 854 0 2001 854 102002 854 1202003 854 3102004 854 540 2005 854 710 2006 854 7602007 854 8002008 854 2000-2004 4,270 980 2000-2009 8,540 4,940 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-06Since the early 1980s, federal activities to provide rental subsidies for low- income people have shifted sharply from constructing low-income housing tousing less costly existing housing subsidized with vo uchers and certificates. Two construction programs under which new commitments are still being madeare the Section 202 and Section 811 programs for elderly and disabled people,respectively. For 1999, $854 million was appropriated to construct up to 9,900new units and subsidize their operating costs. (The appropriation allows asmuch as $48 million of those funds to be used for vouchers for disabled peo-ple.) Eliminating funding for additional new units under those programs would reduce outlays by $4.9 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Initially, savings inoutlays would be substantially smaller than savings in budget authority becauseof the long lags involved in building new projects and thus in spending autho-rized funds. Proponents of this option see little need to subsidize any new construction. The overwhelming housing problem today, they argue, is not a shortage ofrental units but the inability of low-income households to afford those that exist. For example, average overall annual vacancy rates have consistentlyexceeded 7 percent since 1986. In any event, if elderly and disabled peopleneed more housing assistance, it could be provided less expensively throughvouchers or certificates. Opponents of the option argue that national statistics on the supply of rental units mask local shortages of certain types of units. In particular, manyhouseholds with an elderly or disabled person need housing that can providespecial social and physical services that are not generally available. Peoplewho support subsidized construction of units for low-income elderly and dis-abled households also maintain that the high cost of producing such units re-quires the certainty of a guaranteed stream of income that only project-basedsubsidies can provide.180 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-03 INCREASE PAYMENTS BY TENANTS IN FEDERALLY ASSISTED HOUSING Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 300 160 2001 610 4902002 970 8502003 1,350 1,2202004 1,680 DiscretionaryMost lower-income renters who receive federal rental assistance are aided through various Section 8 programs or the public housing program, all of whichare administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD). Those programs usually pay the difference between 30 percent of ahousehold's income after certain adjustments and either the actual cost of thedwelling or a payment standard. In 1998, the average federal expenditure perassisted household for all of HUD's rental housing programs combined wasroughly $5,100. That amount includes both housing subsidies and fees paid toadministering agencies. This option would increase tenants' rent contributions over a five-year period from 30 percent to 35 percent of their adjusted income. Budgetary sav-ings would total $14.2 billion over the 2000-2009 period, including $10.5 bil-lion for Section 8 programs and $3.7 billion for public housing. (Those esti- mates are based on the assumption that the Congress will provide budget au-thority to extend the life of all commitments for housing aid that are due toexpire during the 2000-2009 period.) To diminish or eliminate the impact ofthis change on assisted tenants, state governments\u2014which currently contributeno funds toward the federal rental assistance programs\u2014could be encouragedto make up some or all of the decreased federal support. One rationale for directly involving states in housing assist ance is that those programs generate substantial local benefits, such as improved quality ofthe housing stock. If all states paid 5 percent of the adjusted income of thosetenants receiving assistance, housing costs for assisted families would not rise.Moreover, since eligibility for housing aid is determined by each area's medianincome, tying states' contributions to renters' incomes would ensure that lower-income states would pay less per assisted family than would higher-incomestates. Finally, if a state chose not to participate and consequently rent pay-ments by its households increased to 35 percent of adjusted income, those out-of-pocket costs would still be well below the nearly 50 percent of income paidby the typical unassisted renter who is eligible for assistance. Because not all states might make up the reduction in federal assistance, housing costs could increase for some current recipients of aid, who generallyhave very low incomes. This option could also cause some higher-incomerenters in assisted housing projects to move to unassisted housing because itmight now cost less to rent. As those tenants were replaced by new ones withlower income, the concentration of families with very low income in thoseprojects would increase. In turn, the savings from this option could decreasesomewhat.FUNCTION 600 INCOME SECURITY 181 600-04 REDUCE RENT SUBSIDIES TO CERTAIN ONE-PERSON HOUSEHOLDS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 30 20 2001 70 502002 100 802003 130 1102004 160 150 2005 200 180 2006 230 2102007 260 2402008 280 2602009 270 290 Cumulative 2000-2004 490 410 2000-2009 1,730 1,580 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryGenerally, recipients of federal housing aid live in housing units that are specif- ically designated for use by federally assisted tenants or rent units of their ownchoosing in the private rental market. Support for that second type of aid comesin the form of Section 8 certificates and vouchers, which generally reduce whatrecipients spend for housing to 30 percent of their income. Starting in 2000, thecertificate and voucher programs will be combined into one program that willpay the difference between 30 percent of a tenant's income and the lesser of thetenant's actual housing cost or a payment standard determined by local rentallevels. The payment standard and the amount of the federal subsidy both vary according to the type of unit in which the tenant resides. One-person house-holds may generally reside in apartments with up to one bedroom, whereaslarger households may reside in larger units. Linking the rent subsidy for anewly assisted one-person household (or a currently assisted household thatmoves to another housing unit) to the cost of an efficiency apartment rather thana one-bedroom apartment would save $20 million in federal outlays in 2000and nearly $1.6 billion over the 2000-2009 period. The Administration in- cluded this option in its 1999 budgetary proposals. An argument in favor of this option is that an efficiency unit would pro- vide adequate living space for a person who lived alone. An argument againstthe option is that individuals in some areas might have difficulty finding suit-able housing under this new rule and as a result might have to spend more than30 percent of their income to pay for available housing.182 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-05 STOP EXPANSION OF THE NUMBER OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE COMMITMENTS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 283 20 2001 570 2102002 870 6702003 1,170 1,0802004 : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 370-06Each year between 1975 and 1995, and again in 1999, the Congress expanded the stock of Section 8 certificates and vouchers to increase the number of low-income renters who receive housing aid. Those forms of housing assistanceprovide subsidies that allow recipients to live in private housing of their ownchoosing, provided the units meet certain standards. At the end of 1998, a totalof about 1.5 million commitments for rental assistance were outstanding in bothprograms, at a total cost of about $7.9 billion in that year. For 1999, the Con-gress authorized $283 million to fund an additional 50,000 vouchers, and theCongressional Budget Office's baseline assumes that this amount of funding fornew units will also be appropriated for each year in the future. Stopping expansion of the number of rental assistance commitments would reduce federal outlays by $15.2 billion over the 2000-2009 period.(That estimate is based on the additional assumption that the Congress willprovide budget authority to extend the life of all vouchers and certificates thatare due to expire over the 2000-2009 period.) An argument in favor of this option is that expanding rental assistance programs is inappropriate in light of the cutbacks that have occurred in otherareas of federal spending. Furthermore, existing commitments will continue toassist many new eligible households each year because of turnover amongassisted renters. In addition, no current recipients would lose their housingassistance as a result of this option. An argument against the option is that less than one-third of eligible rent- ers actually receive housing assistance. If the number of commitments wasfrozen, the proportion of eligible renters receiving aid would fall because ofcontinued growth in the number of eligible households. As a result, the numberof eligible households with one or more housing problems\u2014such as paying arelatively large share of income for rent or living in a physically inadequate orcrowded dwelling\u2014would probably increase.FUNCTION 600 INCOME SECURITY 183 600-06 REDUCE FUNDING FOR EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING IN THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 116 95 2001 175 1382002 122 1472003 116 1292004 115 125 2005 115 125 2006 110 1102007 110 1102008 110 1102009 109 109 Cumulative 2000-2004 644 634 2000-2009 1,198 1,198 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 600-07The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) established a new work and training requirement for certain foodstamp recipients. The act limited food stamp eligibility to a maximum of threemonths in any 36-month period for adults not engaged in work or job trainingwho are able-bodied, are between the ages of 18 and 50, and have no dependentchildren. Under PRWORA, the requirement applies unless the Secretary ofAgriculture waives it for a locale because of a high level of unemployment orinsufficient job opportunities. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) provided certain exemptions from the PRWORA work/training requirement as well as $600 million to fundnew work/training program slots. The Agricultural Research, Extension, andEducation Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-185) reduced work/training funds by$100 million in 1999 and $45 million in 2000. This option would eliminate the remaining funds for work/training slots under the BBA. It would also provide additional savings in the Food Stampprogram derived from not paying benefits to the people who would have occu-pied the canceled slots. (When the Congressional Budget Office estimated thecost of P.L. 105-185, it estimated savings of $200 million.) In total, CBOestimates that the option would reduce outlays by $95 million in 2000 andabout $1.2 billion for the 2000-2009 period. An argument for eliminating the remaining work/training funds provided under the BBA is that states have not been using all of the funds allotted tothem. States receive basic federal funding for employment and training of foodstamp recipients under the Food Stamps Act of 1985, and those funds can beused for able-bodied adults without dependent children. People facing the work/training requirement under PRWORA can also apply to other programsthat operate independently of the Food Stamp program. States with economi-cally distressed areas, which might have fewer alternative work/training oppor-tunities than more prosperous locales, can also apply for waivers from thePRWORA requirement. An argument against this option is that the unspent funds are not necessar- ily evidence of a lack of need. States have had little time to develop the work/training programs that the BBA authorizes. Such programs must be targetedprimarily at able-bodied adults without dependent children and may not simplysubstitute for state-funded programs. To ensure that BBA funds are spent onnew work/training efforts, the act requires states to maintain their 1996 state spending levels for work/training programs in order to collect the BBA funds.Another argument for maintaining the funds available under the BBA is that they offer some flexibility because they do not have to be spent in a particularfiscal year. The funds may be carried over and redistributed by the Secretaryof Agriculture among the states on the basis of year-to-year changes in thedistribution of covered individuals.184 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-07 REDUCE THE EXEMPTIONS FROM EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 30 30 2001 30 302002 35 352003 35 352004 35 35 2005 35 35 2006 35 352007 40 402008 40 402009 40 40 Cumulative 2000-2004 165 165 2000-2009 355 355 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 600-06The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) is intended to encourage people to work or pursue job training.Thus, the act restricts food stamp eligibility to a maximum of three months inany 36-month period for able-bodied adults not engaged in work or trainingwho are 18 to 50 years of age and have no dependent children\u2014unless theSecretary of Agriculture has waived the work/training requirement for theirlocale. Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), however, states mayexempt from the requirement up to 15 percent of such able-bodied food stamprecipients. This option would eliminate the 15 percent exemption to the PRWORA work/training requirement, which the Congressional Budget Office estimateswould reduce outlays by $30 million in 2000 and $355 million for the 2000-2009 period. The BBA exemption allows states to use different food stamp eligibility rules for different childless adults. Eliminating the exemption would requirestates to use the same eligibility criteria for all 18- to 50-year-old able-bodiedpeople with no dependent children who live in a particular local area. An argu-ment against this option is that the exemption provides a safety net for a needypopulation that can be difficult to serve.FUNCTION 600 INCOME SECURITY 185 600-08 REDUCE THE $20 UNEARNED INCOME EXCLUSION UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 60 60 2001 125 1252002 125 1252003 125 1252004 130 130 2005 140 140 2006 125 1252007 115 1152008 130 2000-2009 1,210 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 600-09The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides federally funded monthly cash payments\u2014based on uniform, nationwide eligibility rules\u2014tolow-income elderly and disabled people. In addition, most states provide sup-plemental payments. Because SSI is a means-tested program, recipients' out-side income reduces their SSI benefits, subject to certain exclusions. For un-earned income, most of which is Social Security, $20 a month is excluded;benefits are reduced dollar for dollar for unearned income above that amount.The program allows a more liberal exclusion for earned income in order tomaintain work incentives. This option would reduce the monthly $20 unearned income exclusion to $15. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the savings from thatchange would be $60 million in 2 000 and $1.2 billion over the 2000-2009 period. A program that ensures a minimum living standard for its recipients need not provide a higher standard for people who happen to have unearned income.Nevertheless, reducing the monthly $20 exclusion by $5 would decrease by asmuch as $60 a year the incomes of the roughly 2.5 million low-income people(approximately 40 percent of all federal SSI recipients) who would benefit fromthe exclusion in 2000. Even with the full $20 exclusion, the incomes of mostSSI recipients fall below the poverty threshold.186 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-09 CREATE A SLIDING SCALE FOR CHILDREN'S SSI BENEFITS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS IN A FAMILY Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 50 502002 120 1202003 120 1202004 130 130 2005 160 160 2006 140 1402007 140 1402008 170 1702009 180 180 Cumulative 2000-2004 420 420 2000-2009 1,210 1,210 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 600-08The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides cash payments \u2014based on uniform, nationwide eligibility rules\u2014to elderly and disabled peoplewith low incomes. In addition, most states provide s upplemental payments to SSI recipients. In 1997, children received approximately $5 billion in federalSSI benefits, accounting for almost one-quarter of federal SSI benefits paid todisabled recipients that year. Unlike other means-tested benefits, the amount of the SSI benefit for an additional child does not decline as the number of SSI recipients in a familyincreases. In 1999, a family with one child qualifying for SSI benefits couldreceive up to $500 a month, or $6,000 a year, if the family's income (excludingSSI benefits) was under the cap for the maximum benefit. If the fa mily had additional eligible children, it could have received an additional $500 a monthfor each one. (A child's benefit is based only on the presence of a disability andthe family's resources, not on the nature or severity of the qualifying disability oron participation by other family members in the SSI program.) This option would create a sliding scale for SSI disability benefits, so that a family would receive smaller benefits per child as the number of children re-ceiving SSI increased. The sliding scale used for this option was recommendedby the National Commission on Childhood Disability in 1995. It would keep themaximum benefit for one child as it is in current law but reduce additional bene-fits for additional recipient children in the same family. If that sliding scale wasin place in 1999, the first child in a family qualifying for the maximum benefitwould receive $500, the second child would receive $312 (38 percent less), andthe third would receive $267 (47 percent less). Benefits would continue to de-crease for additional children. About 90 percent of child recipients would beunaffected by the new scale, and the remaining 10 percent would have their bene-fits reduced by about one-fourth, on average. As with current SSI benefits, thesliding scale would be adjusted each year to reflect changes in the consumer priceindex. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that this option would not be implemented until 2001, because the Social Security Administration does notmaintain data on multiple SSI recipients in a family and implementation of thesliding scale would therefore require significant effort. Savings from this optionwould total $50 million in 2001 and $1.21 billion over the 2001-2009 period. Proponents of this option argue that the proposed reductions in benefits reflect economies of scale that generally affect the cost of living for families withmore than one child. Proponents might also note that the high medical costs thatdisabled children often incur, which would not be subject to economies of scale,would continue to be covered because SSI participants generally are covered byMedicaid. Still, opponents could argue that children with disabilities sometimeshave unique needs that may not be covered by Medicaid, including housingmodifications and specialized equipment. With the proposed drop in benefits,some families might be unable to meet such needs.FUNCTION 600 INCOME SECURITY 187 600-10 REDUCE THE FEDERAL MATCHING RATE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE CHILD SUPPORTENFORCEMENT PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 850 850 2001 930 9302002 1,050 1,0502003 1,150 1,1502004 1,250 1,250 2005 Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 600-11The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, enacted in 1975, assists states in their effort to improve the payment of child support by noncustodial parents.The federal government pays 66 percent of the program's administrative costs,provides incentive payments, and allows states to retain some of the money theycollect. This option would reduce the federal share of administrative costs from 66 percent to 50 percent. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that lower-ing the federal matching rate could save $850 million in 2000 and $12.9 billionthrough 2009. Several arguments can be made for shifting greater responsibility for CSE administrative costs to the states. For one thing, it would encourage states tomake their CSE efforts more efficient because states would be paying a largershare of the costs of any inefficiencies. Moreover, it would bring the federalshare of CSE administrative costs more in line with the share of such costs thatthe federal government bears in comparable programs. Lowering the matching rate would entail some risks, however. Because caseloads for child support workers are already high, states are not likely to beable to improve the program's efficiency enough to offset the reduction in fed-eral payments. As a result, states might cut their CSE services, and child sup-port collections might drop. A reduction in collections could also mean higherstate costs for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) because statecollections of child support partly offset states' TANF benefit payments. Statesmight respond to their greater share of the costs by reducing their benefits andservices for needy families. Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, reductions in federal funding for certain entitlement grant programs\u2014including the Child SupportEnforcement program\u2014are considered mandates on state governments if thestates lack authority to amend their programmatic or financial responsibilitiesto offset the loss of funding. Because some states may not have sufficient flexi-bility within the CSE program to make such changes, this option could consti-tute an unfunded mandate on those jurisdictions under the law.188 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-11 REPEAL THE HOLD-HARMLESS PROVISION FOR STATE COLLECTIONS IN THE CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENTPROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 50 50 2001 50 502002 45 452003 45 452004 40 40 2005 35 35 2006 30 302007 25 252008 20 202009 15 15 Cumulative 2000-2004 230 230 2000-2009 355 355 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 600-10Enacted in 1975, the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program assists states' efforts to improve the payment of child support by noncustodial parents. Inaddition to providing funds for CSE administration and incentive payments, thefederal government allows states to keep a portion of their collections. Underthe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996(PRWORA), which provides block grants to states for Temporary Assistancefor Needy Families (TANF), a state can retain a portion of the child support itcollects for TANF recipients. The act allows the state to keep an amount equalto the state's matching rate for other federal programs or the amount that thestate retained in 1995, whichever is greater. This option would repeal the \"hold-harmless\" provision in PRWORA that allows a state to keep the amount of its 1995 CSE collections for TANF fami-lies, even if the state collects less than the 1995 amount. The CongressionalBudget Office estimates that eliminating that provision would reduce outlays by$50 million in 2000 and by $355 million in 2000 to 2009. Eliminating the hold-harmless provision could elicit different reactions from the states. Because it would tie the amounts retained by states from CSEcollections more closely to what they actually collected, this option could in-duce states to expand their CSE efforts and thus raise their total collections forTANF families. But states that did not reach their 1995 CSE collection levelswould have less funding available, which could cause them to reduce theirbenefits and services for needy families. Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, reductions in federal funding for certain entitlement grant programs\u2014including the CSE program\u2014are considered mandates on state governments if the states lack authority toamend their programmatic or financial responsibilities to offset the loss offunding. Because some states may not have sufficient flexibility within theCSE program to make such changes, this option could constitute an unfundedfederal mandate on those jurisdictions under the law.FUNCTION 600 INCOME SECURITY 189 600-12 REDUCE TANF BLOCK GRANTS TO STATES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 819 35 2001 819 352002 819 852003 819 952004 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryUnder the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), the federal government provides block grants to states forTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The amounts of the blockgrants are based on spending levels for three programs that PRWORA repealedand TANF replaces: Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Emer-gency Assistance for Needy Families, and the Job Opportunities and BasicSkills (JOBS) training program. To receive TANF funds, a state must spendfrom its own funds a predetermined \"maintenance-of-effort\" amount based onits pre-TANF spending. In addition, the state must maintain minimum workparticipation rates for recipient families, require parents and caretaker recipi-ents to engage in work activities after receiving no more than 24 months ofTANF benefits (with some exemptions), and impose a five-year limit on receiptof federally funded TANF benefits. Currently, the Congress has authorized$16.5 billion annually for TANF through 2002. This option would reduce the TANF block grants to states by 5 percent, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would reduce budget author-ity by $819 million and outlays by $35 million in 2000. For 2000 to 2009, CBO estimates that this option would reduce budget authority by $8.1 billionand outlays by $1.5 billion. Budget authority is projected to fall by less than the full 5 percent reduc- tion in the TANF block grant because of the increase in spending for foodstamps that would occur when TANF benefits were reduced. Outlays wouldfall by less than the reduction in budget authority because caseloads in theAFDC and TANF programs have declined significantly over the past five yearsand many states have been accumulating TANF budget authority from theircurrent annual block grants. The cut in budget authority would result in loweroutlays only after a state had depleted its stored budget authority. An argument for reducing the TANF block grants is that most states need much less money for their programs than legislators expected when PRWORAwas enacted. An argument against the cut is that it would reduce federal spend-ing immediately in several states that have been exhausting their TANF blockgrants, which could cause those states to cut their TANF benefits and services.In addition, reducing federal funding could be viewed as an abr ogation of a prior agreement between the federal and state governments and could makefuture agreements on block grants more difficult.190 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-13 REDUCE FUNDING FOR THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 110 83 2001 110 1082002 110 1102003 110 1102004 110 110 2005 110 110 2006 110 1102007 110 1102008 110 1102009 110 110 Cumulative 2000-2004 550 521 2000-2009 1,100 1,071 SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps some low-income households pay their home energy costs. Authorized by the Omni-bus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 and distributed through block grants tothe states, LIHEAP funding is $1.1 billion in 1999. States may use the grantsto help eligible households pay home heating or cooling bills, provide energy\"crisis intervention\" for those in immediate need, and fund low-cost weatheri-zation projects. Additionally, the LIHEAP appropriation includes $300 millionfor energy emergencies designated by the President. Households may be eligible for the program if they receive assist ance under certain means-tested programs or if their income is sufficiently low.Eligibility requirements are set by the states within federal guidelines. Forexample, the states may give preference to households with the highest energycosts (relative to income). Cutting LIHEAP funding by 10 percent would save nearly $1.1 billion in federal outlays during the 2000-2009 period. One way of achieving that reduc-tion in spending would be for states to forgo weatherization spending, whichincludes funds for new windows, doors, and furnaces that reduce future energyuse. In 1995, states spent an average of just over 10 percent of their LIHEAPblock grants for weatherization. Currently, states can spend up to 15 percent oftheir grant funds for weatherization, with the option of obtaining a waiver thatallows expenditures of as much as 25 percent. Each year between 1995 and1998, five states on average received that type of waiver. An argument in favor of reducing LIHEAP funding is that the program was created in response to rapid increases in the price of home energy sourcesin the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since 1981, however, real energy prices(adjusted for inflation) have decreased by about one-quarter. In addition, thesmall number of waivers that states have obtained to increase weatherizationspending supports the claim that most do not regard weatherization as a priorityfor LIHEAP funds. The federal government already provides similar assistancethrough the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Weatherization Assistance forLow-Income Persons, which has an appropriation of $133 million in 1999 andserved over 63,000 households in 1998. An argument against reducing LIHEAP funding is that spending for the program has already declined. In real terms, its 1999 appropriation is abouthalf of its first appropriation. From 1 981 to 1995, the percentage of eligible households receiving assistance dropped from 36 percent to 19 percent. More-over, many communities have yearlong waiting lists for assistance from DOE'sweatherization program, making it unlikely that the DOE program would beable to make up for LIHEAP's decreased coverage. In add ition, it would be impossible for all of the states to limit cuts in funding to weatherization assis-tance. In 1995, six states did not fund any weatherization projects. To complywith this option, those six states and others that use less than 10 percent of theirgrant funds for weatherization would have to cut their basic LIHEAP spending.FUNCTION 600 INCOME SECURITY 191 600-14-A DEFER COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENTS FOR CSRS ANNUITANTS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 370 370 2001 520 5202002 460 4602003 560 5602004 720 720 2005 600-14-C, 600-15, 600-16, and 600-17 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998. Federal civilian and military retirement programs cover about 4.2 million active employees and 4.3 million retirees and survivors. F ederal pension payments totaled $75 billion in 1998. Civilian workers covered by the Civil ServiceRetirement System (CSRS), which covers most civilian employees hired beforeJanuary 1, 1984, receive full cost-of-living-adjustments (COLAs), as do mili-tary personnel hired before August 1, 1986. Civilian employees and militarypersonnel hired after those dates receive less generous protection from inflation.Employees covered by the post-1983 civilian plan, the Federal EmployeesRetirement System (FERS), receive a so-called diet-COLA, generally 1 per-centage point less than inflation. Moreover, COLAs are generally paid only toFERS retirees who are age 62 and older. Military personnel covered by thepost-1986 pension provisions also receive COLAs that are a percentage pointless than inflation. At age 62, those military retirees will receive a one-timeadjustment to their pensions, increasing them to the amount that would havebeen payable had full COLAs been in effect. This option and options 600-14-B and 600-14-C illustrate three basic approaches to reducing the cost of COLAs: deferring adjustments for inflation,limiting the size of those adjustments, and reducing adjustments for middle- andhigh-income retirees. All three options would still leave federal retirees withbetter protection against inflation than most retirees with private-sector pen-sions. However, as with any cut in benefits, those reductions could make re-cruitment and retention harder for both federal civilian programs and the mili-tary services. Deferring COLAs until age 62 for all nondisabled civilian employees who retired before that age would yield savings in direct spending of $370 million in2000, $2.6 billion over five years, and $9 billion over 10 years. Consistentwith the military retirement system, this option allows a catch-up adjustment atage 62 that reflects inflation after the date of retirement. Under the COLA-deferral approach, a CSRS-covered annuitant retiring at age 55 with an averageannuity of $25,000 in 1998 would lose $18,000 over seven years. No estimateof this option is provided for the military. Extending the COLA deferral tomilitary retirees, who are generally forced to retire after 20 to 30 years of ser-vice, would probably be too onerous. Deferring COLAs would align COLA practices for CSRS with those under FERS and encourage federal employees to work longer. A major disad-vantage of this option is that for current retirees or those nearing retirement, itcould be regarded as a revocation of earned retirement benefits. In addition,although CSRS benefits are more generous than those typically offered byprivate employers, they fall short of those offered by many large private firms,which compete directly with the federal government in labor markets. More-over, because CSRS benefits are already less generous than those availableunder FERS, this option would worsen the disparity between the government'scivilian retirement plans.192 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-14-B LIMIT SOME COLAs FOR FEDERAL RETIREES Savings (Millions of dollars) Civilian Military Annual 2000 170 560 2001 390 9102002 630 1,2602003 880 600-14-C, 600-15, 600-16, and 600-17 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.Another way to reduce the cost of protecting retired federal workers from infla- tion would be to widely apply the so-called diet-COLAs (cost-of-living adjust-ments) provided under the Federal Employees Retirement System, or FERS, andthe post-1986 M ilitary Retirement System, or MRS. That option would limit COLAs for pre-1986 MRS retirees to 1 percentage point below the rate of infla-tion. For annuitants under the Civil Service Retirement System, or CSRS,COLAs would be restricted to half a percentage point below inflation. More-over, when inflation fell below 3 percent, FERS retirees would receive a COLAequaling the rate of inflation less a percentage point. The smaller one-half pointreduction for CSRS retirees would produce a cut roughly comparable to the1 percentage-point limit for MRS and FERS enrollees because MRS and FERSenrollees are also covered by Social Security. Savings in direct spending for civilian pensions would amount to $170 million in 2000, $3.2 billion over five years, and $13.1 billion over 10 years.For military pensions, savings in direct spending would be $560 million in2000, $6.4 billion over five years, and $23 billion over 10 years. (Those esti-mates assume that the Congress would also lower agencies' appropriations toreflect the decreased cost of funding current employees' benefits.) Over fiveyears, the average CSRS retiree would lose $1,600; the average military retireewould lose $3,400. (Savings from this option for civilian pensions would fall by$440 million over five years if it was coupled with option 600-14-A, which would defer COLAs until age 62 for CSRS workers.) On the civilian side, theCongress could also consider limiting COLAs only for the more generous FERSplan. The main argument for this approach, as with the other COLA options, is that COLA protection under the CSRS and pre-1986 MRS exceeds that offeredby other federal and private pension plans. On average, private pension plansoffset only about 30 percent of the erosion of purchasing power caused by infla-tion. FERS and the post-1986 MRS provide full protection less 1 percent. Bycontrast, CSRS and the pre-1986 MRS provide 100 percent automatic protectionfrom inflation. The main argument against cutting any retirement benefit is that such an action hurts both retirees and the government's ability to recruit a qua lity workforce. Advocates for federal workers argue that although certain provisionsof federal retirement plans are generous, total compensation should be the basisof comparison between federal and private-sector employment. Annual surveysindicate that federal workers may be accepting salaries below private-sector ratesfor comparable jobs in exchange for better retirement provisions. In essence,workers pay for their more generous retirement benefits by accepting lowerwages during their working years. This option, however, would hurt those retir-ees most dependent on their pensions. It would also renege on an understandingthat workers covered under CSRS who passed up the chance to switch to FERSwould retain their full protection against inflation. Finally, critics note that someprotection from inflation for federal retirees has been restricted in the past. TheGeneral Accounting Office calculated that COLA delays and reductions duringthe 10-year period from 1985 through 1994 effectively reduced COLAs to about80 percent of inflation.FUNCTION 600 INCOME SECURITY 193 600-14-C REDUCE COLAs FOR MIDDLE- AND HIGH-INCOME FEDERAL RETIREES Savings (Millions of dollars) Civilian Military Annual 2000 260 300 2001 610 5402002 960 8002003 1,320 1,0702004 1,700 1,350 600-14-B, 600-15, 600-16, and 600-17 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.Another alternative would tie reductions in the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to annuitants' benefit levels. For example, the full COLA could beawarded only on the first $680 of a retiree's monthly benefit; a half COLA could be given on the remainder. The average pension for a civilian retiree was$1,710 a month in 1998, and the average military pension was $1,450 a month.The threshold of $680 per month is about equal to the projected poverty levelfor an elderly person in 1999 and could be indexed to maintain its value overtime. Similar proposals have been considered for Social Security. This approach would save about $260 million in direct spending for civil- ian pensions in 2000, $4.9 billion over the 2000-2004 period, and $19.4 billionover 10 years. For military pensions, savings in direct spending would be $300million in 2000, $4 billion over five years, and $15.5 bi llion over 10 years. (Those estimates assume that the Congress would also decrease appropriationsto agencies to reflect the drop in the cost of f unding benefits for current em- ployees.) The average retiree under the Civil Service Retirement System(CSRS) who was affected by the cut would lose $2,600 over five years, and theaverage affected military retiree would lose $2,140. Because the full COLAwould be paid only to beneficiaries with small annuities, this option wouldbetter focus COLAs on retirees who had the greatest need for protection frominflation. Retirees receiving Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS)benefits already receive a reduced COLA, so this change would affect themless than those receiving CSRS benefits. As a result, the option would widenthe existing gap between benefits provided by FERS and those provided byCSRS, leaving FERS even more generous relative to CSRS than it had been inthe past. The disadvantage of the option is that it would reduce the ability of the federal government to hire and retain middle- and upper-level managers andprofessionals. In addition, restricting COLAs would undercut a major strengthof the federal retirement system\u2014its ability to offer indexed pensions. Fullyindexed benefits provide insurance against inflati on, which generally is not offered in the private sector. Furthermore, many people object to any reduc-tions in earned retirement benefits. They also point out that federal pensionsare fully taxable under the individual income tax in the same proportion thatthey exceed the contributions that employees made during their working years.Moreover, pension benefit levels are not always reliable indicators of totalincome. As a result, unrestricted COLAs might be paid to recipients who hadsubstantial income from other sources.194 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-15 MODIFY THE SALARY USED TO SET FEDERAL PENSIONS Savings (Millions of dollars) Civilian Military Annual 2000 20 20 2001 50 402002 80 702003 120 902004 160 130 2005 190 180 2006 220 2302007 250 3102008 280 4102009 320 540 Cumulative 2000-2004 430 350 2000-2009 1,690 2,020 SPENDING CATEGORY : 600-14-B, 600-14-C, 600-16, and 600-17 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the PrivateSector (Memorandum), August 1998.Both of the government's major civilian employee retirement plans, the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the Civil Service Retirement Sys-tem (CSRS), provide initial benefits based on an average of the employee'sthree highest-earning years. The Military Retirement System also uses thatthree-year base for personnel hired after September 1980. However, personnelhired before that date receive benefits calculated by using their salary at thedate of retirement. If a four-year average was adopted for future retirees underCSRS and FERS as well as for military personnel hired after September 1980,and a 12-month average was adopted for all other military personnel, initialpensions would be about 1.5 percent to 2 percent smaller for most new civilianretirees and about 1 percent to 2 percent smaller for new m ilitary retirees. In 2000, total savings to the government in direct spending for civilian pensionswould be $20 million; savings would total $430 million over five years and $1.7 billion over 10 years. Savings in direct spending for military pensionswould be $20 million in 2000, $350 million over five years, and $2 billion over10 years. (Those estimates assume that the Congress would also reduce agen-cies' appropriations to reflect the lower cost of funding current employees'benefits.) This option would align federal practices more closely with those in the private sector, which commonly uses five-year averages. The change in figur-ing the base salary would encourage some employees to remain on the joblonger in order to boost their pensions to reflect the higher salaries they receivewith more years on the job. That incentive could help the government keepexperienced people, but it would hinder efforts to reduce federal employmentand promote younger hires. In 1995, the Congress actively considered basingmilitary pensions on the final 12 months of pay for personnel hired before Sep-tember 1980 but ultimately rejected that proposal. The major drawback to the option is that it would cut benefits and conse- quently reduce the attractiveness of the government's civilian and military com-pensation packages. In fact, the 105th Congress considered significant in-creases in pension benefits for military personnel in its second session beforefinally dropping the proposal from the omnibus appropriation bill. Recently,the Senate passed legislation increasing military pay and pensions; the Admin-istration's budget for 2000 also proposes increases. Under this option, FERS benefits would remain more generous than those offered by large private firms, but CSRS benefits would fall below those re-ceived by many retirees in the private sector. The average CSRS retiree wouldlose $450 annually, whereas the average FERS retiree would lose $140 annu-ally because of the smaller defined benefit under that system. Retirees partici-pating in FERS would continue to receive their full Social Security benefits anddistributions from the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). In contrast, Social Securitydoes not cover CSRS participants, and the government makes no contributionsto TSP accounts established by CSRS participants.FUNCTION 600 INCOME SECURITY 195 600-16 RESTRICT THE GOVERNMENT'S MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN Savingsa (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 640 640 2001 720 7202002 800 8002003 880 8802004 980 980 Discretionary savings from the 1999 funding level adjusted for inflation.

Comparing Federal Salaries with Those in the Private Sector (Memorandum), July 1997.The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for federal civilian employees is a defined contri- bution pension plan similar to the 401(k) plans that many private employersoffer. Federal agencies automatically contribute to the TSP an amount equal to1 percent of an individual's earnings on behalf of each of the 1.5 million workerscovered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). In addition, theemploying agency matches voluntary deposits by employees dollar for dollar onthe first 3 percent of their pay and 50 cents for each dollar on the next 2 percent.The total federal contribution is 5 percent of pay for employees who also putaside 5 percent. Employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System(CSRS), which covers most civilian federal employees hired before January 1,1984, can contribute 5 percent of their pay to the TSP, but agencies contributenothing on behalf of those employees. If the government limited its matching contributions to a uniform rate of 50 percent on the first 5 percent of pay, its maximum contribution would fall to 3.5percent of pay. Savings from that proposal would total $640 million in 2000and $4 billion over five years. Ten-year savings would reach $10.6 billion.(The estimates exclude savings realized by the Postal Service because reduc-tions in its operating costs eventually benefit only mail users.) Assuming thatagencies continued the automatic 1 percent contribution, this arrangement wouldremain more generous than the defined contribution pension plans that are typi-cally offered in the private sector. Limiting the matching contributions would reduce the disparity between the government's two major retirement systems. Benefits under FERS are cur-rently more generous than those under the older CSRS for most participants.Yet restricting the matching contributions would have several drawbacks.Middle- and upper-income employees rely on the government's contributions tomaintain their standard of living during retirement because Social Security re-places a smaller fraction of their income than it does for lower-income employ-ees. Part of the TSP's appeal derives from its individual accounts for each par-ticipant, which enjoy some protection from cuts imposed by subsequent changesin law. The security and portability of the TSP were major factors in the deci-sion of many employees to switch from CSRS to FERS, because the TSP com-pensated for a less generous defined benefit plan. Changing the TSP's provi-sions would be unfair to that group, whose decision to switch plans reasonablyassumed that changes would not be made. Opponents of restricting the matchingrate also argue that doing so would diminish employees' savings for retirement,a problem that would be intensified if the cut reduced TSP participation. Re-search shows, however, that private-sector employees' contributions to their401(k) plans tend to be responsive to the offer of employer matching contribu-tions but not to the size of the match.196 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 600-17 INCREASE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR FEDERAL PENSIONS Mandatory Savings from Civilian PlansaIncreased Revenues from Military Plansa Annual 2000 0 20 2001 0 902002 0 1302003 940 1602004 1,140 2000-2009 7,580 1,840 a.

The optionwould also require people entering the military services to contribute 2 percentof basic pay toward retirement. Before 1999, most civilian workers covered bythe Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), the older of the two major civil-ian retirement plans, contributed 7 percent of their salary to their retirementfund. However, as CSRS-covered workers, they pay no Social Security taxes.Employees covered by the other major civilian plan, the Federal EmployeesRetirement System (FERS), generally contributed 0.8 percent of pay toward adefined benefit plan and paid 6.2 percent in Social Security taxes. The Bal-anced Budget Act of 1997 temporarily raises federal civilian employees' contri-butions to the retirement funds by 0.5 percent of pay; it also raises nonpostal agencies' contributions for CSRS participants by 1.5 percent of pay. The gov-ernment began phasing in those increases in January 1999\u2014employee contri-butions initially rose by 0.25 percent of pay. The increases are scheduled toexpire after 2002. This option would make those higher employee and agencycontributions for civilian pensions permanent. Adopting this option for civilian employees would increase savings in mandatory programs by $2.1 billion over five years and $7.6 billion over 10years. Contributions by new military personnel would increase revenues by$20 million in 2000, $ 590 million over five years, and $1.8 billion over 10 years. (The estimates assume that agencies' contributions for employees underFERS and for military personnel remain unchanged.) Because the majority ofmilitary personnel leave the armed forces before retirement and receive nopension, the estimate of revenues is net of their refunded pension contributionsduring the 2000-2009 period. Requiring employees to contribute to their retirement funds is one way to offset the generosity of federal civilian pension benefits relative to those in theprivate sector, yet maintain a high level of salary replacement once peopleretire. Moreover, military retirement benefits, which currently require no con-tributions, are more generous than benefits for federal civilian retirees. Requir-ing contributions by military personnel would be a step toward parity. On the downside, for most federal civilian employees and new entrants to the armed forces, the option would be roughly equivalent to a 0.5 percent and2.0 percent pay cut, respectively, and would further diminish the federal gov-ernment's compensation package relative to that of the private sector. (Privatefirms seldom require employees to contribute to pension plans.) Those factorswould weaken the government's ability to attract new personnel. In the case ofmilitary personnel, the option would hurt retention by increasing the incentivefor service members to leave the military before they became eligible for retire-ment after 20 years of service\u2014in essence, the option would offer an \"exitbonus\" in the form of the returned contributions. The government as a resultmight attract a less skilled workforce or be forced to raise cash compensationfor its employees.1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 19990510152025Outlays in Billions of Dollars DiscretionaryMandatory700 Veterans Benefits Budget function 700 funds programs that offer benefits to military veterans.

The VA spends about $500 million a year toconstruct and modernize those facilities. Although in 1996 the Congress gavethe VA authority to purchase health care services from community providers,the department continues to receive funds to build facilities and alter existingones in ways that would increase patient capacity. This option would suspend funding for major construction projects for two years but leave funds for minor repair and modernization intact. Funding formajor construction would then resume in fiscal year 2002 at 50 percent of pro-jected levels. Those reductions would save $854 million over 10 years com-pared with the 1999 funding level. Proponents of this option would argue that funding for major construction weakens the VA's incentive to purchase care from private-sector providers whoalready have facilities in place. Moreover, the VA's 22 regional health carenetworks are still developing ways to better plan and coordinate services amongVA facilities. While that process is going on, constructing and renovatingfacilities may not necessarily be the most efficient way to ensure access to care.Before the VA enlarges its direct care system, the regional networks should berequired to develop long-range planning models that compare the costs of capi-tal expansion and the costs of contracting with local providers in their geo-graphic areas. Opponents of this option would claim that funding for new construction has already slowed down because of the VA's emphasis on building outpatientclinics rather than large hospital facilities. They would also argue that somelocations are underserved by the private sector as well as by the VA, which willmake the department's new contract authority ineffective in creating access tocare. Without the availability of funds for constructi on, the VA may not be able to provide care to deserving veterans in some locations.FUNCTION 700 VETERANS BENEFITS 199 700-02 END FUTURE VETERANS' COMPENSATION PAYMENTS FOR CERTAIN VETERANS WITH LOW-RATED DISABILITIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 21 19 2001 66 622002 113 1092003 162 1582004 214 209 2003 290 285 2006 324 3242007 354 2000-2009 2,459 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 700-03Approximately 2.3 million veterans who have service-connected disabilities receive veterans' disability compensation benefits.

About 50,000 veterans with disability ratings below 30 percent are added to the rolls every year, receiving benefits of between $70 and $185 a month.Federal outlays could be reduced by almost $2.5 billion during the 2000-2009period by ending benefits for those low-rated disabilities in future cases. Making veterans with new disability ratings below 30 percent ineligible for compensation would concentrate spending on the most impaired veterans.Performance in civilian jobs depends less now on physical labor than when thedisability ratings were originally set, and improved reconstructive and rehabili-tative techniques are now available, so physical impairments rated below 30percent may not reduce veterans' earnings.

Disabilities need not be in-curred or made worse while performing military duties to be consideredservice-connected; for example, disabilities incurred while on leave also qual-ify. The federal government gives death compensation awards to survivorswhen a service-connected disability is related to the cause of death. As many as 50 percent of veterans receiving compensation payments may qualify on the basis of injuries or diseases that were neither incurred nor aggra-vated while performing military duties. Ending disability and death compensa-tion awards in such cases in the future would reduce outlays by almost $6.4 bil-lion over 10 years. Approximately 5 percent of those savings would come fromreduced death compensation awards. This option would make disability compensation of military personnel comparable with that of federal civilian employees under workers' compensa-tion arrangements. However, because military personnel are assigned to placeswhere situations may sometimes be volatile, they have less control than civil-ians over where they spend their off-duty hours. Therefore, in many cases itmight be difficult to determine whether a veteran's disease, injury, or impair-ment was entirely unrelated to military duties. The formal appeals system ofthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) could be extended to cover rulingsspecifying that disabling conditions were unrelated to military duties. Data collected by the VA indicate that about 200,000 veterans receive a total of $1.2 billion a year in VA compensation payments for diseases that,according to the General Accounting Office (GAO), are generally neithercaused nor aggravated by military service. Those diseases include arterio-sclerotic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, Hodgkin's disease,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including chronic bronchitis and pulmo-nary emphysema), hemorrhoids, schizophrenia, osteoarthritis, and benign pros-tatic hypertrophy. Ending new awards only for veterans with those diseaseswould have a more limited impact than this option because it would not affectall veterans whose compensable disabilities are unrelated to military service.However, it could eliminate compensation for some veterans whose disabilitiesare not generally service-connected, according to GAO, but whose circum-stances constitute an exception to that general conclusion. Such an approachwould yield smaller savings than the main option\u2014about $1.1 billion over the2000-2009 period.FUNCTION 700 VETERANS BENEFITS 201 700-04 ELIMINATE \"SUNSET\" DATES ON CERTAIN PROVISIONS FOR VETERANS IN THE BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997 Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 0 02002 0 02003 672 OPTIONS : 700-03, 700-05, and 700-06Five provisions in law that affect veterans will cease to apply on September 30, 2002\u2014their \"sunset\" date. As a result, starting in 2003, outlays will be higherthan if the provisions remained in effect. Those provisions: o Protect the monthly benefit for certain pensioners who have no dependents and are eligible for Medicaid coverage for nursing home care, thus lower-ing pension costs for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) but increas-ing costs for the Medicaid program, which is paid for by the federal andstate governments; o Authorize the Internal Revenue Service to help the VA verify incomes reported by beneficiaries, for the purpose of establishing eligibility forpensions and benefits; o Increase the fees charged for first-time and repeated use of the veterans' home loan program and make the VA more cost-effective in securitizingloans and acquiring property: o Authorize the VA to collect from any health insurer that contracts to insure a veteran with service-connected disabilities the reasonable cost of medicalcare that the VA provides for the treatment of non-service-connected dis-abilities; and o Authorize the VA to charge copayments to certain veterans receiving inpa- tient and outpatient care and outpatient medication from VA facilities. This option would make the effects of those provisions permanent by elimi- nating the sunset date in each case. In addition, it would eliminate the VA'scurrent authority to spend the medical care collections. Beginning in 2003, those collections would revert back to the Treasury. If all five provisions weremade permanent and medical receipts were deposited in the Treasury, savingsduring the 2000-2009 period, compared with the current level of spending,would total $5.1 billion. The main advantage of this option is that it would convert the temporary savings achieved by those provisions into continuing savings. The main disad-vantage is that certain veterans or their insurers would be worse off financially.States would also face higher Medicaid costs b ecause of withdrawn federal funds for nursing home care.202 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 700-05 EXTEND AND INCREASE COPAYMENTS FOR OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED AT VA PHARMACIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 0 0 2001 0 02002 0 02003 137 1372004 186 186 2005 236 236 2006 239 2392007 243 2432008 247 Cumulative 2000-2004 323 323 2000-2009 1,538 1,538 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 700-04In 1990, the Congress gave the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) temporary authority to charge copayments for care and services at VA facilities to certainveterans\u2014namely, those with relatively high income and no service-connecteddisabilities. Copayments for outpatient prescriptions filled at VA pharmacieswere set at $2 for a 30-day supply of drugs. The Congress has since extendedthe authority to collect that copayment through 2002 but has not increased thecopayment amount, even though the VA's prescription drug expenditures haverisen by an average of 9 percent per year between 1991 and 1998. This option would make three sets of changes. First, it would eliminate the provision under which the copayment will expire and would extend that paymentindefinitely. It would also require the VA to collect copayments in all applicablecases and would remove the department's discretion to waive the copayment.Currently, the VA bills veterans from a central office on the basis of informationforwarded by VA pharmacies. Under this option, copayments would be col-lected by those pharmacies as they dispensed prescriptions. Second, this optionwould increase the copayment amount by $1 each year until it reached $5 for a30-day supply. Third, the option would send those collections to the Treasuryrather than allowing the VA to spend them, as under current law. Those threeactions would take effect in 2003 and save more than $1.5 billion through 2009. Proponents would argue that eventually requiring a $5 copayment for pre- scription drugs would encourage more prudent consumption and make the VAdrug benefit consistent with that of other health delivery systems, includingmanaged care plans in the private sector. Opponents, by contrast, would charge that some veterans with multiple chronic illnesses could be overburdened by the higher cost sharing. Even limit-ing the number of prescriptions subject to copayments in one month could placean undue financial burden on chronically ill veterans and their families, accord-ing to critics.FUNCTION 700 VETERANS BENEFITS 203 700-06 INCREASE BENEFICIARIES' COST SHARING FOR CARE AT VA-OPERATED NURSING FACILITIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 195 195 2001 202 2022002 209 2092003 216 2162004 220 220 2005 227 227 2006 234 2342007 242 2422008 250 2000-2009 2,255 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 700-04Veterans may receive long-term care in nursing homes operated by the Depart- ment of Veterans Affairs (VA) depending on the availability of resources. Thatcare is rationed primarily on the basis of service-connected disabilities andincome. Under certain conditions, a veteran may receive care at the VA's ex-pense in state-operated or privately run nursing facilities. The VA may charge copayments to veterans with no service-connected disabilities and high enough income when they receive more t han 90 days of care in VA-run nursing homes. In 1998, the copayment rate was equivalent toabout $13 a day. A study by the General Accounting Office found that thecopayment recovers just 0.1 percent of the costs of providing nursing homecare. In contrast, state-operated nursing facilities for veterans and communitylong-term care facilities that treat veterans have their own copayment policies.As a result, those facilities offset a larger share of their operating expenses thanthe VA, recovering as much as 43 percent through copayments. (Estate recov-ery programs are another way they offset costs.) This option would authorize the VA to revise its cost-sharing policies to recover more of the cost of providing care in VA nursing facilities. The depart-ment would be required to collect a minimum of 10 percent of its operatingcosts, but it could determine the type of copayments charged and who would beeligible to pay them. For example, it could apply the current copayment to abroader category of veterans or could require the veterans who now makecopayments to pay more. Recovering 10 percent of the VA's operating costswould save $195 million in 2000 and almost $2.3 billion over 10 years.Achieving those savings would require not allowing the VA to retain and spendthe receipts; instead, they would be deposited in the Treasury. Proponents of this option would argue that veterans in VA nursing facili- ties are getting a far more generous benefit than similar veterans in non-VAfacilities. Because VA-run nursing homes are relatively scarce, veterans luckyenough to be admitted to one receive an unfair advantage over similarly situ-ated veterans. Recovering more of the expense at VA facilities would makethat benefit more equitable among veterans and different sites of care. Opponents of this option would argue that beneficiaries in nursing facili- ties may be less able to make copayments than beneficiaries receiving othertypes of care. They would also argue that allowing the VA to charge veteranswith service-connected disabilities would be inconsistent with other medicalbenefits that those veterans receive. The department could continue to exemptthose veterans, but it would have to charge high-income veterans withoutservice-connected disabilities even more to achieve the 10 percent recoverylevel.204 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 700-07 REVISE THE MONTGOMERY GI BILL PROGRAM Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 104 104 2001 116 1162002 128 1282003 140 1402004 153 153 2005 165 165 2006 177 1772007 191 1912008 206 2062009 221 221 Cumulative 2000-2004 640 640 2000-2009 1,601 1,601 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe Montgomery GI Bill\u2014which provides funds for higher education to former service members\u2014was created as a form of military compensation and an incen-tive in recruiting. Recruits on active duty can participate by contributing $ 1,200 during their first year of service (the same amount as in 1986). Reservists canparticipate too, but they make no contribution. Veterans of active duty and theselected reserves receive $453 or $212 a month, respectively, for full-time enroll-ment in an authorized program of study. The size of those benefits is indexed tothe consumer price index (CPI). This option would limit the cost of the program in three ways. First, it would lower the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for benefits to half the annualchange in the CPI. Second, it would raise the initial contribution of active-dutypersonnel from $1,200 to a bout $1,600 in 2000 and increase it in subsequent years by the same percentage that benefits increase. Third, the option wouldrequire reserve personnel to make contributions proportional to those of active-duty members and would subject their benefits to the lower COLA. Those threechanges would save $104 million in 2000 and a total of $1.6 billion through2009. Opponents of the option would argue that the Montgomery GI Bill is an effective tool (more so than enlistment bonuses) for recruiting the kinds of peoplethe military needs to operate high-technology weapons and other equipment. Itencourages recruits to complete their initial term of enlistment and increases theprobability that they will join a reserve component. Current and prospectiveservice members could view this option as an erosion of benefits. Moreover, theoption might force the Department of Defense to expand other recruiting pro-grams, diluting the potential savings from curtailing these benefits. Opponentswould also observe that college costs have continued to rise faster than the CPI.Finally, opponents would argue that the annual CPI-based adjustment is notprimarily a COLA but rather a mechanism for maintaining the value of theMontgomery GI Bill as an enlistment incentive. Reducing the automatic adjust-ment could force the Congress to raise benefits periodically, as it did in the past. Allowing benefits to increase with inflation while contributions remain fixed provides a richer net benefit each year. At the program's inception, benefitswere nine times greater than contributions, but they are now more than 16 timesgreater\u2014and the multiple will continue to grow every year under current law.Proponents of this option might argue that such a situation is unnecessary torecruit a high-quality force. In recent years, the Department of Defense has metor exceeded its goals for the percentages of recruits having high school diplomasand above-average scores on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test. Moreover, thearmed forces need a smaller percentage of the targeted population now than theydid in the 1980s, when the program was cr eated and the force was 50 percent larger. Proponents of this option would argue that fine-tuning these educationalbenefits to the post-Cold War environment would still allow the military to main-tain a highly sk illed force. Fin ally, the program did not provide any automatic COLAs to benefits for its first seven years and provided only a half-size COLAwhen such adjustments were initially made.1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999-5051015202530Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory750 Administration of Justice Budget function 750 funds programs that provide judicial services, law enforcement, and prison operation.

Of that amount, approximately $2.4 billion is designatedfor efforts to prevent drugs from entering the United States. Both domesticagencies and the Department of Defense carry out law enforcement efforts tocontrol illegal drugs. Approximately two-fifths of the funds for interdiction andinternational activities are allocated under the administration of justice budgetfunction. Another one-fourth is allocated to defense-related efforts. (The re-mainder is split between the transportation and international affairs budgetfunctions.) Eliminating funds for drug interdiction and international activities,which may be relatively less effective than domestic antidrug efforts, wouldsave $1.6 billion in the first year, $10.7 billion over five years, and $22.5 bil-lion over 10 years. Critics of the funding claim that interdiction and international activities are both more costly and less effective than other antidrug efforts; that no clearproof of their efficacy exists; and that the federal government could drasticallyreduce the resources devoted to such activities without affecting drug use overthe long term. In fact, some sources show that illicit drugs are less expensiveand more readily available now than they were before the federal governmentbegan trying to control them. Interdiction and international activ ities do not reduce the demand for drugs and have less impact on the price users pay thanstate and locally funded efforts. Interdiction and international activities affectproducers' costs, which are only a small part of the users' charges. The bulk ofthose charges are added in the later stages of processing and delivery. (Ofcourse, local and state efforts to control the supply of drugs also face severalobstacles: competition among producers and distributors, the large markupfrom wholesale to retail prices, and the ability of distributors to dilute the drugto maintain an end price that customers can afford.) Proponents argue that a variety of reasons exist to support interdiction and international activities. Notable successes, including the destruction of majordrug trafficking organizations and the large quantities of illegal drugs seized ordestroyed, contradict claims of ineffectiveness. In fact, supporters of interdic-tion and international activities argue that street prices would have been muchlower, and the availability of drugs much greater, without extensive funding forcriminal justice efforts. Moreover, if the goal of the federal government is tocontrol, and not simply to reduce, the use of illegal drugs, some effort to reducethe flow of drugs into the country will be necessary. Proponents of antidrugactivities argue that given the unacceptably high level of drug use, the govern-ment should reform allegedly ineffective programs rather than eliminate them.Finally, in cases where antidrug activities are integrated with other agencyfunctions, cutting back funding for interdiction and international efforts wouldalso disrupt those related activities.FUNCTION 750 ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE 207 750-02 REDUCE FUNDING FOR JUSTICE ASSISTANCE AND CERTAIN JUSTICE-RELATED ACTIVITIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 502 410 2001 504 4762002 504 5042003 504 5042004 504 504 2005 504 504 2006 504 5042007 504 5042008 504 2000-2009 4,918 CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 750-01 and 800-05In addition to the law enforcement activities that the Department of Justice carries out directly, it and related government entities provide various types oflaw enforcement or legal assistance to individuals, community organizations,and state and local law enforcement agencies. That assistance, which amountedto $1.3 billion in 1999, can take the form of direct payments to individuals;financial grants to carry out projects or conduct research; information, training,or services; or in-kind grants. This option would consolidate and reform justiceassistance programs and reduce the amount spent on them by 20 percent. Itwould also terminate the Legal Services Corporation and the State Justice Insti-tute. Those cuts can, of course, be considered separately. Taken together, theywould save $410 million in 2000, $2.4 billion over five years, and $4.9 billionby 2009. The two greatest criticisms of the justice assistance programs are that they do not respond to local concerns and priorities and that they often address prob-lems that are not federal responsibilities. Consolidating the grant programsadministered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance would yield administrativesavings, and switching from categorical to block grants would allow grantrecipients to focus their efforts on areas of greatest need rather than on prob-lems that, though significant nati onally, are less important locally. Similar arguments apply to the Legal Services Corporation, which provides legal assis-tance to the poor in civil matters. Critics contend that responsibility for suchassistance more properly lies with state and local governments. Some criticsalso charge that the activities of Legal Service lawyers tend to focus on advanc-ing social causes rather than on helping poor people with routine legal prob-lems. (The Congress modified the Legal Services Corporation in 1996, restrict-ing the types of cases and clients it could represent by, for example, prohibitingthe corporation's lawyers from representing plaintiffs in class-action suits.) TheState Justice Institute, which makes grants for research on criminal justicematters, likewise faces questions of responsibility and jurisdiction. The criti-cisms leveled against the institute are that much of the research it sponsors issimilar to that conducted elsewhere and that in neglecting to publicize the re-search or cooperate with the courts in instituting reforms and new ideas, it doestoo little to affect the states' actual administration of justice. Supporters of funding for justice assistance argue that it is merited on practical grounds. The categorical grant system, they maintain, is working asintended: in certain cases, the problems the grants address have a nationalscope but might be ignored by states without the i ncentive of federal f unds. Reduced federal spending would, moreover, disproportionately affect thosestate-run programs that depend heavily on federal fundi ng, such as juvenile justice. In defending the Legal Services Corporation and the State Justice Insti-tute, opponents of this option argue that the federal government has an obliga-tion to provide assistance in areas with scarce support from state and privatesources. 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999-5051015Outlays in Billions of Dollars Discretionary Mandatory800 General Government Budget function 800 funds the central management and policy responsibilities of both the legisla- tive and executive branches of the federal government.

Thegovernment makes the property available free or at deep discounts. In 1998, according to GSA data, the government donated 49 pieces of property valued at$90 million. For the 1994-1998 period, the value of donations totaled a bout $475 milli on. If the government discontinued the program and instead sold surplus property at market value, it could increase offsetting receipts by a totalof $450 million over 10 years. According to supporters of this option, selling surplus property, rather than giving it away, would raise revenue for government and would ensure,through open compe tition for assets in the market, that property is put to its most highly valued use. They note that the government already provides abun-dant direct and indirect assistance to states and localities to support conserva-tion, education, and other public services. They also point out that nonprofitorganizations received about $20 billion in federal support in tax deductions forcharitable contributions in 1998. In addition, the program provides unevenassistance, which favors areas with a heavy federal presence, according to those who would restrict it. Advocates of transferring surplus property argue that the program pro- vides valuable support to localities, nonprofit organizations, and others strug-gling to offer useful public services in areas such as education, conservation,and transportation. During periods of fiscal restraint, such programs also offerthe government a way to support causes it deems worthy, without having tomake appropriations. In add ition, advocates argue that transferring surplus property to communities may offset some of the local impact of closing federalinstallations.FUNCTION 800 GENERAL GOVERNMENT 211 800-02 ELIMINATE GENERAL FISCAL ASSISTANCE TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 232 232 2001 232 2322002 232 2322003 232 2322004 232 232 2005 232 232 2006 232 2322007 232 2322008 232 2,320 CATEGORY : DiscretionaryUnder the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act (Revitalization Act) of 1997, the federal government assumed responsibil-ity for providing certain services to the District of Columbia in exchange foreliminating the annual payment of general assistance to the District. Specifi-cally, the federal government agreed to fund the operations of the District's criminal justice, court, and correctional systems. It also assumed responsibilityfor paying off more than $5 billion in unfunded liabilities owed by the city toseveral pension plans, increased the federal share of the city's Medicaid pay-ments, and provided special borrowing authority to the District. For fiscal year 1998, the Revitalization Act included slightly more than $200 million in assistance for the District that was not related to the obligationsspecifically assumed by the federal government. For fiscal year 1999, theOmnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act in-cluded $232 million in such funding. That amount includes funds for transpor-tation projects, District of Columbia schools, and government managementreforms. Eliminating such funds would save about $2.3 billion over the 2000-2009 period. One argument for eliminating such funding is that the federal government relieved the District of Columbia government of the cost of a substantial, andincreasing, portion of its budget\u2014criminal justice, Medicaid, and pensions. The proposed trade-off for assuming responsibility for those functions waseliminating other assistance, including the annual federal payment. Eliminatingassistance would be consistent with that policy. Furthermore, because theDistrict of Columbia's financial situation has recently improved considerably,the city needs less assistance. One argument against eliminating such funding is that the Cons titution gives the Congress responsibility for overseeing the District of Columbia(which the Congress has largely delegated to the city government) and the citystill has major problems with its public schools, roadways, and other essentialcity services. Therefore, opponents of this option argue that the need continuesfor funding assistance. Moreover, the Congress prevents the District of Colum-bia from imposing commuter taxes as other cities do. Those are taxes on non-residents who work in a city and benefit from city services. Two of three dol-lars earned in the District of Columbia are earned by nonresidents. Finally,opponents note that continued assistance is justified because a large portion ofcity property is exempt from local taxes, including the property owned by thefederal government or foreign nations that accounts for over 40 percent of prop-erty in the city.212 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 800-03 ELIMINATE MANDATORY GRANTS TO U.S. TERRITORIES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 28 2 2001 28 82002 28 132003 28 182004 28 23 2005 28 28 2006 28 282007 28 282008 28 282009 28 28 Cumulative 2000-2004 140 64 2000-2009 280 204 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryAs part of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), the federal government agreed to provide financial assistanceto CNMI, a U.S. territory. During the 1978-1992 period, the federal govern-ment provided CNMI with $420 m illion for operations, economic development, and infrastructure. After 1992, the financial assistance agreement between the United States and CNMI requires, in the absence of a new agreement, grants to the Common-wealth to continue indefinitely at the 1992 funding amount\u2014$28 million. In1996, Public Law 104-134 reallocated the $28 million in annual grants amongCNMI; the territories of Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands; andthe freely associated states of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. The reallo-cation was made, in part, because the government believed that the goals of theoriginal financial assistance agreements had been met and that other areas hada greater need for assistance. Of the $28 million, more than $11 million contin-ues to go to CNMI. The option and savings assume a new agreement with CNMI. Eliminating the mandatory grants to the U.S. territories and freely associated states wouldsave about $200 million over the 2000-2009 period. Because the territoriesspend new grants relatively slowly, eliminating the grants would not save muchmoney in the first several years. The Department of the Interior could includeadditional funding for infrastructure and other purposes as part of its annualappropriation request; however, the territories would no longer be entitled tothe $28 million, and requests for add itional appropriations for infrastructure grants would compete with all other appropriation requests. For instance, infiscal year 1999, the Congress appropriated $38 million in assistance to theterritories. Aside from reducing direct spending, eliminating the grants would put assistance to the territories for capital needs on equal footing with other assis-tance to the territories and with similar grants to state and local governments.In addition, some people argue that the reason for providing mandatory assis-tance to CNMI has ended because its goals have been met. The decision toreallocate the annual funds among the insular areas would seem to support thatconclusion. In addition, CNMI has had considerable difficulty developingprojects, raising matching funds, and receiving approval from the Departmentof the Interior, all of which suggests that the goals for which the funding wasdesigned have been met. Those who would continue the grants argue that the insular areas still have significant needs and that the mandatory grants ensure that f unding is available. In addition, CNMI has a growing economy and increasing self-suffi-ciency, which supporters of this option cite as proof that the federal assistanceworks. Others argue that any further change in CNMI's funding should be partof a new financial agreement between the United States and CNMI. Otherwise,CNMI could view the unilateral ending of the assistance as a br each of good faith on the part of the U.S. government, which could have political and legalrepercussions.FUNCTION 800 GENERAL GOVERNMENT 213 800-04 REQUIRE THE IRS TO DEPOSIT FEES FROM INSTALLMENT AGREEMENTS IN THE TREASURY AS MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 97 88 2001 99 992002 101 1012003 103 1032004 105 105 2005 106 106 2006 108 1082007 110 1102008 112 1122009 113 113 Cumulative 2000-2004 505 496 2000-2009 1,054 1,045 SPENDING CATEGORY : MandatoryThe fiscal year 1996 appropriation act for the Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain inde-pendent agencies authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to establishnew fees and increase existing fees. The act also allows the IRS to retain andspend receipts collected from those fees, up to an annual limit of $119 million.The IRS has used the authority mainly to charge taxpayers a fee for enteringinto payment plans with the agency. In fiscal year 1998, the IRS collected andspent $98 million in fee receipts. Requiring the IRS to deposit those receipts in the Treasury would elimi- nate the IRS's ability to spend them. That would reduce the IRS's direct spend-ing by about $100 million a year, or more than $1 billion over the 2000-2009period. That estimate assumes that removing the spending authority would notsubstantially reduce the amount the IRS collects each year from such fees. An argument for eliminating the IRS's authority to spend the receipts is that processing payment plans with the taxpayers is an administrative functiondirectly related to the IRS's mission\u2014getting citizens to pay the taxes they owe\u2014and for which the agency already receives an annual appropriation. Forfiscal year 1999, for instance, the IRS received $7.9 billion in direct appropria-tions (not counting transfers). That argument may have particular merit be-cause the IRS does not directly use the receipts collected from fees for install-ment agreements to fund the processing of those agreements. A second argu-ment is that the spending authority could create the incentive for the IRS tounnecessarily encourage taxpayers to pay their taxes in installments. Similarly,it could encourage the agency to seek new and unnecessary fees. An argument for continuing to allow the IRS to spend the receipts is that given the constraints on total discretionary spending, allowing the IRS to gener-ate and use fee receipts helps ensure that the federal government's main revenuecollector has sufficient funding to fulfill its mission. Some people would arguethat even an annual decrease of $100 million could negatively affect revenuecollection. In addition, eliminating the spending authority could reduce theIRS's incentive to allow, or its ability to provide for, installment payments, thushurting those taxpayers who would benefit from such arrangements.214 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 800-05 ELIMINATE FEDERAL ANTIDRUG ADVERTISING Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 185 46 2001 185 1202002 185 1672003 185 1852004 185 185 2005 185 185 2006 185 1852007 185 1852008 185 1852009 185 185 Cumulative 2000-2004 925 703 2000-2009 1,850 1,628 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTIONS : 750-01 and 750-02The fiscal year 1998 appropriation act for the Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain inde-pendent agencies authorized and provided funding of $195 million to the Officeof National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) for a national antidrug media cam-paign. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropria-tions Act provided $185 million for the program in fiscal year 1999 and autho-rized $195 million for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2002. Amounts pro-vided to ONDCP can be used to test and evaluate advertising, purchase mediatime, and evaluate the effects. In addition, the agency must try to get donationsfrom nonfederal sources to finance part of the costs. Eliminating the antidrug media program would save $1.6 billion over the 2000-2009 period, assuming that the Congress will otherwise continue to pro-vide the same level of funding for the program that it provided for fiscal year1999. Arguments for terminating funding of the advertising campaign are many. First, solid empirical evidence of media campaigns' effectiveness in either pre-venting or reducing drug use is lacking. Some analysts claim that media spotsdo not reduce drug use by minors as effectively as treatment or interdiction.Furthermore, since nonprofit organizations, such as the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, already conduct educational programs about the dangers of druguse, ONDCP's campaign may duplicate private and local efforts. In any event,with more than $300 million in available balances at the start of this year andthe authority to solicit and use public donations, ONDCP could continue the media campaign, on a much smaller scale, without an annual appropriation. Other analysts argue that educating the young about the hazards of drug use is a national responsibility. Some point to the \"Just Say No\" campaignbegun by former First Lady Nancy Reagan in the 1980s as an example of thesuccessful use of the national media to raise yo ung people's awareness of the dangers of drugs. Proponents of the program also argue that the cost of drugabuse to the country is so high that it is worthwhile to maintain a program thatreduces drug use even slightly.920 Allowances The President's budget and the Congressional budget resolution sometimes include amounts in function 920 to reflect proposals that are not clearly specified or that would affect multiplebudget functions.

Beginning in 1999, with certain excep-tions, 75 percent of light-duty vehicles acquired for federal fleets in high-density areas must be manufactured or converted to operate as a bi-fuel (gaso-line or alternative fuel), flexible-fuel (mixture), or dedicated-fuel (alternativefuel only) vehicle. EPACT annually applies to more than 20,000, or just underhalf, of new vehicles. Although agencies have yet to meet any of EPACT's annual targets for acquiring alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs), they increasingly add AFVs to theirfleets. To date, the government has acquired or converted close to 35,000AFVs, which are often considerably more expensive to buy and operate thanconventional vehicles. For example, the government spends about $4,000 morefor a vehicle equipped to operate using compressed natural gas. Eliminating theEPACT requirement would save $142 million in federal transportation coststhrough 2009. The estimate of annual savings assumes that agencies will continue under current law to fall short of the 75 percent requirement. If agencies were to meetcurrent-law targets, increasing their use of AFVs, savings would be greater.The estimated budgetary effect of eliminating the EPACT requirement excludesannual savings to the Postal Service, which is classified as off-budget. An obvious advantage of eliminating the requirement is that it would reduce transportation costs to the federal government and the taxpayers. Inaddition, given the annual limits set in law for total discretionary spending, andfalling fuel prices, it may no longer be desirable to require agencies to purchasethe more expensive AFVs. A disadvantage of eliminating the requirement is that the federal govern- ment would no longer be leading the conversion to AFVs. Such a policychange could discourage similar efforts at the state and local levels. In addition,the development of the AFV market and of less expensive vehicles of that typecould slow. Such a result could hurt clean air efforts. However, according toinformation from the General Services Administration and the Department ofEnergy, many agencies are buying bi-fuel vehicles that comply with EPACTbut that do not require the use of alternative fuels.FUNCTION 920 ALLOWANCES 217 920-02 REDUCE THE NUMBER OF POLITICAL APPOINTEES Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 48 46 2001 71 712002 76 762003 121 1192004 108 109 2005 82 84 2006 87 872007 139 1372008 123 1242009 94 96 Cumulative 2000-2004 425 421 2000-2009 951 947 NOTE: Savings measured from the 1999 funding level adjusted for payraises and changes in employ-ment. SPENDING CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe term \"political appointee\" generally refers to employees of the federal government who are appointed by the President, some with and some withoutSenate confirmation, and to certain policy advisers hired at lower levels. Forthis discussion, the term \"political appointee\" refers to cabinet secretaries,agency heads, and other executive-schedule employees at the very top ranks ofgovernment; top managers and supervisors who are noncareer members of theSenior Executive Service; and confidential aides and policy advisers referred toas Schedule C employees. The total number of employees in such positions,according to Congressional Budget Office projections, will average about2,800 over the next 10 years. If the government instead capped the number ofpolitical appointees at 2,000, savings over 10 years would total $947 million.The current average salary for political appointees, in CBO's calculations, isestimated to be $87,000. Reports from several groups, including the National Commission on the Public Service and the Twentieth Century Fund, have called for cuts in thenumber of political appointees. The National Commission on the Public Ser-vice, also known as the Volcker Commission, called for setting a limit similarto the one described here. In addition to the problem of excessive organiza-tional layering, the Volcker Commission described concerns about many ap-pointees' lack of expertise in government operations and programs. In politicalappointments, the commission noted, political loyalties generally count morethan knowledge of government. Moreover, few appointees are in office longenough to acquire the necessary skills and experience to master their job. Thatlack of experience, according to the commission, means that political appoint-ees in many instances are not effective in carrying out the policies of the Presi-dent they serve and can disrupt an agency's daily operations. As a result, ca-reer managers become frustrated and demoralized, making recruitment andretention difficult in the top ranks of the career civil service. Critics of reducing the number of political appointees cite the importance of a President's establishing control over the vast bureaucracy by having like-minded individuals and allies strategically situated. Those appointees, criticsnote, form an important link to the electorate because they help to ensuregovernmentwide leadership that is consistent with the philosophy of eachelected President. Such appointees, moreover, can offer fresh perspectives andinnovation. The high rate of turnover among appointees, critics argue, meansthat those officials make way for someone new before they reach the point ofburnout.218 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 920-03 CHARGE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES COMMERCIAL RATES FOR PARKING Added Receipts (Millions of dollars) Annual 2000 110 2001 1102002 1102003 1102004 110 2005 110 2006 1102007 1102008 1102009 110 Cumulative 2000-2004 550 2000-2009 1,100 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 920-01The federal government leases and owns more than 200,000 parking spaces, which it allocates to its employees\u2014in most cases without charge. Requiringfederal government employees to pay commercial rates for their parking couldyield receipts of $110 million in 2000, $550 million over five years, and $1.1billion over 10 years. Federal workers in the largest metropolitan areas would bear the brunt of the new charges. Those in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area would beaffected the most, paying about 75 percent of the total charge. (Federal em-ployees in less commercially developed areas, where charging for parking isuncommon, would not face new parking charges.) Employees who continued touse federally owned or managed parking would, on average, pay about $120per month; employees who currently use free or heavily subsidized parkingcould choose alternative means of transportation, such as public transportationor carpooling, to avoid the charge. Supporters of this option favor charging commercial rates for parking because it would encourage federal employees to use public transportation orcarpool. That would reduce the flow of cars into urban areas, cutting down onenergy consumption, air pollution, and congestion. By acting as a model em-ployer in this regard, the federal government could more effectively call onothers to reduce pollution and energy consumption. In addition, commercialpricing would indicate the demand for parking by federal workers more accu-rately, enabling the government to allocate spaces to those who valued them themost. Moreover, if commercial rates reduced demand for spaces sufficiently,the government might be able to put the unused spaces to new, higher-valueduses. Finally, some observers argue that the federal government should notprovide a valuable commodity, such as parking, free to workers who can affordto pay for it. Critics of this option argue that by charging for parking, the government would unfairly penalize workers in urban areas who have difficulty obtainingaccess to alternative transportation or who drive to work for valid personalreasons. Charging for parking would also reduce federal employees' total com-pensation. In addition, critics note that many private-sector employers providefree parking. Some people also have argued that charging commercial rateswould merely re-ration the existing spaces without reducing the number ofpeople who drive to work. According to that view, the spaces would simply beallocated by willingness to pay rather than by rank, seniority, or other factors.FUNCTION 920 ALLOWANCES 219 920-04 IMPOSE A FEE ON GSE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 550 550 2001 550 5502002 550 5502003 550 5502004 550 550 2005 550 550 2006 550 5502007 550 5502008 550 5502009 550 550 Cumulative 2000-2004 2,750 2,750 2000-2009 5,500 5,500 SPENDING CATEGORY : Mandatory RELATED OPTION : 370-10 RELATED CBO PUBLICATIONS : Assessing the Public Costs and Benefits of Fannie Mae andFreddie Mac (Report), May 1996. Controlling the Risks of Government-Sponsored Enterprises (Report), April 1991.Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are private financial institutions chartered by the federal government to support the flow of funds to agriculture,housing, and higher education. GSEs achieve their public purposes by borrow-ing on the strength of an implicit federal guarantee of their debt obligations.Investors infer the guarantee from the exemption of GSE securities from thenormal protection afforded to investors, Congressional support for the enter-prises' public purposes, their exemption from state and local taxes, and the hugevolume of their outstanding obligations. The implicit guarantee lowers GSEs'cost of borrowing, thus conveying subsidies that give them a competitive ad-vantage in financial markets. Before the 1990s, GSEs generally used the money they borrowed to make loans or buy loans made by other lenders. More recently, the three largestGSEs\u2014Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank System\u2014have used borrowed funds to acquire enormous portfolios of debt securities.The investments consist mainly of mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) but alsoinclude corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. At the end of 1998, theinvestment portfolios of those three enterprises totaled $586 billion, or 52 per-cent of their combined assets. A fourth GSE, Farmer Mac, has acquired asmaller investment portfolio. The four enterprises conduct an arbitrage be-tween the market for GSE debt and that for private debt, profiting from thedifference between the yields on their investments and their own subsidizedcost of funds. Imposing an annual fee on the four GSEs that earn arbitrage profits that would equal 10 cents for every $100 (10 basis points) of each GSE's holdingsof debt securities that the enterprise finances with debt would save $550 millionin 2000, $2.8 billion over five years, and $5.5 billion by 2009. The fee wouldreduce the competitive advantage that GSEs have in holding debt securitiesand, at least initially, would reduce the net income of the four that do so; theirnet income exceeded $6.5 billion (after taxes) in calendar year 1998. Theenterprises could avoid the fee by reducing their investment portfolios butwould probably not do so because their cost advantage in issuing debt exceedsthe fee. The GSEs could also try to recoup lost arbitrage profits by increasingtheir risk or the prices they charge. Proponents of imposing the fee argue that no public policy objectives are served by allowing GSEs to seek high yields in investments unrelated to theirmissions. The profits of each enterprise subject to the fee, except Farmer Mac,would remain above competitive levels. Even if the three housing GSEs re-duced their MBS holdings, it would not adversely affect the markets for thosesecurities, which are deep, liquid, and extremely efficient. Critics counter thatgreater risk taking by the four enterprises could increase the government's riskexposure. Federal risk-based capital requirements and regulatory examina-tions, if effective, would limit the amount of any increase in the GSEs' riskborne by the government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could possibly raisethe interest rates on new mortgages they bought, but competition from whollyprivate firms and between those two GSEs would limit their ability to do so.220 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 920-05 REPEAL THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 610 580 2001 610 6102002 610 6102003 610 6102004 610 610 2005 610 610 2006 610 6102007 610 6102008 610 CATEGORY : DiscretionaryThe McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act of 1965 (SCA) sets basic labor standards for employees working on government contracts whose main purposeis to furnish labor, such as laundry, custodial, and guard services. Contractorscovered by the act generally must provide those employees with wages andfringe benefits that at least equal those prevailing in the contractors' locality orthose specified by a collective bargaining agreement of the previous contractor.The Department of Labor measures prevailing wages in an area according tothe specific wages and benefits earned by at least 50 percent of workers in aparticular type of job or by the average of the wages and benefits paid to work-ers in that type of job. The provision about collective bargaining agreementsapplies to successor contractors, regardless of whether their employees arecovered by such an agreement. In 1998, the SCA covered approximately 55,000 contracts valued at more than $19 billion. The Department of Defense accounted for about 42 percent ofthat dollar value, the Army Corps of Engineers for 16 percent, and the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration for 15 percent. The cost of services procured by the federal government could be reduced by repealing the SCA. Repealing the act would reduce outlays by about $600million in 2000 and by about $6.1 billion over the 2000-2009 period, providedfederal agency appropriations were reduced to reflect the anticipated reductionin costs. Federal procurement costs would fall because repealing the SCA would promote greater competition among bidders, although the precise magnitude ofthe savings is difficult to measure. Repealing the SCA would give contractorsadded flexibility that could allow them to reduce the costs of providing services.Opponents of this option are concerned, however, that it would allow bidders toundermine existing collective bargaining agreements. In addition, repealing theSCA would reduce the compensation of workers in some firms that provideservices to the government, which opponents argue could reduce the quality ofsuch services.FUNCTION 920 ALLOWANCES 221 920-06-A REPEAL THE DAVIS-BACON ACT Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 580 245 2001 580 6602002 580 9002003 580 1,0202004 580 1,100 2005 580 1,130 2006 580 Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 920-06-BSince 1935, the Davis-Bacon Act has required that \"prevailing wages\" be paid on all federally funded or federally assisted construction projects with contractsof $2,000 or more. The Department of Labor measures prevailing wages in anarea according to the specific wages and benefits earned by at least 50 percentof workers in a particular type of job or the average of the wages and benefitspaid to workers in that type of job. Those procedures, as well as the classifica-tions of workers who receive prevailing wages, favor union wage rates in somecases. In 1999, approximately $52 billion in federal discretionary funds was authorized for construction projects covered by the Davis-Bacon Act. Fifty-three percent of that amount went to transportation projects, 14 percent went tothe Department of Housing and Urban Development and other community andregional development projects, and 13 percent went to the Department of De-fense. (Most of the spending authority for transportation projects is controlledby limitations on obligations rather than by budgetary authority.) The federal government could reduce outlays for construction by repealing the Davis-Bacon Act. Doing so would reduce discretionary outlays by about$245 million in 2000 and by about $9.6 billion over the 2000-2009 period, provided that federal agency appropriations were reduced to reflect the antici-pated reduction in costs. Mandatory spending would fall by about $10 millionin 2000 and by about $260 million over the 10-year period. Repealing Davis-Bacon would allow the federal government to spend less on construction, although the precise effect of repealing the act on contractors'costs is difficult to measure. In addition, it would probably increase the oppor-tunities for employment that federal projects would offer less skilled workers.However, such a change would lower the earnings of some construction work-ers. In addition, opponents of this option argue that eliminating Davis-Baconrequirements could jeopardize the quality of federally funded or federally as-sisted construction projects. They contend that by requiring firms to pay atleast the locally prevailing wage, the people they hire are more likely to be ableworkers, resulting in fewer defects in the finished projects and more timelycompletion.222 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 920-06-B RAISE THE THRESHOLD FOR COVERAGE UNDER THE DAVIS-BACON ACT Savings (Millions of dollars) Budget Authority Outlays Annual 2000 325 60 2001 325 2052002 325 3052003 325 3602004 325 395 2005 325 405 2006 325 4152007 325 4152008 325 4152009 325 415 Cumulative 2000-2004 1,625 1,325 2000-2009 3,250 3,390 SPENDING CATEGORY : Discretionary RELATED OPTION : 920-06-AAn alternative to repealing the Davis-Bacon Act (see option 920-06-A) would be to raise the threshold for determining which projects are covered by the act.In recent years, several bills have been introduced that would raise the thresh-old by various amounts. Raising it from $2,000 to $1 million would save about$60 million in 2000 and about $3.4 billion over the 2000-2009 period in discre-tionary outlays, provided that federal agency appropriations were reduced toreflect the anticipated reduction in costs. In addition, it would save $2 millionin 2000 and $35 million over the 10-year period in mandatory spending. Al- though this option would save only about one-third of the amount that would besaved by repealing Davis-Bacon, the option would reduce firms' and the gov-ernment's administrative burden by restricting coverage to the largest contracts. As with repealing Davis-Bac on, raising the threshold would allow the federal government to spend less on construction, although the precise effect ofraising the threshold on contractors' costs is difficult to measure. In addition, itwould probably increase the opportunities for employment that federal projectswould offer less skilled workers. However, such a change would lower theearnings of some construction workers.

RELATED OPTION : REV-02A home is the largest consumer purchase and the main investment for most Americans. The tax code has historically treated homes more favorably thanother investments. Most investments pay their return in cash that is subject toincome taxes. Homes, however, pay their return in housing services directly tothe owner, and that return is not subject to taxation. Furthermore, owners whohelp finance their home purchase with a mortgage are allowed to deduct theinterest even though the investment produces no taxable income. The tax codealso exempts most capital gains from home sales. Limiting mortgage interest deductions would reduce the preferential treat- ment of home ownership for owners who must borrow to purchase their homes.Under current law, taxpayers may deduct interest on up to $1 m illion of debt that they have incurred to acquire and improve first and second homes. Theymay also deduct interest on up to $100,000 of other loans they have securedwith a home (home-equity loans), regardless of purpose. No other type ofconsumer interest is deductible. Current law also limits the extent to whichinterest deductions for carrying assets other than first and second homes canexceed income from such assets. Lowering the limit on the amount of principal eligible for the mortgage interest deduction from $1 million to $300,000 would reduce deductions forabout half a million taxpayers with large mortgages and increase revenues by$40.8 billion over the 2000-2009 period. That change would reduce the deduc-tion only for owners of relatively expensive homes. Only 4 percent of newmortgages originated in 1998 exceeded $300,000. The fraction affected wouldbe greatest in high-cost areas such as Honolulu and San Francisco. Preferential treatment for home ownership encourages people to become homeowners and to purchase larger homes. Increasing home ownership maycontribute to social and political stability by strengthening people's stake intheir communities and governments. In addition, such preferential treatment may stabilize neighborhoods by encouraging longer-term residence and homeimprovement. The amount of preference, however, is probably larger thanneeded to maintain a high rate of home ownership among people buying homesvalued over $300,000. Canada achieves about the same rate of home owner-ship as the United States without allowing the deduction of mortgage interest.Instead of the deduction, some provinces provide a limited tax credit for low-and middle-income people who save for a down payment. A disadvantage of providing preferential tax treatment for investment in home ownership is that it reduces the amount of savings available for invest-ment in taxable business enterprises. In recent years, about 30 percent of netprivate investment has gone into owner-occupied housing. Consequently, a reduction in investment in owner-occupied housing could raise investmentnoticeably in other sectors.226 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-02 LIMIT THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION FOR SECOND HOMES Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.5 2001 0.72002 0.72003 0.72004 0.8 2005 0.8 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 3.4 2000-2009 7.6 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-01Taxpayers who borrow to purchase or improve a second home may deduct the interest on that mortgage on the same terms as for a first home. The only limiton the amount borrowed for the two homes is that it be under $1 million. Fur-thermore, equity in both homes may be used as collateral to borrow $100,000that can be used for any purpose and whose interest may be deducted (home-equity loans). Several arguments for and against limiting the deductibility of all mort- gage interest appear in option REV-01. Additional considerations apply tomortgage interest on second homes. Permitting taxpayers to deduct the interestfrom mortgages on second homes\u2014many of which are vacation homes\u2014mayseem inequitable when taxpayers cannot deduct interest from consumer loansused to finance either medical expenses or other consumer purchases. How-ever, limiting the deduction of mortgage interest to a single home would retainthe current deduction for taxpayers with high mortgage interest on a costlyprimary home while partially denying it for other taxpayers with equal com-bined mortgage interest on two less costly homes. The deductibility of mortgage interest could be limited to debt that tax- payers incur to acquire and improve a primary residence, plus $100,000 ofother debt secured by that home. That approach would require interest deduc-tions for second homes to qualify under the $100,000 limit on home-equityloans if they are to be deductible. The limitation would increase revenue by$7.6 billion for the 2000-2009 period.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 227 REV-03 LIMIT DEDUCTIONS OF STATE AND LOCAL TAXES TO THE EXCESS OVER 2 PERCENT OF ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 5.3 2001 17.92002 18.42003 18.92004 19.5 Committee on Taxation.In determining their taxable income, taxpayers may claim a standard deduction or itemize and deduct from their adjusted gross income (AGI) certain specificexpenses, including state and local income, real estate, and personal propertytaxes. For taxpayers who itemize, those deductions provide a federal subsidyof state and local tax payments. Consequently, the deductions indirectly fi-nance increased state and local government spending at the expense of otheruses of federal revenues. Limiting the deductibility of state and local tax payments to the amount in excess of 2 percent of AGI would continue the mitigating effect of the deduc-tion on differences in taxes among states and increase federal revenues byabout $184 billion over the 2000-2009 period. An alternative approach wouldbe to prohibit deductions above a fixed ceiling, which also might be a percent-age of AGI. A ceiling set at 5.75 percent of AGI would increase revenues byabout the same amount\u2014$187 billion in 2000 through 2009. A floor and aceiling, however, would have very different effects on incentives for state andlocal spending. A floor would retain the incentive for increased spending, but aceiling would reduce it. As a way to assist state and local governments, deductibility of state and local taxes has several disadvantages. First, the deductions reduce federal taxliability only for itemizers. Second, because the value of an additional dollar ofdeductions increases with the marginal tax rate, the deductions are worth moreto higher-bracket taxpayers. Third, deductibility favors wealthier communities.Communities with a higher average i ncome level have more residents who itemize and are therefore more likely to spend more b ecause of deductibility than lower-income communities. Fourth, deductibility may discourage statesand localities from financing services with nondeductible user fees, therebydiscouraging efficient pricing of some services. An argument against restricting deductibility is that a taxpayer with a large state and local tax liability has less ability to pay federal t axes than one with equal total income and a smaller state and local tax bill. In some areas, ataxpayer who pays higher state and local taxes may receive more benefits frompublicly provided services, such as recreational facilities. In that case, thetaxes are more like payments for other goods and services (for example, privaterecreation) that are not deductible. Alternatively, higher public expendituresresulting from deductibility benefit all members of a community, includinglower-income nonitemizers who do not receive a direct tax saving.228 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-04 LIMIT DEDUCTIONS FOR CHARITABLE GIFTS OF APPRECIATED PROPERTY TO TAX BASIS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.3 2001 1.72002 1.82003 1.82004 1.9 2005 1.9 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 7.5 2000-2009 17.6 SOURCE: Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-05, REV-23-A, REV-23-B, and REV-24Under current law, taxpayers who itemize deductions may deduct the value of contributions they make to qualifying charitable organizations up to a max-imum of 50 percent of adjusted gross income in any year. In 1996, 32 milliontaxpayers claimed just over $86 billion of deductions for charitable contribu-tions, reducing federal revenues by about $22 billion. In addition to cash dona-tions, taxpayers may deduct the fair market value of a contribution of appreci-ated property that they have held for more than 12 months, regardless of howmuch they paid for the property. The deduction provides significant government support for charitable activities. But one criticism of the deduction is that it provides unequal federalmatching rates for contributions by different taxpayers. The government sub-sidy rates can approach 40 percent of contributions for the highest-incometaxpayers but are only 15 percent for taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket andzero for people who do not itemize deductions. Another cr iticism is that the electorate as a whole, and not individual donors, should make decisions aboutwhich activities deserve taxpayer support. Limiting the deduction of appreciated property to a taxpayer's cost of an asset under the regular income tax would increase revenues by about $0.3 bil-lion in 2000 and by more than $17.6 billion over 10 years. The existing provi-sion allows taxpayers to deduct the entire value of assets they contributed eventhough they paid no tax on the gain from appreciation. That outcome providespreferential treatment to one kind of donation relative to other kinds and ex- pands the preferential treatment of capital gains (see options REV-23A, REV-23B, and REV-24). Indisputably, however, the current provision encouragespeople to donate appreciated assets, such as stock or art, to eligible activitiesrather than leave them to their heirs at death, when any gains also escape in-come tax (see also option REV-05).PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 229 REV-05 LIMIT DEDUCTIONS FOR CHARITABLE GIVING TO THE AMOUNT EXCEEDING 2 PERCENT OF ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 1.5 2001 10.32002 10.92003 11.42004 on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-04Current law allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct the value of contributions they make to qualifying charitable organizations up to a maximum of 50 per-cent of adjusted gross income (AGI) in any year. It also allows contributions ofappreciated property to be deducted at fair market value. One proposed changewould limit the deduction for donations of appreciated property to its tax basis(see option REV-04). Another way to limit the charitable deduction but retainan incentive for giving would be to allow taxpayers to deduct only contributionsthat exceed 2 percent of AGI. Such a limit would retain the incentive for increased giving by people who donate a large share of their income but would remove the incentive for peoplewho contribute smaller amounts. It would completely disqualify the charitabledeductions of about 17.6 million taxpayers in 2000 and reduce allowed deduc-tions for roughly another 16.1 million. The option would increase revenues byabout $1.5 billion in 2000 and by about $116 billion over the 2 000-2009 pe- riod. Such a change would eliminate the tax incentive for just over half of thetaxpayers who currently make and deduct charitable contributions. As a result,overall charitable giving would decline. In addition, it would encourage tax-payers who planned to make contributions over several years to lump themtogether in one tax year to qualify for a deduction with the 2 percent floor.230 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-06 PHASE OUT THE CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE CREDIT Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.3 2001 1.42002 1.42003 1.42004 1.4 2005 1.3 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 5.9 2000-2009 11.8 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-12Taxpayers who incur employment-related expenses for the care of children and certain other dependents may claim an income tax credit. The credit per dollarof qualifying expenses declines from 30 percent for taxpayers whose adjustedgross income (AGI) is $10,000 or less to 20 percent for taxpayers whose AGIis above $28,000. Tax law limits creditable expenses to $2,400 for one childand $4,800 for two or more. The maximum credit for a taxpayer with one childand income above $28,000 is thus $480 each year. Creditable expenses cannotexceed the earnings of the taxpayer or, in the case of a couple, the earnings ofthe spouse with lower earnings. In 1996, taxpayers claimed about $2.5 billionin credits on 6 million tax returns. About two-fifths of the credit benefits taxpayers with an AGI of $50,000 or more. Retaining the credit for only lower-income families would reduce itsrevenue cost. One way to do that would be to lower the percentage of credit asincome rises. For example, trimming the credit percentage by 1 percentagepoint for each $1,500 of AGI over $30,000\u2014and thus eliminating it completelyfor those with an AGI over $58,500\u2014would raise $11.8 billion from 2000 through 2009. That option would reduce or eliminate the credit for about 72percent of currently eligible families. Alternatively, phasing out the creditbetween $50,000 and $78,500 would raise about $7.8 billion in the sameperiod. That option would reduce or eliminate the credit for nearly half of theeligible families. Finally, phasing out the credit between $65,000 and $93,500would raise $5.6 billion in the same period, reducing or eliminating the creditfor about one-third of eligible families. The credit provides a work subsidy for families with children. Phasing out the credit for higher-income families targets the subsidy toward familieswith greater economic need, but it may dis courage parents in fam ilies with a reduced credit from working outside the home. If the credit was phased out, higher-income employees could seek other tax benefits for dependent care by asking their employers to provide subsidizedday care. Current law allows workers to exclude from taxable income up to$5,000 of annual earnings used to pay for dependent care through employer-based programs. If more employer-subsidized dependent care was provided,budgetary savings would fall. To preclude taxpayers from using that alterna-tive, the Congress could limit the use of that fringe benefit (see option REV-12).PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 231 REV-07 INCLUDE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IN THE PHASEOUT OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT Added Revenuesa (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 1.0 2001 1.12002 1.12003 1.22004 1.2 2005 1.2 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 5.6 2000-2009 12.2 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a. Includes outlay savings.Under current law, the earned income tax credit (EITC) is phased out as the larger of earned income or adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds a certainthreshold. To phase out the EITC, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 expandedthe definition of AGI to include tax-exempt interest and nontaxable distribu-tions from pensions, annuities, and individual retirement arrangements notrolled over into similar vehicles. The modified AGI still excludes most transferincome, however. Low-income families with significant transfer income canthus claim the EITC with total income that would reduce or deny the credit tootherwise equivalent families whose income is fully included in their AGI. Forsingle taxpayers with income above $25,000 and joint filers with income above$32,000, AGI includes up to half of Social Security benefits. This optionwould require that taxpayers include all Social Security benefits in a modifiedAGI used to phase out the EITC. That change would increase federal revenuesand decrease outlays for the EITC by a total of $1 billion in 2000 and $12.2 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Counting all Social Security benefits to phase out the EITC would give the same EITC to low-income taxpayers receiving Social Security and claimingthe EITC as that received by otherwise comparable taxpayers whose incomederives entirely from sources fully included in AGI. The Internal RevenueService (IRS) already receives information on taxpayers' Social Security bene-fits, so administering this option would require only minor procedural changes. Because the modified AGI would still exclude some forms of transfer income, however, this option would not remove all differences in EITC forfamilies with the same total income. The IRS does not currently receive infor-mation on most forms of taxpayers' transfer income. As a result, counting alltransfer income would require a substantial expansion of information reportingto the IRS and a marked increase in taxpayers' compliance costs. Furthermore,because most transfer income not included in AGI is means-tested, counting alltransfers in phasing out the EITC would offset, at least in part, the goal of pro-viding income to poor recipients. Even so, excluding any transfers from theincome measure used to phase out the EITC would result in differential treat-ment of otherwise equivalent taxpayers. In addition, counting Social Security benefits for the EITC phaseout would increase compliance costs for Social Security recipients claiming theEITC and would further complicate the already complex form required for theEITC. That would run counter to recent efforts to simplify procedures forclaiming the EITC.232 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-08 LIMIT THE TAX BENEFIT OF ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS TO 15 PERCENT Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 35.9 2001 81.72002 86.52003 91.72004 Committee on Taxation.Current law allows taxpayers to reduce taxable income by the amount of item- ized deductions. Taxpayers who itemize may deduct state and local income andproperty taxes, home mortgage interest payments, contributions to charity,employee business expenses, moving expenses, casualty and theft losses, andmedical and dental expenses. Taxpayers benefit from itemizing if their deduc-tions exceed the standard deduction. Current law limits some itemized deduc-tions to the amount in excess of a percentage of adjusted gross income, and itreduces all itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. The tax benefit of itemized deductions, like all deductions, increases with a taxpayer's marginal tax bracket. For example, $10,000 in itemized deduc- tions would reduce taxes by $1,500 for a taxpayer in the 15 percent taxbracket, $2,800 for a taxpayer in the 28 percent bracket, and $3,960 for a tax-payer in the 39.6 percent bracket. Most taxpayers do not itemize deductions.Of the 30 percent of taxpayers who do itemize, however, about half are in taxbrackets above 15 percent. This option would limit the tax benefit of itemizeddeductions to 15 percent for those higher-bracket taxpayers. The limit wouldincrease revenues by about $393 billion over five years and $988 billion over10 years. Limiting the tax benefit of itemized deductions would make the income tax more progressive by raising average tax rates for most middle- and upper-income taxpayers. The limit might also improve economic efficiency because itwould reduce tax subsidies that lower the after-tax prices of selected goods,such as mortgage-financed, owner-occupied housing. The itemized deductions for health expenses, casualty losses, and em- ployee business expenses, however, are not subsidies of voluntary activities butare instead allowances for costs that reduce the ability to pay income tax.Under this option, some taxpayers would pay tax on income they use to defraysuch costs because they would pay tax on their gross income at rates above 15percent but could deduct only 15 percent of the cost of earning income. Thus,an individual with unusually high medical bills, for example, would pay moretax than another individual with the same ability to pay but low medical bills. Like other limits on itemized deductions, this option would create incen- tives for taxpayers to avoid the limit by converting itemized deductions intoreductions in income. For example, taxpayers might draw down assets to repaymortgages, reducing both income and mortgage payments, or donate time orservices rather than cash to charities. The option would also make calculatingtaxes more complex for itemizers.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 233 REV-09 IMPOSE AN EXCISE TAX ON NONRETIREMENT FRINGE BENEFITS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 5.6 2001 8.32002 8.82003 9.42004 10.0 2000-2009 Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-10, REV-11, and REV-12Unlike employee compensation paid in cash, many fringe benefits are exempt from income and payroll taxes. The exemption of employer-paid health and lifeinsurance premiums from tax w ill cost about $55 billion in income taxes and $40 billion in payroll taxes in 2000. In addition, the law explicitly excludesfrom gross income employer-paid dependent care and miscellaneous benefitssuch as employee discounts and parking valued below a specified limit. Impos-ing an excise tax on fringe benefits would diminish the effects of those exclu-sions. Excluding fringe benefits from gross income effectively subsidizes their cost, leading people to consume more of such benefits than they would if theyhad to pay the full price. As a result, resources may be allocated inefficiently.For example, excluding employer-provided health insurance has contributed tothe large and growing demand for health care services (see option REV-10). Such exclusions are inequitable because individuals whose compensation is paid all in cash pay more tax than others with the same total income paidpartly in fringe benefits. That inequity is exacerbated to the extent that employ-ees' higher demand for fringe benefits drives up their price for people who haveto purchase them with after-tax dollars. Moreover, because the tax exclusion isworth more to taxpayers in higher tax brackets and b ecause higher-income taxpayers receive more fringe benefits than lower-income people, the tax sav-ings from the exclusion are unevenly distributed among income groups. Making all fringe benefits taxable poses difficu lties in valuing benefits and in assigning their value to individual employees. That problem could beavoided by imposing on employers an excise tax on the value of the benefitsthey provide. Those benefits would include the employer's share of healthinsurance (see option REV-10); premiums to fund the first $50,000 of lifeinsurance, the part that is excluded from income (see option REV-11); depend-ent care (see option REV-12); athletic facilities; employee discounts; and park-ing with a value up to the amount above which it is currently taxed. (U nder current law, employees must include in taxable income in 1999 the marketvalue in excess of $175 per month of any parking provided free of charge by anemployer.) A 3 percent excise tax imposed on fringe benefits, for example,would raise $101.7 billion from 2000 through 2009. The bulk of those reve-nues would come from taxing employer-paid health insurance. This option would require that employers know only their total fringe benefit costs, not the value of benefits paid to each employee. Because theexcise tax rate would be much lower than the tax rate on wages, this optionwould maintain most of the incentive for employers to provide fringe benefitsinstead of taxable wages. An excise tax on employers would be relatively morefavorable to employees in higher-wage firms than including fringe benefits inemployees' taxable income because the excise tax rate would not rise with em-ployees' income.234 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-10 LIMIT THE TAX EXEMPTION OF EMPLOYER-PAID HEALTH INSURANCE Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Income TaxPayroll Tax Annual 2000 6.2 3.9 2001 9.7 6.12002 10.8 6.82003 12.1 7.62004 13.6 8.5 2005 15.2 RELATED OPTION : REV-09 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : The Tax Treatment of Employment- Based Health Insurance (Study), March 1994.Employees do not pay taxes on income they receive in the form of employer- paid health insurance. In addition, health insurance premiums and health carecosts paid through cafeteria plans are generally excludable from income andpayroll taxes. Those exclusions will reduce income tax revenues and payrolltax revenues by a total of about $92 billion in 2000. One way to limit the exclusion would be to treat as taxable income for employees any employer contributions for health insurance plus health carecosts paid through cafeteria plans that exceed $425 a month for family cover-age and $175 a month for individual coverage. Those amounts are estimatedaverage contributions for 2000 and would be indexed to reflect future increasesin the general level of prices. The option would increase income tax revenuesby $149 billion and payroll tax revenues by $93.7 billion over the 2000-2009period. Including employer-paid health care coverage in the Social Securitywage base, however, would lead to increased outlays for Social Security bene-fits in the future that could offset a significant part of the added payroll taxrevenues from this option over the long run. This option would eliminate the tax incentive to purchase additional cov- erage beyond the ceiling. Employees would have more incentive to economizein the medical marketplace, which could reduce both upward pressure on medi-cal care prices and the provision of unnecessary or marginal services. Theoption would index the ceiling amounts to the overall inflation rate, and sincehealth care costs have been rising faster than that, it could constrain health carecosts even more over time. The Congress has already limited the exclusion foremployer-paid group term life insurance in a similar way. One disadvantage of limiting the tax exemption of employer-paid medical insurance premiums is the difficulty of determining when extensive coveragebecomes excessive. In addition, the level of coverage purchased by a givenpremium depends on such factors as geographic location and the characteristicsof a firm's workforce. As a result, a uniform ceiling would have uneven effects.Finally, if health insurance costs continued to rise faster than the general levelof prices, indexing to reflect that level would gradually reduce subsidies foremployer-paid health insurance. Taken together, those factors could increasethe number of workers without health insurance and generate inequities amongtaxpayers by region and type of employer.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 235 REV-11 INCLUDE EMPLOYER-PAID LIFE INSURANCE IN TAXABLE INCOME Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Income TaxPayroll Tax Annual 2000 1.0 0.6 2001 1.5 0.92002 1.5 0.92003 1.6 1.02004 1.6 1.0 2005 1.7 1.0 2006 1.7 1.12007 1.8 1.12008 1.9 1.12009 1.9 1.2 Cumulative 2000-2004 7.2 4.4 2000-2009 16.2 9.9 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-09 and REV-15Tax law excludes from taxable income the premiums that employers pay for group term life insurance but limits the exclusion to the cost of the first $50,000of insurance. The exclusion is not available to the self-employed. Employer-paid life insurance is the third most expensive tax-advantaged fringe benefit(after health insurance, discussed in option REV-10, and pensions). Includingemployer-paid premiums in taxable income would add $16.2 billion to incometax revenues and $9.9 billion to payroll tax revenues from 2000 through 2009. Like the tax exclusion for other employment-based fringe benefits, the tax exclusion for life insurance creates a subsidy for the fringe benefit, whichcauses people to purchase more life insurance than they would if they had topay the full cost themselves. Furthermore, the tax exclusion allows workerswhose employers purchase life insurance for them to pay less tax than workerswho have the same total compensation but must purchase insurance on theirown (see option REV-09). In addition, the value of employer-paid life insur-ance, unlike some other fringe benefits, could be accurately measured and allo-cated. Employers could report the premiums they paid for each employee onthe employee's W-2 form and compute withholding in the same way as forwages. Indeed, employers already withhold taxes on life insurance premiumsthat fund death benefits above the $50,000 limit. A tax subsidy to provide life insurance might be called for, however, if people buy too little life insurance because they systematically underestimatethe potential financial hardship to their families resulting from their death. Butwhether people purchase too little insurance for that reason is unclear. More-over, even if it was clear, a more efficient way of allocating resources might beto provide a direct tax subsidy to all purchasers of life insurance and avoidlimiting the subsidy to insurance provided by employers.236 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-12 ELIMINATE THE EMPLOYER EXCLUSION FOR DEPENDENT CARE Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.1 2001 0.22002 0.32003 0.32004 0.3 2005 0.4 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 1.2 2000-2009 3.3 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-06 and REV-09The tax system provides two types of subsidies for child and other dependent care expenses of working taxpayers. Those subsidies are provided as exclu-sions from income paid to an employee or as a tax credit for those not usingemployment-based subsidies. Although those subsidies provide benefits for thesame activities, the value of the subsidy from employer-based exclusions canbe much larger than that provided under the child and dependent care credit.Eliminating the exclusions and making all tax benefits for child and dependentcare available only through the credit would increase revenues by $3.3 billionfrom 2000 through 2009. Employers may exclude up to $5,000 for child and dependent care ex- penses from the taxable wages of their employees, either as care provided di-rectly by the employer or as other-than-employer care if the employer has es-tablished a qualified plan. The maximum exclusion amount is limited to ataxpayer's earnings or the earnings of the lesser-earning spouse for marriedtaxpayers, and\u2014as with all types of exclusions\u2014the value of the exclusiondepends on the marginal tax rate of the taxpayer. The exclusion also reducesemployers' and employees' liability for Social Security and Medicare payrolltaxes. Taxpayers who do not receive employment-based subsidies may claim a nonrefundable income tax credit, limited to expenses of $2,400 for one depend-ent and $4,800 for two or more de pendents. As with the exclusi on, the total amount of qualifying expenses may not exceed the earnings of the taxpayer or,in the case of a couple, the lower-earning spouse. The credit rate per dollar ofqualifying expenses is 30 percent for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income(AGI) is under $10,000 and is phased down to 20 percent for taxpayers whoseAGI is over $28,000. Most taxpayers receive the 20 percent rate with a result-ing maximum credit of $480 for one child and $960 for two or more children.In 1996, about 6 million taxpayers claimed $2.5 billion in credits. Even though they subsidize the same activities, the credit and the exclu- sion provide significantly different benefits. For example, a high-income tax-payer with one child may receive an income tax benefit of up to $1,980 underthe employer exclusion but only $480 under the credit. In addition, the exclu-sion reduces payroll taxes, but no such benefit is available with the credit.Eliminating the exclusion would provide equitable treatment for taxpayers withsimilar dependent care circumstances regardless of whether their employer hasestablished a qualifying exclusion program. In addition, it would reduce com-plexity by simplifying taxpayer calculations. However, eliminating the exclusion would reduce the total subsidies available for dependent care expenses and could induce some workers (particu-larly second earners in couples) to leave the labor force. If dependent care isconsidered a cost of employment, then eliminating the exclusion may be inap-propriate since some costs of employment are excludable.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 237 REV-13 INCLUDE THE INCOME-REPLACEMENT PORTION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND BLACK LUNG BENEFITSIN TAXABLE INCOME Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 5.0 2001 5.32002 5.52003 5.72004 6.0 2005 6.2 27.5 Committee on Taxation.Current law exempts workers' compensation and Black L ung benefits from income tax. Taxing the portion of those benefits that replaces the income em-ployees lose from work-related injuries or black lung disease would increaserevenues by $60.8 billion from 2000 through 2009. The remaining portion ofbenefits, which reimburses employees for their medical costs (about 40 per-cent), would continue to be exempt from taxation. Taxing the income-replacement portion of those benefits would make their tax treatment comparable with that of unemployment benefits and the wage-replacement benefits that employers provide through sick pay and disabilitypensions. It would also improve work incentives for disabled workers who areable to return to work. (Under current law, the after-tax value of the wagesthey are able to earn may be less than the tax-free benefits they receive whiledisabled.) An argument against taxing such benefits is that legal or insurance settle- ments for non-work-related injuries are not taxable, even if a portion of themreimburses lost income. Taxing workers' compensation benefits would beinconsistent with that approach. Furthermore, if the current levels of wage-replacement benefits were established under the assumption that they would not be taxed, this optionwould reduce benefits below desired levels. Enacting the option might there-fore lead to efforts to increase benefits, thereby potentially reducing the budgetsurplus.238 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-14-A INCLUDE 85 PERCENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND RAILROAD RETIREMENT BENEFITS IN TAXABLE INCOME FOR ALL RECIPIENTS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 8.6 2001 21.92002 22.82003 23.62004 24.4 2005 101.3 2000-2009 : REV-14-B, REV-14-C, and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Reducing Entitlement Spending (Study), September 1994.Under current law, most benefits from Social Security and Railroad Retirement are not subject to tax. Only if the sum of adjusted gross income (AGI), nontax-able interest income, and one-half of Social Security and Tier I benefits exceedsa fixed threshold does a recipient pay tax on any benefits. If that sum exceeds$25,000 for single returns or $32,000 for joint returns, up to 50 percent ofbenefits are subject to tax. Above a second set of thresholds\u2014$34,000 (single)and $44,000 (joint)\u2014up to 85 percent of benefits are subject to tax. A bout one-third of households receiving Social Security will pay income tax on someportion of their benefits in 2000, and about one-half of those households willpay tax on 85 percent of their benefits. Because the thresholds remain fixedover time, as nominal incomes increase, the percentage of households that paytax on benefits will grow to 36 percent in 2004. Bills to remove the 85 percentrate were proposed in 1998 but were not enacted. Requiring all beneficiaries to include 85 percent of their benefits in their AGI would raise $233.6 billion from 2000 through 2009. That change wouldincrease the share of recipients paying tax on their benefits from 32 percent to74 percent. Other features of the tax code would continue to exempt about one-fourth of elderly households from taxation. Eliminating the thresholds would reduce tax disparities among middle- income households. Social Security beneficiaries receive a tax preference notavailable to other taxpayers because they may exclude a portion of their in-come\u2014benefits below the thresholds\u2014from AGI. As a result, middle-incomeelderly families pay less tax than nonelderly families with comparable income. This option would treat Social Security roughly the same as contributory pension plans. Workers receiving benefits from the latter pay income tax onthe excess of benefits over their own contributions. Social Security actuariesestimate that among workers now entering the labor force, employee-paid pay-roll taxes will amount to no more than 15 percent of expected benefits. Thus,85 percent is the minimum fraction of benefits in excess of past contributions. Retirees might consider increased taxes on benefits to violate the implicit promises of the Social Security and Railroad Retirement programs. The gov-ernment has, however, changed the Social Security and Railroad Retirementprograms often, altering the benefit formula, introducing partial taxation ofbenefits, and raising payroll tax rates to finance the programs. Finally, in-creased taxation of benefits is one way to apply a means test to program pay-ments.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 239 REV-14-B INCLUDE 85 PERCENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND RAILROAD RETIREMENT BENEFITS IN TAXABLE INCOME FOR HIGHER-INCOME RECIPIENTS AND INCLUDE 50 PERCENT FOR ALLOTHER RECIPIENTS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 4.1 2001 10.52002 10.92003 11.32004 11.6 : REV-14-A, REV-14-C, and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Reducing Entitlement Spending (Study), September 1994.Under current law, low-income Social Security recipients pay no income tax on their benefits.

Almost all beneficiaries currently taxed on up to 50percent of their benefits\u2014couples with combined income between $32,000 and$44,000 and individuals with combined income between $25,000 and $34,000\u2014would be unaffected. (Because the taxation of benefits is phased in undercurrent law, some couples with combined income just above $32,000 and sin-gles with income just above $25,000 are now taxed on less than a full 50 per-cent of their benefits.) Compared with the previous option (REV-14-A), this proposal would protect a larger share of benefits received by lower-income beneficiaries fromtaxation. Roughly 39 percent of beneficiaries would continue to pay no taxes,compared with about 26 percent under the previous option. Under this option, however, beneficiaries with somewhat higher income (whose benefits now are taxed at less than 50 percent) would receive lowerafter-tax benefits. Any such reduction in benefits might be viewed by recipi-ents as violating promises made during their working years about the benefitsthey could expect to receive during retirement.240 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-14-C INCLUDE 85 PERCENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND RAILROAD RETIREMENT BENEFITS IN TAXABLE INCOME FOR HIGHER-INCOME RECIPIENTS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 2.5 2001 5.22002 5.62003 6.02004 6.5 2005 7.0 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 25.8 2000-2009 66.6 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-14-A, REV-14-B, and REV-16 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Reducing Entitlement Spending (Study), September 1994.Under current law, low-income Social Security recipients pay no income tax on their benefits. Recipients with modified adjusted gross income (AGI) above$25,000 ($32,000 for joint filers) pay tax on up to half of their Social Securitybenefits; those with modified AGI above $34,000 ($44,000 for joint filers)must include up to 85 percent of their benefits in taxable income (see optionREV-14-A). This option would continue to exempt the Social Security benefitsof low-income recipients from taxation but require recipients with modifiedAGI above $25,000 ($32,000 for joint filers) to include up to 85 percent oftheir benefits in AGI. It would raise $66.6 billion from 2000 through 2009.Moreover, it would almost exclusively affect individuals with income between$25,000 and $34,000 and couples with modified income between $32,000 and$44,000. Few of the 70 percent of all recipients whose benefits are not now subject to the income tax would be taxed under this option. Because 85 percent ratherthan 50 percent of benefits would be included in modified AGI measuredagainst the thresholds, some of those beneficiaries who now fall just below thethresholds would move above them and have a portion of their benefits subjectto tax. Like option REV-14-A, this option would treat Social Security benefits the same as private pensions, taxing roughly that portion of benefits that ex-ceeds the recipient's own contributions. But by maintaining the thresholds,lower-income recipients would continue to receive the favorable tax treatmentnow accorded to their Social Security benefits. Continuing to have thresholds, however, would also maintain some disin- centive for workers to save for their retirements. Recipients whose benefits areonly partly over the taxable threshold face increased effective taxes on incomefrom savings. An additional dollar of interest income, for example, would incurnot only an income tax on that dollar but would also make an additional 85cents of Social Security benefits subject to tax by pushing that additionalamount over the threshold. The dollar of interest income would thus face aneffective tax rate 1.85 times that incurred by a person whose benefits are eithertaxed fully or not at all. Therefore, a taxpayer in the 15 percent tax bracketwould owe an additional $27.75 of tax on $100 more of interest income. Al-though current law also has a disincentive to saving, its effect would be exacer-bated by the increase in the share of benefits subject to taxation above thethresholds from 50 percent to 85 percent.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 241 REV-15 INCLUDE INVESTMENT INCOME FROM LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES IN TAXABLE INCOME Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 11.3 2001 22.92002 23.62003 24.32004 25.1 Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-11Life insurance policies and annuities often combine features of both insurance and tax-favored savings accounts. The investment income from the savings,sometimes called \"inside buildup,\" is not taxed until it is paid out to the policy-holder. If it is left to the policyholder's estate or used to pay for life insurance,it can escape taxation entirely. Under this option, life insurance companies would notify policyholders annually of the investment income realized on their account, just as mutualfunds do now. Individuals would include those amounts in their taxable in-come. Life insurance disbursements and annuity benefits would no longer betaxable as they were paid. Making the investment income taxable in that waywould raise almost $245 billion in 2000 through 2009. Investment incomefrom annuities purchased as part of a qualified pension plan or qualified indi-vidual retirement account would still be tax-deferred until benefits were paid. The tax deferral currently allowed for life insurance and annuities is simi- lar to the deferral allowed for unrealized capital gains income. Taxing theinvestment income from life insurance and annuities annually would equalizetheir tax treatment with that of a bank account, taxable bond, or mutual fund. A tax incentive to purchase life insurance is desirable if people system- atically underestimate the financial hardship on spouses and families caused bytheir own death. Such shortsightedness could cause them to buy too little lifeinsurance. Similarly, it might cause people to buy too little annuity insurance toprotect them against ou tliving their assets. But it is not currently known whether people would buy too little insurance without the tax incentive or theextent to which the tax incentive might increase the amount of life insurance orannuity coverage purchased. If the incentive is justified to correct for people'sshortsightedness rather than subsidize the inside buildup, a better policy mightbe to subsidize life insurance directly by allowing a tax credit or partial deduc-tion for insurance premiums. Annuities receive other tax incentives through thespecial tax treatment of pensions and retirement savings. A tax preference for inside buildup in life insurance policies and annuities has an uncertain effect on savi ng. It may encourage saving because it would increase people's income when they are older for each dollar they saved whenthey were younger. The tax preference might, however, reduce saving becauseit also enables people to save less when they are younger without reducing theirexpected income when they are older.242 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-16 INCLUDE AN INCOME-RELATED PORTION OF THE INSURANCE VALUE OF MEDICARE BENEFITS INTAXABLE INCOME Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Tax HI OnlyTax SMI OnlyTax Both Annual 2000 3.0 1.8 4.9 2001 7.5 4.8 12.72002 8.0 5.4 13.82003 8.6 6.2 15.22004 9.3 7.1 16.8 2005 10.3 8.0 18.8 2006 11.3 9.1 21.02007 12.5 10.3 23.42008 13.7 11.6 26.02009 15.0 13.1 63.4 77.6 181.5 SOURCE: on Taxation. HI = Hospital Insurance; SMI = Supplementary 570-18, 570-19-A, and 570-19-B RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Reducing Entitlement Spending (Study), September 1994.Even though Social Security benefits are at least partially taxable under current law (see options REV-14-A, REV-14-B, and REV-14-C), Medicare benefitsare not subject to tax. This option would include 85 percent of the insurancevalue of Hospital Insurance (HI) and 75 percent of the insurance value of Sup-plementary Medical Insurance (SMI) in adjusted gross income (AGI), to theextent that combined income (AGI plus nontaxable interest income plus one-half of Social Security, Railroad Retirement, and Medicare benefits) exceeds$34,000 for single returns and $44,000 for joint returns. Administering thisoption would be straightforward because a mechanism is already in place fortaxing Social Security benefits. (The percentages roughly represent the shareof program costs not paid for by recipients through either payroll taxes duringtheir working years or SMI premiums.) Taxpayers with combined incomebelow those thresholds but above $25,000 (single) and $32,000 (joint) wouldinclude 50 percent of the insurance value of both HI and SMI in AGI. Taxpay-ers with lower income would be unaffected. Because the thresholds are notindexed for inflation, however, a larger fraction of Medicare insurance benefitswould become taxable over time. From 2000 through 2009, the HI tax alone would increase federal reve- nues by $99.3 billion, and the SMI tax alone would yield $77.6 billion. Impos-ing both taxes simultaneously would raise revenues by a bout $181.5 billion over 10 years. The combined tax would generate more revenue than the sum ofthe HI and SMI taxes because some taxpayers would face higher tax rates astheir AGI increased. In addition, combining HI and SMI taxes would movemore enrollees above the threshold. Earmarking revenues from taxing HI benefits for the HI trust fund would delay the deficit of the trust fund projected for 2007. A tax on SMI benefitswould shift some SMI costs from taxpayers to enrollees. Using income thresh-olds would leave lower-income enrollees unaffected. In fact, because manyenrollees do not have to pay income taxes, this proposal would affect onlyabout 34 percent of enrollees in 2000. Because the tax would apply to in-kind benefits rather than cash income, some enrollees might object that the additional income does not generate cashwith which to pay the tax liability. An alternative option would forgo income thresholds and include 85 per- cent of the insurance value of HI benefits and 75 percent of the insurance valueof SMI in AGI for all taxpayers. With no income thresholds, the HI and SMItaxes would raise $293.6 billion over the 2000-2009 period.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 243 REV-17 RAISE THE AGE LIMIT FOR THE KIDDIE TAX FROM 14 TO 18 FOR TAXING INVESTMENT INCOME Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 a 2001 0.12002 0.12003 0.12004 0.1 2005 0.2 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 0.4 2000-2009 1.5 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a. Gain of less than $50 million.Under current law, investment income received by a dependent child under age 14 in excess of specified limits is subject to federal income tax at the parents'marginal tax rate. In 1998, the applicable limit was $1,400. The provision\u2014often referred to as the \"kiddie tax\"\u2014is intended to limit the ability of parentsto reduce the income tax on investment income by transferring ownership ofassets to their young children. It does not, however, preclude parents fromreducing their tax bills by giving investment assets to children older than 13.This option would raise from 14 to 18 the age limit below which a child's in-vestment income is taxed at parents' rates. It would increase income tax reve-nues by $1.5 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Extending the kiddie tax to older children would help prevent parents from sheltering assets to reduce their tax liability. Under current law, income fromassets in the name of a child over age 13 is taxed at the child's rate, generally15 percent, rather than at the parents' tax rate, which can be as high as 39.6percent. On annual asset income of $10,000, for example, that difference cancut the family's tax bill from $3,960 to $1,500, or more than 60 percent. Raising the age for the \"kiddie tax\" to 18 could lead to higher taxes on the income of assets properly owned by children older than 13. Not all assets areowned by older children because their parents want to shelter investment in-come by shifting assets into their children's names. An older child may haveearned and saved substantial funds for many years, in which case it is reason-able that the income from those assets should be taxed at the child's rate ratherthan the parents' rate. Imposing the parents' higher rate could discourage teen-agers from saving earnings or monetary gifts. Furthermore, a policy that dis-courages young people's saving would conflict with the intent of recent legisla-tion designed to promote saving for higher education.244 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-18 EXPAND MEDICARE COVERAGE TO INCLUDE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES NOT NOW COVERED Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 1.1 2001 1.42002 1.42003 1.32004 1.2 2005 1.2 Cumulative 2000-2004 6.4 2000-2009 11.3Certain groups of state and l ocal government employees are not covered by Medicare, despite expansions of coverage in 1985 and 1990. (All federal em-ployees have been covered since 1983, as required by the Tax Equity and Fis-cal Responsibility Act of 1982.) The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconcili-ation Act of 1985 mandated that state and local employees who began workafter March 31, 1986, pay Medicare payroll taxes, but it did not make coveragemandatory for those hired before that date. The Omnibus Budget Reconcilia-tion Act of 1990 expanded Medicare coverage to include all state and localgovernment employees not covered by any retirement plan. Under current law, many state and local employees will qualify for Medi- care benefits on the basis of other employment in covered jobs or their spouse'semployment. Those employees will receive b enefits as if they had worked continuously in covered employment. One out of six state and local employeesis not covered by Medicare through employment, but about 85 percent of thosenot covered receive Medicare benefits through their spouse or because of workin covered employment. Requiring all state and local employees to pay Medicare payroll taxes would make their coverage resemble that of federal employees. Broader cover-age would reduce the inequity from the high benefits those employees receive inrelation to payroll taxes paid. Expanding Medicare coverage to include morestate and local employees would increase the government's liability for futureprogram benefits. The additional revenues, however, would most likely morethan offset increased benefits permanently. Expanding Medicare coverage to include state and local government employees who began work before April 1, 1986, would raise $11.3 billionfrom 2000 through 2009. The annual revenue gain would decline gradually asemployees who were hired before April 1986 leave state and local governmentpayrolls.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 245 REV-19 MAKE CALCULATION OF TAXABLE WAGES FOR SELF- EMPLOYED PEOPLE EQUIVALENT TO CALCULATIONFOR OTHER WORKERS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) On- BudgetOff- Budget Annual 2000 0.2 0.1 2001 0.2 0.12002 0.2 0.12003 0.2 0.12004 0.2 0.1 2005 0.2 0.1 2006 0.2 0.12007 0.2 0.12008 0.3 0.12009 0.3 0.2 Cumulative 2000-2004 1.0 0.6 2000-2009 2.0 1.3Social Security and Medicare taxes come in two forms: the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) tax paid on wages and the Self-Employment Contri-bution Act (SECA) tax paid on self-employment income. For FICA taxes,employees and employers each pay a 6.2 percent Social Security tax on wagesup to a taxable maximum ($72,600 in 1999) and a 1.45 percent Medicare taxon all wages. Until 1983, the SECA rate was explicitly set lower than the combined employer and employee FICA rate. As part of the Social Security Amendmentsof 1983, the Congress increased effective SECA rates starting in 1984. Theconference comm ittee said that the law was \"designed to achieve parity be- tween employees and the self-employed\" beginning in 1990. Nonetheless, thecurrent method for calculating SECA taxes allows a self-employed taxpayer topay less tax than a non-self-employed worker with the same nominal income.For example, an employee earning $50,000 and his or her employer each pay$3,825 in FICA taxes, so that employee's total compensation is $53,825 and thetotal FICA tax But self-employed sibling also earnstotal compensation of $53,825, under current law that person would pay only$7,605 in SECA taxes, $45 less than the non-self-employed sibling would pay. For people with earnings above the taxable maximum, the amount of Social Security tax paid is the same for the self-employed and the non-self- employed; however, the amount of Medicare tax paid is less for the self-em-ployed. For example, an employee earning $100,000 and his or her employereach pay $4,501 in Social Security taxes and $1,450 in Medicare taxes, so thatemployee's total compensation is $105,951 and the total FICA tax is $11,902.That person's self-employed sibling\u2014with the same total compensation\u2014paysthe same maximum Social Security tax but a Medicare tax of only $2,838, or$62 less. High-income, self-employed taxpayers may have a SECA Medicaretax liability as much as 6.3 percent less than that of non-self-employed taxpay-ers. That difference has existed since 1991, when the Congress first set the Medicare taxable maximum higher than the Social Security taxable maximum.Correcting the difference would require a slight addition to Schedule SE, but itwould directly affect only self-employed taxpayers with income above the tax-able maximum. Changing the SECA calculation formula would increase on-budget reve- nues by $2 billion from 2000 to 2009. Off-budget SECA revenues, which aredeposited into the Social Security trust funds, would increase by $1.3 billion.246 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-20 ELIMINATE THE SOURCE RULES EXCEPTION FOR INVENTORY SALES Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 1.4 2001 2.92002 3.12003 3.32004 3.6 2005 3.8 2000-2004 14.3 2000-2009 36.5 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-21Under current law, income allocation rules can provide a subsidy for the export of U.S.-made products of some multinational corporations. The \"title passage\"rule, which specifies the allocation of income between domestic and foreignbusiness activities, routinely allows U.S. multinational corporations to useexcess foreign tax credits to offset about half of the U.S. tax on their exportincome by characterizing it as foreign-source income, even if the inventory ispurchased in the United States and the income from the sale is not subject toforeign tax. U.S. corporations generally pay U.S. tax on their worldwide income. Corporations are allowed a tax credit against their U.S. tax liability on foreignincome for the amount of income tax paid abroad on that income. The credit islimited to the U.S. tax liability that would have been assessed on that income.If the corporation paid more foreign tax on foreign income than it would havepaid on otherwise identical domestic income, the firm has excess foreign taxcredits. The title passage rule allows a company with excess foreign tax creditsto classify more of its export income as foreign source than it could justifysolely on the basis of the location of its business activities, implicitly giving thecompany an export subsidy. About half of the export income of such compa-nies is effectively exempted from U.S. tax. Replacing the title passage rulewith an activity-based rule, which would apportion income on the basis ofactual economic activity, would increase tax revenues by $1.4 billion in 2000and by $36.5 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Export subsidies increase investment and employment in export indus- tries, but most economists agree that such subsidies do not increase the overalllevels of domestic investment and domestic employment as a result of foreign-exchange effects that cause imports to increase as much as exports. That re-duces investment and employment in import-competing industries in the UnitedStates. Export subsidies distort the allocation of resources domestically andabroad and result in the United States receiving fewer imports in exchange forexports. In addition, the existing rule gives U.S. multinational exporters acompetitive advantage over U.S. exporters that conduct all of their businessdomestically. Current allocation rules make U.S. corporations with excessforeign tax credits more competitive with foreign corporations operating in thesame markets; U.S. corporations without foreign tax credits do not receive thatadvantage. Finally, the U.S. income tax treaty system, established since thetitle passage rule was enacted 70 years ago, often protects U.S. export salesincome from local taxation in the country where the goods are sold. Becauseexport sales income is not usually subject to foreign tax, it may not be appropri-ate to allow foreign tax credits to be used to offset U.S. tax liability on thatincome.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 247 REV-21 TREAT FOREIGN SALES CORPORATIONS LIKE OTHER FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 1.0 2001 2.12002 2.32003 2.52004 2.7 2005 2.9 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 10.6 2000-2009 27.1 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-20The tax code subsidizes U.S. exports through rules for foreign sales corpora- tions (FSCs). Those rules offer U.S. companies an opportunity to exempt about15 percent of their export income from U.S. tax by characterizing it as incomeof a foreign subsidiary that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade orbusiness. According to a decision by the governing council of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), export income can be exempted fromU.S. tax only if the economic activity that produces the income takes placeoutside the United States. In response to the GATT decision, the Congressamended the tax code to allow U.S. companies to charter FSCs in low-taxcountries and either supply goods to the FSCs for resale abroad or pay commis-sions to them on export sales. Many FSCs are largely paper corporations with very few employees. Under the tax code, when a U.S. company sells exports through an FSC, about23 percent of the total income from production and marketing is attributed tothe FSC and about 65 percent of the FSC's export income is exempt from U.S.tax. The exempt income, which is approximately 15 percent of the income fromthe sale, remains free from U.S. tax when the company receives it as a dividendfrom the FSC. The rules provide an incentive for U.S. taxpayers to locate in-vestment domestically. Export subsidies, such as FSCs, reduce global economic welfare and may even reduce the welfare of the country granting the subsidy, even though do-mestic export-producing industries may benefit. FSC rules may reduce theincentive for U.S. corporations to move economic activity, such as manufactur-ing, abroad. However, the effects of export subsidies on foreign exchange,which raise the value of the dollar and lower the cost of imports, cause importsand exports to increase. Consequently, companies in import-competing indus-tries reduce domestic investment and employment. This option would curtail the subsidy resulting from FSC rules by treating FSCs like other foreign subsidiaries. In general, all of the income repatriatedfrom FSCs would be subject to U.S. tax. The tax on any income from an FSCthat was deemed foreign-source income could be offset by unused foreign taxcredits. This option would increase tax revenues by $1 billion in 2000 and by$27.1 billion over the 2000-2009 period.248 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-22 MAKE FOREIGN SUBNATIONAL TAXES DEDUCTIBLE RATHER THAN CREDITABLE Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 2.3 2001 4.82002 5.02003 5.32004 5.5 2005 22.7 Committee on Taxation.Under current law, U.S.-owned corporations deduct U.S. state and local income taxes from taxable income, but they receive tax credits for income taxes paid toforeign governments, including foreign subnational governments, such as states,cities, and provinces. That may favor foreign over domestic investment if thecombination of federal and local income taxes imposed on domestic incomeexceeds the foreign tax imposed on the same type and amount of foreign-sourceincome. U.S. local income taxes are only deductible against U.S. federal in-come taxes; however, all foreign income taxes generally can be credited againstU.S. federal income taxes. That situation may affect the decisions of U.S.taxpayers regarding whether to invest here or abroad. This option would equalize the tax treatment of domestic and foreign subnational income taxes by allowing corporations to credit foreign taxes to theextent that they exceed a fixed percentage of foreign-source income or a fixedpercentage of foreign income taxes. The fixed percentage would be set to re-flect the overall U.S. ratio of local to federal income taxes. Taxes for whichcredits are denied under this option would be deducted from foreign-sourcegross income to yield foreign-source taxable income. The rule could defer to oroverride existing tax treaties. Making the federal tax treatment of foreign subnational income tax pay- ments consistent with the tax treatment of domestic state and local income taxpayments would increase tax revenues by $2.3 billion in 2000 and $54.9 billionover the 2000-2009 period. It would also level the playing field between do-mestic and foreign investment: it would reduce the slight incentive that U.S.-based multinational corporations have to make additional investments in coun-tries where the overall level of foreign income tax on a foreign investment islower than the combination of U.S. federal and local tax on domestic invest-ment. In turn, equalizing the tax rates between foreign and domestic investmentwould increase the economic effici ency of the international allocation of capital. In some cases, however, removing the creditability of foreign subnational income taxes would make U.S. corporations operating in a foreign country lesscompetitive with other foreign corporations operating in that country. In addi-tion, firms would probably reduce their repatriation of income from prior over-seas investments to avoid paying the additional U.S. tax required under theprovision. Finally, if foreign countries implemented similar rules for the U.S.-earned income of their corporations, the amount of capital flowing into theUnited States might decline.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 249 REV-23-A INCLUDE ACCRUED CAPITAL GAINS IN THE LAST INCOME TAX RETURN OF THE DECEASED Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 a 2001 11.22002 12.02003 10.52004 8.6 2005 42.3 2000-2009 78.1 SOURCE: Committee on Taxation. a. Gain of less than $50 million. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-04, REV-23-B, and REV-24A capital gain or loss is the difference between the current value of a capital asset and the owner's basis. The owner's basis is the initial cost of the assetplus the cost of any subsequent improvements and minus any deductions fordepreciation. When a capital asset is sold, tax law normally requires that theowner include any realized gain in taxable income. The owner may deduct anyrealized losses against realized gains, and when the owner has no gains inexcess of losses, he or she may deduct up to $3,000 of the loss against otherincome. An exception occurs when an owner holds an asset until death. In that case, tax law allows the inheritor to \"step up\" the basis to the asset's value as ofthe date of the decedent's death. When the asset is sold, the inheritor paysincome tax on the gain that accrued after the decedent's death. The gain that accrued before the decedent's death is permanently excluded from taxable in-come. The estate of the decedent may pay taxes under the separate estate tax,but that tax applies equally to assets on which the decedent previously paidincome tax and to assets with accrued capital gains that had escaped incometaxation. Stepping up basis at death provides a tax break for capital gains income not available for other income such as wages, interest, and rental income. Thatencourages people to hold assets until death that they would have preferred tosell earlier. If holding those assets until death offered less of a tax benefit,people would feel freer to adjust their asset holdings as their circumstanceschanged. Furthermore, stepping up basis at death has spawned many tax-shel-tering schemes in which, for example, people borrow against their assets forcurrent consumption but have the loan paid off by selling the assets after theydie. A disadvantage of taxing gains at death is that the tax might force the decedent's family to sell assets to pay the tax. Sales of illiquid assets at aninopportune time can reduce their value substantially. Forcing heirs to sell afamily farm or business would impose a particular hardship on families wantingto continue the enterprise. Another disadvantage of taxing gains at death is thatthe decedent may have left inadequate documentation of the asset's basis. Taxing accrued but unrealized gains on the final income tax return of the decedent would raise about $78.1 billion from 2000 through 2009. This optionwould exclude gains on assets that a spouse inherits. Instead, the spouse wouldassume the basis of the decedent and pay tax on the full gain only when theasset was sold. Any gains on assets that the decedent left to charity would alsobe exempt. This option also includes special provisions to defer taxes for fam-ily businesses, allow use of the exclusion for gains on a home, and excludesmall gains on personal property. About 10 percent of decedents would owetaxes on accrued gains on their final income tax return. Finally, taxes paid ongains realized at death would be deductible under the estate tax.250 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-23-B ENACT CARRYOVER BASIS FOR CAPITAL GAINS HELD UNTIL DEATH Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 a 2001 0.92002 1.72003 2.82004 3.9 2005 5.2 2000-2004 9.3 2000-2009 44.4 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a.

Under this option, heirs would adoptthe basis of the decedent on assets they inherit. The decedent's capital gainswould then be taxed when the heirs sold the assets. To allow for inadequaterecordkeeping by decedents on an asset's basis, the option would allow heirs toset the basis of an inherited asset at 50 percent of the asset's current value. Inaddition, if the decedent's estate paid any estate tax, shares of that tax would beadded to the basis of all of the estate's assets in proportion to the assets' share ofthe estate's value. This option would raise roughly $44.4 billion from 2000through 2009. Carryover basis would avoid a major disadvantage of taxing gains on the final income tax return of the d eceased: the heirs would not be faced with an overwhelming tax bill that could force the sale of the assets at an inopportunetime. Carryover basis could also ease the way for a family seeking to continueto operate the deceased's business. But it would not ease the problem of inade-quate recordkeeping by the deceased, except to the extent that the 50 percentrule suggested above would create a safe harbor. Carryover basis would achieve some of the objectives of taxing gains on the final tax return of the deceased. It would make most gains held at deathtaxable eventually, removing some of the inequity that arises from never taxinggains held until death. Furthermore, it would reduce the barrier to adjustingasset holdings before death as circumstances change. Finally, it would reducethe rewards to tax shelters that provide access to investment funds before deathwithout an outright sale of the asset until after death. Carryover basis wouldsucceed less in achieving those objectives than would taxing gains at death,however, because it would still provide the benefits of deferral for heirs whocould afford to postpone the sale of inherited assets with large capital gains. Gains held until death have always been exempt from income tax. The Congress enacted a carryover basis in the Tax Reform Act of 1976 but post-poned it in 1978 and repealed it in 1980. Therefore, it never took effect. Theprimary objection voiced in the Congress at the time carryover basis was re-pealed was that recordkeeping by many asset owners would be inadequate fortheir heirs to document basis.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 251 REV-24 ELIMINATE LIKE-KIND EXCHANGES Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.1 2001 0.62002 0.62003 0.62004 0.6 2005 0.7 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 2.5 2000-2009 6.0 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-04, REV-23-A, and REV-23-BThe tax law requires that people who sell or exchange capital assets report any capital gain or loss as income. An exception occurs for exchanges of certainlike-kind assets, mainly real estate. No gain or loss is recognized if propertyheld for productive use in a trade or business or for investment is exchanged forproperty of a like kind that is to be held for the same reasons. In those ex-changes, the gain in the original property carries over to the new property, andits recognition is deferred until the new property is sold. Like-kind real estateassets are broadly defined as any properties located in the United States. Exchanges can involve the concurrent swapping of like-kind property between two owners, but in many exchanges a single owner sells one propertyto a second party and purchases a replacement property from a third party. Forthose transactions to qualify as like-kind exchanges, the proceeds from the saleof the original property must be held outside the seller's control\u2014for example,by a qualified intermediary\u2014and used to purchase the replacement property. Inaddition, the like-kind replacement property must be designated within 45 daysand purchased within 180 days. Capital gains cannot be deferred on the trading of many financial assets. Any gain from the selling of one stock to purchase another and of a share in onepartnership to purchase another is taxable in the year exchanged. Gains fromtrades of bonds, mortgages, and other debt instruments are taxed similarly.Eliminating the deferral for like-kind exchanges would tax people who buy andsell real estate the same way as people who buy and sell stocks, bonds, orshares in partnerships. The option would raise $6 billion from 2000 to 2009. A justification for continuing like-kind exchanges is that the new property is a continuation of the same investment as the previous one, and no tax shouldbe levied until the owner leaves that line of investing. When properties areswapped without cash payments, no money becomes available for payment ofthe tax. Furthermore, allowing like-kind exchanges facilitates property ex-changes in response to changing conditions of the taxpayer or property markets.But those justifications apply to many exchanges of stocks, bonds, and partner-ship shares as well and therefore do not support continuing the current differen-tial tax treatment of those assets. One reason for either continuing the currentdifferential treatment or phasing it out slowly is that many investors purchasedproperties with the understanding that they would be able to exchange them forother properties without paying capital gains taxes. Changing the treatmentabruptly would impose hardships on some investors and could possibly depressproperty prices. Finally, some tax-deferred swaps of corporate equities arepermitted, such as those that take place in business mergers. In 1987, the Ways and Means Committee passed a provision limiting the amount of gain that can be deferred under like-kind exchanges of real propertyto $100,000. In 1989, the comm ittee considered limiting deferral of gain to exchanges of properties that are similar or related in service or use. Thatstricter standard already applies to gains on involuntary conversions. In 1997,the Treasury Department proposed that the same standard be applied to realestate exchanges.252 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-25 CONVERT THE CREDIT FOR STATE DEATH TAXES TO A DEDUCTION Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0 2001 3.72002 3.82003 4.12004 4.3 2005 4.6 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 15.9 2000-2009 41.5 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-26 and REV-27Current law imposes a gift tax on transfers of wealth during a taxpayer's life- time and an estate tax on transfers at death. One of the credits used to offsetfinal tax liability is for state death taxes: a fraction of the taxes paid to states isdirectly deductible from federal estate and gift tax liability. Gift and estate taxes together constitute a unified tax: one progressive tax is imposed on cumulative transfers during life and at death. Credits built intothe system have always excluded most transfers from taxation, so less than 2percent of deaths result in an estate tax filing. The Taxpayer Relief Act of1997 increased the credits for the first time since the late 1980s to prevent thenumber of estates subject to tax from rising and to lower the taxes paid bytaxable estates. The credit for state death taxes bu ilt into the federal estate tax system lowered revenues by about $3.8 billion in 1996, which is over 25 percent oftotal revenue in that year. State death taxes currently reduce a taxpayer's fed-eral tax liability by a credit that ranges from 0.8 percent on transfers of$40,000 to 16 percent on transfers of more than $10 million. When enacted in1926, the credit sometimes virtually eliminated the federal tax liability becausethe top marginal rate in the federal estate and gift tax was 20 percent. The credit acts as a state revenue-sharing system for estates taxed up to the 16 percent exclusion level. Consequently, a majority of states have adoptedstate death tax systems that simply redistribute estate tax revenues from thefederal to state governments. That shift is accomplished by imposing statedeath taxes according to a schedule that exactly matches the amount of thefederal credit. Changing the credit to a deduction would raise about $41.5 billion over the 2000-2009 period and would correspond to the treatment of state and localincome and property taxes as itemized deductions under the federal income tax.The immediate effect of changing the credit to a deduction would be to raise theeffective tax rate on state death taxes from zero to one minus the marginal taxrate under the federal estate tax, which ranges from 37 percent to 55 percent forpositive tax liabilities. That would cause the biggest increase in taxes for tax-payers in states where death taxes are high. In the long run, states may choose to change their own death tax rules to partially restore the levels and distribution of effective estate tax rates. If statesbehave that way, reduced state tax revenues will offset any increase in federaltax revenues, and the reduced state revenues will have to be made up by someother changes in state-level taxes or spending.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 253 REV-26 INCLUDE LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS IN THE BASE FOR ESTATE TAXES Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0 2001 0.52002 0.52003 0.52004 0.5 2005 0.5 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 2.0 2000-2009 5.0 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-25 and REV-27Current law imposes a gift tax on transfers of wealth during a taxpayer's life- time and an estate tax on transfers at death. One form of wealth transfer getspreferential treatment under the estate tax: payouts on life insurance policiesare not counted as transferred wealth if the owner of the policy is not the dece-dent. Including life insurance proceeds in the tax base would raise estate taxrevenues by about $5 billion between 2000 and 2009. Gift and estate taxes together constitute a unified tax: one progressive tax is imposed on cumulative transfers during life and at death. Credits built intothe system have always excluded most transfers from taxation, so that less than2 percent of deaths result in an estate tax filing. The Taxpayer Relief Act of1997 increased the credits for the first time since the late 1980s to prevent thenumber of estates subject to tax from rising and to lower the taxes paid bytaxable estates. Wealth transferred at death through life insurance is generally not subject to estate tax; if the policyowner is not the decedent, the policy payout amount isnot taxable. Thus, one important element of estate tax planning during awealthy taxpayer's lifetime is to make life insurance payments, with the in-tended heirs as the beneficiaries, directly or through trust arrangements. Premi-ums paid are not taxed as long as the amounts are below the $10,000 annualgift exclusion. Life insurance proceeds were first included in the estate tax base in 1918, two years after the modern estate and gift tax system was put in pl ace. The 1918 act included in the base proceeds from policies owned by the decedentand payouts in excess of $40,000 on policies owned by others. In 1942, allproceeds from policies in which the decedent paid the premiums or owned thepolicies were also made taxable. Legislation enacted in 1954 dropped the\"premiums paid\" test, leading to the current system in which only policiesowned by the decedent are included in the estate tax base. The tax advantage of excluding life insurance from the base for estate taxes can be significant. The initial transfer of premiums does not affect taxliability because those amounts could be transferred tax-free under the annual$10,000 exclusion for any reason. The real benefit comes later, however, as premiums invested in whole-life plans earn interest and dividends not subject toincome tax. Another argument for excluding life insurance from the base for estate taxes is to lower the cost of transferring wealth when assets are not liquid. Forexample, the owner of a closely held business can use life insurance to prepaythe estate tax that will be liable on the business, and the heirs can avoid havingto sell the business to pay the taxes. This option would increase the cost of thatpractice. The Congress raised the exclusion for closely held businesses in 1997to help prevent businesses from being sold when the owner dies.254 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-27 ELIMINATE NONBUSINESS VALUATION DISCOUNTS UNDER THE ESTATE TAX Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0 2001 0.52002 0.52003 0.52004 0.6 2005 0.6 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 2.1 2000-2009 5.7 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-25 and REV-26Current law imposes a gift tax on transfers of wealth during a taxpayer's life- time and an estate tax on such transfers at death. One accounting practicetaxpayers are using is transferring marketable securities, such as st ocks and bonds, to holding companies, which then issue shares (claims to the securities)to intended heirs. Although transferred assets are still taxable, the commonpractice of discounting minority holdings of business assets is often applied tosecurity holding companies to undervalue the assets for the taxable estate com-putation. The gift and estate taxes together constitute a unified tax: one progressive tax is imposed on cumulative transfers during life and at death. Credits builtinto the system have always excluded most transfers from taxation, so that lessthan 2 percent of deaths result in an estate tax filing. The Taxpayer Relief Actof 1997 increased the credits for the first time since the late 1980s to preventthe number of estates subject to tax from rising and to lower the taxes paid bytaxable estates. The value of minority interests in nonpublicly traded business assets are typically discounted when computing taxable estates. The practice is justifiedon the grounds that a buyer purchasing a minority share in an ongoing operationwould generally not pay market value for the fractional interest because themajority owners can adversely affect the long-term value of the fractionalowner's share. For example, if the majority owners are also officers of thecompany, they could in theory make decisions that would increase their incomeat the expense of the minority owners. Because the goal of the estate tax sys-tem is to tax only the value of the asset that would be paid by a willing buyer,large discounts are standard. The use of such a practice for nonbusiness assets cannot be defended on the same grounds. In nonbusiness situations, a taxpayer contributes marketableassets to a family limited partnership or limited liability company and simul-taneously gives or bequeaths minority interests in the holding company to in-tended heirs. The taxpayer then claims discounts on those gifts, using theguidelines generally agreed on for transferring business assets. The taxpayerclaims a reduced value in the marketable asset simply because it was placed ina holding company before being given or bequeathed. Restricting the practice of valuation discounts to active businesses would raise $5.7 billion over the 2000-2009 period. The exact proposal would requirethat interests in an entity be valued at a proportional share of the fair marketvalue of the entity's net worth to the extent that net worth includes readily mar-ketable assets (cash, cash equivalents, foreign currency, publicly traded securi-ties, real property, annuities, royalty-producing assets, non-income-producingproperty, such as art or collectibles commod ities, options, and swaps) when given or bequeathed. If the entity is part of an active business, the net worthheld in marketable securities for working capital would be subject to the usualbusiness valuation practices.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 255 REV-28 REDUCE TAX CREDITS FOR REHABILITATING BUILDINGS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.2 2001 0.22002 0.22003 0.22004 0.2 2005 0.2 2006 2000-2004 0.9 2000-2009 2.0 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.The Congress enacted tax credits for rehabilitation to promote the preservation of historic buildings, encourage businesses to renovate their existing premisesrather than relocate, and encourage investors to refurbish older buildings. Thecredit rate is 10 percent for expenditures on commercial buildings built before1936 and 20 percent for commercial and residential buildings that the Depart-ment of the Interior has certified as historic structures because of their architec-tural significance. The credits favor commercial use over most rental housing and may there- fore divert capital from more productive uses. Moreover, in favoring renova-tion over new construction, the credits may encourage more costly ways ofobtaining additional housing and commercial buildings. Rehabilitation may have social benefits when it discourages the destruc- tion of historically noteworthy buildings. The government could promote thatobjective at a lower cost, however, by permitting a credit only for the renova-tion of certified historic buildings and lowering the credit rate. Some surveysindicate that a 15 percent credit would be sufficient to cover the extra costs ofboth obtaining certification and undertaking a rehabilitation of historic quality.Reducing the credit for historic structures to 15 percent and repealing the creditfor nonhistoric structures would increase revenues over the 2000-2009 periodby about $2 billion. Repealing both credits would raise about $6 billion overthe same period.256 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-29 REPEAL THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING CREDIT Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.1 2001 0.32002 0.62003 1.02004 1.5 2005 1.9 2000-2004 3.5 2000-2009 17.0 Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : 370-06The low-income housing credit (LIHC) subsidizes the construction and sub- stantial rehabilitation of low-income rental housing. Individuals and corpora-tions who qualify for the LIHC receive tax credits over a 10-year period thatare worth up to 70 percent, measured in present value, of the construction orrehabilitation costs of qualifying projects. The percentage is limited to 30 per-cent for projects that receive other federal subsidies. To qualify for the LIHC, project owners must set aside at least 20 percent of rental units for families whose income is below 50 percent of area medianincome, or 40 percent of units for families whose income is below 60 percent ofmedian income. Rents are restricted. The set-aside and rent restrictions applyfor at least 15 years. State housing agencies allocate the credits subject tostatutory limits. The LIHC will r educe federal revenue by $3.3 billion in 1998 and is estimated to grow to $3.9 billion in 2001. Repealing the tax credit for newprojects would raise $17 billion from 2000 through 2009. Housing assistance could be provided to the same number of people at lower cost if the assistance was provided in the form of an expanded housingvoucher program. Low-income tenants can use housing vouchers to pay for allor part of the rent for the housing of their choice, as long as it meets minimumstandards for habitability. By contrast, the low-income housing credit subsi-dizes only new and substantially rehabilitated housing, which is the most ex-pensive kind of housing. High overhead costs also make some housing subsidized by the LIHC even more expensive to produce and rent. Private investors in low-incomehousing syndicates require high rates of return to compensate for the inherentrisk of such investments as well as the specific risks imposed by the credit. Forexample, projects that fail to comply with the requirements of the program maybe subject to heavy penalties. In addition, some investors cannot use the creditsevery year because of the limits on passive losses and on the use of business taxcredits. Moreover, the administrative and marketing costs in organizing low-income housing syndicates are high. Advocates of the LIHC argue that it, in combination with rental assistance subsidies, assists many poor families and can be an important part of neighbor-hood revitalization efforts. In addition, affordable housing that meets minimalhousing standards is scarce in some areas with low-income families. For thosereasons, a supply subsidy such as the LIHC might be a more effective policytool than a demand subsidy such as housing vouchers. Advocates also arguethat lower-middle-income people who benefit from the credit are neglected bytraditional housing programs, which primarily assist poor families, and thatstate governments, which allocate the credits, are better able to assess the hous-ing needs of their communities than is the federal government. Finally, budgetconstraints on discretionary spending might make it difficult to repeal the creditin favor of an expanded voucher program funded by annual appropriations.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 257 REV-30-A TAX CREDIT UNIONS LIKE OTHER THRIFT INSTITUTIONS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.5 2001 0.82002 0.82003 0.92004 0.9 2005 0.9 2000-2004 3.9 2000-2009 9.0 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-30-BCredit unions are nonprofit institutions that provide their members with finan- cial services such as accepting deposits and making loans. The federal incometax treats credit unions more favorably than competing thrift institutions, suchas savings and loan institutions and mutual savings banks, by exempting theirretained earnings from taxation. That situation reduces economic efficiencybecause different tax treatment of like institutions hinders competition and theprovision of services at the lowest cost. In addition, more credit unions andfewer taxable thrift institutions now exist than would otherwise be the case. Credit unions, savings and loans, and mutual savings banks were origi- nally all tax-exempt, but in 1951 the Congress removed the tax exemptions forsavings and loans and mutual savings banks. It considered those institutions tobe similar to profit-seeking corporations. Credit unions, unlike the other depos-itory institutions, were designed to be cooperatives whose members shared acommon bond. Since 1951, many credit unions have come to resemble other thrift institu- tions. Credit unions no longer limit membership to people sharing the commonbond of having the same employer or occupati on. Since 1982, credit union regulators have allowed credit unions to extend their services to members ofother organizations. Although that was legally challenged, recent legislation(the Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998) allows multiple, unrelatedgroups to join the same credit union as long as the group has 3,000 or fewermembers when it joins the credit union. In addition, most credit unions allowmembers and their families to participate permanently, even after membershave left the sponsoring organization. Credit union membership has grown from about 5 million in 1950 to about 70 million today. Credit unions, like taxable thrifts, now serve the gen-eral public. They also resemble thrift institutions in that they retain earnings.Although credit unions argue that earnings retention protects them against un-expected events, other thrift institutions complain that credit unions use theretained earnings to finance expansion. Finally, credit unions now provide many of the services offered by savings and loans and mutual savings banks. A significant number of credit unionsoffer mortgages and car loans, direct deposit, access to automatic tellers, pre-authorized payments, credit cards, individual retirement accounts, safe depositboxes, and discount brokerage services. Moreover, some large credit unionsoffer electronic account access by telephone as well as business loans. Taxing credit unions like other thrift institutions would raise $3.9 billion over the five-year period from 2000 to 2004 and $9.0 billion from 2000 to 2009.258 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-30-B TAX CREDIT UNIONS WITH MORE THAN $10 MILLION IN ASSETS LIKE OTHER THRIFT INSTITUTIONS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.5 2001 0.72002 0.82003 0.82004 0.8 2005 0.9 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 3.6 2000-2009 8.4 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-30-AAn alternative to taxing all credit unions like other thrift institutions (see option REV-30-A) would be to tax only large credit unions and allow small creditunions to retain their tax-exempt status. Unlike large credit unions, small creditunions are similar to nonprofit mutual organizations and should have similartax treatment. Most small credit unions have members with a single commonbond or association. In some cases, volunteers from the membership manageand staff the credit union. In addition, many of the small credit unions do notprovide services comparable with other thrift institutions. To protect the smaller credit unions, the Congress could choose to tax only credit unions with assets greater than $10 million. Such an action wouldexempt 8 percent of all assets in the credit union industry and about two-thirdsof all credit unions from taxation. Taxing credit unions with more than $10 million in assets like other thrift institutions would raise $3.6 billion over the five-year period from 2000 to2004 and $8.4 billion from 2000 to 2009.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 259 REV-31 REPEAL THE EXPENSING OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.4 2001 0.52002 0.52003 0.52004 0.5 2005 0.6 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 2.4 2000-2009 5.7 SOURCE: Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-32, REV-33, REV-35, and REV-40The current tax system favors extractive industries (oil, gas, and minerals pro- ducers) over most other industries through various tax preferences (see alsooption REV-32). One preference allows certain types of oil and gas producersand producers of hard minerals to deduct some exploration and developmentcosts when they are incurred (a process called expensing) rather than over timeas the resulting income is generated. That immediate deduction of costs con-trasts with the normal tax treatment facing other industries, in which costs arededucted more slowly according to prescribed rates of depreciation or deple-tion. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 established uniform capitalization rules thatrequire certain direct and indirect costs allocatable to property to be eitherdeducted when inventory is sold or recovered over several years as depreciationdeductions (so that any deduction of costs is postponed). However, intangibledrilling and development costs and mine development and exploration costs areexempt from those rules. Thus, the expensing of such costs results in a taxpreference for extractive industries that other industries do not have. (See op-tions REV-33, REV-35, and REV-40 for other exceptions.) Expensible exploration and development costs include costs for excavat- ing mines and drilling wells. They also include prospecting costs for hard min-erals but not for oil and gas. Although current law allows full expensing forindependent oil and gas producers and noncorporate mineral producers, it li mits expensing to 70 percent of costs for \"integrated\" oil and gas producers (compa-nies involved in substantial retailing or refining activities) and corporate min-eral producers. Firms subject to the 70 percent limit must deduct the remaining30 percent of costs over a 60-month period. Although the original rationale for expensing was that the costs of explo- ration and development were considered ordinary operating expenses, continu-ing the preference has been justified on the grounds that oil and gas are \"strate-gic minerals,\" essential to national energy security. However, expensing dis-torts the efficient allocation of resources in several ways. First, it causesresources to be overallocated to drilling and mining, when some of those re-sources might be used more productively elsewhere in the economy. Second,although the preference might reduce dependence on imported oil in the shortrun, it encourages current extraction, perhaps at the cost of reduced future ex-traction and greater future reliance on foreign production. Third, expensingmay result in an inefficient allocation of production within those extractiveindustries because the extent of the subsidy depends on factors not systemati-cally related to economic productivity\u2014such as the difference between theimmediate deduction and the true useful life of such capital as well as onwhether the producer must pay the alternative minimum tax (in which caseexpensing is limited). Repealing the expensing of exploration and development costs would improve the allocation of resources and raise $5.7 billion from 2000 through2009, assuming that firms could still expense costs from unproductive holes andmines.260 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-32 REPEAL THE PERCENTAGE DEPLETION FOR EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.4 2001 0.42002 0.42003 0.42004 0.5 2005 0.5 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 2.1 2000-2009 4.6 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-31 and REV-33The current tax system favors extractive industries (oil, gas, and mineral pro- ducers) over most other industries in various ways. One way is by allowingproducers to deduct exploration and development costs when they are incurred(see option REV-31). Another way is by allowing some firms to use the \"per-centage depletion\" method to recover costs rather than the standard \"cost deple-tion\" method. The percentage depletion method of cost recovery allows certain types of extractive companies (independent producers and royalty owners, or non-integrated companies) to deduct a certain percentage of a property's gross in-come in each taxable year, regardless of the actual capitalized costs. In con-trast, other industries (and since 1975, integrated oil companies as well) use thecost depletion method. Under cost depleti on, the costs recovered cannot exceed the taxpayer's expenses in acquiring and developing the property. But underpercentage depletion, they may. Thus, the percentage depletion method resultsin a tax preference for certain types of extractive companies that other compa-nies do not have. Unlike the expensing of exploration and development costs,however, percentage depletion applies only to a small subset of total oil, gas,and minerals production because it excludes the large integrated producers. Current law typically allows nonintegrated oil and gas companies to de- duct 15 percent of the gross income from oil and gas pr oduction up to 1,000 barrels per day. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 made per-centage depletion even more generous, however, for nonintegrated companiesthat are considered to be \"marginal\" producers (those with very low total pro-duction or production that is entirely made up of heavy oil). The deduction formarginal properties can be up to 25 percent of gross income if the market priceof oil drops low enough. Producers of hard minerals may also use percentagedepletion, but the statutory percentages vary from 5 percent to 22 percent de-pending on the type of mineral. Tax law limits the amount of percentage deple-tion to 100 percent of the net income from an oil and gas property and 50 per-cent of the net income from a property with hard minerals. Percentage depletion has been justified on the grounds that oil and gas are \"strategic minerals,\" essential to national energy security. Percentage depletiondistorts the allocation of resources, however, by encouraging production inthose industries over other types of industries. It can also cause an inefficientallocation of production by extractive businesses in the same way thatexpensing does as well as in other ways. In particular, percentage depletionsubsidizes firms according to gross income and not according to investment.Thus, it encourages developing existing properties over exploring for new ones. Repealing the percentage depletion for extractive industries would im- prove the allocation of resources and raise $4.6 billion over the 2000-2009period.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 261 REV-33 REPEAL THE TAX CREDIT FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY COSTS AND EXPENSING OF TERTIARY INJECTANTS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.1 2001 0.12002 0.12003 0.12004 0.1 2005 0.1 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 0.4 2000-2009 0.8 SOURCE: Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-31, REV-32, REV-35, and REV-40 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Climate Change and the Federal Budget (Memorandum), August 1998.The tax code provides a 15 percent credit for the costs of recovering domestic oil by a qualified \"enhanced oil recovery\" (EOR) method. Qualifying methodsare those that allow the recovery of oil that is too viscous to be extracted byconventional methods. The costs of labor, materials, equipment, repairs, intan-gible drilling, and development qualify for the credit, which is phased out foroil prices above $28 per barrel (adjusted for inflation). Without the credit,EOR would not be realistic because it is more expensive than recovering oil byconventional methods. In addition, the tax code provides for the expensing of tertiary injectants \u2014the fluids, gases, and other chemicals that are injected into oil or gas reser-voirs to extract highly viscous oil. The tax code permits deducting the full costof the chemical injectants in the year in which the injectants are used to extractoil. The expenditures for injectants also qualify for the 15 percent EOR credit;however, the credit must be subtracted from the deduction if both are claimedfor the same expenditure. Without tax incentives, the use of tertiary injectantsto extract oil would not be economical. The EOR credit was enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconcilia- tion Act of 1990 to increase the domestic supply of oil and reduce the demandfor imported oil, particularly from producers in the Persian Gulf and otherpolitically unstable areas. The expensing of tertiary injectants was enacted in1980 for similar reasons but also to ensure that the costs of injectants would betreated the same as intangible drilling costs, which are also expensed. Both provisions offer capital subsidies to lower the cost of producing oil by unconventional, more expensive methods. Whether the federal governmentshould subsidize the production of high-cost domestic oil depends on the exter-nal costs of oil imports. Increased domestic production lessens short-termdependency but depletes domestic resources, encouraging long-term depend-ency on imports. The world market price of oil is currently low, and oil production in the United States has been declining. Although the United States is more depen-dent on foreign oil than it used to be, it is less vulnerable to supply disruptionsbecause of the stockpiling of oil under the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, theweakened power of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and theincreased competitiveness in world oil markets. Eliminating both the EOR credit and the expensing of tertiary injectants would increase revenues by $0.8 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Elimi-nating the EOR credit alone would increase revenues by $0.7 billion, and elimi-nating expensing alone would increase revenues by $0.1 billion during the sameperiod. 262 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-34 REPEAL THE PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR ALCOHOL FUELS FROM EXCISE TAXES ON MOTOR FUELS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.4 2001 0.52002 0.52003 0.52004 0.5 2005 0.5 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 2.4 2000-2009 5.0 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-45 and 270-03The tax code imposes excise taxes on motor fuels, but it partially exempts fuels that are blends of gasoline and alcohol. Repeal of the partial excise tax exemp-tion would raise $5 billion in revenues over the 2000-2009 period. That esti-mate assumes that the Congress also repeals the alcohol fuels credit, an alterna-tive tax benefit that can be used instead of the partial excise tax exemption.The credit, however, is in almost all cases less valuable than the exemption andis rarely used. Ethanol (an alcohol fuel produced primarily from corn and sugar) used as a fuel is eligible for a nonrefundable tax benefit (through credit or exemption)of up to 54 cents per gallon. The exact size of the tax benefit depends on thepercentage of alcohol in the fuel and whether the alcohol was made from afossil (nonrenewable) or nonfossil (renewable) fuel source. The exemptionapplies only to alcohol fuels produced from nonfossil fuel sources. For exam-ple, gasohol, which is 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol (a renewablesource) receives a 5.4 cents per-gallon exemption from the 18.3 cents per-gallon tax on gasoline. The Transportation Equity Act of 1998 extended the ethanol fuels credit, which had been scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year 1999. The tax benefit rate drops to 53 cents per gallon for 2001 to 2002, 52 cents per gallonfor 2003 to 2004, and 51 cents per gallon for 2005 to 2007. The entire taxbenefit is now scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year 2007. One purpose of the tax benefit\u2014enacted in the late 1970s\u2014was to in- crease national security by reducing the demand for imported oil and therebyreduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil sources. Another purpose was to pro-vide an additional market for U.S. agricultural products by encouraging domes-tic production of ethanol. Over the past several years, U.S. environmentalaction has increased the value of ethanol by mandating the oxygen content ofmotor fuels in many areas of the country. Use of oxy genated fuels in motor vehicles generally produces less carbon monoxide pollution than does gasoline.The tax benefit appears to have successfully encouraged energy pr oducers to substitute ethanol for gasoline. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, however, reduced the need for the partial excise exemption by mandating the minimum oxygen content of gas-oline used in areas with poor air quality. Moreover, since ethanol productionuses more resources than gasoline production, the allocation of resources result-ing from the partial exemption may be economically inefficient if the value ofthose resources in alternative uses outweighs the value of the reduction in airpollution. Repealing the excise tax exemption could result in higher federal outlays for price support loans for grains. But any increase in outlays\u2014not included inthe budget estimates shown above\u2014would probably be much smaller than theestimated revenue increase.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 263 REV-35 CAPITALIZE THE COSTS OF PRODUCING TIMBER Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.3 2001 0.52002 0.52003 0.52004 0.5 2005 0.4 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 2.3 2000-2009 4.4 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-31, REV-33, and REV-40The current tax system allows timber producers to deduct (\"expense\") most of the production costs of maintaining a timber stand when those costs are in-curred. That tax treatment contrasts with the uniform capitalization rules ap-plied to most other industries. (See options REV-31, REV-33, and REV-40 forother exceptions.) Established under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA-86),such rules require that production costs not be deducted until the sale of theproduced goods or services. When businesses do not account for costs properly,business income is not measured correctly because the costs of producing goodsand services are not matched with the sale of the goods and services. Although the costs of planting a timber stand are in fact subject to capital- ization rules, subsequent maintenance and production costs are not. Timberproducers can expense indirect carrying costs, such as property taxes, interest,insurance costs, and administrative overhead, as well as the costs of labor andmaterials to remove unwanted trees and to control fire, disease, and insects. Byallowing timber producers to deduct such production costs before the timber isharvested or sold, the tax code in effect subsidizes timber production by defer-ring tax that producers otherwise would owe on their income. (Under certaincircumstances, however, the deferral granted to noncorporate producers oftimber may be greatly curtailed by the limits of the tax code on losses frompassive business activities.) The original rationale for expensing timber production costs was a general perception that such costs were maintenance costs and thus deductible as ordi-nary costs of a trade or business. When TRA-86 established uniform capital-ization rules, the general reason given for exempting timber costs was thatapplying the rules to those industries might have been unduly burdensome. Expensing timber production costs distorts investment behavior in two ways: more private land is devoted to timber production, and trees are allowedto grow longer before they are cut. Unless timber growing offers spilloverbenefits to society that are not captured by market prices, the tax preferenceleads to an inefficient allocation of resources and an inefficient harvesting rate. Whether or not timber production offers important spillover benefits is unclear. Standing timber provides some spillover benefits by deterring soilerosion and absorbing carbon dioxide (a gas linked to global warming), butcutting timber can lead to soil erosion. In addition, producing and disposing ofwood and paper products contribute to pollution. Capitalizing the costs of timber production incurred after December 31, 1999, would raise $4.4 billion in revenue from 2000 through 2009 by acceler-ating tax payments from timber producers. In the long run, capitalizing timberproduction costs would raise the price of domestic timber and lower the valueof land used to grow it. Moreover, lease payments to private land owners bytimber growers would probably fall, causing some land that historically hasbeen devoted to growing timber to be used in other ways. In the short run,however, capitalizing timber production costs might lower the price of domestictimber because producers would have an incentive to harvest it earlier.264 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-36 REPLACE CORPORATE CREDIT WITH A DEDUCTION FOR EMPLOYER FICA ON CERTAIN TIP INCOME Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.2 2001 0.32002 0.32003 0.32004 0.3 2005 0.3 2006 2000-2004 1.4 2000-2009 3.1 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.Since 1993, employers in the food and beverage industry have been entitled to a nonrefundable corporate income tax credit against Federal Insurance Contri-butions Act (FICA) taxes paid on employee tips (except for any amount of tipsthat makes up the difference between regular wages and the minimum wage).Replacing that tax credit with a deduction, which is the standard tax treatmentfor such labor costs, would increase revenues by $3.1 billion from 2000 to2009. Until 1988, all employers were required to pay FICA tax on tips only to the extent that the federal minimum wage exceeded the actual wage paid by theemployer. Following a proposal in the President's budget, the Omnibus Bud-get Reconciliation Act of 1987 expanded the definition of wages subject toFICA tax to include all cash tips. Opponents of the expanded definition of wages tried to repeal it several times. One provision in the Revenue Act of 1992 would have retained theexpanded definition for FICA purposes but would have granted a full,nonrefundable credit against the new FICA tax as part of the general businesscredit, which applies mostly to corporate taxpayers. Legislators used that indi-rect approach because Congressional budget rules make lowering Social Secu-rity revenues particularly difficult. Although both houses passed the bill, Presi-dent Bush pocket-vetoed it. A similar provision was finally enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, but the credit applied only to tips received at foodand beverage establishments. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996expanded the credit to tips received in connection with food served for takeoutor delivered off premises, relaxed restrictions on the timing of affected wages,and allowed the credit to apply to tips not reported by the employee. Proponents of replacing the credit with a deduction argue that the credit creates jobs. But because the credit grants a tax preference to a specific indus-try (food service) and a specific form of compensation (tips), the credit could becreating jobs in one sector at the cost of more productive jobs in other sectors.Proponents also assert that tips differ from wages since they are paid by cus-tomers, not employers. From an economic perspective, however, tips are thesame as wages because they are earned by employees for services performed.Tips could be considered self-employment income, but such treatment wouldgreatly increase the administrative burden of tax collection. Because the wages of waiters and waitresses are much lower than those of most employees, the credit makes the overall tax system more progressive, atleast to the extent that the credit is passed through by the recipient firms to theservers instead of to the customers, shareholders, or higher-paid employees.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 265 REV-37 REPEAL THE \"LOWER OF COST OR MARKET\" INVENTORY VALUATION METHOD Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.2 2001 0.42002 0.32003 0.32004 0.3 2005 0.1 2006 2000-2004 1.5 2000-2009 2.0 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.Under the inventory valuation method called \"lower of cost or market\" (LCM), businesses may deduct immediately the accrued losses on year-end inventoriesbut defer paying tax on gains until the year of sale. That situation providesfavorable tax treatment, although only to firms using the first-in, first-outmethod of inventory accounting. Furthermore, under either the LCM or the costmethod of inventory valuation, firms may deduct immediately any losses frominventory goods that arise from damage, imperfections, broken lots, or certainother causes (subnormal goods method). In that case as well, firms receivefavorable tax treatment to the extent that such goods are sold\u2014 and hence in- come is realized\u2014in later tax years. This option would repeal LCM and the subnormal goods method of inven- tory valuation for all firms with gross receipts averaging more than $5 millionannually over a three-year period. It would therefore require the businesses tovalue their inventories at cost and include in taxable income both gains andlosses from the change in inventory value only when those goods are sold. TheAdministration proposed this option in its past four budgets. LCM not only causes a timing mismatch between recognition of gains and losses, but it also has two mechanical shortcomings. First, once a firm hasreduced the value of inventories using the LCM method, it need not ever recordan increase in the value, even if the actual value of the inventories subsequentlyrises. Second, the definition of market value is somewhat skewed. Retailersare allowed to deduct losses on inventory following a markdown of the retailprice, even if the new retail price remains above the original cost. Those short-comings could be addressed, however, without repealing the LCM method. This option would increase revenues by $2 billion over the 2000-2009 period. The increase in liability has two components\u2014a one-time increasefrom the revaluation of existing inventory to exclude unrealized (accrued)losses and a smaller, permanent increase from growth in the excluded lossesover time. Because the option phases in the new rules, the one-time revaluationcomponent raises liability every year for four years. The permanent componentincreases over time because unrealized losses grow annually.266 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-38 TIGHTEN RULES ON INTEREST DEDUCTIONS FOR CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.2 2001 0.42002 0.42003 0.42004 0.4 2005 0.5 2006 2000-2004 1.8 2000-2009 4.4 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.Corporations purchase life insurance policies in part as protection against fi- nancial loss from the death of their more important employees or owners. Pur-chases of cash-value life insurance provide a tax benefit if corporations indi-rectly finance them by increasing debt or other liabilities and then deduct theresulting interest expense from taxable income. The Internal Revenue Servicedisallows the interest deduction if it can establish a direct link between in-creases in debt or other liabilities and the purchase of cash-value insurance. Adirect link is difficult to establish, however, because firms increase liabilitiesfor many purposes. This option would disallow a proportion of a firm's total interest deduc- tions equal to the proportion of its total assets invested in cash-value life insur-ance policies. The option would not apply to insurance on the life of ownerswith 20 percent or more interest in the firm. It would raise an estimated $4.4billion over the 2000-2009 period. The tax code allows the tax benefit by exempting the investment income (or \"inside buildup\") of a life insurance policy from corporate income tax andpermitting a corporation to deduct from taxable income the interest on debt thatis indirectly used to finance the investment. Such asymmetric treatment pro-vides an opportunity for tax arbitrage because corporations can generate inter-est deductions that they can use to shelter other taxable income. Individualsmay not use that tax benefit because the tax code does not allow them to deductthose interest payments. In 1996, the Congress disallowed the deductibility of interest on loans from an insurance company with the cash-value policy as collateral (with ex-ceptions for insurance on certain key employees). In 1997, the Congress en-acted a proportional disallowance of interest deductions, but it applied only tofirms that purchase cash-value insurance on the life of people who were notemployees or owners. This option would further disallow such interest deduc-tions except for purchases of insurance on the life of those who own at least 20percent of the firm. The Administration has proposed this option in its past twobudgets. In 1986, the Congress also enacted a similar disallowance of a pro-portion of interest deductions for financial institutions that purchased state andlocal government securities whose interest was tax-exempt. Opponents of this option argue that a firm may have business reasons to purchase life insurance policies on its employees and owners as well as otherbusiness reasons to issue debt and that the firm may not be linking the twodecisions to create a tax shelter. Proponents of the option, however, argue thatfirms intend to use the policies and debt as tax shelters.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 267 REV-39 REPEAL TAX-FREE CONVERSIONS OF LARGE C CORPORATIONS TO S CORPORATIONS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 a 2001 a2002 a2003 0.12004 0.1 2005 0.1 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 0.2 2000-2009 0.7 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. a. Less than $50 million.Under current law, a C corporation may reduce taxes on some income by elect- ing to be treated as an S corporation or converting to a partnership. The incomeof C corporations is generally taxed twice, once when it is earned by the corpo-ration and again when it is distributed to stockholders. S corporation and part-nership income is taxed only once, at the personal tax rates of the firm's own-ers. Over time, the distinction between S corporations and partnerships hasbecome somewhat blurred, but conversion from a C corporation to either ofthose two corporate forms continues to receive differential tax treatment. The election of S corporation filing status receives preferential tax treat- ment compared with conversion to a partnership. Converting to an S corpora-tion is tax-free under many situations; converting to a partnership is taxable andrequires the corporation to recognize any built-in gain on its assets and theshareholders to recognize any such gain in their corporate stock. Under section1374 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a C corporation converts to an S corpora-tion, the appreciation of the corporation's assets while it was a C corporation isnot subject to the corporate-level tax unless the assets are sold within 10 yearsof the conversion. Current law allows a corporation to avoid the two-tier cor-porate tax by converting tax-free to an S corporation. This option would repeal tax-free conversions for corporations with a value of more than $5 million at the time of conversion, thereby making the taxtreatment of the two types of conversions more similar. When a C corporationwith a value of over $5 million converted, to an S corporation, the corporationand its shareholders would immediately recognize the gain in their appreciatedassets. This option would increase income tax revenues by $0.7 billion over the2000-2009 period. Repealing those tax-free conversions would equalize the tax treatment of economically similar conversions from two-tier corporate systems to single-tierflow-through systems, reducing the effect of tax considerations on decisionsabout organizational form. For people who think S corporations more closelyresemble corporations than they do flow-through entities, such as partnerships,preserving the current differential tax treatment may be considered beneficial.According to that viewpoint, current law merely allows a corporation to changeits filing status from that of C corporation to S corporation, providing it meetsthe legal requirements, without having to pay tax for changing its choice ofcorporate form.268 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-40 REPEAL THE EXPENSING OF CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL COSTS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.5 2001 2.92002 1.62003 0.92004 0.6 2005 0.4 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 6.5 2000-2009 8.2 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-31, REV-33, and REV-35Like its treatment of some costs of producing timber, the current tax code al- lows most farmers\u2014except farm corporations, partnerships, and tax shelters\u2014to expense (deduct immediately) certain capital outlays and production costs,even when such investments generate income over several years. That taxtreatment contrasts with the depreciation and uniform capitalization rules appli-cable to most other industries, which deduct such costs more slowly. (See op-tions REV-31, REV-33, and REV-35 for other exceptions.) Agricultural expenses qualifying for immediate deduction include tool purchases; the costs of breeding, feeding, and raising livestock; certain soil andwater conservation expenses; fertilizer purchases; and the development andplanting expenses of crops that require two years or less between planting andharvesting. Because in many cases such investments produce income over a period exceeding one year, expensing those costs understates income in the year ofdeduction and overstates income in the year of realization. Thus, farmers candefer taxes, which reduces their effective tax rate. The Tax Reform Acts of1976 and 1986 limited the use of expensing for farm corporations and tax-shelter operations; the 1986 act required most other types of businesses to de-duct production and resale costs more slowly according to the uniform capital-ization rules. Thus, current law regarding expensing of agricultural costsfavors production of small farms over that of larger ones and of the agriculturalindustry in general over most other industries. Such a tax preference can leadto an inefficient allocation of resources. The original justification for the expensing of such costs, however, was to simplify financial recordkeeping for farmers. Although the administrative costsof recordkeeping are clearly lower today than they used to be, it may still besimpler for farmers to deduct costs in one period than in several periods. Agriculture receives other special tax treatment as well. One example is income averaging, in which farmers may elect to average all or a portion oftaxable income over the previous three-year period in computing current yeartax liability. The Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 made that provi-sion permanent to mitigate the adverse tax consequences resulting from fluctu-ating income levels. The 1998 act also extended the carryback period for netoperating losses from two to three years for farming losses incurred from disas-ters that have been designated as such by the President. Subjecting all farms to the normal depreciation and uniform capitalization rules would level the tax treatment among businesses and industries, neutraliz-ing the effects of the tax system on economic decisions. Such a change wouldraise $8.2 billion in revenue from 2000 through 2009.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 269 REV-41 ELIMINATE EXEMPTION OF INCOME FOR COOPERATIVELY OWNED ELECTRIC AND TELEPHONE UTILITIES Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.2 2001 0.32002 0.32003 0.32004 0.3 2005 0.3 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 1.4 2000-2009 3.1 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.

Eliminating thosetax exemptions and taxing those co-ops as regular for-profit corporations wouldraise $0.2 billion in 2000 and $3.1 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Cooperatives may exclude from income amounts that they are required to distribute as dividends to their members. In addition to that exclusion, electricand telephone co-ops also may exclude earnings from other sources from tax-able income, as long as at least 85 percent of their income is collected frommembers for providing their primary service (electricity or telephone service).Some forms of outside income are not even counted toward the remaining 15percent, including rental income from telephone poles that are leased to cable ortelephone companies and income from the Yellow Pages, cable TV, and In-ternet access. In addition, distributions of dividends to cooperative members,whether cash or payments in kind in the form of household utility services, arefree from income tax. Eliminating the tax exemption on dividends to individu-als could generate additional revenues. Those tax breaks, along with the low-interest loan program available through the Rural Utilities Service (see option 270-05) were created to encour-age the wiring of rural areas for service. However, since 95 percent of theUnited States is already connected to the electricity grid, the cost to distributorsis probably the same for rural and urban customers. Moreover, all electriccooperatives have those subsidies, even generation c ooperatives, which may not need subsidies. Generating electricity does not cost more in rural areas. If the tax exemption ends and cooperatively owned electric and telephone utilities must pay the same corporate income tax as other suppliers of electric-ity, then electricity rates to the cooperatives' customers may rise. Electric andtelephone co-ops would be subject to taxes that other co-ops do not pay. Pri-vately owned utilities claim, however, that subsidies to rural cooperatives areunnecessary and unfair. If electricity is deregulated, this tax exemption willtreat electric cooperatives differently than the investor-owned utilities they willbe competing with for customers. If policymakers decide that subsidies areneeded for distributing electricity in rural areas, a more direct approach wouldbe through universal service provisions, which would provide a fund to subsi-dize the wire portion of the electricity service.270 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-42 INCREASE THE EXCISE TAX ON CIGARETTES BY 50 CENTS PER PACK Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 4.9 2001 6.42002 6.32003 6.32004 6.3 2005 6.2 2006 6.22007 6.1 2008 6.1 2009 6.0 Cumulative 2000-2004 30.2 2000-2009 60.8 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.

The Proposed Tobacco Settlement: Issues from a Federal Perspective (Paper), April 1998.Taxes on certain goods and services can influence consumer choices, causing people to purchase less of the taxed items. That generally leads to a less effi-cient allocation of society's resources unless some costs associated with thetaxed items are not reflected in their price. Tobacco creates costs to societythat are not reflected in its pretax cost. Examples of those \"external costs\"include higher health insurance costs to cover the medical expenses linked tosmoking and the effects of cigarette smoke on the health of nonsmokers. Taxesincrease prices and can result in consumers paying the full cost of smoking. Currently, the federal cigarette excise tax is 24 cents per pack; it will increase to 34 cents in 2000 and 39 cents in 2002. (Other tobacco products have similar taxes.) Federal tobacco taxes raised about $5.8 billion in fiscalyear 1998, about 0.3 percent of total federal revenues. Increasing the cigarettetax by 50 cents a pack (in addition to the scheduled increases) would increasenet revenue by $61 billion between 2000 and 2009. State excise t axes will average about 40 cents per pack in 1999. In add ition, a settlement reached between state attorneys general and major tobacco manufacturers requirespayments equivalent to an excise tax of about 35 cents per pack. Some economists estimate the external costs of smoking to be signifi- cantly less than those taxes and fees, but others think that taxes should be in-creased more. Technical issues cloud the debate; for example, the magnitude ofthe health impact of secondhand smoke is uncertain. But much of the debateinvolves varying theories, such as whether to consider the health effects on thesmoker's family or the public health and pension savings that arise becausesmokers have shorter lives. Increasing excise taxes may be desirable regardless of the magnitude of external costs if consumers underestimate the harm of smoking or how addic-tive nicotine is. Teenagers, especially, may not be prepared to evaluate thelong-term effects of beginning to smoke. However, all populations know thatsmoking has health risks. Increasing excise taxes leads to reduced consumption of tobacco. Each 10 percent increase in cigarette prices is likely to lead to a decline in cigaretteconsumption of 2.5 percent to 5 percent, probably with a larger decline forteenagers. Both because lower-income people are more likely to smoke than higher- income people and because expenditures on cigarettes for those who smoke donot rise appreciably with income, taxes on tobacco are regressive; that is, suchtaxes take up a greater percentage of income for low-income families than formiddle- and upper-income families. Several bills introduced in the last Congress proposed raising the excise tax. In his 2000 budget, the Presi dent proposed an increase of 55 cents per pack in the tobacco tax.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 271 REV-43 INCREASE ALL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAXES TO $16 PER PROOF GALLON Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 3.6 2001 4.42002 4.42003 4.52004 4.5 2005 4.5 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 21.4 2000-2009 44.2 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-44 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Federal Taxation of Tobacco, Alcoholic Beverages, and MotorFuels (Study), August 1990.Federal excise taxes on distilled spirits, beer, and wine raised $7.5 billion in fiscal year 1998, about 13 percent of all excise tax revenue and almost 0.5percent of total federal revenues. Current federal excise taxes on beer and wineremain much lower than the federal excise tax on dis tilled spirits in tax per ounce of ethyl alcohol. The current tax on distilled spirits of $13.50 per proofgallon results in a tax of about 21 cents per ounce of alcohol. The current taxon beer of $18 per barrel results in a tax of about 10 cents per ounce of alcohol(assuming an alcohol content for beer of 4.5 percent), and the current tax ontable wine of $1.07 per gallon results in a tax of about 8 cents per ounce ofalcohol (assuming an average alcohol content of 11 percent). Increasing the federal excise tax to $16 per proof gallon for all alcoholic beverages would raise about $44 billion between 2000 and 2009. A tax of $16per proof gallon is equivalent to about 25 cents per ounce of ethyl alcohol. Itwould raise the tax on a 750-milliliter bottle of distilled spirits from about$2.14 to $2.54, the tax on a six-pack of beer from about 33 cents to 81 cents,and the tax on a 750-milliliter bo ttle of table wine from about 21 cents to 70 cents. Alcohol consumption creates costs to society not reflected in the pretax cost of alcoholic beverages. Examples of those \"external costs\" include healthcosts covered by the public, productivity losses borne by others, and the loss oflives and property in alcohol-related accidents and crime. Calculating thosecosts creates both practical and theoretical difficulties, but a study sponsored bythe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimated the externaleconomic costs of alcohol abuse to be over $80 billion in 1992. By raising the price of alcoholic beverages, excise taxes generally result in consumers paying more of the costs of drinking. Studies consistently showthat higher prices lead to lower consumption and less abuse of alcohol, evenamong heavy drinkers. Therefore, increasing taxes would reduce the totalexternal costs of alcohol abuse. Increasing excise taxes to reduce consumption may be desirable regard- less of the effect on external costs if consumers are either unaware of or under-estimate the harm that their drinking causes to them and others or how addictivealcohol can be. Taxes on alcoholic beverages are regressive when compared with annual family income; that is, such taxes take up a greater percentage of income forlow-income families than for middle- and upper-income families. In addition,alcohol taxes fall not only on problem drinkers but also on drinkers who imposeno costs on society and are thus unduly penalized. Taxes are also likely to reduce consumption by some light drinkers who would have received beneficialhealth effects.272 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-44 INDEX TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL TAX RATES FOR INFLATION Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.2 2001 0.52002 0.72003 1.12004 1.3 2005 1.7 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 3.8 2000-2009 15.8 SOURCE: Joint Committee on Taxation.

Together those taxes represented nearly one-quarter of revenues from all excise taxes and almost 0.8 percent of total federalrevenues. Tobacco and alcohol excise taxes are currently imposed on a per-unit basis. In the absence of legislation, their real cost declines with inflation.For example, despite several small legislative increases, excise taxes on dis-tilled spirits have declined by nearly 80 percent in real terms since 1951. Indexing the tax rates for tobacco and alcoholic beverages for inflation would raise nearly $16 billion in the 2000-2009 period. Indexing those tax rates would prevent inflation from eroding real tax rates and would avoid theneed for abrupt nominal increases in the future. Smoking and drinking create costs to society that are not reflected in the pretax prices of tobacco and alcoholic beverages, which cover only productionand distribution costs. Examples of those \"external costs\" include medicalexpenses linked to smoking and drinking that are covered by the public, theeffects of cigarette smoke on the health of nonsmokers, and the loss of lives andproperty in alcohol-related accidents. By raising the price of tobacco and alcoholic beverages, excise taxes can result in consumers paying the full cost of smoking and drinking. Since in-creased excise taxes lead to reduced consumption of tobacco and alcoholicbeverages, such increases will r educe the total external costs of smoking and drinking. If those external costs come mainly from heavy or abusive consump-tion by a minority of consumers, however, higher excise taxes could undulypenalize moderate and occasional smokers and drinkers. Taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverages are regressive when compared with annual family income; that is, such taxes are a greater percentage of in-come for low-income families than for middle- and upper-income families. Inrecent years, tobacco taxes have become increasingly regressive as the smokingrate has declined faster among wealthier groups. An alternative to indexing would be to convert to ad valorem taxes, which equal a percentage of the manufacturer's price. That method would link taxrevenues to price increases, although it would tie revenues to the price of taxedgoods, not the general price level. A shortcoming of the ad valorem tax is thatit creates incentives for manufacturers to artificially lower the prices theycharge company-controlled wholesalers, thus reducing their tax liability.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 273 REV-45 INCREASE MOTOR FUEL EXCISE TAXES BY 12 CENTS PER GALLON Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 10.9 2001 14.62002 14.42003 14.42004 14.6 2005 68.9 2000-2009 SOURCE: Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTION : REV-34 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Federal Taxation of Tobacco, Alcoholic Beverages, and MotorFuels (Study), August 1990.Increasing petroleum taxes could encourage conservation by making petroleum more expensive, reduce pollution, and decrease the country's dependence onforeign oil suppliers while raising significant amounts of revenue. Imposing new or higher petroleum taxes would raise petroleum prices and reduce consumption. To the extent that taxes on oil reduced the demand forimported oil, foreign suppliers would absorb part of the tax through lowerworld oil prices. To the extent that petroleum taxes reduced petroleum con-sumption, the taxes would also reduce carbon dioxide emissions and couldtherefore help reduce global warming. Taxing petroleum is not the only way of reducing dependence on foreign oil supplies. Stockpiling oil would arguably be a better way of coping with therisks of increased dependence on imports because it would not artificially re-duce current energy use by households and businesses. That argument is basedon the premise that aside from the problem of interruptions in supply, world oilprices accurately reflect real resource costs and thus already provide an appro-priate incentive to conserve. A tax increase would reduce consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel by encouraging people to drive less or purchase more fuel-efficient cars andtrucks. In addition, the tax would offset, though imperfectly, the costs of pollu-tion and road congestion that automobile use produces. A rate increase onmotor fuel taxes would not adversely affect U.S. producers relative to foreignproducers because final consumers and the domestic transportation i ndustry purchase most of the motor fuel. Moreover, the overall motor fuel tax rate islow in the United States compared with the rates in other countries. Increasing tax rates on motor fuels would impose an added burden on the trucking industry and on people who commute long distances by car, who arenot necessarily the highway users who impose the highest costs of pollution andcongestion on others. Pollution and congestion costs are much higher indensely populated areas, primarily in the Northeast and coastal California,whereas per capita consumption of motor fuel is highest in rural areas. In addi-tion, taxes on gasoline and other petroleum products take up a greater percent-age of income for low-income families than for middle- and upper-incomefamilies. Federal motor fuel taxes are currently 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel fuel. A 12 cent increase would raise revenueby $10.9 billion in 2000 and $147 billion over the 2000-2009 period. It wouldraise the total federal tax rate for gasoline to 30.4 cents per gallon. To bolsterthe overall budget, the Congress could allocate the increased revenues to thegeneral fund\u2014as it did in 1998\u2014rather than use the additional revenues to fi-nance further highway spending.274 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-46-A TAX WATER POLLUTANTS ON THE BASIS OF BIOLOGICAL OXYGEN DEMAND Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 1.4 2001 2.12002 1.92003 1.92004 1.8 2005 1.8 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 9.1 2000-2009 17.6 SOURCE: on Taxation.

Taxes on waterpollutants discharged by those facilities could encourage further reductions inpollution below the level required by current regulations. Taxes can reducepollution cost-effectively by encouraging firms with the lowest abatement coststo reduce pollution, allowing firms with high abatement costs to continue pol-luting and pay the tax. Reductions in discharges caused by the tax would in-crease welfare if the additional abatement costs were less than or equal to thesocial benefits from reduced pollution levels. According to a recent survey of water quality submitted to the Environ- mental Protection Agency by states, tribes, and other jurisdictions, over 36percent of the nation's surveyed rivers, lakes, and estuaries fail to meet water-quality standards at some time during the year. Organic water pollutants con-tribute to that failure by depleting the oxygen in the water as they decompose.Dissolved oxygen is necessary to sustain fish and other aquatic life. Biologicaloxygen demand (BOD) measures the intensity of oxygen-demanding wastes inwater. (One BOD equals 1 milligram of oxygen consumed per 2.2 pounds ofeffluent.) One option is to impose a tax on the level of BOD in discharges. Gener- ally, firms subject to water pollution standards do not pay taxes or fees oneffluents (discharges) that regulations still allow. Most of the high-volumeBOD dischargers, sometimes referred to as point sources, are publicly ownedtreatment works (POTWs), paper and pulp mills, food processors, metal pro-ducers, and chemical plants. Discharges by point sources total about 12.5 mil-lion pounds of effluent per day, and publicly owned treatment works dischargeabout 8.4 million pounds of that amount. The cost of controlling discharges at POTWs and many industries subject to Clean Water Act regulations averages about 50 cents to 75 cents per poundof effluent removed. A charge on BOD levels in discharges could encouragemanufacturing facilities and POTWs with lower abatement costs to reducepollution. Assuming effluents record an average concentration of 22 BOD, atax of about 65 cents per pound of effluent discharged would raise $9.1 billionfrom 2000 through 2004 and about $17.6 billion over the 2000-2009 period. The costs of administering a BOD water pollution excise tax would be small because allowable levels of BOD discharges are specified in the permitsthat state and local governments issue to regulated sources of water pollution.Levying a tax on effluents from POTWs and large industrial dischargers wouldensure that the tax base included all of the largest dischargers of BOD. The taxoption, however, might raise constitutional issues about federal taxation oflocal governments. In that case, POTWs (or a federal authority) could collectthe tax directly from polluters that discharge into municipal sewer systems.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 275 REV-46-B IMPOSE AN EXCISE TAX ON TOXIC WATER POLLUTANTS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.1 2001 0.22002 0.22003 0.22004 0.2 2005 0.2 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 0.9 2000-2009 1.7 SOURCE: on Taxation. RELATED : REV-46-A, REV-47-A, REV-47-B, REV-47-C, and REV-47-D RELATED CBO PUBLICATION : Decreasing the Discharge of Bioaccumulative Toxic Water Pollutants: A Policy Analysis (Memorandum), December 1992.Taxes on major facilities that discharge water pollutants can both raise revenue and provide incentives for firms to reduce pollution cost-effectively (see optionREV-46-A). Harmful levels of toxic chemicals and metals in the water are akey concern because they do not readily break down in natural ecosystems, allowing them to accumulate in the environment. One option is to impose a taxof varying rates on companies that discharge certain toxic substances. Manufacturers in the United States discharged more than 170 million pounds of toxic substances into water directly in 1996 and more than 230 mil-lion pounds into water indirectly through sewers. Toxic pollutants generallyinclude organic chemicals (such as solvents and dioxins), metals (such as mer-cury and lead), and pesticides. Those pollutants may threaten the aquatic envi-ronment and human health. The amount of environmental harm that toxic water pollutants cause de- pends on their toxicity. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has de-vised a weighing method to indicate the toxicity of various pollutants. Usingthat weighing system makes it possible to measure the quantities of differenttypes of toxic pollutants by their \"toxic pound equivalents,\" which the EPAdefines as the pounds of the pollutant multiplied by its toxic weight. This op-tion adopts tax rates developed by the Congressional Research Service (CRS)in a study on the discharges of manufacturing firms in 1987. CRS defined fivecategories of pollutants on the basis of their toxicities. The tax rates variedfrom 65 cents per pound for the least toxic category of pollutants to $63.40 perpound for the most toxic cat egory. Those rates corres pond to a charge of $32.35 for the equivalent of each toxic pound. The variable tax rates providefirms with a greater incentive to reduce their most toxic discharges. According to the EPA, the cost of controlling the equivalent of an incre- mental toxic pound varies among industries, ranging from $1.50 to $606.00 (in1991 dollars). The tax, therefore, could encourage industries and firms withlow abatement costs to reduce their toxic discharges and would raise $1.7 bil-lion from 2000 through 2009. The Internal Revenue Service could use information that the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) provides on toxic discharges by manufacturing firmsto assess tax payments, or the EPA could collect the tax on behalf of the Inter-nal Revenue Service. An important considerati on, however, is that the accu- racy of TRI data is questionable. The TRI contains self-reported data, andmany facilities that meet the reporting r equirements fail to file reports or file inaccurate ones. To improve the accuracy of the TRI database and enhanceenforcement, frequent auditing would be necessary.276 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-47-A IMPOSE A TAX ON SULFUR DIOXIDE EMISSIONS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.5 2001 0.82002 0.72003 0.72004 0.6 2005 0.6 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 3.3 2000-2009 6.0 SOURCE: REV-46-B, REV-47-B, REV-47-C, REV-47-D, andREV-48 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION Affecting the Relative Success of EPA's NOx Cap-and- Trade Program (Paper), June 1998.Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets national standards for ambient air quality designed to protect public health andwelfare. The EPA defines acceptable levels for six \"criteria\" air pollutants:sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO), and lead. Along with emissions from natural sources, emis-sions of air pollutants from stationary sources (such as industrial facilities andcommercial operations) and mobile sources (automobiles, trains, and airplanes)contribute to the ambient levels of those criteria pollutants. Sulfur dioxide belongs to the family of sulfur oxide gases formed during the burning of fuel containing sulfur (mainly coal and oil) and during the opera-tion of metal smelting and other industrial processes. Exposure to high concen-trations of SO 2 may promote respiratory illnesses or aggravate cardiovascular disease. In addition, SO2 and NOx emissions are considered the main cause of acid rain, which the EPA believes degrades surface waters, damages forestsand crops, and accelerates corrosion of buildings. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 adopted a new acid rain control program that introduces a market-based system for emission allowances toreduce SO 2 emissions. An emission allowance is a limited authorization to emit a ton of SO2. The EPA allots tradable allowances to affected electric utilities according to their past fuel use and statutory limits on emissions. Once theallowances are allotted, the act requires that annual SO 2 emissions not exceed the number of allowances held by each utility plant. Firms may trade allow-ances, bank them for future use, or purchase them through periodic auctionsheld by the EPA. Firms with relatively low abatement costs have an economicincentive to reduce emissions and sell surplus allowances to firms that haverelatively high abatement costs. In general, taxes on emissions can also help reduce pollution in a cost-effective manner by encouraging firms with the lowest abatement costs toreduce pollution and allowing firms with high abatement costs to continue pol-luting and pay the tax. The following three options (REV-47-B, REV-47-C,and REV-47-D) would also base tax rates on an estimate of the average cost ofreducing an additional ton of pollution. Consequently, some firms with lower-than-average abatement costs might reduce their pollution levels below allow-able standards. One option is to tax emissions of SO 2 from stationary sources not already covered under the acid rain program. Imposing a tax of $200 per ton of SO2 emissions from those sources would raise roughly $6 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Most firms do not pay taxes or fees on emissions that regulationsstill allow, although major stationary sources must pay fees annually to coverprogram costs of operation permits under the Clean Air Act Amendments of1990. Basing the tax on the terms granted in those air pollution permits wouldminimize the cost of administering the tax for the Internal Revenue Service.Opponents argue that such a tax would impose an additional burden on manyfirms that already incur costs to comply with current regulations on emissions.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 277 REV-47-B IMPOSE A TAX ON NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 6.7 2001 9.72002 9.22003 8.92004 8.7 2005 8.5 2000-2004 43.2 2000-2009 84.7 REV-47-A, REV-47-C, REV-47-D, andREV-48 RELATED CBO PUBLICATION Affecting the Relative Success of EPA's NOx Cap-and- Trade Program (Paper), June 1998.Nitrogen oxides (NOx) usually enter the air as the result of high-temperature combustion processes such as those found in automobiles and power plants.Nitrogen oxides play an important role in the atmospheric reactions that gener-ate ground-level ozone (smog) and acid rain. The Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) believes that nitrogen oxides can irritate the l ungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections such as influenza. NO x and pollutants formed from NOx can be transported over long distances, so problems associ- ated with the pollutant are not confined to areas where NOx are emitted. The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires states to implement programs to re- duce ground-level ozone. Since NOx and ozone can be transported long dis- tances, the CAA requires upwind states to establish programs that will helpdownwind states meet statutory standards. The EPA ruled in 1998 that 22northeastern states and the District of Columbia have to revise their plans tofurther reduce NO x emissions. The rule does not mandate how NOx are to be reduced but gives each affected state a NOx emission target. The goal of the rule is to have programs in place by 2003 that reduce NOx emissions by about 1.2 million tons in the affected states by 2007. In addition, the EPA is encouraging the formation of a regional NOx al- lowance trading program similar to the national SO2 trading program. Such a program could be structured to encourage firms with relatively low costs forabatement to reduce their emissions and sell surplus NO x allowances to firms that have relatively high costs for abatement. One way to help control NOx would be to tax the stationary sources of NOx that do not participate in the regional NOx allowance trading program. The cost of controlling NOx from stationary sources ranges between $600 and $10,000 per ton abated. A tax of $1,500 per ton of NOx emissions from sta- tionary sources would encourage abatement at facilities with lower abatementcosts. For example, firms might adopt currently available abatement tech-niques whose capitalized costs are lower than the tax they would otherwise pay.A tax at that level would raise about $39 billion from 2000 to 2009. Thoserevenue estimates assume high participation in a NO x regional allowance trad- ing program. If the states declined to participate in a regional allowance trad-ing program and sources in those states were subject to the tax, the proposedtax would raise about $85 billion over the 2000-2009 period. Proponents of pollution taxes argue that such taxes discourage activities that impose costs on society. Opponents argue that the additional cost to firmsof such a tax may be greater than the additional benefits to society. Accurateestimates of additional social benefits from reducing pollution levels may notexist in some cases.278 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-47-C IMPOSE A TAX ON PARTICULATE MATTER Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 0.5 2001 0.72002 0.62003 0.62004 0.6 2005 0.6 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 3.0 2000-2009 6.0 SOURCE: : REV-46-A, REV-46-B, REV-47-A, REV-47-B, REV-47-D, andREV-48Particulate matter (PM) is the general term used for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Those particles come in a wide range ofsizes: fine particles are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, and coarse parti-cles are larger than 2.5 micrometers. The particles originate from many differ-ent stationary and mobile sources as well as from natural sources. Fine parti-cles result from fuel combustion in motor vehicles, power generation, and in-dustrial facilities as well as from residential fireplaces and wood stoves.Coarse particles are generally emitted from power plants and factories andsources such as vehicles traveling on unpaved roads, materials handling, andcrushing and grinding operations as well as from windblown dust. Some parti-cles are emitted directly from their sources such as smokestacks and cars. Inother cases, gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds interact with other compounds in the air to formPM. According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studies, emissions of PM (alone or combined with other air pollutants) are linked to some adversehealth effects. For example, particulate matter can carry heavy metals andcancer-causing organic compounds into the lungs, increasing the incidence andseverity of respiratory diseases. Other health effects may include increasedhospital admissions and emergency room visits for respiratory-related illnessesand chronic bronchitis. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA sets national standards for ambient air quality and is directed to review those standards every five years. In 1997, theEPA completed its review of the standards, finalized standards for fine particu-late matter, and revised those for ozone and coarse particulate matter. The newstandard for fine particles will require that a national monitoring network beestablished before states can develop plans showing how areas will attain thenew PM standard. Under the EPA's current timetable, states would begin tosubmit plans for controlling fine PM for EPA approval in 2005. The deadlinefor compliance with the new standard for fine PM is approximately 2017. Since monitoring systems and a permit system are already in place for coarse particle emissions, one option would be to tax such emissions from sta-tionary sources. That tax could be administered similarly to the taxes on SO 2 and NOx. A tax of $500 per ton of coarse PM would raise about $6 billion from 2000 through 2009. A tax on coarse PM may cause some electric utilitiesand manufacturing plants to install improved electrostatic precipitators, wetscrubbers, or other equipment to reduce their PM emissions and lower their taxburden. Reductions in emissions caused by the tax would be economicallyefficient if the additional abatement costs were less than the social benefitsfrom reduced pollution. Opponents of such a tax argue that it would impose an excessive burden on firms that already incur costs to comply with current standards. Further-more, to the extent that a tax on PM would eventually raise the price of energy,it might be regressive.PART TWO REVENUE OPTIONS 279 REV-47-D IMPOSE A TAX ON VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 12.0 2001 17.32002 16.32003 15.52004 14.8 75.9 2000-2009 REV-46-B, REV-47-A, REV-47-B, REV-47-C, andREV-48Ground-level ozone has remained a pervasive pollution problem in many areas of the United States. Ozone is not emitted directly into the air but is formed bythe reaction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO x) in the presence of heat and sunlight. Ozone occurs naturally in the stratosphere(the upper atmosphere) and provides a protective layer high above the earth. Atground level, however, ozone is the prime ingredient of smog. Short-term ex-posures (one to three hours) to ambient ozone concentrations have been linkedto increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits for respiratorycauses. Repeated exposure to ozone may m ake people more susceptible to respiratory infection and lung inflammation. In 1997, the Environmental Pro-tection Agency (EPA) revised the national ambient air-quality standards forozone. The new standard will replace the 0.12 parts per million (ppm) standardmeasured over one hour with a more stri ngent 0.08 ppm standard measured over eight hours. To control ozone pollution, the EPA has traditionally focused on reducing emissions of VOCs (and, more recently, NO x). VOCs include chemicals such as benzene, toluene, methylene chloride, and methyl chloroform. VOCs arereleased from burning fuel (gasoline, oil, wood, coal, natural gas, and the like)or from using solvents, paints, glues, and other products. One option is to tax emissions of VOCs from stationary sources. (See op- tions REV-47-B and REV-48 on taxing emissions of NO x and emissions from mobile sources, respectively.) Those sources range from huge industrial facili-ties, such as chemical plants, petroleum refineries, and coke ovens, to smallsources, such as bakeries and dry cleaners. The vast number and diversity ofstationary sources make it difficult to estimate emissions and the cost of abate-ment. A tax of $3,000 per ton on all VOC emissions from stationary sourcesmight promote some abatement and would generate slightly over $145 bi llion in revenues from 2000 through 2009. The advantage of a broad-based tax on VOCs is that it would affect large and small sources of the compounds. The EPA estimates that the small sourcesaccount for a large portion of emissions from stationary sources. Becausestationary sources emitting less than 2.5 tons of VOCs per year are not cur-rently subject to federal regulation, however, a broad-based VOC tax would beadministratively harder to implement than a tax on the large sources alone.Imposing the tax on small sources of VOCs through tec hnology-based estimates of emissions rather than measured emissions would reduce administrative costsbut it would also somewhat reduce the incentive to emit less. A disadvantageof such a broad-based tax is that it may be regressive. To the extent that thetax raises the prices of consumer goods, including food, it may take up a largershare of household income for low-income consumers than for higher-incomeconsumers.280 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 REV-48 IMPOSE A ONE-TIME TAX ON EMISSIONS FROM NEW AUTOMOBILES AND LIGHT TRUCKS Added Revenues (Billions of dollars) Annual 2000 2.0 2001 2.92002 2.92003 2.92004 2.9 2005 2.9 2006 Cumulative 2000-2004 13.6 2000-2009 27.9 SOURCE: Committee on Taxation. RELATED OPTIONS : REV-47-A, REV-47-B, REV-47-C, and REV-47-DThe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 strengthened the components of the earlier law that addressed mobile sources of pollution. They raised the tailpipestandards for cars, buses, and trucks and expanded inspection and maintenanceprograms to include more regions with pollution problems and to promote morestringent testing. The amendments also introduced several regulations to reduceair pollution from mobile sources, including regulations for selling improvedgasoline formulations in some polluted cities to reduce pollutant levels. Inaddition, the amendments provided new programs that tighten emission stan-dards for vehicles to encourage the development of even cleaner cars and fuels. Despite progress to date in controlling air pollution from motor vehicles, mobile sources continue to significantly affect national air quality. On averagenationwide, highway motor vehicles account for over one-quarter of all volatileorganic compound (VOC) emissions, almost one-third of nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions, and about 60 percent of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. A tax onemissions from mobile sources could provide an additional incentive for con-sumers to purchase cleaner cars and trucks, which could help to reduce emis-sions from those sources. One option is to tax emissions of NO x, VOCs, and CO from mobile sources. A one-time tax imposed on new automobiles and light trucks could bebased on grams of NO x, VOCs (measured in grams of hydrocarbons), and CO emitted per mile as estimated by the emissions tests that the EnvironmentalProtection Agency requires for every new vehicle. The tax could be adminis-tered like the \"gas guzzler\" excise tax. The auto dealer would collect the tax onbehalf of the Internal Revenue Service from the vehicle's purchaser. Such a tax averaging $250 per new pass enger car and light-duty truck could raise $27.9 billion in revenues from 2000 through 2009. Vehicles madein earlier years have been excluded from the estimate because of the adminis-trative problems of collecting the tax. A disadvantage of excluding older vehi-cles, however, is that they account for a larger share of emissions from mobilesources than do new vehicles. Opponents of this option argue that such a taxwould raise vehicle prices and therefore might encourage people to delay pur-chasing new vehicles.Appendix Scorekeeping Guidelines These budget scorekeeping guidelines are to be used by the House and Senate Budget Commit-tees, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget (the \"score-keepers\") in measuring compliance with the Congres-sional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA), as amended, andGRH as amended. 1 The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure that the scorekeepers measure the effects oflegislation on the deficit consistent with establishedscorekeeping conventions and with the specific re-quirements in those Acts regarding discretionaryspending, direct spending, and receipts. These rulesshall be reviewed annually by the scorekeepers andrevised as necessary to adhere to the purpose. Theserules shall not be changed unless all of the score-keepers agree. New accounts or activ ities shall be classified only after consultation among the score-keepers. Accounts and activities shall not be reclassi-fied unless all of the scorekeepers agree. 1. CLASSIFICATION OF APPROPRIATIONS : Following (pages 1014-1053 of conference report) is alist of appropriations that are normally enacted in ap-propriations acts. The list identifies appropriatedentitlements and other mandatory spending in appro-priations acts, and it identifies discretionary appropri-ations by category. 2. OUTLAYS PRIOR : Outlays from prior-year appropriations will be classified consistent with thediscretionary/mandatory classification of the accountfrom which the outlays occur.3. DIRECT SPENDING PROGRAMS : Entitle- ments and other mandatory programs (including off-setting receipts) will be scored at current law levels asdefined in section 257 of GRH, unless Congressionalaction modifies the authorization legislation. Substan-tive changes to or restrictions on entitlement law orother mandatory spending law in appropriations lawswill be scored against the Appropriations Committeesection 302(b) allocations in the House and the Senate.For the purpose of CBA scoring, direct spending sav-ings that are included in both an appropriation bill anda reconciliation bill will be scored to the reconciliationbill and not to the appropriation bill. For scoring un-der sections 251 or 252 of GRH, such provisions willbe scored to the first bill enacted. 4. TRANSFER OF BUDGET AUTHORITY FROM A MANDATORY ACCOUNT TO A DIS-CRETIONARY ACCOUNT : The transfer of budget authority to a discretionary account will be scored asan increase in discretionary budget authority and out-lays in the gaining account. The losing acc ount will not show an offsetting reduction if the account is anentitlement or mandatory. 5. PERMISSIVE TRANSFER AUTHORITY : Permissive transfers will be assumed to occur (in fullor in part) unless sufficient evidence exists to the con-trary. Outlays from such transfers will be estimatedbased on the best information available, primarily his-torical experience and, where applicable, indicationsof executive or congressional intent. This guideline will apply both to specific transfers (transfers where the gaining and losing accounts and 1.

REAPPROPRIATIONS : Reappropriations of expiring balances of budget authority will be scored asnew budget authority in the fiscal year in which thebalances become newly available. 7. ADVANCE APPROPRIATIONS : Advance ap- propriations of budget authority will be scored as newbudget authority in the fiscal year in which the fundsbecome newly available for obligation, not when theappropriations are enacted. 8. RESCISSIONS AND TRANSFERS OF UN- OBLIGATED BALANCES : Rescissions of un- obligated balances will be scored as reductions in cur-rent budget authority and outlays in the year themoney is rescinded. Transfers of unobligated balances will be scored as reductions in current budget authority and outlaysin the account from which the funds are being trans-ferred, and as increases in budget authority and out-lays in the account to which these funds are beingtransferred. In certain instances, these transactions will result in a net negative budget authority amount in the sourceaccounts. For purposes of section 257 of GRH, suchamounts of budget authority will be projected at zero.Outlay estimates for both the transferring and receiv-ing accounts w ill be based on the spending patterns appropriate to the respective accounts. 9. DELAY OF OBLIGATIONS : Appropriation acts specify a date when funds will become availablefor obligation. It is this date that determines the yearfor which new budget authority is scored. In the ab-sence of such a date, the act is assumed to be effectiveupon enactment. If a new appropriation provides that a portion of the budget authority shall not be available for obliga-tion until a future fiscal year, that portion shall be treated as an advance appropriation of budget author- ity. If a law defers existing budget authority (or unobligated balances) from a year in which it wasavailable for obligation to a year in which it was notavailable for obligation, that law shall be scored as a rescission in the current year and a reappropriation inthe year in which obligational authority is extended. 10. CONTINGENT LEGISLATION : If the author- ity to obligate is contingent on enactment of a subse- quent appropriation, new budget authority and outlays will be scored with the subsequent appropriation. If a discretionary appropriation is contingent on enactmentof a subsequent authorization, new budget authority and outlays will be scored with the appropriation. If a discretionary appropriation is contingent on the fulfill- ment of some action by the Executive Branch or some other event normally estimated, new budget authoritywill be scored with the appropriation and outlays willbe estimated based on the best information about when(or if) the contingency will be met. Non-law makingcontingencies within the control of the Congress are not scoreable events. 11. SCORING PURCHASES, LEASE-PUR- CHASES, CAPITAL LEASES, AND OPERATINGLEASES: When a law provides the authority for an agency to enter into a contract for the purchase, lease-purchase, or lease of an asset, budget authority andoutlays will be scored as follows: For lease-purchases and capital leases, budget authority will be scored against the legislation in theyear in which the budget authority is first made avail-able in the amount of the estimated net present govern-ment's total estimated legal obligations over the life ofthe contract, except for imputed interest costs calcu-lated at Treasury rates for marketable debt instru-ments of similar maturity to the lease period and iden-tifiable annual operating expenses that would be paidby the government as owner (such as utilities, mainte-nance, and insurance). Property taxes will not be con-sidered to be an operating cost. Imputed interest costswill be classified as mandatory and will not be scoredagainst the legislation or for current level but willcount for other purposes. For operating leases, budget authority will be scored against the legislation in the year in which thebudget authority is first made available in the amountnecessary to cover the government's legal obligations.The amount scored w ill include the estimated total payments expected to arise under the full term of aAPPENDIX SCOREKEEPING GUIDELINES 283 lease contract or, if the contract will include a cancel- lation clause, an amount sufficient to cover the leasepayments for the first fiscal year during which thecontract is in effect, plus an amount sufficient to coverthe costs associated with cancellation of the contract.For funds that are self-insuring under existing author-ity, only budget authority to cover the annual leasepayment is required to be scored. Outlays for lease-purchase in which the Federal government assumes substantial risk--for example,through an explicit government guarantee of thirdparty financing -- will be spread across the period dur-ing which the contractor constructs, manufactures, orpurchases the asset. Outlays for an operating lease, acapital lease, or a lease-purchase in which the privatesector retains substantial risk, will be spread acrossthe lease period. In all cases, the total amount of out-lays scored over time against legislation will equal theamount of budget authority scored against that legisla-tion. No special rules apply to scoring purchases of assets (whether the asset is existing or is to be manu-factured or constructed). Budget authority is scored inthe year in which the authority to purchase is firstmade available in the amount of the government's esti-mated legal obligations. Outlays scored will equal theestimated disbursements by the government based onthe particular purchase arrangement, and over timewill equal the amount of budget authority scoredagainst that legislation. Existing contracts will not be rescored.To distinguish lease purchases and capital leases from operating leases, the following criteria will beused for defining an operating lease: -- Ownership of the asset remains with the lessor during the term of the lease and is not trans-ferred to the government at or shortly after theend of the lease period. -- The lease does not contain a bargain-price pur- chase option. -- The lease term does not exceed 75 percent of the estimated economic lifetime of the asset.-- The present value of the minimum lease pay- ments over the life of the lease does not exceed90 percent of the fair market value of the assetat the inception of the lease. -- The asset is a general purpose asset rather than being for a special purpose of the governmentand is not built to unique specification for thegovernment as lessee. -- There is a private-sector market for the asset.Risks of ownership of the asset should remain with the lessor. Risk is defined in terms of how governmental in nature the project is. If a project is less governmentalin nature, the private-sector risk is considered to behigher. To evaluate the level of private-sector riskassociated with a lease-purchase, legislation and lease-purchase contracts will be considered against the fol-lowing type of illustrative criteria, which indicateways in which the project is less governmental: -- There should be no provision of government financing and no explicit government guaranteeof third party financing. -- Risks of ownership of the asset should remain with the lessor unless the Government was atfault for such losses. -- The asset should be a general purpose asset rather than for a special purpose of the Gov-ernment and should not be built to unique spec-ification for the Government as lessee. -- There should be a private-sector market for the asset. -- The project should not be constructed on Gov- ernment land. Language that attempts to waive the Anti-Defi- ciency Act, or to limit the amount or timing of obliga-tions recorded, does not change the government's obli-gations or obligational authority, and so will not affectthe scoring of budget authority or outlays.284 MAINTAINING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE: SPENDING AND REVENUE OPTIONS April 1999 Unless language that authorizes a project clearly states that no obligations are allowed unless budgetauthority is provided specifically for that project in anappropriations bill in advance of the obligation, thelegislation will be interpreted as providing obligationauthority, in an amount to be estimated by thescorekeepers. 12. WRITE-OFFS OF UNCASHED CHECKS, UNREDEEMED FOOD STAMPS, AND SIMILARINSTRUMENTS : Exceptional write-offs of un- cashed checks, unredeemed food stamps, and similarinstruments (i.e., cumulative balances that have builtup over several years or have been on the books forseveral years) shall be scored as an adjustment to themeans of financing the deficit rather than as an offset.An estimate of write-offs or similar adjustments thatare part of a continuing routine process shall be nettedagainst outlays in the year in which the write-off willoccur. Such write-offs shall be recorded in the ac-count in which the outlay was originally recorded. 13. RECLASSIFICATION AFTER AN AGREE- MENT: Except to the extent assumed in a budget agreement, a law that has the effect of altering theclassification of spending and revenues (e.g., fromdiscretionary to mandatory, special fund to revolvingfund, on-budget to off-budget, revenue to offsettingreceipt), will not be scored as reclassified for the pur-pose of enforcing a budget agreement. 14. SCORING OF RECEIPT INCREASES OR DIRECT SPENDING REDUCTIONS FOR ADDI-TIONAL ADMINISTRATION OR PROGRAMMANAGEMENT EXPENSES : No increase in re- ceipts or decrease in direct spending will be scored asa result of provisions of a law that provides directspending for administration or program managementactivities.15. ASSET SALES : If the net financial cost to the government of an asset sale is zero or negative (a sav-ings), the amount scored shall be the estimated changein receipts and mandatory outlays in each fiscal yearon a cash basis. If the cost to the government is posi-tive (a loss), the proceeds from the sale shall not bescored for the purposes of the CBA or GRH. The net financial cost to the Federal government of an asset sale shall be the net present value of thecash flows from: (1) estimated proceeds from the asset sale;(2) the net effect on Federal revenues, if any, based on special tax treatments specified inthe legislation; (3) the loss of future offsetting receipts that would otherwise be collected under contin-ued government ownership (using baselinelevels for the projection period and esti-mated levels thereafter); and (4) changes in future spending, both discretion- ary and mandatory, from levels that wouldotherwise occur under continued govern-ment ownership (using baseline levels forthe projection period and at levels estimatedto be necessary to operate and maintain theasset thereafter). The discount rate used to estimate the net present value shall be the average interest rate on marketableTreasury securities of similar maturity to the expectedremaining useful life of the asset for which the esti-mate is being made, plus 2 percentage points to reflectthe economic effects of continued "}
