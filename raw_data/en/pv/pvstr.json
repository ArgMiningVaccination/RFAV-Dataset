Energy: Vyvamind uses the precise doses of caffeine and theanine found in clinical studies to produce the biggest increases in mental energy, focus and processing speeds while eliminating side effects and promoting a calm mind.

Nootropics and smart drugs, also known as cognitive enhancers, brain pills, or brain supplements, consist of prescription drugs, dietary supplements, or synthetic compounds that may improve cognitive performance and brain health. Depending on the type of nootropic ingredients the formula contains, these smart drugs can affect the body in different ways, including increasing blood flow to bring more oxygen to your brain cells. However, the term \"nootropic\" can apply to any synthetic or natural substance that could impact brain function and mental skills positively. Additionally, nootropic supplements support a range of cerebral functions that help with intracellular signaling, neurotransmission, and molecular processes. In turn, they may help you improve learning, memory, and overall cognition. You may also come across nootropic supplements that can help your body replenish vital proteins and amino acids that foster mental clarity and overall cognitive health. How We Ranked the Top Nootropic Pills Ingredients While dietary supplements aren't usually subject to clinical trials, the nootropic supplements in this review all contain scientific-evidence-backed ingredients. In fact, the best nootropics have scientific studies supporting the quality and efficacy of the compounds, extracts, vitamins, amino acids, and nutrients that improve cognitive skills and brain function. We'll go deeper into the most common ingredients in nootropic stacks and the evidence behind their effectiveness in a bit, so keep reading. Advertised Benefits Of course, every manufacturer wants to claim that their product is the absolute best nootropic and will provide the most improvements to your cognition, memory, mental performance, and cerebral health. Therefore, we looked closely at every cognitive benefit of the five supplements in this review, from supporting healthy brain cells to aiding in recovery after intense cognitive exertion and improving memory and mental clarity. Then, we checked for any scientific studies backing up these claims. All five of our picks fit the bill, verifying that they were high-quality products that will improve cognitive abilities. User Reviews One of the best ways to verify whether a nootropic supplement is actually effective and provides noticeable results is by reading through user reviews from actual customers. So we checked reviews from real-life customers on each manufacturer's official website, then looked on other platforms, such as Google and e-commerce stores. Finally, we researched each manufacturer's overall reputation and whether they were a well-established brand with a loyal customer base. Price One of the biggest factors to consider when purchasing any product is price, including dietary supplements and nootropics. As you may know, the best nootropics can be expensive. However, for many people, the beneficial results far outweigh the cost. You can save money on your order by purchasing multiple bottles or subscribing to promotional emails. In addition, each of the nootropic supplements we reviewed offered a 30- or 60-day money-back guarantee or had a refund policy for unopened bottles. How to Choose the Most Effective Nootropics Look for Clean Labels When we say \"clean labels,\" we mean supplements that don't contain proprietary blends or complexes. Why? Because companies can hide the actual dosage levels and amounts of the ingredients in a supplement by using the term \"proprietary blend.\" For unethical manufacturers, the term is a legal loophole that allows them to claim that their supplement contains the most expensive or effective compounds, while in reality, it only has them in trace amounts. Therefore, you should only purchase dietary supplements with transparent, honest labeling that discloses precise dosage levels. Avoid Stimulants The most common nootropic is caffeine, a stimulant that is a popular ingredient in many smart drugs. However, that fact doesn't mean it's a great idea to use nootropics full of stimulants. You may find that taking a stimulant-heavy smart drug can cause side effects like a racing heart or pulse, headache, or jitters. In general, we recommend avoiding stimulants for non-prescription nootropic supplements. Product Guarantees The best nootropic supplements have product guarantees that offer dissatisfied consumers some recourse to get their money back, usually minus shipping charges. Money-back guarantees are a good sign that the supplement manufacturer believes in the quality and effectiveness of the product, its formula, and the results it will provide consumers. The best deal we found was Brain Pill and Noocube, which both offer customers a 60-day money-back guarantee. Effective Dosages Finding an all-in-one nootropic stack with adequate and effective dosage levels is critical. Of course, taking a nootropic with low dosages likely won't provide noticeable benefits and improvements to your cognition and mental skills. However, taking too much of a supplement could cause adverse side effects, such as headaches or nausea. All of the five nootropics we reviewed had no known side effects and clean labels listing the ingredients and amounts. The Most Popular Brain Boosting Ingredients When researching the best nootropics, you'll probably find that many of them have the same ingredients. But which are the most effective and produce the best results? We'll explore the most popular nootropics and how they can boost your brain performance. Caffeine Caffeine is perhaps the most commonly used nootropic in the world. Drinking a cup of coffee can provide cognitive benefits by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain and reducing feelings of fatigue. In addition, it can improve concentration and mental alertness. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7601837/) showed that chronic caffeine consumption resulted in a \"significantly lower risk\" of developing neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. Lion's Mane Mushroom Lion's mane mushrooms are actually quite beautiful. The fruiting bodies are large and wide, with dozens of long, drooping white tendrils that resemble a lion's flowing mane. In addition to this super mushroom's ability to improve brain function, it can also support the healthy function of your heart and intestine. However, the primary benefit of taking lion's mane mushrooms is replenishing the neurochemicals to produce active brain cells. One study showed that lion's mane resulted in a 60.6% [neurite outgrowth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24266378/), which is why it's such a common ingredient in the best nootropic supplements. L-Theanine L-theanine is one of the most important amino acids for brain function and has many nootropic properties. Primarily, it works by raising dopamine, serotonin, and GABA levels in the human brain. However, [studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836118/) that L-theanine can increase both verbal and letter fluency, making it ideal for people with stress-related issues and cognitive decline. Combining L-theanine and caffeine can enhance mental alertness and accuracy when multitasking. The combination is a great way to improve cognitive performance, which is why you'll commonly see both ingredients in nootropic supplements. Bacopa Monnieri For centuries, Ayurvedic medicine has harnessed the nootropic benefits of Bacopa monnieri, an aquatic plant. If you want to improve your cognitive function, Bacopa monnieri is one of the best nootropics to add to your health and wellness regimen. The plant contains bacosides A and B, which support a healthy stress response. In addition, studies have shown that [Bacopa monnieri](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564646/) is a cognitive enhancer and has the potential to reduce oxidative damage. Rhodiola Rosea Also known as golden root or arctic root, Rhodiola rosea is a flower that grows in the frigid mountains of Europe. Rhodiola rosea is an adaptogen, meaning that it increases your body's natural resistance to stress. One study found that participants taking this adaptogenic herb showed noticeable improvements and symptom relief regarding the depression and stress that are often part of mental fatigue and burnout. Another review of over 35 studies concluded that [Rhodiola rosea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288277/) supports learning and memory skills. Ginkgo Biloba If you were to head to China, you would find ginkgo biloba, a native tree the Chinese have used for thousands of years. The tree's compounds provide numerous health benefits for people, such as reducing cognitive decline. Researchers reviewed 21 different studies that showed how [ginkgo biloba](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26268332/) is beneficial for people with mild Alzheimer's, improving their capabilities. Further reviews of additional studies concluded that ginkgo might reduce numerous symptoms of dementia in people suffering from this cognitive disorder. Maritime Pine Bark Extract The maritime pine tree grows along the Mediterranean coasts in Portugal, Spain, Morocco, and France. Maritime pine bark extract might improve cognitive function, particularly for those with mild cognitive impairment or decline. In addition, research suggests that French pine bark extract, known as Pycnogenol, improves oxidative stress and cognitive function in healthy working professionals. CDP Choline CDP choline is an essential nutrient and water-soluble compound that serves as a common ingredient in brain pills and nootropic supplements. CDP choline is necessary for your body to produce acetylcholine, a vital neurotransmitter that affects intelligence, mood, and memory. Certain studies have shown that choline can improve brain function, including mental processing and memory. Research has also shown that CDP-choline may improve verbal memory in older adults with poor memory skills. Vitamin B-12 You've probably heard of vitamin B-12, another common ingredient you'll find in most nootropics. Research shows that a combination of Omega-3 fatty acids and Vitamin B-12 reduces the signs of mental decline in people with early-stage dementia. Furthermore, high levels of Vitamin B-12 can also increase the likelihood of recovery from mental illness such as major depressive disorder in people with a B12 deficiency. Benefits of Taking Nootropic Supplements We just discussed the most common ingredients you'll find in the [best brain supplements](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/06/06/10-best-brain-supplements-for-memory-focus-brain-health/). But what are the actual benefits of taking nootropics? Let's discuss that now. Brain Health (Brain Cells) The best nootropic supplements promote brain cell health by supporting maintenance, growth, and recovery for peak cerebral performance. The best nootropic supplement for supporting brain cell health is Mind Lab Pro, although Noocube and Hunter Focus are also effective for optimizing your cerebral health and function. Improve Mental Performance Brain fog and mental fatigue are two common signs of interrupted neural pathways and stress. If you're experiencing a lag in mental performance and cognitive function, taking a nootropic supplement can be a significant way to boost your brain power. Nootropics can optimize communication along your neural pathways, helping you achieve peak performance. Short-Term Memory Have you ever found yourself forgetting dates, names, or appointments? Short-term memory loss is commonly associated with cognitive decline. However, you can combat short-term memory loss by taking a nootropic supplement. In particular, nootropics rich in amino acids may support a healthy nerve growth factor and neural communication, causing a boost in your short-term memory and recall ability. Focus and Productivity Do your job and extracurricular activities require a very high level of cognitive functioning? If so, then taking a nootropic supplement is an option to sharpen your focus, improve your eye for detail, and boost productivity. For example, if you work very long hours, many nootropics can help you shake off the brain fog and lack of sleep and still perform at peak levels the next day at work. Mood Your overall mood and emotional balance can significantly impact your day. Fortunately, taking nootropics can positively affect your emotion and mood. Essentially, nootropics can balance your mood by interacting with the brain to correct chemical imbalances and reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression. A List of Synthetic Smart Drugs To Consider Another option that many people consider regarding nootropics is synthetic smart drugs. Let's discuss four of the most popular right now. Modafinil Modafinil is a prescription drug that can treat narcolepsy. However, it's also a synthetic nootropic that may help people reduce fatigue and boost brain energy and function. While experts consider Modafinil to have a lower risk of dependence, taking this synthetic nootropic at high levels may cause withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop. Adderall Adderall is another synthetic prescription drug containing amphetamine salts that doctors commonly prescribe to people with the learning disability Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, known as ADHD. Adderall helps your brain modulate specific chemicals that control focus, behavior, and memory, and also leaves you feeling more alert and awake. However, you should know that Adderall has a very high risk of physical dependency. That's why we recommend [natural adderall alternatives](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/06/11/natural-adderall-alternatives-10-best-otc-adderall-substitutes-for-adhd/) for improving cognitive performance. Noopept If you want a nootropic that delivers an immediate and noticeable boost of cognitive energy, Noopept is a good choice. The synthetic nootropic supports healthy levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a compound essential for developing brain cells. It also may contribute to faster recovery after a brain injury. Piracetam Piracetam is another synthetic nootropic that's very similar in structure to Noopept, making it a popular alternative. This \"smart drug\" helps people with a cognitive decline improve their memory. However, it may not be as effective or produce the same results in normal, healthy individuals. Frequently Asked Questions About Nootropics Do Nootropic Supplements Really Work to Improve Cognitive Function? Yes, nootropic supplements work. However, please remember that your results may vary based on your level of intellect, your body type, if you have any cognitive impairments, etc. Most nootropics work by increasing blood flow to the brain, although they can help enhance brain function in a variety of ways. For example, nootropics can also optimize brain activity and neural communication and improve short-term and long-term memory. How Much Do Nootropics Cost? The price of nootropics depends on the manufacturer, quality, ingredients, dosages, and more. However, the best nootropics often cost anywhere from $50 to $90 a bottle, usually consisting of a one-month supply. Luckily, you have a few different options for saving money on your purchase.

If you're looking for a natural alternative to Adderall, three of the best nootropics include Performance Lab Mind, Noocube, and Mind Lab Pro.

Can Smart Pills Help with ADHD? If you or your child has ADHD, you've probably searched for medications or supplements that can help you maintain focus and concentration while avoiding mental burnout. Adderall is one of the most common prescription medications for treating ADHD and can improve mental focus, concentration, and energy levels. However, natural nootropic supplements are a great option if you're looking for a safer alternative to prescription medications like Adderall or Ritalin. Who Should Consider Taking Nootropics? Nootropics are highly popular among entrepreneurs, professionals, students, older individuals, athletes, and even healthy individuals. Essentially, any adult over the age of 18 can benefit from taking nootropics if they want to increase their cognitive skills, improve memory, and maintain a healthy brain. Of course, you should always consult with your physician before starting a supplement regimen, especially if you're on any type of prescription medication. Can Brain Supplements Help Improve Memory? Yes, brain supplements can help improve memory, detail retention, and recall. If you've been having trouble remembering names, dates, appointments, etc., taking a nootropic can help you boost your memory. For example, research shows that they increase blood circulation to the brain while replenishing essential nutrients (like glucose, which the brain needs for fuel) and improving energy levels. Nootropics can also increase neuroplasticity, which enhances brain activity and memory abilities. Are Nootropic Supplements FDA-Approved? Nootropics are dietary supplements, which means they do not require approval from the FDA. Only prescription medications require FDA approval. However, that doesn't mean that they aren't safe. The five nootropic supplements in this review all have natural ingredients with no known side effects, and all five brands manufacture their products in FDA-registered facilities, either in the U.S. or U.K. How Long Does It Take for Nootropics to Work? The amount of time it takes for nootropics to work varies on a few factors, such as the type of supplement, body type, weight, etc. For example, Noopept, a synthetic nootropic, often has almost immediate effects on cognitive ability. However, natural nootropics can take up to 60 days of consistent use to provide the full benefits to users. Usually, fast-acting nootropics offer a short-term boost, whereas natural nootropics are better for long-term optimization. Adderall and Ritalin take about 30 minutes to one hour to take effect, generally peaking around three hours.
