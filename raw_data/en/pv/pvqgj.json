The goal of Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe is to provide students with accurate information about HIV disease and guide them in making responsible decisions to protect their health and the health of others both now and in the futu re. HIV prevention education should be part of the total health education curriculum. As in any new or revised program, school di stricts should examine these instructional methods and materials to determine the appropr iateness of content for their students. The review criteria used for this document included the importance of content; medically accurate information; examinat ion of materials; presentati attainable objectives; organization and usability; appropriate evalua tion activities to assess learning of concepts; and clarity of information for st udents and teachers. Program evaluation is critical in order to impl ement an HIV preventi on program that provides meaningful learning experiences that meet district goals and community standards. One of the most effective strategies to evaluate a curriculum is to form an HIV Prevention Education Advisory Committee at the school or district levels. This committee could include teachers, school administrators, school board members, students, parents, health depar tment representatives, other health professionals and community members. The committee may also assist the district in the implementation of an HIV prevention educati on plan. One recommended activity would be to provide training opportunities for all district sta ff and school board mem bers. The committee could also assist in the planning of a parent night to be conducted prior to HIV prevention instruction. A par ent's letter and proposed parent's night agenda is included in the resource section to assist in plann ing. By taking a step by step approach to HIV education, students are provided with a program that is suppor ted not only by the entire district but by their parent s and community at large. 2 INTRODUCTION TO THE REVISED CURRICULUM In the nearly 19 years since the curriculu m was first developed, approximately 5,000 more people in Oregon have been diagnosed with AIDS and 850,000 nationwide. Throughout that time a cons istent 17-20% of all AIDS cases have been among 20-29 year-olds. Because the time between getting infected with HIV and the time of being diagnosed with AIDS is 8-10 years on average, we know that many of those 20-29 year-olds became infected as adolescents. Ideally, all risk of HIV infection could be el iminated if students abs tained from sexual intercourse, alcohol and drug use and needle s haring. The reality, however is quite different from that, and our education effort s must be designed to reach all students, especially those at highest risk. Studies show that Oregon students are at risk for HIV infection. Forty-one percent (41%) of 11th-grade students who responded to the 2004 Oregon Healthy Teens Survey (OHTS) repor ted they have had sexual intercourse. Only 64% of those who are sexually acti ve stated they had used a condom at last intercourse. Rates of sexually transmitted disease among teens are continuing to be a problem in Oregon. Thirty-thr ee to thirty-five percent (33- 35%) of all Chlamydia cases were among teens 15-19. Seventeen percent (17%) of all cases of gonorrhea in Oregon are among teens. Drug and alcohol use are prevalent am ong Oregon students according to the 2004 OHTS and occur statewide in rural communiti es, as well as urban ones. Forty-five percent (45%) of Oregon OHTS participants had at least one drink of alcohol during the 30 days prior to the survey, but 29% had five or more drinks of alcohol in a row during that same time. Twenty-four percent (20%) used marijuana during the 30 days preceding the survey. A small percentage of students reported usi ng steroid pills or shots, and having injected an illegal drug. There is still no cure for AIDS, and no vaccinati on for HIV. Given these realities, HIV prevention education is absolut ely imperative. To do less than an all-out education effort is to leave our young people at seri ous risk for getting infected with HIV. HIV prevention education is best delivered within a comprehensiv e health education program that includes sexual ity and family life education. Those teachers and school districts that have the most difficult time teaching about HIV and AIDS are those who have had no training in sexuality education and where the required HIV/AIDS education must stand alone, without benefit of a comprehensive health education program. Having a comprehensive program in place also makes it easier for teachers in other classes (such as English or social studies , in grades where health is not taught) to integrate HIV education at ev ery grade level as required by OAR 581-22-1440. In those districts where controversy or fear of controversy precl udes a quality program in health, sexuality or HIV preventi on education, the students are placed at risk by that educational system. School boards, adminis trators, and communities must be accountable for ensuring that students in thei r districts are not le ft at risk because of their policies or progr ams or lack of them. Although it is a common myth that HI V/AIDS information changes daily, the information most important for student education has not changed. HIV is spread in three ways: through having sex exchanging blood with an infected person from an infected woman to her fetus or newborn by blood or breast milk 3 These are behaviors we must address in our education to students. To this end, and in response to requests from teachers throughout Oregon who have used and evaluated the first edition of the cu rriculum, we have made important changes and additions to this revised curriculum. It is more relevant to students' lives, the framework as a stronger theoretical base for behavior change, and the lessons are designed to increase student learning through c ooperative learning and critical thinking activities. Education courses are intended to teach life skills necessary for successful living. As in nutrition, fitness, stress and personal health, pr eventive education in HIV/AIDS is critical to teac hable behaviors to last a lifetime. The majority of high school graduates in Oregon do not go on to college. Thus, high school may well present the last opportunity to reach young people and help them learn responsible skills and behaviors necessary for prevention of HIV/AIDS. Oregon's newly-adopted K-12 Health Educati on Content Standards (Feb. 17, 2005) emphasize the teaching of skill development. Th is revised curriculum is aligned to the new Content Standards. School districts ha ve until the 2007-08 school year to align their health education curriculum with the Cont ent Standards.

Updates to the electronic version will be published by the Oregon Department of Education (ODE ). It is imperative that any HIV education program have the capability to change informati on easily to accommodate new data. Each grade level unit of this curriculum gui de contains five to six lesson plans. These plans contain objectives, materials needed, procedures to attain the objectives and suggested evaluation activities. Other strategi es can be successfully incorporated into the program to meet varyi ng teaching and learning styles. Following each lesson, teacher information is provided. This section is only for the instructor and intended to gi ve background on the lesson. So me teachers will use all of the information while others will use only segm ents due to the differences in their students' level of maturity, knowledge-base, and community expectations. Student materials and transparency masters follow the teacher information. The appendix provides information on supplemental material s available from other Oregon agencies. School districts should determine the contex t in which HIV education will be taught. HIV education must be part -of a comprehensive school heal th education program. Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe was written to exist within units addressing communicable diseases, sexually transmitted diseases , and alcohol and drug prevention. HIV education can be further enhanced by examin ing the epidemic within other academic subjects. Community Participation The success of any educational program or curriculum depends upon the support of the parents and community. Parents, guardi ans, and other members of the community can provide valuable guidance in the development of an inst ructional program. They can be directly involved by participating in a formal review of this curriculum and by taking part in their child's activities and assi gnments. A prime activity for soliciting community support is to conduct a parent's night. This provides an opportunity to present current scientific information about HIV disease and introduce the parents to the HIV prevention ed ucation program. Families make decisions to share informa tion according to their own cultural and religious values and lifestyles. As a child's learning comes from their family as well as the school, peers, and community, each family c an also consult their own faith group or religious consultation to assist them in talking about HIV/AIDS. One of the most important variables in the success of a HIV prevention program is the teacher. The teacher's background on a topic, comfort level in teaching the subject, and willingness to provide a variety of learning opportunities are factors that contribute to a quality instructional program. 5 HIV education requires a professional who has the ability to present accurate information and is sensitive to the needs of students and the community. Educators must use a variety of teaching strategies that allow for the diversity of student learning styles. To properly prepare teachers to implement HIV prevention educati on, the district should provide professional dev elopment opportunities. O ne of the most important developmental activities is to give t eachers the opportunity to evaluate their own attitudes related to this epidemic. ODE can furnish the technical expertise required to conduct HIV prevention education workshops ( www.hklb.org ). Student Education Knowledge, attitudes and behavior are the th ree areas of learning that must be addressed in HIV prevention education. Information should be directed toward the knowledge of risk behaviors associated with HIV transmission and the behaviors that prevent HIV infection. Classroom instru ction and activities should be based upon the evaluation of student needs and readiness. Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe offers lessons based upon the c oncept of critical thinking skills. These lessons provide the student a chance to judge and evaluate information; examine society's response to this epidemic ; and define or develop personal attitudes about HIV prevention and education. This curriculum also includes scenarios and situational dramas which require st udents to use risk-reducing behaviors and responsible decision-making skills. Before presenting HIV prevention educat ion, classroom ground rules must be established. Students need to f eel comfortable about the subject matter. The teacher should clearly define the methods by wh ich student questions and group discussion will be handled. Discussion, peer interaction, and questions should be encouraged. The choice not to participate in activities, if an i ndividual does not feel at ease, must also be honored. The goal of this curriculum and guide is to provide students the opportunity to learn accurate information about HIV infection and to develop skills and attitudes that will lead them to make healthy decisions to prevent HIV disease. This prevention education should be discussed in the context of comm unicable diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, and alcohol and dr ug prevention. Information about HIV disease and AIDS must be accurate and relative to the ages of the students. Fear and shame are not effective themes to use when teaching student s about HIV disease. Children relate to living. Therefore, mainta ining the quality of life thr ough preventive strategies and responsible decisions is the preferred me thod in which to learn about this epidemic. Paula Radloff HIV Health Educator-Schools 6 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe CURRICULUM PHILOSOPHY, GOAL, AND OBJECTIVES Philosophy We believe a primary obligati on of the educational system is to provide opportunities for students to develop skills necessary to be responsible for choosing and practicing healthy behaviors. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) disease has become one of the most serious health issues facing today's yout h. Because there is not a medical solution to this epidemic, education is the pr imary strategy in its prevention. Instructional Goal The goal of this curriculum is to provide students the opportunity to learn accurate information about HIV infection and AIDS to develop skills and attitudes that will lead them to make healthy decisions to pr event acquired immunodef iciency syndrome. Program Objectives: Grades 4-5 Analyze a list of risk and no-risk behaviors. Synthesize risk behaviors and methods for their prevention. Comprehend the differences betw een communicable and non-communicable diseases. Comprehend the purpose of infect ion control and its procedures. Explain how HIV affects the i mmune system. Comprehend how human immunodeficiency virus is spread. Explain how HIV infection and AIDS can be prevented. Evaluate information on HIV disease and community response to persons with AIDS. Explain his or her feelings about persons infected with HIV or who have AIDS. 7 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe Disease Prevention for Elementary Students Curriculum - Grades K-3 2005 (Revised) Oregon Department of Education Susan Castillo State Superintendent of Public Instruction Oregon Department of Human Services Bruce Goldberg, Director 8 It is the policy of the State Board of Educ ation and a priority of the Oregon Department of Education that t here will be no discrimin ation or harassment on the grounds of race, color, sex, marital status, religion, nati onal origin, age or handi cap in any educational programs, activities or employment. Persons having questions about equal opportunity and nondiscrimination should cont act the State Superintendent of Public Instruction at the Oregon Department of Education.

All or any part of this document may be photocopied for educational purposes without permission from the Oreg on Department of Education. 9 PREFACE This curriculum resource guide was writt en and published by the Oregon Department of Education (ODE). Funding was provided th rough a grant from the Centers for Disease Control. Teachers and others from throughout the state have assisted in the development of the guide. A working draft produced in Januar y 1989 was evaluated by over 75 reviewers statewide representing administrators, clergy, medica l professionals, parents, and teachers. Their comments we re presented to the ODE AIDS Advisory Committee, and a draft was produced for use in 14 regional workshops. Participants' comments were helpful in producing the final document. The 2006 revised edition was prepared by Br ad Victor, HIV/STD Prevention Program Coordinator, Oregon Department of Education, and reviewed by the Oregon HIV/AIDS Materials Review Panel. School District Review This is a state developed resource guide for districts to present to their local AIDS advisory committees. At the local level schools can choose to adopt the guide in full, to adopt part of the guide with modifications, or elect not to adopt the guide and instead develop curricula locally. In any case, t he local curricula must reflect the plan of instruction outlined in OAR 581-22-1440 ( http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/rules/OARS_500/OAR_581/581_022.html ). As in any program, school districts shoul d examine these instructional methods and materials to determine the appropriateness of c ontent for their students. Examples of review criteria used for this document incl uded the importance of content, examination of materials, presentation of attainabl e objectives, organization and usability, appropriate evaluation activities to asse ss learning of concepts, and clarity of information for students and teachers. Progra m evaluation is critical in order to implement an HIV prevention program that provides meaningful learning experiences that meet district goals and community standards. The success of any educational program or curriculum depends upon the support of the parents and community. Parents, guardians, and other members of the community can provide valuable guidance in t he development of an instructi onal program. They can be directly involved by participating in a formal review of this curriculum and by taking part in their child's activities and assignments. One of the most effective strategies to develop a curriculum is to form an HIV Prevention Education School Advisory Co mmittee. This committee could include teachers, school administrat ors, school board members, students, parents, health department representatives, other health prof essionals, and community members. The committee may also assist the district in the implementation of an HIV prevention education plan. One recommended activity w ould be to provide training opportunities for all district staff and school board members. The committ ee could also assist in the 10 planning of a parent's letter and proposed parent's night to be conducted prior to HIV prevention instruction. A parent's letter and proposed par ent's night agenda is included in the Resource Section of HEALTHY KIDS: KEEPING SAFE CURRICULUM GUIDE to assist in planning. Taking a step-by-st ep approach to HIV educ ation, students are provided with a program that is supported not only by the enti re district but by their parents and community at large. 11 INTRODUCTION The importance of a K-3 HIV curriculum is to begin to lay the foundations necessary to enable children to prevent HIV transmission when they are older. A K-3 curriculum has three important responsibilities: (1) to addr ess children with age appropriate materials in ways that meet their level of understanding, their needs, and thei r interests; (2) to teach children knowledge, skills, and attitudes t hat will lay a foundation for practice and reinforcement of lifelong, health-related beh aviors (including prevention of HIV and AIDS); and (3) to allay their fears, conc erning transmission of HIV through casual contact. The education delivered must be both knowledge-based and skill-based. Because the risk behaviors that are involv ed with HIV transmission are sexual, drug- related, or related to needle-sharing, many are concerned that prev ention education will not be appropriate for children in kindergarten through grade 3. However, what can be done in those grades is to help build a solid foundation in life skills that will serve them throughout their lives. The skills necessary for learning and practicing lifelong, health-related behaviors include decision-making, infection control, refusa l skills, coping behaviors, self-responsibility and self-esteem, self-confidence, and tolerance for others. These are the skills we can and need to be teaching young children. By learning these skills at a young age, children can practice them throughout their liv es. Such practice will help students gain confidence and reinforce their abiliti es to make healthful decisions. It is extremely important that children know that HIV is not spread through casual contact. It is not spread in classr ooms, on playgrounds, through hugs, by holding hands, from insect bites, or by sharing f ood. Because children at this age are very tactile oriented, they need to know that t heir normal touching behaviors do not put them at risk. Such information will help alleviate their fears. The like lihood is greater that children will know someone who is HIV+ or who has AIDS t han being infected themselves. They need to be compassionate towards the children who are infected. The curriculum corresponds with Oregon's Benchmarks and Standards for Health Education by providing the knowledge and lif e skills necessary to make responsible, health-related choices and to take appropriate action. The Benchmarks and Standards determine what must be taught in public school s; the schools determine how health education will be taught. Infection control procedures are included as important for young children for basic hygiene practices and basic disease prevention. Decision-making skills are taught by giving children choices appropriate to their ages, the responsibilit y to make their own choices, and the freedom to make their own mistakes and learn from those mistakes. Such skills empower children and give t hem more confidence in themselves. Self-esteem and acceptance are taught by helping children value uniqueness in themselves and in others. Self-esteem is an important component in students' ability to make and act upon healthful and responsible choices. Decision-making skills and a sense of self-esteem are both essential to students' ability to practice refusal skills. 12 Taken together these are t he knowledge, attitudes, and skills young children need in order to build a solid foundation for positiv e action and prevention, both now and in the future. Donna Noonan HIV Health Educator Oregon Department of Human Services, Health Services 13 TO THE TEACHER One of the most important va riables in the success of a HI V prevention program is the teacher. The teacher's background on a topic, comfort level in teaching the subject, and willingness to provide a variety of learning opportunities are factors that contribute to a quality instructional program. It is recommended that teachers at each level familiarize themselves with the entire lesson sequence of this AIDS guide in or der to better understand the focus of the lessons they are presenting and how each less on is part of our overall developmental approach. The lessons have been developed with considerat ion given to where each fits into the already established health curriculum. Each lesson includes placement in the Health Education Benchmarks and Standards, student learner outcome, suggested materials and vocabulary, activities, decision-making, closure, and sample family involvement activities. The teacher should review eac h lesson to determine the length of time needed for each lesson and what vocabulary terms need to be defined for use with the lesson. The teacher information provided is only for the instructor and intended to give background on the lesson. So me teachers will use all of the information while others will use only segments due to t he differences in their stu dents' level of maturity, knowledge-ease, and community expectations. HIV education requires a professional who has the ability to present accurate information and is sensitive to the needs of students and the community. Educators must use a variety of teaching strategies t hat allow for the diversity of student learning styles. To properly prepare teachers to implement HI V prevention education, the district should provide professional development opportuni ties. One of the most important developmental activities is to give t eachers the opportunity to evaluate their own attitudes related to this epidemic. ODE can furnish the technical expertise required to conduct HIV prevention education workshops ( www.hklb.org ). ABOUT STUDENTS Classroom instruction and activities should be based on the evaluation of student needs and readiness. This curriculum also include s scenarios and situational dramas which require students to use risk-reducing behavio rs and responsible decision-making skills. Before presenting HIV prevention educat ion, classroom ground rules must be established. Students need to feel comforta ble about the subject matter. The teacher should clearly define the methods by whic h student questions and group discussion will be handled. Discussion, peer interaction, and questions should be encouraged. The choice not to participate in activities, if an i ndividual does not feel at ease, must also be honored. 14 The goal of this curriculum resource guide is to provide students the opportunity to learn accurate information about HIV infection and to develop skills and attitudes that will lead them to make healthy decisions to prevent HIV disease. This prevention education should be discussed in the context of communi cable diseases. Information about HIV disease and AIDS must be accurate and relative to the ages of the students. Fear and shame are not effective them es to use when teaching st udents about HIV disease. Children relate to living. Therefore, main taining the quality of life through preventive strategies and responsible decisions is the pr eferred method in which to learn about this epidemic. 15 AIDS INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES: WHAT DO CHILDREN WANT TO KNOW ABOUT AIDS? Five Years Many five-year-olds talk constantly and ar e intensely curious. They bring home new words, new concepts, and challenging questions that may startle or baffle parents. Often these have to do with human sexuality. The five-year-old is fairly independent in most of their health and grooming routines, and generally understand and follow simple safety rules. Many concerns related to AIDS are of intere st to the five-year-old : conception, birth, marriage, death, sexuality, and all kinds of human relationships. They fear things like violent death, kidnappers, and criminals. The fear of fatal diseases or AIDS specifically, may arise for some five-year-olds. Germs are attributed as the cause of many diseases, though they do not really understand what germs are, what they look like, and where they hide. The child does understand that colds and flu can be passed by kissing or sharing cups. At this age, questions about AIDS are more likely to arise than before. Children may pursue detailed answers by asking more and more specific questions. Six Years Both five- and six-year-olds are very concer ned about other children. An extension of their egocentrism is \"if it happens to other kids, maybe it will happen to me.\" As cognition develops, the six-year-old is abl e to handle a wider variety of information at more sophisticated levels. The likelihood in creases that the child will hear more information about AIDS as he/she develops more social contacts in school and other settings. A common misconception at this age is that people get AIDS from being bad. Questions about sexuality will continue to be asked at home if the home environment is open for questions. Children are also aware of other resources for sex information like peers at school, older siblings , or older students who ca rry a wealth of sexual information of widely variable accuracy. Te levision and popular music is suggestive without being thorough. There may be signifi cant confusion about sexual issues. Seven and Eight Years The seven- and eight-year-olds are beginning to be more sophisticated in their understanding of the world, and growin g autonomy and independence. They spend more time with peers away from family and exposure to televisi on programs, movies, and videos containing information about sexua lity, violence, and death. Boys and girls begin to divide into separate groups on the playgrounds. 16 Questions are raised and anxieties may be ex pressed when major events or personal experiences bring concerns closer to the child's own life. Stories about children with AIDS who have been mistreated ma y be especially interesting and/or disturbing. If given the opportunity to discuss AIDS with an adult they trust, children may have many questions, usually over a broader range of concer ns than the five- or six-year-old. The seven- and eight-year-olds are often still qui te literal-minded. Sophisticated words can mask a lack of true understanding despi te their increasing maturity. It is the parent's and teacher's role to answer questions, and impart skills to help children cope with this difficult information and keep it in healthy perspective in their lives.

ISBN: 0-941816-52-4. 17 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES K-3 The following objectives and lessons are desi gned specifically for kindergarten through third grade. The focus of these units is on healthy lifestyles, responsible decision- making, and practicing skills to prevent the spread of germs. Students are taught infection control techniques and how to res pond to emergency situations appropriate for the grade level and stage of development. ________________________ __________________ _______________ ____________ These lessons are designed so that by the end of the third grade, students will: Understand that some diseases are communicable and some are not; Understand that the spr ead of communicable disease, including AIDS, can be prevented; Practice behaviors that reduce the spread of communicable disease within the context of daily activity; Understand that AIDS is a communicabl e disease that is hard to catch (you cannot get it just by being near, touching, or playing with someone who has it); Decide about and demonstrate procedures for care of minor cuts and injuries; Illustrate responses for emergency sit uations at home, school, and community; Accept their unique qualities and have a positive regard for themselves and others; Recognize risk behaviors and methods for prevention; Oregon's Health Education Content Standar ds are indicated on each grade level content matrix.

Break lesson into three lessons: 1. Microscope/germs 2. Role plays, coughing/sneezing, hand/head picture (created during lesson) 3. Handwashing, summary Oregon Health Education Standard/ Benchmark: CC, IC, SM, DM. Vocabulary Germs, habits prevent (use pictures to illustrate vocabulary) . Materials Cookie, gum, toothbrush, cup or glass, tissue, glue, paper , marker, Diagrams 1, 2 and 3, paper plate, microscope. Activity Teacher introduces the lesson by explaini ng to students that germs are very tiny living things that cannot be seen without the aide of special tools like a microscope. Have students look at somethi ng under a microscope; explain that a microscope enlarge s, magnifies. Show picture of germs (Diagram 1). Explain that there are all different kinds of germs. They don't look like any animal or plants we can see--not like a bird or a dog or a flower. Show picture of ger ms (Diagram 2). Diagram 2 may be confusing, may want to exclude . Most germs don't hurt people at all, but some germs make people sick. When you have a cold, it is caused by a kind of germ (Diagram 3). Tell students that there are many ways germs are passed. Ask them if they know of ways germs are passed (list them). Share with them that germs are pass ed when we cough or sneeze on or near someone, and/or when we share item s like a cup or a straw we have been drinking from, and that we should practice health habits that prevent the spread of germs. Use pictures of coughing or sneezing or have students point to mouth, nose, and hands. 21 Teacher sets up and role-plays a situat ion where students are asked if someone would like to: * Share a half-eaten cookie; * Drink from a cup after t he teacher takes a drink; * Chew gum that the teacher is chewing; * Use the teachers toothbrush. Explain to students that germs are pass ed when we share these items and they should say \"No, thank you\" w hen someone offers these items. Have volunteers role-play \"No, thank you.\" Have all students role -play in partners. Tell students that germs are also pass ed when we cough or sneeze and that we should remember to always cover our m outh with our hands or facial tissue. Have students act out. Students draw a head outline filling in a fa ce. On a separate piece of paper they trace a picture of their own hand and cut it out. A tissue is placed over the mouth and nose on the face, gluing the hand cut-out to hold the tissue. May need assistance to complete activity (or use paper plate for head). Sometimes we tell you to wash your hands, even when they look clean. That's because you might have germs on your hand t hat you can't see. Germs wash off with soap and water, and this helps you stay healthy. Demonstrate and practice proper handwashing technique (i n the context of their daily routine). Guided practice now , then practice in context. * Use soap and warm running water. * Rub hands vigorously. * Wash all surfaces, including backs of hands and wrists. Rinse well. * Dry hands with paper towel. * Turn off water. Closure Ask students why we don't share another pers on's cup, toothbrush, etc. Answer: germs. Reinforce relationship of germs to sickness. Family Involvement Activity Take the Family Involvement activi ty sheet home and share with family. Explain sheet before sending home; do a sample in class. 22 Additional Activities Grow germs in Petri dishes. Give each child a tissue and practice coughing and sneezing into the tissue.

Infection control measures are usually quite simple, such as washing one's hands before preparing a meal, covering one's mouth when coughing or sneezing, or wearing gloves when touching blood that has come from someone else. Although infection control might seem to be most important when people are known to be sick (such as in hospitals), in reality, infection control mu st be practiced everyday by everyone. This is because communicable diseases are usually most infe ctious either before or just as infected persons develop symptoms, before they know they are ill. Thus, by the time one realizes that someone has a communicable di sease, he or she probably has already been exposed to the infection unless good infection control has been used. Examples of Ways to Control Infections 1. Wash hands before meals. 2. Cover mouth when coughing or sneezing. 3. Wash hands before preparing food. 4. Stay home when sick. 5. Dry feet after taking a shower. 6. Don't drink untreated water. 7. Don't eat uncooked meat. 8. Wash hands after touching animals. 9. Wash hands after going to the bathroom. Handwashing Handwashing is one of the most important ways to practice infection control. Students need to learn about handwashing and have an opport unity to practice all of the steps. To demonstrate proper procedures for handwashi ng, you can verbally instruct students how to wash their hands while they sit at t heir desks. They can pretend they are at a sink doing each action as it is directed, or you may want to take groups of students to the sink and give them the opportunity to wash their hands with soap and water. Whatever method used, the steps to follow include: 1. Use soap and running water. 2. Rub hands vigorously. 3. Wash all surfaces, including backs of hands, wrists, underneath fingernails. 4. Rinse well. 5. Dry hands with paper towel. 6. Turn off the water. These procedures should be incorporated befor e meals, after recess, after using the bathroom, after coughing and sneezing, an d after assisting in first aid. 28 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE KINDERGARTEN LESSON 2 Learner Outcome Students are able to demonstrate proper care of personal injuries involving blood. A minimum of two days for this lesson. Vocabulary First aid, injury, care, bandage, germ, scab, blood, treat, heal (use visual cue--physical example or picture) . Materials First aid material, gauze, bandage, infection control kit. Activity Begin the lesson by telling students t he importance of caring for small cuts, scrapes, and bloody noses. Use pictures. Ask students to recall the last time t hey had a cut or scrape or bloody nose. Encourage students to discuss what they w ould do if they fell on the playground and got a small cut or bloody nose. Ma ke sure students know who at school could help with first aid. Have students role-play, tell own stories. Share with students the things that should be done to treat a scrape, small cut, or bloody nose. Write them on the board or demonstrate. Demonstration in pairs. For cuts and scrapes: * Wash the skin with warm water and soap to remove the dirt. * Dry the skin. * Use ointments or cream s with adult supervision. * Place a bandage on the injured body part. For bloody nose: * Apply direct pressure to bridge of nose. * Use tissue to catch blood spills. Explain to students the need for proper disposal of used bandages and tissues (i.e., not on playgrounds, classroom floor, etc.). Cover this area when demonstrating treatment of cuts and scrapes. Demonstrate and practice disposal of items, make pictures of where things go at school and where at home you would dis pose of items, discuss where/if you have supplies at home. 29 Share and demonstrate why school personnel use gloves and show kit (gloves, etc.) that would be used to treat a cut, scrape, or bloody nose, and explain the importance of using gloves. Demonstrate use of gloves, explain and let students experience sensory effect. Explain that students should never touc h another student's blood. Some germs live in blood; blood is like their home, so do not touch the blood. It may have germs which are dangerous. Use pictures, slides, or videotape. Refer to a book about Louis Pasteur. Explain to students that deeper cuts and bloody noses may need adult attention and it is important to show all injuries to an adult. Use children's' language (\"boo boo,\" \"owie,\" etc.). Change \"adult\" to \"someone older or bigger\" (adult not always available). Explain to students that when skin is open from cuts and scrapes, dirt and germs can get into the body as well as come out. Use large cardboard model of human skin--show both actions. When one gets a small cut, a little skin gets broken. The cut bleeds because small blood vessels are cut at the sa me time. Soon, the blood hardens and dries. This closes the cut so it will not bleed anymore. A scab forms over the skin. When the cut skin is healed, the scab falls off. Can use red nail polish to demonstrate blood drying and hardening like scab. Explain to students the importance of calling an adult to assist in cleaning up blood spills. (An adult can check to see if the injury is serious or needs further attention.) Ask volunteers to act out the following situations: * A child is walking in the park. He /she trips over a branch and cuts his arm. What should he/she do? (Responses should include: Wash the cut carefully with soap and water, place a bandage on it, tell an adult.) * A girl was playing tag at school when she fell and hurt her knee. She saw she had scraped off some skin and had gotten dirt in it. What should she do? (Responses should include: Report inju ry to teacher, wash knee with soap and warm water, dry knee, put a bandage on it.) * A boy runs into another boy while playing on the playground. He gets a bloody nose. What should he do? (Responses should include: Apply di rect pressure by pressing the bleeding nostril toward the middle of the nose. Use tissue to catch blood spills, report injury to teac her or playground supervisor.) * A girl is with a friend who gets cut, what should she do? (Responses should include: report in jury to an adult, avoid contact with friend's blood, wash with soap and water if accidental contact.) Go to actual sites. 30 Decision-Making Students will get assistance from a trusted adult when they are injured or when another student is bleeding. Closure Ask students what things should be done to treat a scrape, cut, or bloody nose? (Chart responses.) Family Involvement Activity \"First Aid Material Treasure Hunt\" Sheet (Do trial run in class before sending sheet home.) Additional Activity Teacher collects completed \"First Aid Materi al Treasure Hunt\" sheets from students. As a class, they chart the items to reinforce mathematics concepts. Have nurse help explain first aid, handli ng of blood, and why she wears gloves. Play a game such as \"Red Rover, \" to demonstrate germs penetrating skin. 31 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY KINDERGARTEN LESSON 2 Name:__________________ ______________________ Dear Parent: Your child has been studying how to take care of mino r cuts and scrapes. Please help us by going on a treasure hunt in your home to look for items on the following list. Either you or your child can circle the items once you find and talk about them. FIRST AID MATERIAL TREASURE HUNT Clean wash cloth First aid spray, ointment Garbage can 32 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE KINDERGARTEN LESSON 2 Places that Should Use Infection Control The message here is that the first aid precautions should be used everywhere. Certainly there are some settings where the risk of infections is lower (elementary school classroom poses less risk than a sexua lly transmitted diseases clinic setting). There is no setting, however, where the risk is zero. The consequences of an exposure are so serious that the precautions are justified even in the lower-risk settings. Precautions for Giving First Aid When giving first aid to someone with a blee ding injury, steps should be taken to avoid direct contact with blood. These precautions apply to giving first aid to anyone, not just persons who are known to have an infection. Younger students should seek help from an adult before giving first aid. People can be exposed to viruses by co ming in contact with infected blood while providing first aid. The risk of infection by this means is very low and can occur only if the blood from the infected person can get thr ough a break in the skin, such as a cut, open sore, or chapped area. Nevertheless, st eps should be taken while providing first aid to avoid direct skin contact with blood. Precautions with first aid cannot be limited to just those who are known to be Infected. It Is important to remember that most persons infected wit h HIV and the Hepatitis B and C virus are not sick and do not know that th ey are infected. Therefore, the same precautions must be used when gi ving first aid to everyone. The precautions include: 1. Persons giving first aid should use a first aid kit that includes a pair of plastic or rubber gloves. 2. Persons giving first aid should put on the gloves before having contact with blood, unless harm would come to the in jured person because of a delay caused by putting on the gloves. 3. After giving first aid, all disposable items contaminated with blood should be placed in a plastic bag, which is tied shut and put in a wastebasket or trash can. Remove soiled gloves without touching the contaminated surface with bare hands. Dispose of the gloves. 4. Any clothes contami nated with blood should be lau ndered or dry-cleaned. 33 5. Any blood spilled on the floor, desks, or other surfaces should be cleaned up with soap and water. Then the surfaces should be disinfected and allowed to air dry. Household bleach may be used (household bleach may damage surfaces being cleaned). (Refer to U.S. Depar tment of Labor, Bloodborne Pathogens, 1910.1030.) 6. All persons providing first aid and cleanup should wash thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible after finishing the task. First Aid Procedures for Bloody Nose 1. Place student in a sitti ng position with head forward. 2. Encourage student to apply pressure by pressing the bleeding nostril toward the middle of the nose. 3. If student is unable to help him/hersel f and needs assistance, caregiver should apply gloves before coming into skin contact with blood. 4. When nosebleed stops, wash gloved hands to remove gross amounts of blood. 5. Encourage student to wash all bl ood off the skin with soap and water. 6. Place any blood-stained fi rst aid supplies in a plasti c bag that can be sealed. 7. Clean up minor blood spills on all surf aces. See first aid precautions #5. For major blood spills, contact school custodian. 8. Remove gloves, turning inside out and place in plastic bag. 9. Wash hands with soap and water. Student Assisting Student If one student assists another st udent who is bleeding and come s into contact with that student's blood, the helping student should i mmediately wash his/her soiled skin with soap and running water. If the helping student has blood from another student on his/her clothing, it is recommended that ever y attempt be made to obtain clean clothing for this student. Students should be encouraged to show care and concern for others, but cautioned against coming into contact with body fluids of an injured person. 34 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE KINDERGARTEN LESSON 3 Learner Outcome Students accept (their) unique qu alities and have positive r egard for self and others. Lesson may take two days. Vocabulary Unique, handicapping condition, allergies. Materials Paper, color crayons, markers for drawing activity. Activity Begin the lesson by having all the \"blue-eyed\" students stand for special recognition. Next, have all the st udents with curly hair stand for special recognition. Continue selecting special gr oups (e.g., ribbons in hair, left-handed, striped shirts, brown/blue eyed), ending with all of the students standing. Use a student as an example to insure students understand concept referred to. Read each of the items on t he following list out loud. Ask students to raise their hands if they like the item read, or keep their hands down if they do not. yogurt skipping broccoli painting hamburger dancing tacos fishing salad cleaning house squash gardening Show pictures or demonstrate. Point out that everybody has special qualities both on the inside and outside of their bodies. Explain that the inside thi ngs that make us unique can be the foods we like and do not like to eat, or games we like and do not like to play. The outside things that make us unique can be the color of our skin, hair, and eyes. Teach students the following poe m adapted from Dorothy Aldis. (Write the poem on the board or on a sheet of butcher paper.) \"Everybody says, I look just like my mother. Everybody says, I talk just like my Aunt Bee. Everybody says, I act just like my brother, But I think I'm just like me!\" 35 Choral recitation would be good, but do not hold responsible for memorizing. Ask each student to name two things, one that can be seen and one that cannot be seen, which are unique about her /himself. Model this by saying, \"I'm special because I have ( color ) eyes and I like ( activity, food, etc. ).\" Participation may be volunt ary or teacher assisted. Continue the lesson telling students that another way of saying we are unique is that we are different. Explain that some people are different in ways we can see and in ways we cannot. Ask student s if they can think of other ways that people are different. Teacher gives examples before student examples. Guide the discussion to include people with handicapping conditions, diabetes, allergies, or illne sses (e.g., cancer, etc.). Include conditions like blind, deaf, in wheelchair, mentally handica pped, or any other disabilities that exist in the building. Tell students if someone is different physi cally or if someone is ill, we should do our best to help, if needed, and be kind to them. Discuss some ways we can treat and help people who are different physically or who are sick. Answers might include: * Send cards * Call on the phone * Play with them * Visit * Help with chores if a person c annot do them for him or herself * Treat them like t hey are special. Role-play some of these. Have students draw a pictur e showing a way to help out someone who is different physically or by illness. Closure Finish the lesson by asking students to shar e their drawing and nam e some things they can do to help others feel special (e.g., recognize their talents, compliment their achievements, like them for who they are). Dictate to teacher, volunteer, or cross-age tutor about their drawing. Family Involvement Activity Have students take their drawings home to share with family members. 36 Additional Activity Actually do a helpful activity: * Send cards to someone ill * Send cards or visit retirement center * Visit children's hospital or section of hospital Refer to guidance curriculum for addi tional activities on appreciating individual differences. 37 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE KINDERGARTEN LESSON 4 Learner Outcome Students discuss appropriate strategies for d ealing with unsafe objec ts (e.g., needles, bandages, matches, nails, glass, blood stained it ems, medications, chemicals) on the playground and in the neighborhood. Vocabulary Syringe/needle, unsafe, safe, razor blade. Materials Syringe (with needle and without) and/or pictures of unsafe objects. Use actual objects whenever possible. Activity Discussion - Ask students, 'What kinds of unsafe things have you seen on the playground and in your neighborhood?\" Fo llow with teacher showing materials above (or pictures of materials) and te lling children the items have germs on them and can be dangerous for children . May need to review what germs are. Also discuss why items are unsafe (in addition to germs). Ask the children if they can think of ways to make sure the unsafe items are taken from the playground or other places without the ch ild touching it. Make sure responses include not touching t he item, report findi ng the item to a responsible adult, not playi ng near the unsafe item, warning playmates to stay away. Students role-play finding unsaf e items and appropriate behaviors: * While playing hide-and-seek in the park you find a hypodermic needle (show picture or use plastic syringe). What should you do? * While swinging on the playground, y ou see some broken glass nearby. What are some safe things to do? * You see a bloody shirt in the gy m at school. What should you do? Closure Post pictures of unsaf e items on bulletin board. Ask students why we take precautions with unus ual objects. (Answer: So they don't get injured or infected with germs.) Family Involvement Activity Send a note home with the student aski ng parent and child to check their home/neighborhood identifying un safe (unusual) objects. 38 ACTIVITY SHEET KINDERGARTEN LESSON 4 39 ACTIVITY SHEET KINDERGARTEN LESSON 4 40 ACTIVITY SHEET KINDERGARTEN LESSON 4 41 FIRST GRADE Lesson 1 Lesson 2 Lesson 3 Lesson 4 Lesson 5 Lesson 6 Lesson 7 42 GRADE LEVEL CONTENT MATRIX FIRST GRADE LEARNER OUTCOME LESSON OHECS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1.

Review the GERM concept. * Explain that germs. are very tiny livi ng things that can cause disease. There are different kinds of germs, like bacte ria and viruses. When you have a sore throat, it's caused by a special kind of bacteria. When you have a cold, it's caused by a special kind of virus. * Explain that people get sick when germs enter the body. Germs can enter our body through body openings like eyes, ear s, nose, mouth, and through cuts, sores or any injury in our skin. Teacher or students uses clean, clear, plasti c, spray/mister bottle to demonstrate to class how germs can be spread. * Teacher asks class, 'When I aim at the board and spray what will happen?\" * Teacher aims the spray nozzle at t he board, then sprays (students can also do spraying and feel effect). * Teacher/student also demonstrates t hat when the spray nozzle is covered with facial tissue the spray does not spread. * Teacher asks the students, \"How might this demonstration be similar to the spreading of some germs?\" Students ar e asked to give examples of how germs can be spread. The teacher reinfo rces the way germs can be spread. Sneezing, coughing, sharing food, sharing eating utensils, etc. Make sure students understand germs come from sneezing not spray bottle. Teacher and students discu ss and demonstrate how to reduce the risk of spreading germs by being responsible (i.e ., covering mouth, using facial tissue, using first aid center, washi ng hands) (see a prior lesson). Kindergarten - Lesson 1. 44 Teacher displays sample shield found in lesson and explains the immune system is like this shield in that the immune syst em is our internal body shield to fight germs. Skip shield analogy. Discuss ways of keeping body healthy such as food, rest, exercise. Also see optional activities. Teacher explains now we will play a game about how our immune system protects us from germs. Cross-reference to health units in nutrition and good health habits. Health Immune System Game Roles : Immune System 6-8 students Germs 4-7 students Healthy Person 1 student Diagram of beginning position Students can use body movement to demonst rate the function of a healthy immune system. Tell students to act out how the immune system works. Split students into groups and have them select their roles. Have the students assigned to play the immune system role form an immune system ci rcle by joining hands. The student playing the healthy person can stand inside the circle to symbolize how a person's immune system protects one from germs. T eacher: Instruct germs to approach the immune system and gently nudge the clasped hands. Instruct the immune system to hold hands firmly because as long as the immune system remains intact (the circle remains unbroken) the immune system is able to protect us from germs. The immune system remains intact and the person maintains his or her health. Teacher displays shield and describes acti vities that are on the shield and asks students how they make a person stronger or healthier if they follow these behaviors. Skip this activity if good health habits have been discussed as noted earlier. After discussing the activities on the sa mple immune system shield, students will illustrate the healthy activities on their own immune system shield using the black line master. Instead of small boxes in shield , have students draw one picture on blank shield or see optional activities. Decision-Making Students decide what items t hey wanton their shields, that will display healthy behaviors to help fight germs, and where to put them. 45 Closure Have student share with a nei ghbor why they put certain items on their shields. Adjust to fit activities your class completed. Family Involvement Activity Family Involvement Activity \"Shi eld\" letter could be attached. Adjust letter wording to fit activities your class completed. Optional Activity Display shields in school. Replay immune system game and have st udents wear immune system shields made. Cut magazine pictures or c hoose from precut pictures of healthy activities and paste on paper or large paper shield. 46 47 48 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY GRADE 1 LESSON 1 Name:_________________________________________________________________ 1. Today at school we studied about our bodies' immune system. 2. Our immune system is like an inter nal body shield to fight germs. 3. We discussed things we can do to keep from getting sick. 4. We developed a shield of healthy things we can do. Please look at my shield and ask me questions about it. 49 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 1 LESSON 2 Learner Outcome Students are able to distinguish the differenc e between diseases that can be spread to one another and those that can not. Vocabulary Disease*, sick*, chart, brainstorm (*Priority words) Materials Make game boards of family involvement activity--need dice, and markers. Overhead transparency of how disease sp reads from one person to another. (Make transparency of \"Family Involvement Activity\" student groups.) Activity Introduce the lesson by explaining to the class that today we are going to talk about diseases that can be spr ead from one person to another. Teacher uses overhead trans parency of student groups. Teacher encourages students to brainsto rm diseases or other ways that people can feel not well. These ideas are lis ted on the overhead transparency under group 1 or use a chart. (One of the rules of brainstormi ng is that any contribution is accepted without judgment during the session. List may include cold, mumps, chicken pox, cancer, broken arm, AIDS.) Review with students previous lesson about the way germs can cause illness. Remind students that sometimes if a per son has a germ he/s he can spread that germ or that illness to someone else. Teacher assist students to decide which of these ways of being \"not well\" can be spread from one person to another. Teacher asks \"Can a person with a cold give it to someone else?\" The students respond \"Yes!\" Teacher draws a line from cold, listed under group one to group two or from one person to another person. Teacher repeats the process for the remaining illnesses listed. Remind students that the spread of germs that cause illness can be prevented if we practice good health habits (i.e., covering mouth when we cough or sneeze, not sharing eating utensils, etc.). Closure Teacher asks students to summarize wh ich diseases can be spread and which diseases cannot be spread. Ask class: Which diseases can be spread from one person to another? Which diseases cann ot be spread? What about AIDS? Don't introduce AIDS issue at this point. 50 Family Involvement Activity Student is encouraged to take activity home to share. Family Involvement Activity \"Staying Well Game.\" Optional Activity Play the Family Involvement Activity in class. Play in class - use CPSS-age tutors or cooperative learning groups.

Vocabulary Germs, disease, virus, bacteria spread, prevention Materials Four-part story (fi nger puppets optional). Story lasts several days. Soap-water-towels (handwashing demonstration) Paper, crayon, mural material Handwashing poster Activity Ask volunteers in class to tell what t hey do each day to keep clean. (Answers might include taking a bath or shower, wa shing hands or hair, and brushing teeth.) Discuss how students think keeping clean help s a person stay healthy (let students suggest answers). * Relate illness to germs Perhaps someone has a cold. Encourage st udents to share their past experiences of illness with the class. * Tell them to describe how they felt. * Did they feel hot? * Did their throat hurt? * Did they have to see a doctor? If so, what did the doctor say was wrong? Read the story of Jasper Germ, Velma Vi rus, and Baxter Bacteria. The read-aloud story is divided into four parts. You may w ant to read it over a period of several days. * The story is designed to help childr en understand: (1) where germs are found; (2) how disease germs can be spread, especially by hands; (3) how to wash hands; (4) how thorough handwashing with soap and warm running water helps rinse disease germs from hands. Use the discussion starters at the end of each part to encourage students to think about messages being promoted in the story. Make a poster or use a poster to show when handwashing should occur: sneezing, coughing, before eating, petting animals, using the bathroom, playing, etc. Teacher leads classroom discussion of health or infection, incl uding different ways germs can spread infect ion from one to another. 54 The teacher and students discuss and practice proper handwashing. * Wash hands thoroughly, cleansing all surf aces in the way illustrated, on the handwashing poster. If poster is not availabl e, teacher demonstrates. * Explain how handwashing with soap and wa ter can help to wash away many germs, including germs that can cause sickness; why washing with water alone is not as effective as washing with soap. * Explain the role handwashing pl ays in helping maintain health. * Develop the habit of washing hands before or after specific situations such as playing, eating and goi ng to the bathroom. Have students practice handwashing. Ask students to relate any ex periences they have had that are similar to those of the fictional children. Do this following story and discussion starters. Follow-Up Activity Ask students to dictate a po ssible different ending to each part of the story. Work in groups to dictate one ending for eac h part, or omit this activity. Make a class mural to which each student adds characters, creating a progressive story. Use a theme such as \"W hen We Should Wash Our Hands.\" Optional. Appoint \"handwashing helpers\" who will take responsibility as Carmen does in the story, for reminding partners to wash hands at crucial times. Make Captain Clean badges for \"handwashing helpers\" to wear in class. Ask each student to name a favorite activi ty at school or home. Which ones involve the possibility of germs getting on hands as a result of the activity? What should they do after the activity to keep germs from causing trouble? Closure Ask students to explain the role handwashing plays in helping to maintain health. Family Involvement Activity Complete a class chart using all students. Have student demonstrate how they learned to wash their hands at school. (Procter & Gamble Handwashing Program) \"My Handwashing Chart,\" Parent Involvement Activity Sheet. Optional Activity Provide a hands-on activity by using a microscope to view germs and other items (water, dirt, fingerprint). Have students draw picture of item before and after viewing through microscope. Students make their own finger puppets or hand puppets.

And then there are trouble-making germs like Jasper Germ, Baxter Bacteria and Velma Virus who try to make people sick. Dir ty and mean-looking, Jasper's germ gang went to New York City to look for a place to live. \"Jasper, are you sure this is a good place?\" Baxter asked, throwing down his knapsack. \"Of course! The city is full of people who don't wash their hands.\" \"Hurray!\" cheered Velma with an evil gleam in her eyes. \"Maybe someone who doesn't wash before meals.\" \"Exactly,\" said Jasper. \"Or someone who do esn't wash after using the bathroom or playing with pets.\" \"I get it!\" said Baxter. \"T housands of people don't wash afte r playing or before fixing a snack or eating.\" \"Right, gang!\" said Jasper. \"And when they don't wash, you know what that means.\" \"It means we have a chance to do our dirty work,\" Velma smiled wickedly. \"We get on people's hands and try to sneak inside them w hen they rub their eyes or nose or put their fingers in their mouths.\" \"Nothing can stop us!\" shouted Baxter, picking up \"Let's go.\" \"Not so fast,\" said Jasper. \"First I must tell you something very important.\" Jasper was serious. \"You must always watch out for Captain Clean.\" \"Captain Clean? Who's he?\" asked Baxter. Jasper \"Jasper , what's wrong?\" asked Velma. \"Captain Clean is a mean, clean hand mach ine. And when he teams up with warm water, watch out!\" Jasper was shaking more than ever. \"You mean soap and water can spo il all our fun?\" asked Baxter. Jasper nodded and shuddered. \"Be carefu l, gang. When people wash their hands, germs like us can get sent down the drain.\" Then Jasper germ tried to sm ile. \"A germ's life is not ea sy. But be brave. Many people forget about Captain Clean.\" 56 \"Then let's go!\" said Baxter. Discussion Starters: The germ gang is not nice because... 1 think these are some places germs might live... I wash my hands when... PART II: Jasper Leads the Way Like Jasper said, it didn't take long to fi nd a new home. May Lin and Chris were playing jump rope outside thei r apartment building. \"What do you think?\" asked Jasper. \"Looks good,\" said Baxter. \"But how do we know that other germs aren't living here? Maybe they don't want company.\" \"Don't be silly,\" chuckled Jasper. \"Thousands of germs can sit on a very small area of skin.\" \"In that case. . .\" Baxter started toward May Lin. \"Can't she see us?\" asked Velma. \"Not at all,\" said Jasper. \"We're so small we 're invisible. She can see dirt but she can't see us. With that, Jasper, Baxter and Velma float ed onto May Lin's hand. \"Comfortable,\" said Baxter. \"When does the party st art?\" asked Velma. \"Patience,\" said Jasper. He smiled wickedly. \"Be patient.\" Soon May Lin said to Chris, \"I'm hungry. Let's have some cookies.\" In the kitchen, Captain Clean was on the aler t. He watched May Lin get milk from the refrigerator and Chris reach for the cookie jar. Then Chris asked, \"Should we wash our hands?\" When Jasper, Baxter and Velm a heard these words, they froze. Would Captain Clean stop their fun before it even started? May Lin looked at her hands. \"N o, they aren't dirty.\" At that the germs laughed so har d they rolled all over May Lin's hand. \"Watch me,\" said Jasper, still laughing. \"I'll show you how it's done.\" But Captain Clean knew what was about-t o happen. When May Lin reached into the cookie jar, Captain Clean sitting on the sink shouted, \"No! Wait! Stop! Think!\" But before 57 he could even blink, May Lin swallowed t he cookie and Jasper quick as a wink. The next day May Lin had a stomachache. Discussion Starters: 1. My hands are dirty when... 2. This is why I think May Lin got sick... 3. After playing, May Lin should have... PART III: Velma Moves In \"Jasper's having fun,\" said Velma. \"Now it's our turn,\" said Ba xter, rubbing his filthy hands together eagerly. \"Let's go.\" So Baxter and Velma st arted on their journey. They trav eled through the city on buses, trains and a ferry. They sat on a woman's coa t, a construction worker's hat, and even a dog's tail. But no place seemed like home. \"Are we doing everything right?\" asked Ve lma. \"I want to make someone sick.\" \"Don't get discouraged,\" cheered Baxter in hi s nasty way. \"Remember, Jasper said to be patient. \"Right,\" said Velma, an ugly gleam in her eyes. \"I've got a good chance. Lots of people don't wash their hands.\" Soon afterward Baxter Bacteria and Velma Vi rus found themselves on the hands of a truck driver and they were speeding out of the city. Baxter was concerned. \"Jasper said t he city was such a good place to live.\" \"Don't worry,\" snapped Velma. \"You're such an impatient germ! We can live anywhere!\" After a long ride the germs reached a suburb of Kansas City, where the driver lived with his wife and son John. When the truck driver got home John was in the garden. \"Hooray!\" shouted Velma, seeing John. \"Virus heaven. I can make this boy sick in a minute.\" \"Wonderfully filthy hands,\" said Baxter. The germs made themselves at home in the dirt on John's hands. Soon John stopped playing and went inside. Before Baxter and Velma knew what was happening, John was standing in front of the bathroom sink. \"No!\" gasped the germs together. \"Not Captain Clean!\" 58 Sure enough, the mean, clean hand machine sat on the sink looking tough the scariest' thing the germs had ever seen. John turned on the water and Baxter shouted, \"Hang on, Velma!\" John ran his hands under the water and rubbed them a little bit. When he shut off the water, Baxter and Velma were soggy, but because they were nestled firmly in the dirt, they were still sitting on John's hands. Captain Clean knew what was happening. W hen John reached for the towel, Captain Clean, sitting on the sink, shouted, \"No! Wa it! Stop! Think!\" But before he could even blink, John grabbed the towel as quick as a wink. \"We've won!\" shouted Baxter. \"He's all mine!\" laughed Velma. Later that week John st arted sniffling. His mother said he had a cold. Discussion Starters: 1. I don't think washing with water alone helped John because... 2. Captain Clean couldn't help John because... 3. This is what I think John could have done to stay well... PART IV: Baxter Looses Out Baxter Bacteria was all alone now and he was just itching to make someone sick. Since he had heard Texas was a great plac e to live, he hopped on a breeze and headed south. Just as he drifted from Oklahoma into Texa s, Baxter spotted a welcome sight. There was a small town and on one side of it, the best place in the world to live - a school! \"Jasper would be so proud,\" said the nasty bacteria. \"Schools are a perfect place to make someone sick.\" With that, Baxter zoomed down to the school and into the first grade class. There were so many children that Baxter couldn't decide who he wanted to live on the most. Then he saw Carmen. \"Comfy,\" said Baxter as he sat on Carm en's hand. \"Looks like I'm in luck. It's lunch time.\" Carmen picked up her lunch box and set it on her desk. \"Goody, goody,\" cheered Baxter wickedly. But before Carmen snapped open her box, som eone called to her. It was the mean, clean hand machine. Captain Clean, sitting on the sink, s houted, \"No! Wait! Stop! Think!\" 59 And before Baxter Bacteria could even blink, Carmen jumped up from her seat as quick as a wink. She even said to her friends, Timothy and Ellie, \"Come on, let's wash our hands. Baxter was frightened. He clung to Carmen's skin. At the sink Carmen turned on the water and splashed it on her hands. Baxter got drenched. He could see Captain Clean sitting on the sink and he shuddered. Maybe he would only get wet. But Carmen had other ideas. She reached for Captain Clean and squirted a powerful stream of soap into the hand. \"No. screamed Baxter. \"No \"Y es! thundered Captain Clean. Carmen rubbed her hands until they were bubbl y. Baxter choked and gasped. When Carmen rinsed off the soap, Baxter s lid off her hands and down the drain. The next day the first graders had a class picnic in a near by park. Carmen and all her classmates who were well and health y had lots of fun playing outside. Discussion Starters: 1. I should wash my hands when... 2. Captain Clean can help me if... 3. This is how I can help my fri ends remember to wash their hands... 60 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY GRADE 1 LESSON 3 HOME HANDWASHING CHART Find a handwashing helper at home. Ask your helper to put a sticker in the correct box each time you wash your hands. Breakfast Before Lunch Before Dinner Always After Bathroom Other Times Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday 61 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 1 LESSON 4 Learner Outcome Students are able to demonstrate self-respons ibility concerning s haring of personal items. Vocabulary Healthy, unhealthy, germs Materials Activity Sheet \"Share Healthy Items Only `Pleas e',\" Family Involvement Activity \"Staying Well Game\" (Actual items needed fo r activity below.) Activity Teacher introduces the lesson by asking the class for examples of things that we do share (i.e., toys, crayons, friends, swings). Teacher holds up actual items. Teacher asks student to give examples of unhealthy things to share (i.e., gum, toothbrush, food). Teacher holds up actual items. Teacher asks question, 'When would it not be okay to share a toy; personal item like comb, hat, jacket?\" Teacher explains activity sheet. Students to color items that ar e healthy to share and cross out items that are unhealthy to share. Decision-Making Students decide which items ar e not healthy to share. Closure Teacher summarizes what shoul d and should not be shared. Holdup items and class responds yes\" or \"no\" or 'thumbs up, thumbs down.\" Family Involvement Activity Students are encouraged to take activity home to share. Family Involvement Activity Staying Well Game can be stapl ed on top of student activity sheet. The Family Activity is designed to reinforce all concepts taught in lessons 1-7. See Grade 1, Lesson 2. Optional Activity Play the Family Involvement Activity in class. 62 ACTIVITY SHEET GRADE 1 LESSON 4 Color the Items below that you would share. Circle the items below that you would share. Cross out the Items you would not share. SHARING TOY APPLE FORK SPOON BALL SWING STRAW GAME TOOTHBRUSH \"STAYING WELL GAME\" 63 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 1 LESSON 5 Learner Outcome Students are able to demonstrate knowledge of injuries and responsibility concerning blood spills. Lesson may take one to two days. Vocabulary First aid kit, story problem Materials Bandages, gauze pads, plastic gloves (latex), plastic bags, or equivalent first aid kit approved by school district, Family Involvement Sheet, First Aid Station Activity Teacher began the lesson by asking student s if they have ever fallen off a skateboard or bicycle. Share story with partner. Ask what happened. Did they injure or scr ape part of their body when they fell? Explain that scrapes from falls ar e common and that scrapes and cuts need special attention. * cleaned with soap and water * covered with a bandage--this keeps germs from entering the body. Refer to previous lessons on germs. Explain to students that all minor scrapes and especially serious cuts and injuries involving blood should be reported to an adult. Adult = older or bigger person. Teacher introduces items in firs t aid kit and demonstrates use. Teacher describes story problem and asks for volunteers to demonstrate appropriate first aid response to each stor y problem (i.e., playground, classroom, restroom, blood spills). * Teacher is encouraged to develop story pr oblem based on actual activity from school. * Teacher explains, even if students are not identified to volunteer, students need to imagine a response to the story problem. Use actual demonstrations. Story Problem \u0083 It is recess time, you are on the play ground having fun with your friends and all of a sudden a ball from another game comes and hits you in the face. You had a loose tooth and now the tooth feel s very loose when you touch it and your hands get bloody. What should you do? 64 You are playing a game of tag. While chasing a friend you fall and scrape your hand. What should you do? It is Saturday, the school is not open, ther e is no first aid kit, and you are hurt on the playground. W hat should you do? Story problems can be assigned and di scussed in small groups. Then small groups share with whole class. Role play some of the story problems. Encourage students to care fo r their own minor bleeding in juries. If they cannot, they should seek an adult for assistance. Critical information! Guided practice by pretending to get injury, actually wash injury and actually put band-aid on. Either story problem can be substituted with your friend. This can change the student response to the question \"What should you do?\" Students should be encouraged to show care and concern for others, but cautioned against coming into contact wit h body fluids of an injured person. Remind students that germs can be pass ed to another pers on through blood. Critical information! Establish first aid station in classroom and introduce students to items contained in the station. Explain importance of using gloves when helping another person. Handout coloring sheet with items in first aid center and have st udents color items. Coloring may be difficult due to fine motor coordination. Decision-Making Students decide what should be done in story problem. Closure What items are needed for a first aid kit? What would you do if your friend were injured while playing on the playground (role play)? Family Involvement Activity Students take home activity sheets \"First Aid Station\" and with parental help, they circle the first aid items they have at home. 65 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 1 LESSON 5 Places That Should Use Infection Control The message here is that the first aid prec autions should be used everywhere. Certainly there are some settings where the risk of infections is lower (elementary school classroom poses less risk than a sexually transmitted diseases clinic setting). There is no setting, however, where the risk is zero . The consequences of an exposure are so serious that the precautions are justif ied even in the lower risk settings. Precautions for Giving First Aid When giving first aid to someone with a blee ding injury, steps should be taken to avoid direct contact with blood. These precautions appl y to giving first aid to anyone, not just persons who are known to have an infection. Younger students should seek help from an adult before giving first aid. People can be exposed to viruses by co ming in contact with infected blood while providing first aid. The risk of infection by this means is very low and can occur only if the blood from the infected person can get thr ough a break in the skin, such as a cut, open sore or chapped area. Nevertheless, st eps should be taken while providing first aid to avoid direct skin contact with blood. Precautions with first aid cannot be limited to just those who are known to be infected. It is important to remember t hat most persons infected with HIV and the hepatitis B virus are not sick and do not know that they are in fected. Therefore, the same precautions must be used when giving first aid to everyone. The precautions include: 1. Persons giving first aid should use a first aid kit that Includes a pair of plastic or rubber gloves. 2. Persons giving first aid should put on the gloves before having contact with blood, unless harm would come to the in jured person because of a delay caused by putting on the gloves. 3. After giving first aid, all disposable items contaminated with blood should be placed in a plastic bag, which is tied shut and put in a wastebasket or trash can. Remove soiled gloves without touching the contaminated surface with bare hands. Dispose of the gloves. 4. Any clothes contami nated with blood should be lau ndered or dry-cleaned. 5. Any blood spilled on the floor, desks or other surfaces should be cleaned up with soap and water. Then the surfaces should be disinfected and allowed to air dry. Household bleach may be used (household bleach may damage surfaces being cleaned). (Refer to U.S. Departm ent of Labor, Bloodborne Pathogens, 66 1910.1030.) 6. All persons providing first aid and cleanup should wash thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible after finishing the task. First Aid Procedures For Bloody Nose 1. Place student in a sitti ng position with head forward. 2. Encourage student to apply pressure by pressing the bleeding nostril toward the middle of the nose. 3. If student is unable to help him/hersel f and needs assistance, caregiver should apply gloves before coming into skin contact with blood. 4. When nose bleed stops, wash gloved hands to remove gross amounts of blood. 5. Encourage student to wash all bl ood off the skin with soap and water. 6. Place any blood-stained fi rst aid supplies in a plastic bag which can be sealed. 7. Clean up minor blood spills on all surf aces. See first aid precautions #5. For major blood spills, contact school custodian. 8. Remove gloves, turning inside out and place in plastic bag. 9. Wash hands with soap and water. Student Assisting Student If one student assists another st udent who is bleeding and come s into contact with that student's blood, the helping student should i mmediately wash his/her soiled skin with soap and running water. If the helping student has blood from another student on his/her clothing, it is recommended that ever y attempt be made to obtain clean clothing for this student. Students should be encouraged to show care and concern for others, but cautioned against coming into contact with body fluids of an injured person. 67 GRADE 1 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY LESSON 5 Dear ___________________________________ : Today we learned about the First Aid Center at school. I colored the things we hav e at school. With your help I need to circle the first aid things we have at home. FIRST AID STATIONS BANDAGE GAUZE PAD LATEX GLOVES OINTMENT WATER CLEAN TOWELS DISINFECTANT SOAP Teacher: Note words will be replaced with pictures in the final copy. 68 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 1 LESSON 6 Learner Outcome Students are able to identify him/herself as a unique and special individual. Vocabulary Unique, special, individual, reflection, self portrait. Materials Box gift wrapped with lid, mirror that fi ts inside box, bulletin board, words Super Me, small composite class pictures. Activity Please note this lesson works best when conducted in two days or the a.m. of one day for Part I and the p.m. fo r Part II or vice versa. The gift wrapped box is placed in the center of a display (i.e., table area, secured to bulletin board, stat ion area in classroom). The box should be placed low enough to permit all students in the class to view its content. The lid should be removable. Teacher demonstrates how box can be looked into carefully. Part I (morning) The teacher encourages all students to look into the box. Part II (afternoon) The teacher labels the box \"Super Me.\" The teacher asks the students what they sa w when they looked into the box. The students are asked to give specifics (i.e., brown hair, freckles, glasses) not their names. Have students write a s entence or two on what makes them special. Have students dictate a sentence or two. Students dictate a sentence about a skill, hobby, or personal character trait. Closure Students decide how they are the same and different from other people. Family Involvement Activity Ask students to share self portraits with family. Optional Activity Library Activity Sheet for more able students. 69 Teacher may select a book or series of boo ks to read to students showing unique and special people. Teacher writes a positive pers onality characteristic of each child on a card and shares with child before attachi ng it to self-portrait.

DRAW A PICTURE ABOUT WHAT YOU LEARNED. 2. 71 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 1 LESSON 7 Learner Outcome Students are able to demonstrate effective use of decision-making skills, in risk-taking situations. Vocabulary Decision, unsafe, dare, safe, peer pressure, show-off Materials List of role-play situations. Activity Begin the lesson by having students name some safe places to play (ideas generated may be playground, parks, school ya rd, back or front yard at home, friends home). Have them name some unsafe places to play (ideas generated may include in the street or road, in or around parked cars or motorcycles or trucks, in old or abandoned houses, around construction, etc.). Use pictures and words to label \"safe\" and `unsafe\" places and arrange on board in front of classroom fo r all students to see. Ask students to explain what a dare is (a challenge): * Ask students to share a time when som eone dared them to do something. * Have them share what they did. Share with a partner. Ask students to share what showing off means: * Can it be unsafe to show-off? (Yes, sometimes it can be unsafe.) Ask students, What can you do when someo ne dares you to do something unsafe? Write the following on the board or chart: * refuse to do it * suggest you do something else * ask an adult for help or advice * stop playing with the person who dares you * Simplify words and terms, such as \"Say no!\" Ask for volunteers to role play or use for classroom discussion the following situations: * A friend wants you to run across a busy street instead of going to the traffic lights to cross. * A friend wants you to throw a rock at the neighbor's dog or cat. * A friend wants you to trip som eone who is walking down the hall. 72 * A friend wants you to write something on the bathroom wall. * A friend wants you to ride y our skate board in the road. Use cooperative learning groups and moni tor involvement of students who may need extra practice. Discuss and/or dramatize alternative so lutions to problems and situations. Ask students and discuss: How do you feel when someone dares you to do something? Debrief how students felt during role plays and discuss steps in decision-making skills. Decision-Making Students will decide on appropriate action to take when their friends encourage them to participate in safe/unsafe behaviors. Closure Review with students what they can do wh en someone tries to get them to do something unsafe. Teacher shows an unsafe ac tivity, children draw the safe activity.

Vocabulary Germs, disease, virus, bacteria, prevention, communicable disease Materials Four-part story; soap-water-tow els (handwashing demonstration), finger puppets, optional Activity Ask volunteers in class to tell what t hey do each day to keep clean. (Answers might include taking a bath or shower, wa shing hands or hair, and brushing teeth.) Discuss how students think keeping clean help s a person stay healthy (let students suggest answers). - Relate illness to germs Perhaps someone has a cold. Encourage st udents to share their past experiences of illness with the class. Tell them to describe how they felt. Did they feel hot? Did their throat hurt? Did they have to see a doctor? If so, what did the doctor say was wrong? If there has been an outbreak of a communicable disease in your school or community, a discussion about this circumstance might serve as a good introduction to the Handwashing Program. Or, ff you have had a health project underway, the handwashing unit can bec ome a natural outgrowth of it. Read the story of Jasper Germ, Velma Vi rus, and Baxter Bacteria. The read-aloud story is divided into four parts. You may w ant to read it over a period of several days. Use the discussion starters at the end of each part to encourage students to think about messages being promoted in the story. Ask students to relate any ex periences they have had that are similar to those of the fictional children. Discuss before doing handwashing. Have students practice proper handwashing techniques. Do handwashing after finishing discussions. 77 Additional Activities Look at Grade 1, Lesson 3. Follow-Up Activity Ask students to dictate a po ssible different ending to each part of the story. Do in cooperative groups or optional. Ask students to draw a picture of what t hey think germs might look like if they weren't invisible. Post these on the bulletin board. Can omit this activity - not relevant for some children. Make a class mural to which each student adds characters, creating a progressive story. Use a theme such as \"W hen We Should Wash Our Hands.\" Optional activity - poster or chart - cut pi ctures out of magazines. Appoint \"handwashing helpers\" who will take responsibility as Carmen does in the story, for reminding partners to wash hands at crucial times. Make Captain Clean badges for \"handwashing helpers\" to wear in class. Ask each student to name a favorite activity at school or home. Which ones involve the possibility of germs getting on hands as a result of the activity? What should they do after the activity to keep germs from causing trouble? Closure Ask students to explain the role handwashing plays in helping to maintain health. Family Involvement Activity Have students demonstrate how they learned to wash thei r hands at school.

And then there are trouble-making germs like Jasper Germ, Baxter Bacteria and Velma Virus who try to make people sick. Dirt y and mean-looking, Jasper's germ gang went to New York City to look for a place to live. \"Jasper, are you sure this is a good place?\" Baxter asked, throwing down his knapsack. \"Of course! The city is full of people who don't wash their hands.\" \"Hurray!\" cheered Velma with an evil gleam in her eyes. \"Maybe someone who doesn't wash before meals.\" \"Exactly,\" said Jasper. \"Or someone who do esn't wash after using the bathroom or playing with pets.\" \"I get it!\" said Baxter. \"T housands of people don't wash afte r playing or before fixing a snack or eating.\" \"Right, gang!\" said Jasper. \"And when they don't wash, you know what that means.\" \"It means we have a chance to do our dirty work,\" Velma smiled wickedly. \"We get on people's hands and try to sneak inside them when they rub their eyes or nose or put their fingers in their mouths.\" \"Nothing can stop us!\" shouted Baxter, picking up \"Let's go.\" \"Not so fast,\" said you somethi ng very important.\" Jasper was serious. \"You must always watch out for Captain Clean.\" \"Captain Clean? Who's he?\" ask ed Baxter. Jasper began to shake. \"Jasper, what's wrong?\" asked Velma. \"Captain Clean is a mean, clean hand mach ine. And when he teams up with warm water, watch out!\" Jasper was shaking more than ever. \"You mean soap and water can spo il all our fun?\" asked Baxter. Jasper nodded and shuddered. \"Be carefu l, gang. When people wash their hands, germs like us can get sent down the drain.\" 79 Then Jasper germ tried to sm ile. \"A germ's life is not ea sy. But be brave. Many people forget about Captain Clean.\" \"Then let's go!\" said Baxter. Discussion Starters: 1. The germ gang is not nice because ... 2. I think these are some pl aces germs might live ... 3. I wash my hands when ... PART II: Jasper Leads the Way Like Jasper said, it didn't take long to fi nd a new home. May Lin and Chris were playing jump rope outside thei r apartment building. \"What do you think?\" asked Jasper. \"Looks good,\" said Baxter. \"But how do we know that other germs aren't living here? Maybe they don't want company.\" \"Don't be silly,\" chuckled Jasper. \"Thousands of germs can sit on a very small area of skin.\" \"In that case...\". Baxter started toward May Lin. \"Can't she see us?\" asked Velma. \"Not at all,\" said Jasper. \"We're so small we 're invisible. She can see dirt but she can't see us.\" With that, Jasper, Baxter and Velma float ed onto May Lin's hand. \"Comfortable,\" said Baxter. \"When does the party st art?\" asked Velma. \"Patience,\" said Jasper. He smiled wickedly. \"Be patient.\" Soon May Lin said to Chris, \"I'm hungry. Let's have some cookies.\" In the kitchen, Captain Clean was on the aler t. He watched May Lin get milk from the refrigerator and Chris reach for the cookie jar. Then Chris asked, \"Should we wash our hands?\" When Jasper, Baxter and Velma heard these words, they fr oze. Would Captain Clean stop their fun before it even started? May Lin looked at her hands. \"No, they aren't dirty.\" At that the germs laughed so har d they rolled all over May Lin's hand. \"Watch me,\" said Jasper, still laughing. \"I'll show you how it's done.\" 80 But Captain Clean knew what was about to happen. When May Lin reached into the cookie jar, Captain Clean sitting on the sink shouted, \"No! Wait! Stop! Think!\" But before he could even blink, May Lin swallowed t he cookie and Jasper quick as a wink. The next day May Lin had a stomachache. Discussion Starters: 1. My hands are dirty when ... 2. This is why I think May Lin got sick ... 3. After playing, May Lin should have ... PART III: Velma Moves In \"Jasper's having \"Now it's our turn,\" said Ba xter, rubbing his filthy hands together eagerly. \"Let's go.\" So Baxter and Velma started on their journey. They traveled through the city on buses, trains and a ferry. They sat on a woman's c oat, a construction worker's hat, and even a dog's tail. But no place seemed like home. \"Are we doing everything right?\" asked Ve lma. \"I want to make someone sick.\" \"Don't get discouraged,\" cheered Baxter in hi s nasty way. \"Remember, Jasper said to be patient.\" \"Right,\" said Velma, an ugly gleam in her eyes. \"I've got a good chance. Lots of people don't wash their hands.\" Soon afterward Baxter Bacteria and Velma Vi rus found themselves on the hands of a truck driver and they were speeding out of the city. Baxter was concerned. \"Jasper said the city was such a good place to live.\" \"Don't worry,\" snapped Velma. \"You're such an impatient germ! We can live anywhere!\" After a long ride the germs reached a suburb of Kansas City, where the driver lived with his wife and son John. When the truck driver got home John was in the garden. \"Hooray!\" shouted Velma, seeing John. \"Virus heaven. I can make this boy sick in a minute.\" \"Wonderfully filthy hands,\" said Baxter. The germs made themselves at home in the dirt on John's hands. Soon John stopped playing and went inside. 81 Before Baxter and Velma knew what was happening, John was standing in front of the bathroom sink. \"No!\" gasped the germs together. \"Not Captain Clean!\" Sure enough, the mean, clean hand machine sat on the sink looking tough - the scariest thing the germs had ever seen. John turned on the water and Baxter shouted, \"Hang on, Velma!\" John ran his hands under the water and rubbed them a little bit. When he shut off the water, Baxter and Velma were soggy, but because they were nestled firmly in the dirt, they were still sitting on John's hands. Captain Clean knew what was happening. W hen John reached for the towel, Captain Clean, sitting on the sink, shouted, \"No! Wa it! Stop! Think!\" But before he could even blink, John grabbed the towel as quick as a wink. \"We've won!\" shouted Baxter. \"He's all mine!\" laughed Velma. Later that week John st arted sniffling. His mother said he had a cold. Discussion Starters: I don't think washing with water alone helped John because ... Captain Clean couldn't help John because ... This is what I think John could have done to stay well ... PART IV: Baxter Looses Out Baxter Bacteria was all alone now and he was just itching to make someone sick. Since he had heard Texas was a great place to live, he hopped on a breeze and headed south. Just as he drifted from Oklahoma into Texa s, Baxter spotted a welcome sight. There was a small town and on one side of it, the best place in the world to live - a school! \"Jasper would be so proud,\" said the nasty bacteria. \"Schools are a perfect place to make someone sick.\" With that, Baxter zoomed down to the school and into the first grade class. There were so many children that Baxter couldn't decide who he wanted to live on the most. Then he saw Carmen. \"Comfy,\" said Baxter as he sat on Carm en's hand. \"Looks like I'm in luck. It's lunch time.\" Carmen picked up her lunch box and set it on her desk. \"Goody, goody,\" cheered Baxter wickedly. 82 But before Carmen snapped open her box, som eone called to her. That was the mean, clean hand machine. Captain Clean, sitting on the sink, s houted, \"No! Wait! Stop! Think!\" And before Baxter Bacteria could even blink, Carmen jumped up from her seat as quick as a wink. She even said to her friends, Timothy and Ellie, \"Come on, let's wash our hands.\" Baxter was frightened. He clung to Carmen's skin. At the sink Carmen turned on the water and splashed it on her hands. Baxter got drenched. He could see Captain Clean sitti ng on the sink and he shuddered. Maybe he would only get wet. But Carmen had other ideas. She reached for Captain Clean and squirted a powerful stream of soap into the hand. \"No!\" screamed Baxter \"No! \"Yes!\" thundered Captain Clean. Carmen rubbed her hands until they were bubbly. Baxter chok ed and gasped. When Carmen rinsed off the soap, Baxter s lid off her hands and down the drain. The next day the first graders had a class picnic in a near by park. Carmen and all her classmates who were well and health y had lots of fun playing outside. Discussion Starters: I should wash my hands when... Captain Clean can help me if... This is how I can help my friends remember to wash their hands... 83 GRADE 2 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY LESSON 1 Name:__________________ _____________________ _________________________ Dear Parents: Your child has been st udying the importance handwashing plays in preventing the spread of germs. Please help your child follo w the practice they learned at school. Behavior Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun I wash my hands before I eat I wash my hands after going to the bathroom I wash my hands after I sneeze or cough I use warm soapy water Other How did you do? How could you do better next week? 84 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 2 LESSON 1 The overall goal of the Liquid Ivory Handwas hing Education Program is to motivate proper handwashing practices among students in wa ys that carry over into the home. In planning classroom activities that will accomplis h this goal, consider the health status of children in your classroom and whether any students have relevant health problems such as colds or flu. This information can be useful in establishing specific behavioral objectives and deciding the or der of covering the various topics. You will probably discover some of this info rmation from discussions in class. School and community health professionals may also hav e insights to share with you. Keep in mind the natural curiosity of children at this age. They want to know the why and how of everything - especially about their own bodies. Ask students what they think caused the illnesses they have described. Do they think the illnesses could have. been avoided? Help them understand t hat most people will be sick sometimes. But there are things people can do that may prevent them from \"catching\" germs that can cause illness. Handwashing is one of those things you will be exploring together in class. \"Germs Are Everywhere\" tells the story of Jasper Germ, Velm a Virus, and Baxter Bacteria, a gang of trouble-making germs in tent on making people sick. Their adversary is Captain Clean, the mean, clean hand mach ine who is feared by the germs because they know he can keep them from accomplishi ng their objective. The story culminates in a first-grade classroom where students gras p the importance of washing hands with soap and warm water to prevent the spread of germs. The story is designed to help children underst and: (1) where germs are found; (2) how disease germs can be spread, especially by hands; (3) how failure to wash hands or cursory washing without soap can leave germs on hands which can enter the body and may cause infection; (4) how thorough handwashing with soap and warm running water helps rinse disease germs from hands. Reading the Story in Class. The read-aloud story is divide d into four parts. You may want to read it over a period of several day s. Use the discussion starters at the end of each part to encourage students to think about the messages being promoted in the story. Ask students to relate any experiences they have had t hat are similar to those of the fictional children. Behavioral Objectives. You will choose particular behavioral objectives to meet the specific needs of your class. The material s in this program were developed to provide flexibility in use and a mult idisciplinary approach so that they can be effectively positioned within your overall curriculu m. The following objectives are believed attainable through the use of aids provided and activities suggested. 85 1. Following the use of the read-aloud story and classr oom exploration of germs, students show they understand that: * They can't see germs except with the aid of a microscope. * Germs can live on both people and various objects in the environment. Some types of germs serve useful purpose s while others can cause disease. Bacteria and viruses are two common types of germs that can sometimes cause diseases such as colds and flu. 2. Through classroom discussion of health and infection, students can explain: * The various ways germs can spread infe ction from one person to another. * How germs are most likely to enter the body; especially the importance of hands as carriers of germs. 3. Through classroom discussion and practice in washing hands, students demonstrate the ability to: * Wash hands thoroughly, cleansing all surfaces. * Explain how handwashing with soap and wa ter can help to wash away many germs, including germs that can cause sickness; why washing with water alone is not as effective as washing with soap. * Explain the role handwashing pl ays in helping maintain health. * Develop the habit of washing hands before or after specific situations such as playing, eating, or going to the bathroom. 4. Through classroom discussion, students give evidence that: * They have shared handwashing informati on at home and are trying to follow the practices learned at school. * They recognize other aspects of pers onal hygiene - related to care of skin, hair, nails, and teeth. 86 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 2 LESSON 2 Learner Outcome Students are able to explain one personal health habit that can protect the health of self and others. Vocabulary Health, habit, protection, organism Materials Facial tissue, paper towels, seve ral sample size soap bars, glue, lots of crayons, copies of faces and hands, scissors, butcher paper Activity Review with the students that germs are liv ing organisms that are too tiny to see without a microscope and when they get insi de our bodies they can make us sick. Have students identify different ways ge rms get inside our bodies. Emphasize the importance of hands and mouths as carriers of germs. List ideas given. Pictures can be used also. Give the example of having a cold. We have those cold germs in us and when we sneeze or cough we are spreading them around. Ask the students what we could do to k eep from spreading germs from a cold (e.g., use facial tissue, don't touch other people's used facial tissue, cover the mouth when coughing, cover the nose and mout h when sneezing, wash hands frequently, don't share food, don't share utensils). List ideas from discussion on board, butcher paper. Review with students the impor tance of washing hands to control the spread of germs. - Use soap and warm running water. * Rub hands vigorously. * Wash all surfaces, including: backs of hands and wrists. - Rinse well. * Dry hands with paper towel. * Turn off water. Ask students to identify other good health ha bits (i.e., eating right; exercising; brushing teeth; keeping ski n, hair and nails clean). List ideas given and/or have pictures available (especially for nonreaders). Make a bulletin board or mura l of good health practices. Each child will contribute something to the mural/bulletin board of good health practices. * Have individual children (or partners) volunteer to illustrate each good health habit and preventative health habit for the mural. 87 Spread out the butcher paper on the floor and let the children draw pictures of people eating right; exercising; washing hands; brus hing teeth; keeping skin, hair, and nails clean; taking baths; covering the mouth and nos e while sneezing or coughing. Copies of hands and faces can be used as part of the mural (i.e., hands covering a mouth while sneezing). Have pictures from magazines ava ilable for students who cannot draw or color well. Teacher or children can draw likeness of a sink and the children can cut out more hands and glue the bars of soap into some and position paper towels in the others. Each child will explain his/her c ontribution to the mural and how it is a good health habit; protecting the heal th of self and others. Closure Each child will explain his/her contribution to the mural a nd how it is a good health habit. Family Involvement Activity Give the children a word search to do. They will be looking for vocabulary related to this lesson. This can be sent home as homework or used as an optional activity for those students who finish so oner than others. Not for certain children because it maybe too difficult and/or frustrating. 88 GRADE 2 ACTIVITY SHEET LESSON 2 Cut out and include in the mural. 89 GRADE 2 ACTIVITY SHEET LESSON 2 Cut out and include in the mural. 90 GRADE 2 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY LESSON 2 Name:__________________ _____________________ ________________________ Dear Parents: Your child has been studying how our personal health habits can affect the health of others.

Vocabulary Virus, AIDS, needle/syringe Materials Activity sheet: \"The AIDS Germ is No t Spread By\", plastic needle/syringe Activity Introduce the lesson by reviewing basic information about germs and how germs are spread. Include handwashing, sneezing, coughing. List diseases spread by sneezing, coughing, dirty hands, etc. (i.e., colds, flu, measles, chicken pox, etc), easily-spread diseases. Tell students that today we are going to learn about a specific virus/germ that causes AIDS. Specifically state that AIDS is hard to spread. It is not caught in the same way as diseases t hat are spread by germs. Teacher asks the question, \"I wonder what kinds of things you have heard about AIDS.\" Respond to questions and concerns raised by students. Questions might include: * How do people get AIDS? * What is a germ? * What are IV intravenous dr ugs? What is sharing needles? * Can my dog get AIDS? * Is it safe to be around (play with) someone with AIDS? Does AIDS hurt? * Do bad people get AIDS? Emphasize that people are not at risk th rough casual contact (shaking hands, kissing, hugging, etc.). Explain that AIDS is not passed like colds or chicken pox. You can't get it from a cup. * You can't get it from a cough. * You can't get it from just touching someone. Reassure students that they are not lik ely to become infected with HIV through most daily or casual contact with other children or adults. The only behaviors that put a child at risk involve either close ph ysical contact with parts of the body of an infected person which would usually be cove red by a swimsuit or using drugs or needles outside of a medical setting. Also can be spread through contact with blood. 93 Make a list of how AIDS is spread; also use pictures. Share that doctors and scientists all over the world are working very hard to find away to stop people from getting AIDS and to help people who have it. Closure Conduct a class review on how AIDS is and is not spread. Demonstrate or role play ways AIDS is not spread; i.e., hugging. Have students complete the \"AIDS Germ is No t Spread By\" activity sheet. Students will circle the pictures of activities that do not spread the AIDS virus. Students can work with partners and discuss their selections. Family Involvement Activity Have students take the student activity s heet home to sign and return or have students take a blank sheet home for parents to do. 94 STUDENT ACTIVITY SHEET GRADE 2 LESSON 3 95 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 2 LESSON 3 HOW HIV IS SPREAD HIV is found in blood, semen, breast milk, an d vaginal/cervical secretions of infected persons. Consequently, contact wit h one of these fluids can result in becoming infected with HIV. The most common wa y that HIV is transmitted is by sexual contact. The second most common way that HIV is transmi tted is by the sharing of injection drug needles that have become contaminated with blood of a drug user who is infected. A third way that HIV can be trans mitted is through the blood of an infected mother to her unborn child or through breast feeding. In the past, some people who received blood transfusions developed AIDS because the person who donated the blood was infected with HIV. Since 1985, all blood donated in this country has been tested for HIV infection. Blood that is found to be infect ed is discarded and is not used. HOW HIV IS NOT SPREAD HIV is spread from one person to another onl y by sexual or blood contact. HIV has not been spread by other types of contact that ar e more casual in nature. Scientists have studied whether persons who have lived in th e same house as someone with AIDS are also at risk for getting AIDS . These persons have shared meals, bathrooms, and have hugged and kissed AIDS patients. In spite of this direct c ontact (often for many years), these household contacts have not become in fected with HIV. If HIV is not spread within households, then it is not spread in ot her settings in which there is less direct contact, such as schools or businesses. There is no evidence that mosquitoes or othe r biting insects can spread HIV infection. There has been no evidence of transmission through tears and saliva. HIV is easily destroyed by heat, disinfectants, and drying. Sitting by a person with AIDS, holding hands, or using a telephone or public restr oom does not put you at risk for AIDS. THE TWO RISK BEHAVIORS THAT TRAN SMIT HIV AND THEI R CONSEQUENCES It is critical for students to understand that th e spread of HIV results from behaviors that individuals control. Individuals may avoid exposure to HIV by avoiding the behaviors that present a risk. Information should be clearly and sensitively presented. High risk behaviors for HIV infection are t hose that involve the exchange of blood or sexual fluids. Drug Use Drug use poses unacceptable RISKS to one's health and quality of life. CONSEQUENCES of drug use include overdosing, in fections of the skin and heart, and criminal activity to support the habit. S haring needles either for drug use or other purposes has an additional RISK. If needles are shared, the CONSEQUENCES can also include hepatitis B/C and HIV infection. 96 Sexual Contact Sexual contact is the main method of transmission for HIV. As the number of partners increases, RISK increases. The CONSEQUENC ES of having sex with multiple partners can include AIDS, other sexually transmi tted diseases, and unwanted pregnancies. Remember that it is not always possible to determine if someone is infected with HIV. WHY PEOPLE ENGAGE IN THESE HIGH RISK BEHAVIORS Ideas for this could include: 1. The person doesn't understand that the behavior is high risk. 2. The person knows that the behavior is high risk, but believes that risk only applies to other people. 3. The person doesn't care about the risk because he/she has little sense of self- worth. 4. The person is taking so many other kinds of risks that this ri sk seems small. For example, the drug user is taking risks of overdose, addiction, and other kinds of infections. The risk of AIDS may seem small in comparison. 5. The person is afraid to refuse invo lvement because others may think he/she is chicken or prudish. 6. The person is more interested in doing what they want to do now rather than in worrying about long-term health consequences. 7. Established behaviors are difficult to change. PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO BLOOD CONTACT Infected blood that carries HIV may be inject ed into an uninfected person by the sharing of needles, razors, tattoo instruments, or anyt hing else that can puncture skin. Making responsible decisions and sayi ng no to drugs is the best way to prevent getting HIV infected by blood exposure. Some injecti on drug users are learning how to clean and sterilize their needles to prevent AIDS, but th is has to be done properly and consistently to be effective. Similarly, razors, tattoo instruments, and ear-piercing instruments should not be shared unless they are sterilized between use. There is no risk in donating blood since all equi pment is already sterile and is used only once. 97 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 2 LESSON 4 Learner Outcome Students are able to demonstrat e appropriate responses to emergency situations involving blood. Vocabulary Emergency, neighborhood, injury , trusted adult, stranger Materials List of role-play situations. Tissue, gauze, first aid kit with gloves Activity Ask students to tell you what they think an emergency is (answe rs will vary). Define emergencies child can take care of by self, need adult for and/or hospital, 911 emergencies. Have students list at least one person they could get help from in each of the following places: at school, at home, in their neighborhood. Dictate to a partner if student can't write on own. Ask the class if anyone can explain what to do if you have a small cut or bloody nose. Explain and demonstrate procedur e for caring for your own small cuts and bloody noses. Have students practice procedures on their own body. Cuts * tell a trusted adult (teacher, nurse, secret ary, principal, counselor, custodian, etc., and/ or older child if adult is not available) * clean the cut with soap and water * dry the cut * put a bandage on it Bloody Nose * apply direct pressure by pressing toward the middle of the nose * use tissue to catch blood spills * dispose of bloody tissue * tell a trusted adult (someone older or bigger) Make sure students know who at school co uld help them with minor injuries like cuts and scrapes and bloody noses. Have students role play some of the fo llowing situations that would require emergency assistance. * Little brother/sister cuts their hand whil e playing outside. - You have a bloody nose. 98 * Your classmate has a bloody nose. * You become very sick in class. * You have a loose tooth. Make sure students understand other people can carry germs in their blood and they should avoid contact. Also include other bodily fl uids like vomit, spit, urine, etc. Explain this is why nurses, teachers, etc. use gloves. Closure Ask students the fo llowing questions: Who should you tell if you get hurt? (Always tell a trusted adult and/or older, larger child.) How can you care for a small cut? (Clean the cut with soap and water and bandage it.) Who can you go to in an emergency? Family Involvement Activity Students share with family what they learned in class today. 99 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 2 LESSON 4 PRECAUTIONS FOR GIVING FIRST AID When giving first aid to someone with a blee ding injury, steps should be taken to avoid direct contact with blood. These precautions apply to giving first aid to anyone, not just persons who are known to have an infection. Younger students should seek help from an adult before giving first aid. The precautions include: 1. Persons giving first aid should use a first aid kit that includes a pair of plastic or rubber gloves. 2. Persons giving first aid should put on the gloves before having contact with blood, unless harm would come to the injured person because of a delay in putting on the gloves. 3. After giving first aid, all disposable items contaminated with blood should be placed in a plastic bag, which is tied shut and put in a wastebasket or trash can. Remove soiled gloves without touching the contaminated surface with bare hands. 4. Any clothes contami nated with blood should be launder ed or dry-cleaned. 5. Any blood spilled on the floor, desks or other surfaces should be cleaned up with soap and water. Then the surfaces should be disinfected and allowed to air dry. Household bleach may be used (household bleach may damage surfaces being cleaned). (Refer to U.S. Depar tment of Labor, Bloodborne Pathogens, 1910.1030.) Bloody Nose 1. Place student in a sitti ng position with head forward. 2. Encourage student to apply pressure by pressing the bleeding nostril toward the middle of the nose. 3. If student is unable to help him/hersel f and needs assistance, caregiver should apply gloves before coming into skin contact with blood. 4. When nose bleed stops, wash gloved hands to remove gross amounts of blood. 5. Clean up student, washing all blood off the skin with soap and water. 6. See #5 under \"General First Aid Assistance\" (above). 7. Clean up minor blood spills on environm ental surfaces. For major blood spills, contact school custodian. 8. Remove gloves, discard. 9. Wash hands with soap and water. Student Assisting Student If one student assists another st udent who is bleeding and come s into contact with that student's blood, the helping student should i mmediately wash his/her soiled skin with soap and running water. If the helping student has blood from another student on his/her clothing, it is recommended that ever y attempt be made to obtain clean clothing for this student. 100 Students should be encouraged to show care and concern for others, but cautioned against coming into contact with body fluids of an injured person. 101 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 2 LESSON 5 Learner Outcome Students develop an awareness of their own uniqueness and t he uniqueness of others, as well as accepting differences. Vocabulary Unique, special, different, characte ristics, qualities, acceptance Materials 4 x 4 squares of white paper bulletin board crayons or markers \"I Am Unique\" Activity Sheet Transparency - I Am Unique Ac tivity Sheet (Optional) Activity The class will create a \"class quilt\" using paper quilt squares that are unique and different. The class will comp lete \"I Am Unique\" activity sheets that point out unique and special characteristics. Introduce the lesson by writing the words \"unique, special and different\" on the board. Distribute squares of white paper to students. Tell students not to write their names on the papers. Direct students to design or color the squares in a special way so that they can recognize them afte r they have been mixed with the others. After students are finished, collect the squares and mix them together. Call six students to find their own squares in the pile. Students who may have difficulty could go last. Ask students: * How did you recognize your square? * What made yours unique, special and different? Mount all squares on a bulletin board to make a unique and special class quilt. Discuss with students that people are uni que, special and different, too. * Ask students: What can be seen about people, even str angers, that make them unique or different (hair, eyes, skin color, size, the way they walk, etc.)? What are some things that cannot be seen about people that make them unique, special and different (their li kes, dislikes, feelings, illnesses, allergies)? Include talents, skills, unique knowledge, etc. 102 * Point out that all areas, both inside and out, contribute to our uniqueness and its okay to be unique. List ideas shared by students on board, paper or overhead. Explain that to appreciate ourselves and others as special, unique and different people, they will be developing an \"I Am Unique\" activity sheet. Model filling in the \"I Am Unique\" activity (using an overhead transparency or the blackboard) by filling in blanks with teachers characteristics. Students may need to work with a partner or be given a shorter number of items to do. Collect activity sheets and read them wit hout revealing student's name. Have students try to identify the individual s just by listening to their unique characteristics. (You may also consider giving students the option of not having their sheet read.) After a few activity sheets have been read, re view: - What are some of the qualities that make us unique, specia l and different? - What would our world be like if we were all the same? Closure Have students state things that make hi m/her unique. Remind students that we all are unique and special. It's okay to be differ ent. We don't need to be like everyone else. Our uniqueness is a special gift that makes our world a more interesting place. Family Involvement Activity Use the \"I Am Unique\" activity sheet as family involvement and have family member(s) fill it out. Students can then ident ify that they can be different from brother s and sisters, etc. and be okay. Look for library books on topic. 103 GRADE 2 ACTIVITY LESSON 5 I AM UNIQUE Name: ________________________ _____________________ me happy: ________________________ _____________________ _________________________ 104 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 2 LESSON 6 Learner Outcome Students are able to demonstrat e the ability to distinguish between risk and no risk behaviors. Vocabulary Risk, no risk, consequences, decision Materials \"Risk, No-Risk Student Worksheet\" Activity Write the word risk on the board and a sk students to tell you the meaning. Include risks to health. List student ideas. Tell students they need to identify risk/ no risk behavior because harm can come to them (danger factors). Divide the class into groups of two and have each group decide whether activities on the worksheet are risky or not risky. Go over answers as a class. Discuss t he consequences of each risky behavior. Review decision making choices on Family Involvement Activity Worksheet. Make a classroom chart of responsib le decision making using st udent (simpler) language, and post it in the room. Have students share one risk and one no-risk situation.

Your child has learned that when someone dares them to do something unsafe, the choices are: (1) refuse to do it; (2) suggest something else; (3) ask an adult for help or advice; or (4) stop playing with the person who dares them . Read each of the situations with your child and discuss with your child the decision made in the practice. RESPONSIBLE DECISION-MAKING 1. An older student dares you to take a puff on a cigarette. a. What decisions do you have to make? b. What decision is healthy? c. What decision is safe? d. What decision follows your parent's guidelines? e. How would you ans wer the older student? 2. A friend dares you to stick your arm out of the school bus window while it is moving. a. What decisions do you have to make? b. What decision is safe? c. What decision follo ws school guidelines? d. What decision do you make? 3. A stranger offers to give you a ride home from school. a. What decisions do you have to make? b. What decision is safe? c. What decision follows your parent's guidelines? d. What decision do you make? 108 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 2 LESSON 6 These two lessons explore the importance of making healthy decisions and preventing risks. These are two key components in the prevention of many diseases including AIDS. Students will learn to identify ri sks and consequences in order to develop strategies for prevention. Responsible decision-making methods are presented as a foundation for the prevention of many risks and consequences students will be confronted with now and in the future. The concepts of risks, consequences and prevention are an important theme to reinforce throughout the entire unit. Responsible Decision-Making Listed below are the five steps of responsib le decision making. Present the information using vocabulary and phrases appropriate to the leve l and understanding of your students. Identify the problem or situation. Identify ways to deal with the problem. Apply criteria for responsible decis ion making to each alternative: * Would the results of my decision be health ful? Would the results of my decision be safe? * Would the results of my decision be legal? * Would the results of my decision show respect for myself and others? * Would the results of my decision follow my parent's or guardian's guidelines? Make a responsible decision and act upon it. Evaluate you're actions. 109 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 2 LESSON 7 Learner Outcome Students are able to demonstrat e effective use of decision-making skills when faced with unsafe situations. Vocabulary Decision, unsafe, dare, choice, judgment Materials List of role-play situations. Paper, marking pens Activity Begin the lesson by having students name some safe places to play (ideas generated may be playground, parks, school ya rd, back or front yard at home, friends home). Use pictures to show safe places. Have them name some unsafe places to play (ideas generated may include in the street or road, in or around parked cars or motorcycles or trucks, in old or abandoned houses, around construction, etc.). Uses pictures to show unsafe places. Ask students to explain what a dare is (a challenge): * Ask students to share a time when so meone dared them to do something. * Have them share what they did. Share with a partner. Ask students to share what showing off means: Can it be unsafe to show-off? (Yes, sometimes it can be unsafe.) Ask students, What can you do when so meone dares you to do something unsafe? Some responses may be: refuse to do it suggest you do something else walk away if necessary ask an adult for help or advice stop playing with the person who dares you Write these responses on the board. Use simpler/student language; i.e., Say \"No!\" Ask for volunteers to role play the following situations: A friend wants you to run across a busy stre et instead of going to the traffic lights to cross. A friend wants you to throw a rock at the neighbor's dog or cat. A friend wants you to trip som eone who is walking down the hall. A friend wants you to write so mething on the bathroom wall. A friend wants you to ride y our skate board in the road. Discuss and/or dramatize alternative so lutions to problems and situations. Use cooperative learning groups-- monitor ki ds who need more/specific practice. 110 Ask students and discuss: How do I feel when someone dares me to do something Debrief how students felt during role play ing. Discuss steps in decision-making skills. Decision-Making Students decide on appropriate action to ta ke when their friends encourage them to participate in unsafe behaviors.

Hepatitis B/C Explain your answer: The virus causing hepatitis B/C is transmitted by blood or blood products and sometimes through other body fluids like saliva (B only). X X X X 118 TEACHER INFORMATION GRADE 3 LESSON 1 DEFINITION OF TERMS TEACHER NOTE: AIDS is not included in th is lesson because the focus is on the dif- ference between communicable and non-comm unicable diseases, and how diseases are spread. It forms the f oundation for the introduction of AIDS as part of the comprehensive health education program. This lesson should enable students to recognize that some diseases are transmitted easily. Lesson 4 addresses AIDS as a disease that is hard to contract since the AIDS virus cannot be spread by casual contact. HEALTHY CARRIER Many diseases have a carrier state in wh ich some infected pers ons are not ill, but remain capable of transmitting their infecti on to others indefinitel y. Examples of diseases with carrier states include typhoid fever (typhoid Mary is a famous carrier), hepatitis B/C, and HIV infection. Carriers are especially lik ely to unknowingly transmit their disease to la rge numbers of people. WAYS DISEASES ARE SPREAD Examples of how diseases spread: Airborne An infected person coughs or sneezes the germ into the air and another person breathes it in. Diseases such as the common cold, measles and tuberculosis are spread this way. Blood-Borne Blood from an infected pers on gets into the bloodstream of another person by blood transfusion or needle sharing. Diseases such as hepatitis B/C and HIV are spread this way. Direct Contact A person with a skin infection spreads it by direct skin contact with another person. Diseases such as impetigo may be spread this way. Also, most colds. Fecal-Oral An infected person's stool carries the germ a nd contaminates food or water that is eaten or drunk by another person. Diseases such as hepatitis A and many viral gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and in testines) are spread this way. Sexual The germ is spread from one person to another by sexual contact. Diseases such a syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis B/C and HIV are spread this way. Vector-Borne A mosquito or other insect bites an infe cted person and carries the germ from the infected person's blood to the next person who is bitten. Diseases such as malaria are spread this way. 119 Bacteria One group of germs that needs food and water to live. Communicable Disease A disease that is transmitted directly or i ndirectly from one person to another. It is caused by bacteria, viruses, and other organisms or their toxic products. Droplet Spray Organisms that are pr ojected in droplets of water when an infected person coughs or sneezes and are received in the eyes, nose, or mouth of a nearby person. Germ Organism that can cause diseases. Infected To have a germ or a virus. Measles An infectious communicable virus disease, c haracterized by small, red spots on the skin and high fever. Non-Communicable Diseases Diseases that cannot be spread from one per son to another. Some examples include heart disease, emphysema, diabetes, and most cancers. The cause of non- communicable diseases may be genetic (cystic fibrosis), environ mental (sunlight and skin cancer), behavioral (seat belts and inju ries), or multi-factorial, such as environmental and behavior (smoking and lung cancer). Strep Throat A sore throat caused by bacteri a, with inflammation and fever. Transmitted Causing it to go to another person, as in passing a disease on to another person. Virus A virus is a submicroscopic particle that has the ability to infect cells, the building blocks of plants and animals. Cells t hat are infected with viruses o ften die. When many cells become infected and die, the organism as a whole becomes sick. Viruses are capable of growth and reproduction only in living cell s and thus are not considered to be truly alive. Viruses are thousands of times sma ller than cells and millions of times smaller than people. Viruses do not cause all infections. Many infections are caused by other germs, including bacteria, fungi or parasites. So me diseases that viruses do cause include measles, mumps, polio, common colds, and AIDS. 120 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 3 LESSON 2 Learner Outcome Students understand how the body's immune syst em works and how immunizations and good health practices help our immune system. Vocabulary Immunization, pox, antibodies Materials The immunization story. Name tags for role play game. Activity Write the word immunization in bold letters on the board. * Have students say the word several times together. * Tell them that they go to a doctor for immunizations. * Ask them if they know how a doctor gives immunizations (to protect them from disease). * Tell the immunization story (see teacher information). Tell students if they have healthy immune systems, they are protected from some diseases. Explain this is because their body has and can make antibodies to fight germs. Tell students they will now playa game to show them how a healthy immune system works. Healthy Immune System Roles: Immune system 6-8 students Germs 2-3 students Antibodies 2-3 students Narrator 1 student 121 Students can use body movement to dem onstrate the function of a healthy immune system. Tell students to act out how the immune system works. Split students into groups and have them select their roles. They can form an immune system circle by joining hands. The narrator can stand inside this circle to symbolize how a person's immune system pr otects one from illness. As germs approach the immune system, persons playi ng antibodies go out, attach to them, and bring them back to the immune syst em. As long as the immune system remains intact (the circle remains unbroken) the immune system is able to kill the germ when it comes in contact with i t. The immune system remains intact and the person maintains his or her health. Ask students to list good health practices that can help our immune system. The list might include: * Wash hands before meals * Brush your teeth * Eat breakfast * Get plenty of sleep * Visit the doctor to have your shot * Use good first aid practices Closure Remind students that we can help our immune system by st opping germs from entering our bodies. We do that by daily practice of good health habits (e.g., proper foods, plenty of rest and washing hands). Family Involvement Activity Students share with parents health practice s that can help our immune system. 122 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 3 LESSON 2 Immunization Defined as a method of controlling communicabl e diseases. It comes in the form of a pill, liquid or injection, and helps t he body protect itself against diseases. The immunization story Immunization is a way to help the body manufac ture antibodies that fight off germs. We are not born with these antibodies. We grow t hem within our bodies. Immunization is the method by which our body is told to make antibodies. A few dead or alive, but greatly weakened, germs are introduced into our bodies as a liquid (polio) or a shot in the arm (measles) . These germs are put in the liquid by the doctor or nurse and we eat t hem. When the shot needle sticks in your arm and the germs are put into your body, your body identifies them as bad germs. The body began to manufacture antibodies to fight and kill th ese invading germs. Only a polio antibody can fight the polio germ. A measles anti body fights measles germs. The process of putting germs into the body and the body making antibodies to fight these germs is called immunizations. Diseases controlled by immunizations 1. Diphtheria 2. Whooping Cough 3. Measles 4. Polio 5. Tetanus 6. Mumps 7. Rubella Diseases not controlled by immunizations: 1. Cold 2. HIV 3. Mononucleosis DEFINITION OF TERMS AND INFO RMATION ABOUT IMMUNIZATIONS Antibodies A chemical produced by the imm une system to fight infection Vaccine A substance produced by scientists that is usually injected to prevent disease. Immune System Protects the body from infection. 123 Immunization A method of producing resistance to an infect ious disease, usually by vaccination or inoculation. ABOUT DIPHTHERIA Diphtheria is caused by bacteria that usually enters the body through the nose and mouth. The symptoms are a slight fever, chills and sore throat. In serious cases ... dead cells and bacteria may choke the windpipe with a \"membrane\" and cause the patient to suffocate. Diphtheria can also cause heart failure, pneumonia and paralysis. About 10 percent of diphtheria cases are fatal. DIPHTHERIA IS PREVENTABLE For infants and young children, an initial series of three injections is followed by booster injections which are generally given at 15-18 months of age, at school entry (4-6 years) and then every ten years. ABOUT TETANUS Tetanus is caused by bacteria that is present just about everywhere, but mostly in soil, dust and horse manure. It is not passed from person to person. The germs enter the body through a wound. As the infection devel ops, muscles in the jaw, neck, stomach, and limbs become locked, spasm and the body is wracked by waves of painful convulsions. Tetanus kills 35-70 percent of its victims, depending on age, sex, immunization status, and other factors. TETANUS IS PREVENTABLE Tetanus vaccine is usually given in combi nation with the diphtheria vaccine. Immunity from the vaccine is not permanent; booster in jections must be given every 10 years. Any time a person gets a puncture wound or other kind of wound which is dirty, a doctor should be consulted about whet her a special booster is needed. ABOUT PERTUSSIS Whooping Cough Pertussis causes severe complications and hi gh mortality in infancy. For these reasons immunization is recommended in early life. The disease is highly contagious and as many as 90 percent of un-immunized close contacts of a pertussis case will become infected. Pertussis is caused by a bacteri a found in the mouth, nose and throat of infected persons and is spread through the air to others. The first signs are similar to those of a common cold, accompanied by an irritating cough. The cough increases in intensity as violent and prolonged spasms occur, with high pitched whooping sounds between each spasm, as the patient fights to inhale air. PERTUSSIS IS PREVENTABLE Initially 3 injections are given, usually combined with diphtheria and tetanus (DTP). Boosters are needed at 15-18 months of age and at school entry (4-6 years). ABOUT POLIO Poliomyelitis, Infantile Paralysis Polio is a particularly dangerous disease bec ause of its potential for causing crippling paralysis and even death. T hanks to the widespread use of oral polio vaccine, the disease does not occur frequently; but it still k ills about 10 percent of paralyzed victims. 124 Symptoms of polio include fever, headache, upset stomach, and stiffness in the neck and back, with or without paralysis. Because the disease is caused by a virus, there is no \"cure\" for polio. Over the past few year s the number of un-immunized children has increased and polio can still strike anywher e when immunizations are neglected. REMEMBER, POLIO IS PREVENTABLE Four properly spaced doses of oral vaccine give permanent immunity. ABOUT MEASLES Rubella, Hard, Red, 7-Day, Old-Fashioned Measles is a highly contagious disease caus ed by a virus and is the most common of the childhood diseases. Symptoms in clude: general tiredness, fever of 1010 or more, watery eyes, cough, and dusky red, splotchy rash that begins on the face, then spreads to the trunk and extremities and lasts at least three days. Measles is often a severe disease which frequently causes secondary complications such as middle ear infections, pneumonia or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Encephalitis, which occurs in about one of every 2,000 measles cases, often causes permanent brain damage and mental reta rdation, and it may be fatal. MEASLES IS PREVENTABLE Immunization with measles vaccine prevents di sease in nearly all who are immunized. The vaccine is given by injection, pr eferably at 15 months of age or older. ABOUT MUMPS Mumps is caused by a virus. The sympt oms generally include fever, headache and inflammation of glands that cause swel ling under the ears (back of the cheeks). Sometimes it is more serious. Secondary complications can include serious ear infection, meningitis or enc ephalitis. Although most patient s recover fully, deafness and other permanent damage does occur on rare occasions. In teenage and adult males, mumps may produce a painful inflammation of the testicles. This occurs in 15-20 percent of cases, but rarely results in sterility. In teenage and adu lt females, mumps may cause inflammation of the ovaries and breasts, but rarely causes lasting complications. MUMPS IS PREVENTABLE Immunization with mumps vaccine prevents dis ease in nearly all who are immunized. The vaccine is given by injection, pr eferably at 15 months of age or older. ABOUT RUBELLA German Measles, Three Day Rubella is caused by a virus. It is a mild disease accompanied by low fever, a slight rash and swelling of the glands in the neck. Rubella lasts about three days. But a woman who catches Rubella early in pregn ancy may have a miscarriage or deliver a baby who is crippled, blind, deaf, m entally retarded or has a heart defect. RUBELLA IS PREVENTABLE Immunization with rubella vacc ine prevents disease in nearly all who are immunized. The vaccine is given by injection, pr eferably at 15 months of age or older. 125 ABOUT HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B Haemophilus influenzae type b (Haem ophilus b) is a bacteria t hat is easily spread from child to child causing severe disease. About 1 in every 200 children in the United States will have a moderate to severe case of Haemophilus before their fifth birthday. Haemophilus b causes over half of all cases of meningitis (infection of the covering of the brain). About five percent of all children who develop this disease will die of it and of those who survive, many will have perm anent brain damage. Haemophilus b can also cause pneumonia and infections of other body systems such as blood, joints, bone, soft tissue, throat, and the covering of the heart. HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE b INFECTIONS ARE PREVENTABLE Immunization is recommended at 18 months of age. Because children in day care centers come into close contact with so many other children, they are at increased risk of developing serious disease. Therefore, your doctor may also want to consider immunization of these child ren 18-60 months of age.

Vocabulary Communicable, non-communicable, disease Materials Vegetable oil, Vaseline, pepper, or cinnamon Activity Review with students communica ble vs. non-communicable disease, reminding them how diseases are spread. Tell students that the purpose of the lesson is to learn more about how they can prevent the spread of disease and infection by practicing good health habits. Write \"communicable\" and \"non-communicabl e\" on the board. Briefly define. Place a small amount of vegetable oil or Va seline into the palm of each student's hand. Have students spread the oil or Vase line across the palms of both hands by rubbing them together. Shake a little ground pepper or salt on their palms to represent \"germs.\" Have students try to wash the oil/Vaseline and ground pepper or salt off their hands with cold water. The cold water does not wash away the oil. Explain that warm water and soap is the best method to use to clean their hands. Then have students practice the proven meth od of washing hands with warm, soapy water (as below). Teach students proper procedure for washin g hands. Steps include: Use soap and warm running water. - Rub hands vigorously. - Wash all surfaces including backs of hands, wrists, underneath fingernails when possible. - Rinse well. - Turn off water. - Dry hands with paper towel. Discuss with students when hands should be washed: - before eating - after using the bathroom - after coughing and sneezing after assisting in first aid - after playing - after handling animals List these on board, overhead or paper. 127 Discuss with students other good heal th habits that can be pr acticed to help prevent the spread of communicabl e disease and infection. - Cover mouth when coughing or sneezing. - Wash hands after covering mouth when coughing or sneezing. - Stay home when sick. - Don't share eating utensils or food. - Proper care of injuries. Explain and demonstrate the proc edure for caring for small cuts. - Tell a trusted adult (or older person if adult not available). - Clean the cut with soap and water. - Dry the cut. - Put a bandage on it. - Use gloves if helping someone else. Have students practice. Students should be encouraged to show care and concern for others but cautioned against coming into contact with body fluids of an injured person. Explain and demonstrate the procedure for proper care of one's own nose bleeds. - Apply pressure to bridge of nose. - Use tissue to catch flowing blood. - Tell trusted adult. - Wash ands with soap and water. Have students practice. Have students react to the followi ng situations by role-playing. - Your friend offers you her half-eaten candy bar. - You are getting a cold and sneezing a lot. - Your friend gets a bloody nose while playing dodge ball. - You have just used the bathroom and are getting ready to eat. - You skin your knee while roller skating and your knee is bleeding. Closure Have students list or share health habits they can practice to help prevent the spread of disease. May want to use cooperative learning groups. Family Involvement Activity Send parents a copy of \"Importa nce of Infection Control\" teacher's information. Ask that they help students monitor handwashing daily. 128 GRADE 3 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY LESSON 3 Name:__________________ _____________________ _________________________ Dear Parents: Your child has been studying the importance of washing hands to control infection. We want to share this in formation on handwashing and infection control with the family. IMPORTANCE OF INFECTION CONTROL Infection control measures are the measur es that one person can take to prevent getting or giving a communicable disease to another person. Infection control measures are usually quite simple, such as wash ing one's hands before preparing a meal, covering one's mouth when coughing or snee zing, or wearing gloves when touching blood that has come from someone else. Al though infection control might seem to be most important when people are known to be si ck (such as in hospitals), in reality, infection control must be practiced ev eryday by everyone. This is because communicable diseases are usually most infect ious either before or just as affected persons develop symptoms and do not know yet that they are ill. Thus, by the time one realizes that someone has a communicable di sease, he or she probably has already been exposed to the infection unless good infection control has been used. EXAMPLES OF WAYS TO CONTROL INFECTIONS 1. Wash hands before meals. 2. Cover mouth when coughing or sneezing. 3. Wash hands before preparing food. 4. Stay home when sick. 5. Dry feet after taking a shower. 6. Don't drink untreated water. 7. Don't eat uncooked meat. 8. Wash hands after going to the bathroom. Handwashing Handwashing is one of the most important ways to practice infection control. Students need to learn about handwashing and have an opportuni ty to practice all of the steps. To demonstrate the proper pr ocedures for handwashing, you can verbally instruct students how to wash their hands while they sit at their desks. They can pretend they are at a sink doing each action as it is dire cted, or you may want to take groups of students to the sink and give them the opport unity to wash their hands with soap and water. Whatever method is used, the steps to follow include: 1. Use soap and warm running water. 2. Rub hands vigorously. 3. Wash all surfaces including: backs of hands; wrists; underneath fingernails. 4. Rinse well. 5. Dry hands with paper towel. 6. Turn off the water. 129 These procedures should be incorporated befor e meals, after using the bathroom, after coughing and sneezing and after assisting in first aid. Students should be encouraged to show care and concern for others but cautioned against coming into contact with body fluids of an injured person. 130 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 3 LESSON 3 IMPORTANCE OF INFECTION CONTROL Infection control measures are the measur es that one person can take to prevent getting or giving a communicable disease to another person.

Students need to learn about handwashing and have an opportuni ty to practice all of the steps. To demonstrate the proper pr ocedures for handwashing, you can verbally instruct students how to wash their hands while they sit at their desks. They can pretend they are at a sink doing each action as it is dire cted, or you may want to take groups of students to the sink and give them the opport unity to wash their hands with soap and water.

Rinse well. 5. Dry hands with paper towel. 6. Turn off the water. These procedures should be incorporated befor e meals, after recess, after using the bathroom, after coughing and sneezing and after assisting in first aid. 131 FIRST AID One way people can be exposed to viruses is by coming in contact with infected blood while providing first aid. The risk of infect ion by this means is very low and can occur only if the blood from the infected person can get through a break in the skin, such as a cut, open sore or chapped area. Nevertheless, steps should be taken while providing first aid to avoid direct skin contact with blood. Precautions with first aid cannot be limited to just those who are known to be infected. It is important to remind student s that most persons infected with HIV and the hepatitis B virus are not sick and do not know that t hey are infected. Therefore, the same precautions must be used when gi ving first aid to everyone. PRECAUTIONS FOR GIVING FIRST AID When giving first aid to someone with a blee ding injury, steps should be taken to avoid direct contact with blood. These precautions appl y to giving first aid to anyone, not just persons who are known to have an infection. Younger students should seek help from an adult before giving first aid. The precautions include: 1. Persons giving first aid should use a first aid kit that includes a pair of plastic or rubber gloves. 2. Persons giving first aid should put on the gloves before having contact with blood, unless harm would come to the injured person because of a delay in putting on the gloves. 3. After giving first aid, all disposab le items contaminated with blood should be placed in-a plastic bag, which is tied shut and put in a wastebasket or trash can. Remove soiled gloves without touching the contaminated surface with bare hands. 4. Any clothes contami nated with blood should be lau ndered or dry-cleaned. 5. Any blood spilled on the floor, desks or other surfaces should be cleaned up with soap and water. Then the surfaces should be disinfected and allowed to air dry. Household bleach may be used. 6. All persons providing first aid and cl eanup should wash thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible after finishing the task. PLACES THAT SHOULD USE INFECTION CONTROL The message here is that the first aid prec autions should be used everywhere. Certainly there are some settings where the risk is lower (elementary school classroom poses less risk than a sexually transmitted diseases clinic setting). There is no setting, however, where the risk is zero. The conseq uences of an exposure are so serious that the precautions are justified ev en in the lower risk settings. Examples of specific places that should use infection control include: 1. Hospitals 2. Worksites, homes 3. Schools, especially in athletics w here bleeding injuries may occur. 4. Parks, shopping malls and other public places. 132 Bloody Nose 1. Place student in a sitti ng position with head forward. 2. Encourage student to apply pressure by pressing the bleeding nostril toward the middle of the nose. 3. If student is unable to help him/hersel f and needs assistance, caregiver should apply gloves before coming into skin contact with blood. 4. When nose bleed stops, wash gloved hands to remove gross amounts of blood. 5. Clean up student, washing all blood off the skin with soap and water. 6. See #5 under \"Precautions for Giving First Aid\" on previous page. 5. Clean up minor blood spills on environm ental surfaces. For major blood spills, contact school custodian. 6. Remove gloves. 7. Wash hands with soap and water. 133 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 3 LESSON 4 Learner Outcome Students understand that AIDS is a communicable disease that is hard to catch -you cannot catch it just by being near, touchi ng or playing with someone who has it. Students understand that AIDS is a preventable disease. Vocabulary AIDS, HIV, casual contact, immune system , virus, contracted, defense, hygiene Materials Student Activity Sheet, \"AIDS - True or False\" Activity Tell students that the purpose of today's lesson is to learn more about a specific communicable disease known as AIDS. Review and/or introduce the function of the immune system emphasizing how antibodies provide infection control against viruses and germs. Review communicable diseases and introduce AIDS to the listing. - colds - sore throat - flu - chicken pox - measles - AIDS Lead a discussion on \"What is AIDS?\" - How many students have heard about AIDS? - What have you heard? - AIDS is a disease many of us, including adults, are afraid of. - There is a reason to be concerned about AIDS, because it is a communicable disease that ff you get it, you get very sick and may die. - None of us wants to get a disease that c an make us very sick, so it is important to know about this disease. - It is really important to know what we need to be afraid of and what we do not need to be afraid of. Discuss \"What do we need to know about AIDS?\" - AIDS is a very serious communicable disease. - People who have AIDS are very sick. - A germ (virus) causes AIDS. - This germ needs to get into our blood. How germs get into the bloodstream. - The GOOD NEWS is this germ is hard to get. 134 Use visual aid (poster) of body to show how germs get into bloodstream. Body should show circulatory system. Demons trate the path a germ travels to get into the bloodstream. Emphasize how AIDS is not acquired by: - Hugging, kissing (closed mouth kissing); - Classroom contact; - Coughing, sneezing; - From toilet seats, clothes, dishes; - By sharing food, pencils, etc. Explain, very simply, that the AIDS germ is ONLY spread: - When someone with the germ shar es blood with someone else. Clarify by examples: being 'blood brothers,\" touchi ng or cleaning cuts or nose bleeds. - When someone who has the germ has se x or contact with private parts (point to body parts on a figure cover ed by a swimming suit). - When a mother with the germ has a baby. Clarify this is when mother gives birth. Using the list generated from the review of communicable disease. Classify the list as those diseases that are easy to get and those that are hard to get. Easy to Get Hard to Get Colds AIDS Sore throat Flu Chicken pox Measles Emphasize and discuss: - IT IS OKAY TO BE AROUND PEOP LE WHO HAVE AIDS AND NOT BE AFRAID OF THEM. Student Activity Sheet 1: Provide each st udent with a copy \"AIDS -True or False.\" Read each statement al oud and have students mark \"T' or \"F\" in the space provided. Be sure to cover possible unfamiliar vocabulary words wh ile reading the statements aloud (i.e., contracted, defense, hygiene, ba d drugs [illegal], drugs or abused over- the-counter drugs).

It means: A = Acquired (passes on by a carrier) I = Immune (the body's defense system) D = Deficiency (not working properly) S = Syndrome (a group of signs and symptoms) What is AIDS? AIDS is a very serious disease. People who have AIDS are very sick. Their systems, which normally protect them from disease, are broken and cannot fight against many illnesses. A person with AIDS has to be very careful to avoid many common illnesses which do not make a healthy person very si ck. People who have AIDS get it because the germ that causes AIDS has gotten into their bloodstreams and has made them sick. YOU CANNOT CATCH AIDS BY: - Going to school with a child who has AIDS. - Going to school where an infected person works. - Playing with an infected child. - Shaking hands. - Hugging. - Eating in a public place. - Using a public telephone. - Using public toilet facilities. HOW HIV IS SPREAD HIV is found in blood, semen, breast milk, an d vaginal/cervical secretions of infected persons. Consequently, contact with one of these fluids can re sult in becoming infected with HIV. The most common wa y that HIV is transmitted is by sexual contact. The second most common way that HIV is transmi tted is by the sharing of injection drug needles that have become contami nated with the blood of a dr ug user who is infected. A third way that HIV can be transmitted is th rough the blood of an infected mother to her unborn child or breast feeding. In t he past, some people who received blood transfusions developed AIDS because the person who donated the blood was infected with HIV. Since 19 85, all blood donated in this country has been tested for HIV infection. Blood that is found to be infected is discarded and is not used. HOW HIV IS NOT SPREAD HIV is spread from one person to another only by sexual or blood contact. HIV has not been spread by other types of contact that ar e more casual in nature. Scientists have studied whether persons who have lived in th e same house as someone with AIDS are also at risk for getting AIDS. These per sons have shared meal s, bathrooms and have hugged and kissed AIDS patients. In spite of this direct c ontact (often for many years), 141 these people have not become infected wit h HIV. If HIV is not spread within households, then it is not spread in other sett ings in which there is less direct contact, such as schools or businesses. There is no evidence that mosquitoes or othe r biting insects can spread HIV Infection. There has been no evidence of transmission through tears and saliva. HIV Is easily destroyed by heat, disinfectants and drying. Sitting by a person with AIDS, holding hands or using a telephone or public restr oom does not put you at risk for AIDS. THE TWO RISK BEHAVIORS THAT TRAN SMIT HIV AND THEI R CONSEQUENCES It is critical for students to understand that th e spread of HIV results from behaviors that individuals control. Individuals may avoid ex posure to HIV by avoiding the behavior that present a risk. Informati on should be clearly and sensitively presented. High risk behaviors for HIV infection are t hose that involve the exchange of blood or sexual fluids. Drug Use Drug use poses unacceptable RISKS to one's health and quality of life. CONSEQUENCES of drug use in clude overdosing, infections of the skin and heart, and criminal activity to support the habit. S haring needles either for drug use or other purposes has an additional RISK. If needles are shared, the CONSEQUENCES can also include hepatitis B/C and HIV infection. Sexual Contact Sexual contact is the main method of transmission for HIV. As the number of partners increases, RISK increases. The CONSEQUENC ES of having sex with multiple partners can include AIDS, other sexually transmi tted diseases, and unwanted pregnancies. Remember that it is not always possible to determine if someone is infected with HIV. WHY PEOPLE ENGAGE IN THESE HIGH-RISK BEHAVIORS Ideas for this could include: 1. The person doesn't understand that the behavior is high risk. 2. The person knows that the behavior is high risk, but believes that risk only applies to other people. 3. The person doesn't care about the risk bec ause he or she has little sense of self worth. 4. The person is taking so many other kinds of risks that this risk seems small. For example, the drug user is taking risks of overdose, addiction and other kinds of infections. The risk of AIDS ma y seem small in comparison. 5. The person is afraid to refuse involv ement because others may think he or she is chicken or prudish. 6. The person is more interested in doing w hat they want to do now rather than in worrying about long-term health consequences. 142 7. Established behaviors are difficult to change. PREVENTIVE MEASURES-BLOOD CONTACT Infected blood that carries HIV may be inject ed into an uninfected person by the sharing of needles, razors, tattoo instruments, or anyt hing else that can puncture the skin. Using responsible decisions and sayi ng no to drugs is the best way to prevent getting HIV infected by blood exposure. Some IV drug users are learning how to clean and sterilize their needles to prevent AIDS, but this has to be done properly and consistently to be effective. Similarly, razors, tattoo instru ments and ear-piercing instruments should not be shared unless they are sterilized between use. There is no risk in donating blood since all equi pment is already sterile and is used only once. 143 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 3 LESSON 5 Learner Outcome Students identify feelings asso ciated with illness and disabi lity and learn about positive attitudes toward people with illnesses and disabilities. Vocabulary Illness, disability, isolated, te rminal, handicapped, cancer, empathy Materials Pictures of hospital, ill peopl e, cards, mask, gloves, et c., to share with students. Activity Teacher will lead the class in a discussion on the topic \"What it is like to be ill.\" Or teacher may use brainstorming as a techni que to gather information from students. Students will be asked to respond to following questions. - When was the last time you were ill? - Were you isolated? - What is it like being isolated? - How did you feel knowing you were going to get better? How did people treat you? - How did you wish you were treated? - What changes occurred in your family when you were ill? - What do you think it would feel like to have a disease that does not go away? Write responses on boar d, paper, or overhead. Have students discuss questions with a par tner then cover questions as a whole class (to keep students involved in lesson). Choose five students to volunteer or divide class into cooperative groups. Ask the following questions. Teacher may want to model a question and answer first. - If one of your friends had a cold, would you play with him/her? - If one of your classmates had cancer would you still be his/her friend? - Would you visit a neighbor who was confined to a wheelchair? - Would you attend a birthday party of a friend who has a scar on his/her face. - Would you help a new blind student find the cafeteria at school? W hy? Students should be encouraged to express their feelings and emotions in a nonjudgmental manner. 144 Ask students to think of all the ways these five people are just like us. - They have feelings. - They have goals. - They can have fun. - They can attend school. Closure Ask students to respond in writing to the following: (Teacher select or student select) If I had or were: cancer, blind, a severely burned face, in a wheelchair, the way I would want to be treated is ... Write in pairs or by dictation if necessa ry. If student writes , grade on content, not spelling, structure, or length. Some st udents' writing skills are limited, but they could illustrate a sentence or idea. Family Involvement Activity Family Involvement Activity Sheet \"I Care Too.\" Optional Activities Have students write a letter or a card to so meone who is ill. If students are exposed to this activity early in the year they can send a card to classmates when they become ill. Have students take a field trip to a nursi ng home. They can prov ide entertainment or just interact. Provide some service project for someone w ho is ill or handicapped; i.e., stack wood, mow the law, carry groceries, etc. Include as one of your group of (5) questions a student with AIDS. This of course would provide a springboard for prov iding more information about AIDS. Have a guest with a handicapping condition visit your class. Have a special student in your school visit your class. Have students play with or hav e lunch with a special student. Do simulation activities for disabling conditions. Have \"Kids on the Block\" puppet group come to your school. 145 GRADE 3 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY LESSON 5 Dear Parents: Your child has been learning the importance of having a positive regard for people with illness or disabilities. Help y our child show they care by discussing this issue with them. Identify so meone you know who is ill and help your child send a get well card, call, and/or arrange a short visit. \"I Care Too\" 146 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADE 3 LESSON 6 Learner Outcome Students develop an awareness of their own uniqueness and the uniqueness of others. Vocabulary Unique, characteristics, similarities , self-esteem, differences, appreciation Materials Paper, markers, magazines, scissors, tape/glue, Appreciation Awards Activity Lead the class in a discussion to identify t hose characteristics that make them unique: Use students as real life examples. - physical characteristics - behavior - talents - feeling responses to situations Write responses on boar d, paper, or overhead. Have students talk about how they share so me of these characteristics with others. Have students share with a part ner as well as whole class. Have students write about them selves describing characte ristics that make them unique and special. Draw a picture or find one in a magazine of themselves doing their favorite activity. Allow students to illustrate, dictate, do with partner, or write as a list. Have the class create a bulletin board of the descriptions and pictures about themselves of the characteristics that make them unique and special. Have students discuss the similarities and diffe rences illustrated on the bulletin board. Discuss in groups, then have groups report to class (as below). Have students discuss what it feels like to be different. Have students respond to the following situations. - You are the tallest student in class. - You are the best reader in class. - You can't jump rope as well as your classmates. - You are a shy or quiet person. - You have a hard time with r eading, math or spelling. - You are the fastest runner in your class. - Have students discuss and respond to role play situations. Have the students find a partner to give \"Appreciation Awards.\" 147 Closure Have student share \"I learned\" statements. Family Involvement Activity Have students complete with family the \"T o Be Very Special\" Family Involvement Activity Sheet. Optional Activity Have students demonstrate acceptance of peers by creating appreciation awards for each other (see sample enclosed). 148 GRADE 3 FAMILY INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY LESSON 6 Name:__________________ _____________________ _________________________ Dear Parents: Your child has been studying si milarities and differences in people.

Vocabulary Consequence, healthy, behavior, peer pressure, hypodermic needle Materials Butcher paper, marking pens, board, \"Risks of Unsafe Living\" activity sheet. Papers to put questions on. Activity Introduce the activity by having students lis t (brainstorm) habits that are unsafe. Explain that today's lesson will focus on consequences of unsafe behaviors and steps we can take to prevent such behaviors. Also list safe activities. On a large sheet of butcher paper using co lored marking pens, make a chart similar to the example shown for this activi ty. Have students respond to each \"unsafe practice\" by telling the consequences of th at activity and steps one should take to avoid the unsafe practice. List consequences of safe activities also. Introduce the concept \"peer pressure\" and have students share what they think it means. Explain that its when friends try to get you to do something. Continue by involving students in the following activity. Explain that peer pressure may encourage safe or unsafe behavior. Place questions 1-8 on pieces of paper and insert them in a hat or box. Have selected students draw questi ons from the hat or box. Those students who draw questions may ans wer the question or ask another student what they would do. Instead of individual students answering que stions, lead the entire class in a discussion. The eight questions are: - What would you do if a friend wants you to ride your bicycle while you are blindfolded? - What would you do if a friend ask ed you to eat a tablespoon of salt? - What would you do if a fr iend wants you to stop eating candy that has lots of sugar in - it? - What would you do if a friend wants you to join a boy/girl scout group? - What would you do if a friend wants you to join in teasing a classmate? - What would you do if a fr iend wants you to try drugs? 151 - What would you do if a friend dares you to pick up a hypodermic needle. - What would you do if a friend has a bloody nose? Instead of individual or class discussion, divide into eight groups. Each group discusses one question then whole class reviews. Using the same situations suggested in t he questions above, ask students if they could be more easily pressured into these situations if: - Your friend threatened you with an unpleas ant consequence (for example: \"I'll kick your bike over if you do not do it!'). - Your friend called you names (suc h as \"chicken,\" \"baby,\" etc.). - Your friend explains some consequences to you (for example: \"Sugar is not good for teeth, is not healthy, etc.\"). - More than one friend made t he demand (for example; two friends or three, four, six, etc.). Ask students, what can be done when someone tr ies to pressure them into doing something. Write the following on the chart or board and discuss. - Refuse to do it. - Stop playing with the person pressuring you. - Suggest you do something else. - Seek a trusted adult for help or advise. Role play the four situations above and other situations including safe and unsafe activities, using decision making skills. Decision-Making Students consider consequences of practi cing unsafe behaviors. Students decide how to respond when pressured by peers. Closure Have students give an example of peer pr essure and the conseque nce of that unsafe behavior.

These are two key components in the prevention of many diseases including AIDS. Students will learn to identify risks and consequences in order to develop strategies for prevention. Responsible decision-making methods are presented as a foundation for the prevention of many risks and consequences students will be confronted with now and in the future . The concepts of risks, consequences and prevention are an important theme to reinforce throughout the entire unit. RESPONSIBLE DECISION-MAKING Listed below are the five steps of re sponsible decision-making. Present the information using vocabulary and phras es appropriate to the level and understanding of your students. 1. Identify the probl em or situation. 2. Identify ways to deal with the problem. 3. Apply criteria for responsible dec ision making to each alternative: - Would the results of my decision be healthful? - Would the results of my decision be safe? - Would the results of my decision be legal? - Would the results of my decision show respect for myself and others? - Would the results of my decision follo w my parents' or guardian's guidelines? 4.

NON-CO MMUNICABLE DISEASES Communicable diseases are diseases that one person can give to another. Some examples include measles, the common co ld, tuberculosis, and HIV. Communicable diseases are caused by infectious micro-or ganisms (germs) including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. Not all infections ar e communicable (for example, appendicitis). Non-communicable diseases are diseases that cannot be spread from one person to another. Some examples include heart di sease, emphysema, diabetes, and most cancers. The cause of non-communicable di seases may be genetic (cystic fibrosis), environmental (sunlight and skin cancer), be havioral (seat belts and injuries), or multi-factorial, such as environmental and behavioral (smoking and lung cancer). VIRUS A virus is a sub-microscopic particle that has the ability to infect cells, the building blocks of plants and animals. Cells that are infected with viruses often die. When many cells become infected and die, the organism as a whole becomes sick. Viruses are capable of growth and reproducti on only in living cells and thus are not considered to be truly alive. Viruses are thousands of time s smaller than cells and millions of times smaller than people. Viruses do not cause all infections. Many infections are caused by other germs, including bacteria, fungi or parasites. Some diseases that viruses do cause include measles, mumps, polio, common colds, and HIV. EPIDEMIC An epidemic occurs when the number of pe ople with a specific disease increases suddenly in a community. An epidemic may o ccur when there is a new disease to which people are not immune (example - AIDS), or when conditions change in such a way as to make people more susceptible to an existing disease (example - the influenza epidemic that occurs each winter). Epi demics may be small and involve only a few people, or may be large and affect much of the world's population. the past, large epidemics have usually been caused by comm unicable diseases, and have included tuberculosis, bubonic plague, and smallpox . Recent epidemics of communicable diseases in Oregon include hepatit is A, HIV, and Chlamydia. Epidemics may also be caused by non-communi cable diseases. In this century, as infectious diseases have become better c ontrolled, other certain non-communicable diseases, have become epidemic. For example, lung disease and cancer have become epidemic as a result of an increase in the number of people smoking cigarettes. 170 HEALTHY CARRIER Many diseases have a carrier state in whic h some infected persons never become ill but remain capable of transmitting their infecti on to others indefinitely. Examples of diseases with carrier states include typhoid fever (typhoid Mary is a famous carrier), hepatitis B, and HIV. Carriers are especially likely to unknowingly transmit their disease to large numbers of people. WAYS DISEASES ARE SPREAD Examples of how dise ases spread include: 1. AIRBORNE - An infected person coughs or sneezes the germ into the air and another person breathes it in. Diseases su ch as the common cold, measles, and tuberculosis are spread this way. 2. FECAL-ORAL - An infected person's stool carri es the germ and contaminates food or water that is eaten or drun k by another person. Diseases such as hepatitis A and viral gastroenteritis (infla mmation of the stomach and intestines) are spread this way. 3. DIRECT CONTACT - A person with a skin infection spreads it by direct skin contact with another person. Diseases such as impetigo may be spread this way. 4. VECTOR-BORNE - A mosquito or other insect bites an infected person and carries the germ from the infected per son's blood to the next person who is bitten. Diseases such as malaria are spread this way. 5. SEXUAL - The germ is spread from one person to another by sexual contact. Diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, hepat itis B and HIV are spread this way. 6. BLOOD-BORNE - Blood from an infected person gets into the blood stream of another person by blood transfusion or needle sharing. Diseases such as hepatitis B and HIV are spread this way. 171 VOCABULARY WORKSHEET GRADES 4-5 LESSON 2 Name:__________________ ___________________________ ________________ Directions: Complete the sentences below: 1.

Materials Transparency on Infection Control Guidelines Vocabulary Infection, disinfectant, injury Procedures 1. Involve the students in a review of communicable versus non-communicable diseases and how diseases spread. A part ner or group review is suggested. Do a vocabulary review with words and defi nitions posted or use Vocabulary Notebooks. 2. Tell the students that the purpose of today's lesson is to learn more about how they can prevent the spread of diseases or infections as well as protect themselves. This process is called infecti on control. Write infection control on the board. 3. Involve students in a brainstorming sessi on on ways to control infections. List their ideas on the board and add other i deas to the list from the Teacher Information. 4. Emphasize the importance of handwashi ng in general infection control by involving the students in a handwashing practice session as described in the Teacher Information. 5. After the demonstration, tell students that giving first aid is another part of infection control. Call on 2-3 students to describe or demonstrate what they would do if one of their friends was cut and bleeding in class. Use the transparency to focus on key components of infection control and first aid providing students the opportunity to add t heir own ideas. Review importance of caring for own cuts/nose bleeds when possible. Run off transparency as a handout that they can put into their Vocabulary Notebook. 6. With a partner or individually, have st udents list 3 places that infection control information should be used and posted. Discuss as a class the different responses. List class ideas on board or overhead. 174 7. Assign students individually, in pairs or small groups, the task of developing a visual on infection control. It can be in the form of a poster, pamphlet, media campaign or any other creative idea appr opriate for the intended setting. Post visual aids at appropriate places around the school. Playground, Bathrooms, Classrooms - sinks, by first aid kits , Cafeteria, Heal th Room, Office. 8. Allow time for students to write de finitions into Vocabulary Notebook. 9. Allow time for students to write assi gnments into Vocabulary Notebook. Evaluation Evaluate accuracy of procedur es listed in the visual and appropriateness of setting selected. Optional Activity Review/expand basic first aid information. Resources School Nurses May want to reference regular health curriculum Local/county Nurses 175 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 LESSON 3 IMPORTANCE OF INFECTION CONTROL Infection control measures are the measur es that one person can take to prevent getting or giving a communicable disease to another person. Infection control measures are usually quite simple, such as wash ing one's hands before preparing a meal, covering one's mouth when coughing or snee zing, or wearing gloves when touching blood that has come from someone else. Al though infection control might seem to be most important when people are known to be si ck (such as in hospitals), in reality, infection control must be practiced ev eryday by everyone. This is because communicable diseases are usually most infect ious either before or just as affected persons develop symptoms, when they do not ye t know that they are ill. Thus, by the time one realizes that someone has a comm unicable disease, he or she probably has already been exposed to the infection unl ess good infection control has been used. EXAMPLES OF WAYS TO CONTROL INFECTIONS 1. Wash hands before meals. 2. Cover mouth when coughing or sneezing. 3. Wash hands before preparing food. 4. Stay home when sick. 5. Dry feet after taking a shower. 6. Don't drink untreated water. 7. Don't eat uncooked meat. HANDWASHING Handwashing is one of the most important ways to practice infection control. Students need to learn about handwashing and have an opportuni ty to practice all of the steps. To demonstrate the proper pr ocedures for handwashing, you can verbally instruct students how to wash their hands while they sit at their desks. They can pretend they are at a sink doing each action as it is dire cted, or you may want to take groups of students to the sink and give them the opport unity to wash their hands with soap and water. Whatever method used, the steps to fo llow include: 1. Use soap and running water. 2. Rub hands vigorously. 3. Wash all surfaces, including: - backs of hands - wrists - underneath fingernails 4. Rinse well. 5. Dry hands with paper towel. 6. Turn off the water using a paper towel instead of bare hands. 176 These procedures should be incorporated befor e meals, after recess, after using the bathroom, after coughing and sneezing and after assisting in first aid. ASK STUDENTS WHAT THEY WOULD AND WOULD NOT DO IF SOMEONE CUT THEMSELVES IN CLASS Another way people can be exposed to viruses is by coming in contact with infected blood while providing first aid. The risk of infe ction by this means is very low, and can occur only if the blood from the infected person can get th rough a break in the skin, such as a cut, open sore, or chapped area. Ne vertheless, steps should be taken while providing first aid to avoid direct skin contact with blood. Precautions with first aid cannot be limited to just those who are known to be infected. It is important to remind student s that most persons infected with HIV and the hepatitis B virus are not sick and do not know that t hey are infected. T herefore, the same precautions must be used when gi ving first aid to everyone. PRECAUTIONS FOR GIVING FIRST AID When giving first aid to someone with a blee ding injury, steps should be taken to avoid direct contact with blood. These precautions apply to giving first aid to anyone, not just persons who are known to have an infection. Younger students should seek help from an adult before giving first aid. The precautions include: 1. Persons giving first aid should use a first aid kit that includes a pair of plastic or rubber gloves. 2. Persons giving first aid should put on the gloves before having contact with blood, unless harm would come to the injured person because of a delay in getting and putting on the gloves. 3. After giving first aid, all disposable items contaminated with blood should be placed in a plastic bag, which is tied shut and put in a wastebasket or trash can. Remove soiled gloves without touching the contaminated surface with bare hands. 4. Any clothes contami nated with blood should be lau ndered or dry-cleaned. 5. Any blood spilled on the floor, desks, or other surfaces should be cleaned up with soap and water. Then the surfaces should be disinfected and allowed to air dry. Any cleaner/disinfectant with an EPA number may be used. Example includes fresh household bleach. 6. All persons providing first aid and cleanup should wash thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible after finishing the task. BRAINSTORM PLACES WHERE INFECTION CONTROL SHOULD BE PRACTICED The message here is that the first aid prec autions should be used everywhere. Certainly there are some settings where the risk is lower (elementary school classroom poses less risk than a sexually transmitted diseases clinic setting). However, there is no setting where the risk is zero. The consequences of an exposure are so serious (it only takes one time) that the precautions are just ified even in the lower risk settings. 177 Examples of specific places where infect ion control should be practiced include: 1. Hospitals 2. Worksites, homes 3. Schools, especially in athletics w here bleeding injuries may occur. 4. Parks, shopping malls and other public places. 178 179 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 LESSON 4 AIDS: A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE Objective The learner will demonstrate the ability to explain how HIV affe cts the immune system. Materials Transparencies on AIDS Definition, AIDS Iceberg, Hippopotamus Vocabulary Immune system*, antibodies, germs*, AIDS *, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)*, white blood cells (*Critical vocabulary) Procedures 1. Review vocabulary learned in Lessons 1-3, by asking groups to quiz each other on definitions. Use Vocabulary Notebooks for assistance. 2. Tell the students that the purpose of today's lesson is to learn more about a specific communicable disease known as AIDS. Write AIDS on the board or use transparency. 3. Review and/or introduce the functi on of the immune system emphasizing how bodies provide infection control against viruses and germs. Use visuals and information from health books/curriculum. 4. Monitor student understanding of the immune system through the activity described in the Teacher Information. Or have students illustrate/tell how immune system works on a simple level. 5. Tell students that AIDS is caused by a virus that attacks the immune system. Write human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the board and describe its effect on the immune system. Write the description of its effects on the board/overhead. 6. Use the AIDS transparency to explain the AIDS acronym. Help students break apart the words and practice their pronuncia tion. Involve students in the lesson by asking them what they know about AIDS. Write their ideas on the board/overhead. Tie Immunodeficiency to immune system; make connection for them. 7. Use the iceberg or hippopotamus trans parency to discuss the large percentage of HIV infected persons who are heal thy carriers compared to the small population that has progressed to the disease AIDS. Review definition of healthy carrier and relate it to other diseas es, e.g. strep, staff infections. 180 Have each student describe to a partner in his or her own words the meanings of each vocabulary word covered in this lesson. Then give students time to write the definitions in their notebook or list. 8. Monitor student understanding of HIV and its effect on the immune system by involving students in the second activity described in the Teacher Information. Evaluation Participation in the two-student activities with criteria determined by the instructor. 181 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 LESSON 4 THE IMMUNE SYSTEM The immune system protects the body from infection. Barriers such as skin and mucous membranes (linings of the inside of the mouth, nose, etc.) that prevent germs from entering the body are an impor tant part of the i mmune system. Another important part of the immune system is, t he white blood cell. White blood cells are microscopic and circulate throughout the body ' in the blood stream. There are many types of white blood cells. Different types have different functions such as engulfing (\"eating\") bacteria or producing antibodies, wh ich are substances that help kill germs like viruses and bacteria. ACTIVITY 1 - HEALTHY IMMUNE SYSTEM Roles: Immune System 6-8 students Germs 2-3 students Antibodies 2-3 students Narrator 1 student Students can use body movement to demonst rate the function of a healthy immune system. Tell students to act out how the im mune system works. Split students into groups and have them select their roles. They can form an immune system circle by joining hands. The narrator can stand inside this circle to symbolize how a person's immune system protects one from illness. As germs approach the immune system, persons playing antibodies go out, attach to them, and bring them back to the immune system. As long as the immune syste m remains intact (the circle remains unbroken) the immune system is able to kill the germ when it comes in contact with it. The immune system remains in tact and the person maintains his or her health. HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the nam e of a virus that is able to infect and kill white blood cells. If enough of these cells are killed, the infected person is no longer able to fight off infections. Event ually, even relatively harmless germs that exist normally in the human body are able to cause life-threat ening illnesses. When this happens the person is said to hav e acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. SYMPTOMS OF AIDS The symptoms of AIDS develop as HIV progr essively kills white blood cells and the immune system' becomes unable to fight off in fections and other illnesses. A person is said to have AIDS when they - develop one of several specific conditions that indicate severe immune system impairment . Most commonly, these specific conditions are infections caused by bacteri a or other micro-organisms that normally live in the body but are unable to cause illness when the imm une system is working normally. These organisms ta ke advantage of a special circ umstance or opportunity 182 to cause disease, and thus the infections they cause are often called \"opportunistic\" infections. In persons with AIDS, these infections are usually life-threatening. SPECTRUM OF DISEASE CAUSED BY HIV An iceberg metaphor or the hi ppopotamus can be used to help, explain the types of illness caused by HIV. It is best to discuss the AIDS cases first as the \"tip of the iceberg\" or the part of the hippopotamus t hat is out of the water. AIDS cases represent only a small portion of the in fected population. There is the large percentage of persons, \"under the water,\" who are infected with HIV, but who do not have symptoms of AIDS, and thus are carriers. As the epidemic progresses, carriers may develop AIDS. As these people move to the tip of the iceberg or the part of the hippo above water, more HIV-infected people replace them below. There are always many more HIV-infected peopl e than there are people with AI DS. As our history and knowledge of HIV infection has increased over time, so has our estimate of the incubation period, that is, t he length of time it takes from becoming infected to a diagnosis of AIDS. The average' incubation period for AIDS is 910 years in adults and 4+ years for children. ACTIVITY 2 - THE EFFECTS OF HIV ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM Roles: Immune System 5 students HIV 3-4 students Antibodies 5 students Germs 2-3 students Narrator 1 student This activity demonstrates what HIV does to the body. Use the same methods as described in the first activity. Have st udents who play the immune system assemble in a circle joining hands. They surround the narrator who is protected by the immune system. HIV players attach to persons pl aying the immune system and these persons die. The circle is broken. Now, have germs approach the immune system. Antibodies go out, attach to the germs, and bring t hem back. However, because the immune system is no longer intact, it has lost t he power to kill the germs, and they can go through the breaks in the circle to the narrator. 183 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 LESSON 5 HIV RISK AND A PERSONAL PLAN OF PREVENTION Lesson may take more than one day. Teacher Note The identification of risk behaviors, c onsequences and prevention has been the theme throughout this unit. Information about HIV infection and the disease AIDS, should also be presented within this same context. Befo re teaching this lesson, evaluate the readiness of your students for content and vocabulary. Objectives The learner will demonstrate the ability to: Comprehend how human immunodef iciency virus is spread. Explain how HIV infection and AIDS can be prevented. Materials Transparencies on HIV spread and prevention Vocabulary Sexual contact, fetus, abstinence, monogamy Procedures 1. Review with students concepts previously learned related to this lesson such as risk, consequence, prevention and ways diseases are spread. Write on board/overhead. 2. Explain that the purpose of this lesson is to look at specific risks in the spread of HIV and how HIV infect ion can be prevented. 3. Involve the students in the discussion of how HIV is spread and not spread using the transparencies provided. 4. Introduce the concept that high risk behaviors transmit HIV. Tell the students two high risk behaviors associated with the transmission of HIV. See teacher information on page 205. Should include bl ood contact in addition to drug use and sexual contact. 5. Read aloud the reasons why people may engage in high risk behaviors. Discuss as a class examples and ideas on each reason as they are listed. See page 206 in teacher information. May want to have student generate ideas first, then teacher add any that are left out. 6. Reintroduce how responsible decision-making and refusal skills are also used to prevent the sp read of HIV. Review responsible decision-making steps and refusal skills first. 184 7. Involve the students in the discussion of how to prevent the transmission of HIV. Give students time to add thei r own ideas to the discussion and transparencies. Carefully monitor thei r understanding of prevention concepts such as abstinence and monogamy. 8. Tell students to explain to a partn er three ways HIV transmission can be prevented. 9. Give a writing assignment requiring students to develop a personal plan of prevention. The criteria for their a ssignment could include ideas on risk behaviors, risk reduction, how to prevent the spread of HIV and their strategies for a personal plan of prevention. Grade on content not writing skills. 10. Give students time to write vocabulary in Vocabulary Notebook. 11. Give students time to write a ssignments in Vocabulary Notebook. EVALUATION: Students completing the assignment and addressi ng the criteria should be favorably graded. Clarity and completeness of facts could also be we ighed. Ask several students to share their pledges or post st udent pledges on a bulletin board. 185 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 LESSON 5 HOW HIV IS SPREAD HIV is found in blood, semen, breast milk and vaginal/cervical secretions of infected persons. Consequently, contact wit h one of these fluids can result in becoming infected with HIV . The most common wa y that HIV is transmitted is by sexual contact. The second most common way that HIV is trans mitted is by the sharing of needles for injecting drugs that have become contami nated with blood of a drug user who is infected. A third way that HIV can be transmitted is thro ugh the blood of an infected mother to her unborn child. In the past, so me people who received blood transfusions developed AIDS because the person who donated the blood was infected with HIV. Since 1985, all blood donated in this country has been tested for HIV infection. Blood that is found to be infected is discarded and is not transfused. HOW HIV IS NOT SPREAD HIV is spread from one person to another one by sexual or blood contact. HIV has not been spread by other types of contact that ar e more casual in nature. Scientists have studied whether persons who have lived in th e same house as someone with AIDS are also at risk for getting AIDS. These pers ons have shared meals, bathrooms, and have hugged and kissed AIDS patients. In spite of th is direct contact (often for many years), these household contacts have not become infect ed with HIV. If HIV is not spread within households, then it is not spread in other sett ings in which there is less direct contact, such as schools or businesses. There is no evidence that mosquitoes or ot her biting insects can spread HIV infection. There has been no evidence of transmission through tears and saliva. HIV is easily destroyed by heat, disinfectants, and dryi ng. Sitting next to a person with AIDS, donating blood, holding hands, or using telephones or public restrooms do not put you at risk for AIDS. THE TWO RISK BEHAVIORS THAT TRAN SMIT HIV AND THEI R CONSEQUENCES It is critical for students to understand that th e spread of HIV results from behaviors that individuals control. Individuals may avoid exposur e to HIV by avoiding the behaviors that present a risk. Information should be clearly and sensitively presented. High-risk behaviors for HIV infection are t hose that involve the exchange of blood or sexual fluids. Drug Use Drug use poses unacceptable RISKS to one's health and quality of life. CONSEQUENCES of drug use include overdosing, engaging in risky behaviors as a result of impaired judgment, infections of the skin and heart, and criminal activity to support the habit. Sharing needles either fo r drug use or other purposes (such as injecting steroids, or tattooi ng or \"branding\") mean additional RISKS. If needles are shared, the CONSEQUENCES can also include hepatitis B and HIV infection. 186 Sexual contact is the main method of transmission for HIV. As the number of partners increases, RISK increases. The CONSEQUENCES of having sex with multiple partners can include AIDS, other sexually transmi tted diseases, and unwanted pregnancies. Remember that it is not always possible to determine if someone is infected with HIV. WHY PEOPLE ENGAGE IN THESE HIGH RISK BEHAVIORS Ideas for this could include: 1. The person doesn't understand that the behavior is high risk. 2. The person knows that the behavior is high risk, but believes that risk only applies to other people. 3. The person doesn't care about the risk bec ause he or she has little sense of self worth. 4. The person is taking so many other kinds of risks that this risk seems small. For example, the - drug user is taking risks of overdose, addiction, and other kinds of infections. The risk of AIDS may seem small in comparison. 5. The person is afraid to refuse involv ement because others may think he or she is chicken or prudish. 6. The person is more interested in doing w hat they want to do now rather than in worrying about long term health consequences. 7. Established behaviors are difficult to change. PREVENTIVE MEASURES-BLOOD CONTACT Infected blood that carries HIV may be inject ed into an uninfected person by the sharing of needles, razors, tattoo instruments, or an ything else that can puncture skin. Using responsible decisions and sayi ng no to drugs is the best way to prevent getting HI' infected by blood exposure. Some IV drug users are learning how to clean and sterilize their needles to prevent AIDS, but this has to be done properly and consistently to be effective. Similarly, razors, tattoo instrum ents, and ear-piercing instruments should not be shared unless they are sterilized between use. There is no risk, in donating blood since all equipment is already sterile and is used only once. PREVENTIVE MEASURE S-SEXUAL CONTACT People who care for each other can still show their affection without worrying about HIV infection. Touching, holding hands, hugging and social kissing are ways of showing affection that do not pass the virus because they do not involve the exchange of blood or other infectious body fluids. Since we have learned that HIV is transmi tted from an infected per son to an uninfected person during sexual contact, all people w ho do not want to become infected need to adopt the appropriate sexual behaviors. The prac tices below are listed in order of most effective to least effective. a. Abstinence - If a person does not have sexu al relations with another person, then he or she will not -get HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. The benefits of abstinence can include f eeling good about self for taking responsibility, gaining respect from ot hers, showing respect of others and 187 allowing a person to set and fu lfill important life goals. b. Monogamy - If neither partner in a relations hip has ever had other sexual contact and neither has been infected by other risk behaviors such as injection drug use, then the couple does not have to worry about exposure to HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. If one part ner goes outside of the relationship and has unprotected sexual contact with an in fected person, he or she can bring the infection back to their relationship. 188 189 190 191 192 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 LESSON 6 DEVELOPING HEALTHY ATTITUDES Objectives The learner will demonstrate the ability to: Evaluate information on HIV disease and community response to persons with AIDS. Explain his or her feelings about persons infected with HIV or who have AIDS. Materials Newspaper articles, evaluation worksheet Vocabulary United, petition, alternative, circulating, confidential*, he mophiliacs*, statistics, pending, lawsuit, prospect, options*, sterile, quarantine, discriminating*, emotional*, testimony, unafflicted, enlightened, contingencies, lurk (* Critical words) Procedures 1. Tell the students the purpose of today's lesson is to l earn safe, healthy attitudes towards people who have AIDS. Explain th at it could be possible to someday have a classmate that is infected with HIV or has AI DS. This lesson will help students choose attitudes and behavio rs based on facts, not fear. 2. Discuss and define vocabulary from t he newspaper articles having students write the words and definitions in their vocabulary lists. Have students write critical vocabulary words only. 3. Give students the news articles to read and discuss in small groups. Questions to guide discussion could include how the tw o communities handled the situation and why it was handled di fferently in Glide. Articles could be read aloud to student by another student or tape recorded for their listening. 4. Briefly involve each group in a general class discussion to go over their ideas and feelings. 5. List on the board or ov erhead reasons why people migh t be afraid of a person with AIDS. Have students describe to a par tner what they would say to someone that is afraid to have a person with AIDS in their class. List student ideas on the board and discuss as a class. See Teacher Information. 6. Involve the students in a discussion on positive attitudes and non-discriminatory behavior. Emphasize the importance of intera cting with classmates fairly and in a friendly manner. List student idea s on board/overhead. 7. Assign the evaluation works heet individually or in groups. Give time for sharing of ideas to add closure to the activity. 193 8. When students have finished their written assignment, give them the opportunity to review unit information in preparat ion for the Post- Assessment Survey. Read post assessment aloud one item at a time. Evaluation Clarity of information and opinion supported by facts in the student worksheet could be criteria for evaluation. D egree of accuracy for evaluat ion of the Post-Assessment Survey should be determined by each instructor. 194 TEACHER INFORMATION Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 WHY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF AIDS There are two epidemics related to HIV in fection: AIDS and \"AFRAIDS\" (A Fear Regarding AIDS). \"AFRAIDS\" is caused by a lack of information. Many people who think persons with AIDS should be quar antined do not understand that HIV is only spread through sexual contact or through exposu re to blood. They believe that HIV is spread through casual contact. People who are afraid of AIDS do not know how fragile HIV is and that infection can be prev ented by choosing healthy behaviors. The only way to fight both AIDS and \"AFRAIDS \" is by education. If a person is educated about how to prevent AIDS, they will realize that they have the ability to control their behaviors and potential risk for infection. This will result in an appropriate, discrimination-free response to pers ons with AIDS or HIV infection. ASK STUDENTS TO DESCRIBE WHAT THEY WOULD SAY TO SOMEONE THAT IS AFRAID TO HAVE A PERSON WITH AIDS IN THEIR CLASS. Responses might include the following: 1. AIDS is not spread by casual contact. 2. You cannot get AIDS by sitting next to so meone that has AIDS or is HIV positive. 3. You do not need to be afraid to touch someone with AIDS or share supplies with them. HIV is very fragile, does not have t he ability to \"jump off\" surfaces onto a person and is spread only in specific ways. 4. The AIDS virus is only spread through se xual contact and through exposure to blood. The type of behaviors that spread the virus would not take place in a school or classroom setting. 195 Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 NEWS ARTICLE Excerpts from a column by Mary Martin of The News-Review A strongly united group of parents urged the Roseburg School Board Wednesday night to keep two children with the AIDS-related virus out of Winchester Elementary School. An overflow crowd of 60, mostly parents of Winchester students, heard Douglas County Health Officer Dr. Sharon Thrall tell them, the risk of AIDS being transmitted in a school setting is virtually zero...\" Twelve audience members spoke one by one to the board, delivered a single message: They didn't want to take that chance. DeEdra Dillon, who delivered a petition signed by 200 adults, asked that a separate space be provided for teaching the infected students. The petition reads: We, the undersigned residents of School District Number Four, are petitioning the school board, the school administration, and the parents of the two students who have tested positive for the AIDS-related virus to find an alternative to teaching these students in the public school.\" Dillon and another parent, Laurie Baker, said they began circulating the petitions Monday. They call their group \"Concerned Parents.\" The names of the two boys, one who has AIDS and the other who tests positive to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have been kept confidential. They are brothers who are both hemophiliacs and contracted the virus through blood products used to help clot their blood. They have been scheduled to enter Winchester classrooms Monday. Their grade levels are also kept confidential. Although the overall tone of the meeting was polite, anger surfaced repeatedly. Dr. Thrall was interrupted by loud talk. One man said, \"Don't give us statistics.\" Parent Richard Edera brought up the possibility of \"200 parents keeping their kids home.\" Parent Vicki Linderman asked the board, \"What are you going to do when a child has blood to blood contact? What will you do to protect yourself against my pending lawsuit?\" The prospect of transmission by blood worried several parents. \"You can't be there every minute,\" said Edera. \"There's no such thing as a recess that isn't contact sports.\" Another parent, Greg Linderman, reacted to information from Thrall: \"It's not what we do know; it's what we don't know that scares the heck out of me.\" Parent Gordon Smith asked, \"What options do we have as parents to go to other schools?\" Winchester area resident Jerry Stine asked about the possibility of creating a sterile classroom at Winchester School. And Peggy Matthews said, \"1 can't care about those kids; I have to care about my kids.\" Jeff Wikstrom, a parent whose children attend another public school, said, \"I think what we have to talk about is quarantine. These kids aught to be home... It's too bad they have it; we're not discriminating against them...\" Stenbeck, responding during several tense moments during the evening, said, \"Try to remember, this is not us against them. I hope we are all friends united to help our children.\" Hall labeled the parents' testimony \"responsible concern\" but reminded parents that although \"Zero risk does not exist in infectious disease,\" HIV has never been known to spread by casual contact.\" 196 After about an hour of emotional testimony from the audience, School Board President Stenbeck told them, \"The School Board has your interest at heart. We have done our research... In any decision, were at risk in regard to a lawsuit. We must protect the rights of all students.\" -197- Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 NEWS ARTICLE IN GLIDE, CLASS AND CARING Two brothers returned to Glide Elementary School this week. The boys are both hemophiliacs who carry the AIDS virus as a result of earlier blood transfusions. So far their school days have been full of the classroom lessons and playground games that other, unafflicted children experience. And the community of Glide deserves a lot of credit for that. It could have been otherwise. From the time Glide school officials first learned of the infection last spring, their response has been consistently enlightened and respons ible. They have demonstrated compassion for the infected boys and concern for the health and wellbeing of t he entire community, parents and students alike. There were community forums to educate parents and the larger public on the ABC's of AIDS. T here were training sessions for teachers and other staff. Guidelines were established; contingencies considered. Classroom to classroom went medical experts and Oregonian-Oct. 87 counselors to address the questions of children about a dise ase adults do not yet understand. Worry, fear and even ugliness will lurk in any community confronting AIDS in its schools. Glide could hardly be an exception. But, if the first days of school at Glide Elementary are any indication, the lessons and examples of school personnel paid off. Classmates welcomed the boys back to their classrooms and more. As correspondent Dana Tims wrote Wednesday in The Oregonian, On the playground... the older boy's peers have redesigned the rules of their touch football games to allow him always to play quarterback and throw the ball, rather than having to risk the chance of being cut or hit by catching it.\" In Glide, that's what friends are for. -198- Healthy Kids: Keeping Safe GRADES 4-5 STUDENT REVIEW OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES Name:__________________ _____________________ ________________________ Directions: Read the questions or statements below.

ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIE NCY SYNDROME (AIDS): An acquired defect in the i mmune system function that r educes the affected person's resistance to certain types of infections and cancers. AIDS is caused by a virus called HIV, which is spread through infected semen or vaginal/cervical secretions shared during intimate sexual contact; or exposure to infected blood or blood products. Once a person becomes immune deficient, he or she is susceptible to diseases that healthy people do not catch. ANTIBODY: Protein molecules that are produced and secret ed by certain types of white cells called plasma cells (in response to stimulation by an antigen) made to kill germs and thus fight infection. ANTIGEN: A substance foreign to the body, such as HIV that stimulates the formation of antibodies. ANTIRETROVIRAL AGENTS: Medications and substances used agai nst retroviruses such as HIV. ANTIVIRAL: A substance or process that destroys a virus or suppresses its replication. ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIER: A person who is infected, but has no sym ptoms of the infect ion or disease. BIAS: A preference that gets in the wa y of making an impartial judgment.

The test is not 100% accurate and may produce falsely positive as well as falsely negat ive results. A positive result is better than 99% accurate if found in a person with risk behaviors, such as injection drug use or unsafe sexual contact with an infected person. 210 HIV DEMENTIA: The deterioration of intellectua l functions such as memory loss and difficulties with work due to damage to brain cells and their f unction by active HIV infection. HIV DISEASE: HIV disease can be described as on a cont inuum from the time a person becomes infected with HIV through the time she/he develops AIDS, which is the end stage.

Like other retroviruses, HIV uses 212 the enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA into DNA, which is then integrated into the host cell DNA. SAFER SEXUAL BEHAVIOR: Safer sexual behavior includes ways to be inti mate without transferring semen, vaginal, and cervical secretions, or other body fluids. SEMEN: The fluid that contains spe rm ejaculated through the penis. SEXISM: A belief in the superiority of one sex over an other; policies and practices that serve to elevate one sex and s ubordinate the other.

TRANSCRIPTION: The process of constructing a messenger RNA molecule using a DNA molecule as a template with the resulting transfer of genet ic information to the messenger RNA. As related to HIV, the process by whic h the provirus produces new viruses. VAGINAL/CERVICAL SECRETIONS: Fluids within the vagina and cervix. VIRUS: Submicroscopic microbe causing infectious di sease. Viruses are on the border line of life in that they can function and reproduce only in living cells.
