One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications It could be considered that conventional medicine has indirectly contributed to the rise of complementary and alternative medicine. A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. Today we have alternative medicine which was developed thousands of years ago and have a long-standing historical value of effectiveness, advantages, and some drawbacks. Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the Chem 253 - Organic Chemistry I Lab 10: Isolation of Identification of the major constituent of clove oil 3/15/2012 Purpose: The purpose of this lab was to isolate the cove oil from ground cloves and determine the identity of the major constituent that is known to have the molecular formula C10H12O2 through IR Through the enthusiasm of alternative medicine by patients, the health and social care sector comes across to:\" ethical issues of efficacy, training, competence and patient safety, \"according to (Nursing times ,2005). Therefore, it is important to understand the principles behind complementary therapies and their usage. A forty-minute session is 340 American dollars which is extremely expensive. The type of conditions treated are thyroid disorders, weight issues, allergies, headaches, high blood pressure and adrenal fatigue. Alexis also assists patients in maintaining good health by utilizing bloodwork and other tests to determine weaknesses before they develop into disease. Both evidence and experienced based approaches are used so in this way I feel that she upholds the philosophy of naturopathy treating the individual as a whole person and at the same time uses the tools of science through optimal blood testing to ensure no harm is done to the patient which upholds the naturopathic principle of do no harm. There is no mention of the vital force which is a fundamental naturopathic principle, I feel this may be due to the professionalization of the profession trying to fit into mainstream Naturopathy focuses on an individualized approach to treating the whole person, with a strong emphasis on health promotion and prevention, Holistic Healthcare-How Should Nursing Support Patients' Rights? Healthcare treatments are no longer being determined by set protocols for a particular diagnosis or disease process. Increasingly more common, individualized, patient-driven adaptations are being implemented to improve adherence and compliance with treatment. Society as a whole is changing. The influx Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a term that describes health and wellness therapies that have not been part of conventional medicine. Complementary treatments is with conventional medicine, and alternative treatments is used in place of conventional medicine. It can include treatments and therapies such as massage, natural products, meditation, yoga, vitamin supplements, herbs, chiropractic, acupuncture, and lots more. But problems arise when CAM is questioned if it scientifically helps patients overcome a disease. Is there really health benefits? Are some of the products natural? Do they come with risks? These are questions that can be asked when looking into CAM. Although alternative healing methods have been historically practiced longer than biomedicine, the culture of biomedicine has in the past few centuries worked to assert itself as a more legitimate form of healing. These claims in part come from the assertion that science has proven the legitimacy and effectiveness of biomedicine and the same cannot be said for alternative healing methods. These differences in healing relate to the fact that they have different views of what causes illness. Additionally the two ideologies often cannot coexist with each other which only leads to more disagreement. The differences between the culture of biomedicine and alternative healing methods stem from different understandings of where illness comes from and therefore how it can be healed. In this day and age, a culture of compromise and understanding from both sides, biomedical and traditional, is necessary for effective treatments. To complete the treatment with substitute medicine Naturopathy is a branch of medicine that uses natural therapies free and safe. It supports Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine, commonly referred to as \"Alternative Medicine\", is a vast and rapidly growing new scientific field. It is derived mainly from ancient, traditional methods of healing that have often been practiced in the East for centuries. These include a variety of techniques from herbal healing to acupuncture to homeopathy to energy channeling. Due to the large number of methods that are covered by the term, there are various definitions of Holistic Medicine. However, all literature seems to agree that Alternative Medicine, is exactly what the name suggests: an 'alternative' approach to healing and medicine. It is a more personal move toward health care, which attempts to connect the mind, body and spirit. There are several reasons why I have decided to pursue a career in Naturopathic medicine. First and foremost I want to help people. Septic arthritis in my hip at the age 9 months has led to a lifetime of being constantly involved in many disciplines of the healthcare system. And while medical doctors and surgeons have provided me with the ability to walk and lead a normal life, it was naturopathic and chiropractic doctors that really helped me overcome my overall health concerns. I owe a lot to naturopathic medicine and ultimately wish to become a naturopathic doctor so that I can help other people in ways that I was helped myself. I know that my passion lies within medicine, but the '10 minute appointment followed by a prescription' kind of healthcare does not appeal to me. Alternative Medicine Although \"Alternative\" or \"Complementary\" medicine has been kept on the fringes of the medical sciences in the past, it is becoming increasingly more popular, and more reputable. Alternative medicines are those medical systems which are not taught to or practiced by most conventional medical doctors. Alternative medicines seemingly have always existed, changing and conforming to the current climate of society. There seems to be an almost endless number of alternative medicines, each with their own method of gaining perfect health. Often people who are dissatisfied with conventional medicine turn to alternative medicine for their medical needs. Many similarities link the diverse extremities of alternative medicine. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
