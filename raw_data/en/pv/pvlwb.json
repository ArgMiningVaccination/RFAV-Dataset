The Fond du Lac Tribal College Extension Program (TCEP) will lead and manage the project and, with its university and tribal partners, will extend its outreach to youth that might not otherwise have any contact with the Ojibwe culture. The proposed project seeks to connect Fond du Lac Band members and surrounding communities to regional resources, social networks, and Ojibwe culture through multi-generational design. The proposed project will draw from the knowledge base and social connections established in the TCEP to ensure the prevention model is culturally-based.The proposed project seeks to address community-level mental and behavioral health risk factors, and in particular opioid use and misuse, through integration of culturally-based activities to motivate Native youth toward healthier lifestyles for the betterment of themselves, their families, and especially, their community (in collaboration with the Fond du Lac Human Services Division).Program Goals: Increase knowledge about practices that promote improved mental and behavioral health; about triggers to opioid abuse and effects; increase confidence and desire to avoid opioid use and stop use; increase knowledge of cultural identity, address underlying cores beliefs such as historical trauma to begin healing. Reduce substance abuse among Fond du Lac youth, reduce social isolation and increase positive tribal citizen productivity. Increase tribal well-being, prosperity and reduce tribal health and social costs.", "sitename": null, "date": "2018-01-09", "cleaned_text": "Progress 09/01/18 to 08/31/21 Outputs Target Audience:The project team, along with the Fond du Lac community Advisory Committee, and the broader community stakeholders helped identify the specific target audience for prevention/intervention programming. While we know that at-risk tribal youth is a top priority for the tribe, the project team, partners and stakeholders determined to target the age range of 10-17 years old. This age range was chosen when our team considered the risk factors of pre-teen to high school and pressures that this age group faces in their life. During our final project year our team focused on community training, and continuation of the youth leadership outreach. We identified our stakeholders as not only the youth but the Fond du Lac health clinic staff /practitioners, schoolteachers and staff, trauma rehabilitation staff, and other youth serving organizations in the region.During the 2020-2021 project year the pandemic restricted the access and ability to safely offer outreach to community youth. Instead of monthly in person camp we continued to serve our youth by virtual meetings and leadership boxes sent to campers. We also sponsored events that fit within our youth leadership model that served both youth and was open to all community members. Changes/Problems:The last year of the project was challenging as continuing pandemic safety restrictions restricted the ability of holding in person youth camps. The lack of in person contact hindered the effectiveness of the outreach that relies on building the relationships that are necessary for supporting youth growth. What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided? Nothing Reported How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest? During the final yearof our RHSE project the project staff performed outreach in the Fond du Lac Community using a community events, newspapers, and social media. In the Fond du Lac Tribal newspaper, the Nahgahchiwanong Dibahjimowinnan, and on the Thirteen Moons and FDLTCC Environmental Institute Facebook page our program posted flyers on RHSE events and workshops. The Fond du Lac Internal Review Board published an article in the IRB Newsletter Dagwaagin 2021. The article described the project and referred readers to program staff for more information. The Cultural Responses to Healing Trauma, Fighting Opioids, and Unlocking the Potential of Native American Youth that was recorded during theAugust 2020 Minnesota American Indian Institute on Alcohol and Drug Studies was posted for the 2021 MAIIDS that was hosted at Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College. The Minobimaadiziwin lacrosse event was a day of educational outreach and also an opportunity to hand out flyers that shared the final results of the RHSE project. Over 50 community members attended this event. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals? Nothing Reported Impacts What was accomplished under these goals? The final project year our staff continued to think outside of the box while ensuring the safety of our community youth while dealing with the unexpected complications of a pandemic. Virtual youth workshops, Mind Body Wellness trainings, and community events served 25 youth and over 100 community members. Youth Leadership Camps The final year of programming included virtual meetings with leadership camp participants structured around talking circles and programming supplies that was mailed to the youth homes. Traditional storytelling was held over 4 weeks with Anishinaabe Elders while snow was on the ground. The storytelling shared traditional stories that taught about values, history, and connection to the land. Community Outreach Our project offered the community trainings in skills, techniques, and curriculum that could be incorporated in schools, health clinic, social services, and other youth serving organizations to help with community resiliency. The Mind Body Medicine workshops were offered in November and December. An eight week training on the Mind Body Medicine techniques was offered in April - May of 2021. The Mind Body is an evidence-based, transformational program that provides the science and tools needed to make mind-body medicine an integral, foundational part of the participants personal and professional life. There were 21 community members involved in these trainings and workshops. The traditional lacrosse Minobimaadiziwin and Building Community event was a community outreach event that taught the traditional game of lacrosse, the teachings around the game, and a sharing of the RHSE program successes. Over 50 community members from youth to Elders participated in the day long event. Evaluation Our evaluation team pulled together all the workshops, leadership camps, and Ripple Effect Mapping evaluation results to get feedback on the effectiveness and potential future directions of the youth resiliency work. Community Stakeholder Survey Results Survey findings from both the community stakeholders and youth participants suggest satisfaction with the workshop material, a belief that the content improved knowledge on the given topics and encouraging indications that youth leadership and confidence increased during the time in the camp. As noted above, the community stakeholder survey was intended to provide in-the-moment feedback for staff to improve camp offerings. Therefore, the main emphasis of the survey was open-ended satisfaction and input with some additional items to determine any perceived changes to knowledge. Workshop satisfaction and Input Overall, workshop participants were pleased with the content they received and saw value in all the workshops. Seventy four percent (n=34) of the responses across the three workshops indicated that they would be \"very likely\" to recommend a similar workshop to Fond du Lac youth and 100% of respondents either very or somewhat likely to recommend the content. Additionally, those surveyed felt that the workshop leaders gave them confidence to use the content. Of those surveyed, 97% (n=38) of the responses indicated feeling somewhat or very confident using the techniques that were taught. Restorative Justice and Circle Keeping Participants had almost entirely positive comments about the restorative justice and circle keeping content. When asked how they thought the content might lead to changes in youth, they noted the potential for improved conflict resolution skills, and gaining an \"understanding of the importance of sharing through the circle.\" Participants liked the information shared from the presenters as well as participants and the \"ritual sacred space\" that was created through the workshop. The only concern noted was the data collection (presumably the survey). Indigenous Focusing Oriented Therapy Participants saw value for youth in the IFOT workshop and felt that the content would lead to a stronger connection between mind and body and a sense of calm. Participants appreciated the hands-on techniques and use of medicines to teach the subject and felt that the content could have used a longer amount of time for the workshop. Trauma Informed Yoga The trauma informed yoga workshop was the most widely attended of the three and was, again, well received. The stakeholders felt that the yoga activities would help to relax and calm youth and provide skills for addressing trauma. The group felt that the hands-on work actually doing and learning yoga poses was valuable and wanted more application for work with children and a more comfortable space to do the activities. Knowledge gained Workshop participants consistently noted a gain in knowledge from before to after the workshop. With all three topics, the stakeholders reported more knowledge after the workshop. For the restorative justice and circle keeping workshop, the community members felt that they ended the workshop with considerable knowledge on the topic. Trauma informed yoga participants felt that they had moderate knowledge at the close of the workshop, but they also noted starting the workshop with non-existent knowledge on the topic. Youth Camp Survey Results Youth camp participants identified gains in their feelings of self-efficacy and leadership and noted elements of the camp activities that they liked and those that they hoped to improve. The youth participants also shared knowledge gained in each of the focus areas of the camp. Leadership, confidence, and self-efficacy Youth participants completed the General Self Efficacy measure at two timepoints. Respondents scored higher on each item except one (If I am in a bind, I can usually think of something to do) which showed no change. None of the youth scored themselves lower at the follow up. The total score was .26 higher on the follow up survey.These data indicate an encouraging sign that camp participation may support improvements in leadership skills, confidence, and sense of competence- all critical skills for preventing opioid abuse and building resilience.The youth surveyed offered fewer responses to the open-ended survey items and frequently used one-word responses. The group was also consistent in their responses. Because of this, the top two responses are identified below for each question instead of each individual response. In general, the youth noted enjoyment with camp activities, and many noted that they would not make any changes to the camp. Lacrosse was the most popular activity, and the talking circle was brought up as the least favorite. The youth noted increased knowledge across all the topics presented during the camp and in almost every case they felt that their knowledge after the session was \"considerable.\" Ripple Effect Mapping Findings (REM) The Stakeholder group agreed upon the following themes and sub-themes to organize the findings of the REM. 1. Strengthening a sense of community Deeper relationships - stronger sense of belonging New relationships Connecting with staff and college Bringing generations together Keeping us together during the pandemic 2. Learning and applying healthy coping skills Caring for mind and body Thinking differently 3. Planting seeds of hopefulness Positive experiences Kids were eager to engage 4. Reclaiming our culture and creating a sense of well-being Youth use of Ojibwemowin as part of learning Application of traditional values 5. Gaining confidence in positive leadership skills Increased confidence while meeting challenges of camp activities Increase in communication skills and speaking up 6. Opportunities moving forward Importance of consistent adult presence Narrow age groups in programming Increase the time together to build relationships Publications Progress 09/01/19 to 08/31/20 Outputs Target Audience: The project team, along with the Fond du Lac community Advisory Committee, and the broader community stakeholders helped identify the specific target audience for prevention/intervention programming. While we know that at-risk tribal youthis a top priority for the tribe, the project team, partners and stakeholders determined to target the age range of 10-17 years old. This age range was chosen when our team considered the risk factors of pre-teen to high school and pressures that this age group faces in their life. During our secondgrant year our team focused on community training, and implementation of the youth Leadership camps. We identified our stakeholders as not only the youth but the Fond du Lac health clinic staff /practitioners, school teachers and staff, trauma rehabilitation staff, and other youth serving organizations in the region. During the second year our outreach expanded to the youth Leadership camps, community trainings on resiliency techniques/curriculum, and a conference presentation. Our partners and audience this year included Tribal Council, the Fond du Lac Internal Review Board, Fond du Lac Police Department, Headstart, Air Force, Social Services, Restorative Justice of Carlton County, FDL Health Clinic, FDL Prevention Intervention, and the FDL Ojibwe School. The combination of youth and community focus resulted in outreach and trainings that served a wide section of the Fond du Lac community. Changes/Problems:The 2019-2020 project year held many challenges for both the program and community. Staffing changes was potentially challenging but fortunately we were able to overlap the tenures of the youth coordinators so that there was just a small interrruptionof programming. This switch of staff happened in February2020 which unfortunately gave our new youth coordinator just a small opportunity to meet the camp youth before the March pandemic social distancing protocols were put into place in the community. A new set of camp consent forms and applications had to be developed and approved by the Fond du Lac IRB before the new virtual camps could be implemented. The amazing work of our youth coordinator and support of the IRB allowed us to sucessfully offer the virtual camps in April 2020. What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?Our RHSE project staff were able to attend all eight workshops offered through our program as well as attend theMinnesota American Indian Institute on Alcohol and Drug Studies Conference (MAIIADS) held in August 2020. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest? During our secondyear of our RHSE project the project staff performed outreach in the Fond du Lac Community using a conference presentation, newspapers,and social media. In the Fond du Lac Tribal newspaper, the Nahgahchiwanong Dibahjimowinnan, and onthe Thirteen Moons and FDLTCC Environmental Institute Facebook page our program posted flyers on RHSE events and workshops. Our staff gave presentations on Cultural Responses to Healing Trauma, Fighting Opioids, and Unlocking the Potential of Native American Youth to the August 2020Minnesota American Indian Institute on Alcohol and Drug Studies that was hosted at Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals? Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College requested andreceiveda no cost extension for the RHSE program.During our next reporting period we will continuehosting our RHSE Youth Tribal Leadership camps. The camps will start in December 2020and occur monthly until June 2021. These camps will be focused on 10-14 year old youth and will model some of the curriculum that our RHSE staff have researched and implemented during our first year. Camp topics will include trauma informed yoga, Circle Keeping, lacrosse, mind/body mindfulness, and various leadership activities. Community workshops and professional development outreach will also be offered during the next reporting period. Regional experts in Circle Keeping, Trauma Informed Yoga, Indigenous Focusing -Orientated Therapy (IFOT), Mind/Body, Adverse Childhood Experiences, and the Air Force self defense and leadership program will present in multiple community workshops. These workshops will be held as both professional development opportunitiesfor our Fond du Lac organizations as well as being open to the greater community. Impacts What was accomplished under these goals? During the 2019-2020 project year our staff accomplished great progress on our RHSE program in spite of thegreat upheaval caused by the necessity of dealingwith the unexpected complications of a pandemic. In spite of the changes that were needed to protect the community and still offer programming we had a full and productive year. During this second year of the project we offered 8 Youth Leadership camps, 8 community workshops, a conference presentation, and Ripple Effect Mapping participatory evaluation. Our program served 31 youth and over 100 indigenous community members. Youth Leadership Camps In September our youth coordinator focused on recruiting youth for Leadership Camps. A major effort was made to design and distributerecruitment flyers, youth camp application forms, and consent forms. Our project worked closelywith the Fond du Lac Band's Internal ReviewBoard (FDL IRB). The FDL IRB sets the data collection and privacyparameters with program staff. The first Youth Leadership camp was held in September 2019. This camp focused on team building exercises, such as ropes courses and other leadership games. A planned October Leadership camp had to be re-scheduled to be held in November because of a tragic shooting that rocked the community. In November the camp focused on introducing skills and practices to help our youth deal with stress and see themselves as leaders. The practice of yoga for calming and centering youth was practiced at the beginning of the camp. The traditional game of lacrosse in conjunction withthe Ojibwe teachings that come with the game was taught during November. The traditional teachings that are part of lacrosse includes the practice of respect, intention, and dealing with others. These teachings are modeled as the community adults play with the youth. The last component of this camp was the traditional practice of circle. Circle is a practice that provides a safe structure for the youth to communicate, practice conflict resolution, and learn to hear others. These three components, yoga, lacrosse, and circle, were included in all of the youth leadership camps.In January 2020 the Youth Leadership camp focused on coping skills. Professional instructors taught the youth trauma informed yoga techniques at the beginning of the camp day.An Ojibwe Elder also took the youth out and taught them how to harvest and create snow snakes.The snow snake is a long thin stick that is carved and decorated to be used in a snow snake tournament. The snow snake game is a winter game that has a luge type track with participants that compete on who can throw their \"snake\" the furthest down the track. Again this game includes teachings and stories that are traditionally told in the winter.In February the Youth Leadership camp focused on the Air Force Self Defense course. Tribal Air Force cadets provided part of the training and were role models for our youth. Our project staff felt this was an especially important camp training to offer our youth to add resiliency skills to their toolbox.In March the pandemic prevented all in person meetings. The Fond du Lac Reservation and Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College implemented strong protocols around social distancing requirements.To pivot to social distance camps our coordinator worked with the FDL Internal Review Board to obtain approval for Zoom and care package protocols for the youth camp. The camps were offered monthly using Zoom technology. In order to be able to allow all youth participation equity some of our youth had to be provided a computer. Care packages that included lacrosse equipment, yoga mats, seed starting kits, and potato buckets were delivered to their homes to be used over the next couple of months.Our April through July 2020 youth camps were held via zoom with a focus on the yoga practice, circle keeping, and lessons on the materials that were provided in the camp care packages that was delivered to their houses. Over the course of the 2019-2020 project year we served 31 youth. Community Outreach Our project planned to offer the community trainings in skills, techniques, and curriculum that could be incorporated in schools, health clinic, social services, and other youth serving organizations to help with community resiliency.In November 2019 a community workshop was offered on Circle Keeping which is a practice grounded in indigenous culture that is focused on conflict resolution. Circle Keeping is used in restorative justice that addresses conflict and crime in a way that relies less on punishment but on healing the community.In December 2019 a workshop in IFOT (Indigenous Focusing- Orientated Therapy) was offered to the community. IFOT heals trauma and has been especially well received because it honors core values of each community as well as respecting local traditions. This approach uses land-based healing through a body-centered approach to healing of trauma caused by sexual, physical, and emotional abuse through a person's lifetime and recognizes the impact of historical trauma.Twelve community members from the schools, health clinic, and social services divisions attended the workshop.A community workshop on trauma informed yoga was attended by clinic and school staff in January 2020. Trauma informed yoga is specifically designed to promote the slow, controlled reintegration and release of the somatic effects of trauma. This training was designed for health professionals to teach an understanding of howthis type of yoga could be used for mental health care.In February 2020 a workshop on self defense was offered in partnership with the Colorado Air Force Academy. The Air Force self defense workshops were designed to increase resiliency with a lock down or a stressful situation. Participants learned to how to defend themselves, diffuse a violent situation and how to escape an attack. This training was especially designed for front line workers in the health and education fields.In June 2020 anACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) virtual community workshop was held. The Adverse Childhood Experiences findings represent a paradigm shift in human understanding of the origins of physical, social, mental, and societal health and well-being.The key goals of the presentation were to share the ideas that have resulted in transformative change and community resiliencyin other places, not necessarily solutions that will work in all tribal communities. A June 2020 Mind Body Medicine virtual workshop was held over two days for the community. Mind Body medicine is an evidence based transformational training that provides the science and tools needed to make mind-body medicine an integral, foundational part of personal and professional practice. Mind Body Medicine techniques and tools look at how to manage stress response in the body. Conference The Minnesota American Indian Institute on Alcohol and Drug Studies Conference (MAIIADS) was held August 17th - 21st in a virtual formatto provide education on alcohol and drug abuse that addresses the total well-being of the American Indian individual, family, and community that is sensitiveto cultural healing traditions. Our project staff presented\" Cultural Responses to Healing Trauma, Fighting Opioids, and Unlocking the Potential of Native American Youth\". Evaluation Ripple Effects Mapping evaluation was performed in August 2020. This participatory evaluation technique brought together multiple stakeholders to get feedback on impact of the RHSE program. Core themes that emerged from the process was that the RHSE project had strengthened a sense of community, has increased the learning and applying of healthy coping skills, planted seeds of hopefulness in the youth, supported gains in confidence in positive leadership skills, and helped youth toreclaimculture and a sense of well-being.

MAIIADS 2020 Convention, Cloquet, MN, 09/01/18 to 08/31/19 Outputs Target Audience: The project team, along with the Fond du Lac communityAdvisory Committee, and the broader community stakeholders helped identify the specific target audience for prevention/intervention programming. While we know that at-risk tribal youth is a top priority for the tribe, theproject team, partners and stakeholders determined to target the age range of 10-17 years old. This age range was chosen when our teamconsidered the risk factors of pre-teen to high school and pressures that this age group faces in their life. During our first grant year our team focused on Advisory Committee feedback, curriculum research, evaluation work, and partner outreach.We identified our stakeholders as not only the youth but the Fond du Lac health clinic staff /practitioners, school teachers and staff, trauma rehabilitation staff, and other youth serving organizations in the region. Our outreach to these target audiences were varied in order to reach the maximum amount of community members. This outreach included two radio broadcasts, articles in the Fond du Lac Newspaper, youth focused events, and program presentations at conferences. The advisory board was convened on a bi-monthly basis to get feedback on proposed programming and curriculum models that would be explored during our youth outreach. Changes/Problems: Nothing Reported What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided? Nothing Reported How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?During our first year of our RHSE project the project staff performed outreach in the Fond du Lac Community using conference presenations,newspapers, radio, and social media. In the Fond du Lac Tribal newspaper, the Nahgahchiwanong Dibahjimowinnan, we introduced our staff and the new program. We also hosted two radio outreach programs on the Fond du Lac radio station Dibiki Giizis 89.1. On the Thirteen Moons and FDLTCC Environmental Institute Facebook page our program posted flyers on RHSE events and workshops. Our staff gave presentations on Cultural Responses to Healing Trauma, Fighting Opioids, and Unlocking the Potential of Native American Youthto the July 2019 National Association of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics conference in Washington D.C. as well as the Minnesota American Indian Institute on Alcohol and Drug Studies that was hosted at Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?During our next reporting period will be hosting our RHSE Youth Tribal Leadership camps. The camps will start in September 2019 and occur monthlyuntil June 2020. These camps will be focused on 10-14 year old youth and will model some of the curriculum that our RHSE staff have researched during our first year. Camp topics will include trauma informed yoga, Circle Keeping, lacrosse, mind/body mindfulness, and various leadership activities. In June 2020 the youth will present to the Minnesota American Indian Institute on Alcohol and Drug Studies that will be hosted at Fond du Lac Tribal Community College. Community workshops and professional development outreach will also be offered during the next reporting period. Regional experts in Circle Keeping, Trauma Informed Yoga, Indigenous Focusing -Orientated Therapy (IFOT), Mind/Body, Adverse Childhood Experiences, and the Air Force self defense and leadership program will present in multiple community workshops. These workshops will be held as both professional developement opporunities for our Fond du Lac organizations as well as being open to the greater community. Impacts What was accomplished under these goals? In our first full year of the RHSE program we made great progress on review of the curriculum and reaching out to community programs for input on models of youth resiliency in the face of the opioid addiction. Our program was able to quickly hire a RHSE youth and program coordinator that had youth and health connections in the Fond du Lac community. The other priority was to gather an advisory board to help guide input for the intervention models that are to be tested in the community. The first couple of months our staff reviewed curriculum for models of youth prevention programs that could be adapted for use in the Fond du Lac tribal community. The curriculum to be reviewed was chosen with input from tribal community professionals as well as research on various models that have been used nationally to address the needs of youth in the face of opioid addiction. The curriculum reviewed was Kognito, trauma informed yoga, Healing the Canoe, Circle Keeping, traditional arts/ games, mind/body medicine, and leadership curriculum. Our staff reached out to schools, the health clinic, and substance abuse intervention and prevention organizations in the Fond du Lac community to learn more about the techniques currently used in their outreach. Using this information helped inform the curriculum our program concentrated on further exploring to build a youth model of care and prevention. A stakeholder Advisory Board was formed with people from the community that have been working on community resiliency in the face of substance abuse, historical trauma, and other stressors. In order to clarify the role of the Advisory Board, steps were taken to get everyone on the same page. A survey was developed and given to the RHSE program Advisory Board. This survey engaged Advisory Board members to better understand their strengths, expectations, and knowledge of other youth addiction prevention community efforts. A couple of examples of questions included \"What strengths do you bring to the Advisory Group (e.g. community connections, understanding of cultural resources, personal experiences, knowledge of research, etc.)? \" and \" What other community efforts or potential partners should the RHSE project be aware of?\". The results of our survey highlighted the depth and wealth of knowledge and connections that the Advisory Board offered to enrich the youth programming. Our staff was able to work with the Advisory Board to make sure our project was well grounded in the youth outreach efforts that were happening at Fond du Lac. This step was crucial in order for the Advisory Board to take on the role of helping advise on the curriculum that our program will be testing with the youth and community. As part of our community outreach and youth recruitment, our RHSE program started by testing some traditional games models of youth interaction. One of the examples of this was hosting the snowsnakes workshop and tournament.Snow snakes are a traditional game played during the winter. Using flattened, carved pieces of wood, the \"snakes\" are thrown through a luge like trough in the snow. The objective is to go the longest distance. These games encourage thinking about physics, aerodynamics, and other environmental elements that would impact a successful throw. It also brings together multiple generations in the community for fun.Using traditional stories and teaching skills of sustainable harvesting of saplings for the making of the snowsnakes, an Ojibwe Elder shared the origins of the snowsnake tradition. A snowsnakes workshop and tournament was held in partnership with the Fond du Lac Ojibwe School. This event combined youth outreach on the creation and tradition of snow snakes and tournament play. During the tournament our RHSE staff sought feedback from the families that participated about interest in a youth leadership camp that would focus on building skills and knowledge among youth on how to deal with opioid addiction in their family. Later in that same month a lacrosse workshop was hosted in the Fond du Lac community. The workshop included the history and teachings that accompany lacrosse as well as teachings on how to play the game. Youth participants also had a chance to learn about the harvesting and making of lacrosse sticks. The youth and families were again asked about their interest in participating in a youth leadership camp. Contact information was gathered from interested families. The RHSE staff also met with the lacrosse teachers to explore the role that lacrosse and its teachings could be used as a model for youth resiliency programming. The FDLTCC Tribal College Extension Program has developed a radio show in partnership with the local Fond du Lac community radio station WGZS 89.1 Dibiki Giizis-The Moon. Beginning early 2019, thehour-long segment focuson various aspects of health in hopes to reduce stigma and overcome barriers in addressing health in the Fond du Lac community as well as focusing on issues around the opioid addiction crisis. Guest speakers included staff from the Mino aya win Health Clinic, spiritual leaders, and other health professionals. These radio programs have been well received by both the community and the participating guests. Presentations on Cultural Responses to Healing Trauma, Fighting Opioids, and Unlocking the Potential of Native American Youth was given to the July National Association of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics conference in Washington D.C. as well as the Minnesota American Indian Institute on Alcohol and Drug Studies that was hosted at Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College.These presentations were focused on the purpose of the RHSE program in the community, the success, and the challenges of creating the programming that would best serve the Fond du Lac community youth and how this could be used in our communities across the country. RHSE staff gave an Adverse Childhood Experiences presentation to community elementary school teachers. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (0-17 years) such as experiencing violence, abuse, or neglect. ACEs have been linked to risky health behaviors, chronic health conditions, low life potential and early death. In addition to these effects many youth in tribal communities add the aspect of historical trauma to the list of experiences. The presentation was designed to raise awareness of how ACEs can impact a child's performance at school.
