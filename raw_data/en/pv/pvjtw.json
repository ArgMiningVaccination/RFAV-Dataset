Medicines are used to fight against infection (antibiotics), to protect fromdiseaseorinfection( - vaccines),toprovideelementsmissinginthe organism (vi-tamins, minerals), to temporarily block normal functions (anaesthetics). Efforts to treat people's illnesses in various forms are as old as human history. In the early days, there were reme-dies with plants for diseases. The development of medi-cines and medicines in today's sense has come about in the 19th century when science has made a leap. In the 19th century, innovations in mathematics, physics and astronomy have led to significant developments in chem-istry, anatomy and physiology. The 20th century is the modern period in which drug design emerges. It seems like we are constantly being bombarded with outrageous headlines stating that American manufacturing is dead. Manufacturing casts a wide net over everything from car parts to makeup and within that mega-industry lays anoth - er massive sector that is thriving and growing everyday: pharmaceutical manufacturing. Pharmaceutical manu-facturing in the U.S. accounts for a combined annual reve-nue of around $200 billion dollars and is expected to grow by 3% in 2017. Healthcare reform has led to millions of newly-insured Americans will contribute to growth in the next few years. In addition to that, our aging baby boom - ers are also expected to boost industry growth due to is - sues like heart disease and Alzheimer's. The fact that more than 20,000 products are on the mar - ket when there are more than five drug active ingredi - ents is due to the fact that the same drug substance is applied to the market as different pharmaceuticalprod-uctsindifferentdosageforms(suchasatorvastatin active in - gredient in the market in the name of various pharmaceu - tical products such as Lipitor \u00ae, kolestor\u00ae, combinations also increase the number of medications (eg, the use of ergotamine-caffeine in the treatment of migraine) The objective of developing new drug molecules is to de- velop beneficial therapeutic compounds that are stronger, less toxic andhavetheleastsideeffects.Druginvestigation - sarestillongoingasthese features are difficult to provide-precisely.Pharmaceuticals from Production to Sale: Review InciSelin Dogan Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Karadeniz Technical University, Turkey With the development of better compounds (low toxic-ity, better pharmacodynamics)manymedicinesthatare-widelyusedformanyyears are getting out of use and new therapies are on the agenda.

With many screening methods in the first stages, the active substances are destroyed without med-ication. About 4,000 to 10,000 molecules, which may be drugs, are synthesized in laboratories. After a number of-pharmacologicalscreeningtests,advancedpharmacologi - calactivity and toxicity tests are performed (see whether the desired effect is present and whether there are side effects). After these studies the numberofmoleculescan - bereducedto9-10 Causes of elimination at these stages: not have any ex - pecte deffect low impact potency effective enough but at the same time have serious side effects not stable difficult to be medicine A single molecule is then achieved by phase I/II/III/IV tests. And these processes take about 20 years on aver-age. Before coming to the pharmacy sale, the synthesis of the active ingredients of the medicines and the prepa-ration of these active ingredients in the form of tablets, syrups, ampoules together with auxiliary substances (dis - solving, reaching the effect area, helping to improve the taste) are the last steps. Phase studies consist of preclinical and clinical stages. Clinical stages have four phase steps. Preclinical animal studies In these studies, priority is to select the animal (rat, mouse, rabbit) which is most suitable for human body structure for the disease to be investigated. Experiments can be done in various forms. In this preliminary study on test ani - mals, the aim is to identify the possible scars of treatment and the molecules that must be removed from the process from the beginning due to side effects. Only a very few of these studies pass to clinical phases. Phase 1 studies: Usually 20-80 healthy volunteers. In this phase, the aim is to detect that the drug is reliable. The dose range is calculated, tolerance and pharmacokinet-ics (processes of drug dissolution, attainment of efficacy, breakdown processes).Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Development 2020, Vol.2, Issue 3InciSelin Dogan Phase 2 studies: It is performed in 100-300 volunteer pa- tients with target disease. The effectiveness and safety of the medicine is checked. Side effects, dose response rela - tionships are examined. Phase 3 studies: are performed in a wider patient popula- tion. It is multi-centered, multi-national, randomized. Proof of your effectiveness and side effects are the monitoring phase. However, after sufficient data have been obtained with phase 3 trials, they must be approved for use as med-icines. Phase 4 studies: Clinical trials conducted after the product has been used as a drug. Long-term reliability determina - tion is performed. Side effects that have not been found in clinical trials are observed and examined from the eco - nomic point of view and the impact on quality of life Because these processes are both long-lasting and cost- ly, the production of new drugs is gradually declining. For this purpose, microdose studies (phase 0) are on the proj-ect. In these microdose studies, 6 healthy volunteers are working on doses below 1/100th of human dose. Although this dose seems to be less, the changes in the target can be examined with advanced imaging techniques. More in - formed models can be created in phase studies with the information obtained in these studies From all these, we can say that we have been studying for many years from medicinal production to sale.
