In 1937, it was established as a separate school and approved by the State Board of Education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to confer the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing and the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nur sing Education by Duquesne University. The program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education was designed to meet the specific needs of the registered nurse while the basic program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nu rsing, the first in Pennsylvania, was designed for the high school graduate. The School of Nursing continued to offer two separate degrees until 1964. In September of that year, a single revised professional nursing program was implemented for admission o f both basic and registered nurse students leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing. In the fall of 1982, a new baccalaureate nursing program, also leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing, was instituted and was specificall y designed to meet the educational and professional needs of the registered nurse. A second -degree track was initiated in August 1991. This accelerated 12 -month or 16-month options are designed for students who hold a baccalaureate degree in a discipline other than nursing. In 1986, the Graduate Nursing Program was opened to offer the Master of Science in Nursing. Today, the areas of specialization offered are: Family Nurse Practitioner, Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, Adult Gerontology Acu te Care Nurse Practitioner, Forensic Nursing, Nursing Education and Faculty Role, and Executive Nurse Leadership and Health Care Management. In fall 1994, the Graduate Nursing Program expanded to include study for the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Nurs ing. In 1997, this program was offered online and became the first online PhD program in the country. In 2008, the School of Nursing opened a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program. In Fall of 2014, the School of Nursing launched a newly designed RN -BSN program and a 5 -year joint Biomedical Engineering and BSN program. In 2017, the School of Nursing launched the PhD in Nursing Ethics program. In 2020, the School of Nursing launched its first BSN -DNP program leading to a degree in Executive Nurse Leadersh ip and Health Care Management . In 2022 we launched our first Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Program (DNAP) in conjunction with the Allegheny School of Anesthesia. UNIVERSITY MISSION STATEMENT Duquesne University of the Holy Spirit is a Catholic University, fou nded by members of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, the Spiritans, and sustained through a partnership of laity and religious. Duquesne serves God by serving students - through commitment to excellence in liberal and professional education, through profound concern for moral and spiritual values, through the maintenance of an ecumenical atmosphere open to diversity, and through service to the Church, the community, the nation, and the world. SCHOOL OF NURSING MISSION STATEMENT The purpose of the School of Nursing is to prepare nurses to practice professional nursing that meets the dynamic health care needs of individuals, families, groups, and communities. Faculty facilitate the education of students in the art and science of nursing to provide ethical, holistic, culturally competent, and population - based, collaborative care. SCHOOL OF NURSING VISION STATEMENT From its beginnings in 1937, Duquesne University School of Nursing has challenged its students to develop 3 their minds, hearts and spirits. Dedicate d to excellence and imbued by a sense of purpose, the faculty of nursing integrates nursing science and evidence -based practice with moral and spiritual values, preparing its students to be leaders, locally and globally. As citizens of the world, we embrac e ecumenism and diversity, standing with the oppressed and vulnerable and teaching by example. SCHOOL OF NURSING PHILOSOPHY The faculty believes that nursing is a human science profession and an academic discipline that focuses on the diagnosis and treatm ent of human responses to actual or potential health problems. We believe the client, conceptualized as an individual, family, group or community, is the focus of the professional nurse. We believe each client and member of the School of Nursing community is unique and holds values and beliefs reflective of their own culture, sense of spirituality, and life experiences. The faculty believes that there are core competencies that enable a nurse to provide \"safe passage \" for clients. The core competencies are the basis of the nurse 's ability to provide, design, manage and coordinate caring practices. These core competencies are: clinical judgment, advocacy, caring practices, systems thinking, response to diversity, facilitation of learning, clinical inquiry, an d collaboration. The faculty believes that together we serve students by being strong role models through commitment to excellence as teachers, scholars, clinicians, and learners. The faculty is dedicated to cultivating a sense of professional empowerment , a desire for life -long learning, and a passion for social justice as a way of being in our school and as an integral part of our school community. An innovative curriculum, based on the changing health and socio -cultural needs of populations and the heal th care delivery system, is integral to the commitment of the faculty to students ' learning and development. The faculty believes that we all learn best when actively engaged in the learning process. The faculty desires to work with students as a communit y of learners in which all function at a high level of accountability, flexibility and integrity. In that way, a true learning environment can be created that fosters the exchange of diverse ideas and opinions and advances collaboration. In such a learnin g community, progress can be anticipated and the efficient use of technology can be assessed and incorporated into the total health care environment. An appropriate balance between technology and aspects of human touch and caring is sought. VALUE STATEMENT OF INCLUSION Duquesne University School of Nursing creates an environment that values a culture of inclusion and openness for faculty, staff and students, and its community partners in pursuit of teaching/learning, scholarship, research and services both locally and globally. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK The curriculum flows logically from the conceptual framework originally developed by the American Association of Critical Care Nurses. The Synergy model suggests that patient outcomes are enhanced when the nurse s' competencies are compatible with the characteristics or needs of the patient. When applied in the educational system, the center of attention for the model is the students and their learning. In the academic environment, developmental needs of the stud ents are advanced when faculty competencies are aligned with the learning needs of nursing students. The competencies of the nurse identified in the model are those the faculty envisions as essential to the success of the nurses ' interventions. Underlying all of the nurses ' competencies is the unique contribution of nurses to provide \"safe passage \" for patients and their families through the health care environment. According to Curly (1998) these competencies are: 1. Clinical judgment - clinical reasoning th at underpins decision -making in clinical practice, includes the assessment of given patient care situations, nursing skills, and safe patient care. 2. Advocacy and moral agency - representing the interests of the other and identifying and working to 4 manage or explain ethical and clinical concerns. This dimension acknowledges the unique trust inherent in the nurse patient relationship. 3. Caring practices - constellation of nursing activities that are responsive to the uniqueness of the patient, family, group and community and create therapeutic environment. Caring practices include: vigilance, engagement and responsiveness. 4. Facilitation of learning - ability to use self to maximize patients ' learning. 5. Collaboration - working with others to promote and encourage each person 's contribution to achieving optimal goals for the patient. This includes intra and interdisciplinary work. 6. Systems thinking - appreciating the care environment and the interrelationships within and across health care systems. 7. Response to diver sity - sensitive to recognize appreciate and incorporate differences between and among people along multiple dimensions in the provision of care. 8. Clinical inquiry - process of questioning and evaluating practice, assessing evidence base of practice and i nnovating through research and learning . BSN PROGRAM OUTCOMES 1.

STUDENT ACKNOWLEDGEMNT OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES At the start of each academic year, students are required to review the student handbook for their given program. Students are required to acknowledge that they have reviewed the handbook and policies therein and that they understand them as written. The student 's acknowledgement will be kept for reference as needed. Students who do not acknowledge the handbook by the deadline each academic year will have a registration hold placed on their account . YOUR PARENTS/FAMILY AND YOUR EDUCATION If you are fortunate enough to have the suppor t of parents, a spouse, family, and/or close friends, then you certainly already know how they can help you reach your goals. We encourage their active involvement in your life and hope that they consider themselves part of the extended Duquesne community. However, when it comes to your academic success, you must be your own best advocate. When you graduate you will be responsible for the health and well -being of your patients, and for your own professional development. One major goal of the college experie nce is evolving into a nurse - and a person - who is able to have difficult conversations, seek out solutions to complex problems, advocate for yourself when you perceive inconsistencies, and accept responsibility when you have not met the standards expect ed of you. To that end, School of Nursing faculty, staff, and administrators make it a general policy not to talk to parents , spouses, or family about student issues. If you are having difficulty in a class, with a school policy, or with an instructor, you are expected to understand the \"chain of command \" in place and pursue the appropriate action. Questions about the process are most easily addressed by reading the Handbo ok; if that is not clear, you should talk to your Student Success Coach or the Office for Student Affairs . There are exceptions to this policy, such as if you are in the midst of an emergency and not able to communicate directly, or if the situation is a matter of safety or security that must include notification of parents or family. But t he majority of the time, we expect that all school related communication be with students directly, and not with parents, spouses, or family. For matters where parents must be involved, students must also be present (unless unable, due to circumstances). S tudents are sometimes under the erroneous impression that having parents call is more effective, but the truth is that it often delays action, and results in the same outcome. Your Student Success Coach and all faculty members are here to help you learn th e skills you need to advocate for yourself and your future patients; part of the learning process includes taking on that role as a student. MULTIPASS INSTRUCTIONS The University uses a MultiPass system that will allow you to access a variety of electronic resources at Duquesne through the internet.

The mission of the School of Nursing is to prepare nurses to practice professional nursing to meet the dynamic health care needs of individuals, families, groups and communities through a liberal education focused on the art and science of nursing providing ethical, holistic, culturally competent, and population -based care in a variety of health care settings. In preparation for the professional nursing roles, nursing faculty expect the student to demonstrate physical ability and show emotional stability to meet the demands of a rigorous BSN program. Nursing program applicants and continuing students in the program must be able to meet the cognitive, affective and psychomotor requirements of the curriculum. The School of Nursing in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the 2009 Ame ricans with Disabilities Act Amendment (ADAA) has identified specific essential abilities or technical standards. These technical standards include all of the nonacademic abilities essential for the delivery of safe, effective nursing care. These standards are designed to establish performance expectations that will enable students to deliver safe, effective care during clinical practice activities, with or without reasonable accommodations. Qualified applicants and students are expected to meet all admissi on criteria, as well as these technical standards with or without reasonable accommodations and to maintain related satisfactory demonstration of these standards for progression through the program. The School of Nursing is committed to enabling students w ith identified disabilities by reasonable means or accommodations to complete academic and experiential learning required for completion of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Therefore, any applicant or student who seeks accommodation at the time of admis sion or at any time during progression in the program will be evaluated and receive an assessment of the types of reasonable accommodation needed for the clinical practice component of the program. The technical standards that have been identified as neces sary to meet nursing curriculum technical standards requirements include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: General Abilities To provide quality nursing care the student is expected to possess functional use of the senses of vision, touch, hearing, taste and smell so that data received by the senses must be integrated, analyzed and synthesized in a consistent and accurate manner.

In addition, the indivi dual is expected to possess the ability to perceive pain, pressure, temperature, position, equilibrium and movement. A student must be able to respond promptly to urgent situations that may occur during clinical training activities and must not hinder the ability of other members of the health care team to provide prompt treatment and care to patients. Students are not permitted take substances that have the potential to slow their reaction time in providing prompt treatment and care to patients. Observatio nal Ability The student is expected to be able to observe the patient holistically to accurately assess any health/ illness alterations. These include the ability to make accurate visual and acoustic observations and interpret them in the context of labora tory studies, medication administration, and patient care activities. Inherent in this observation process is the functional use of the senses and sufficient motor capability to carry out the necessary assessment activities. 12 Communication The student is e xpected to be able to effectively communicate and receive communication, both verbally and nonverbally and to translate this information to others. This requires the ability to see, speak, hear, read, write, and effectively utilize the English language** . A candidate must be able to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes written and o ral communication to patients, families, and members of the health care team. **English as a Second Language students will follow the University ESL policy . Motor Ability The student is expected to be able to perform gross and fine motor movements required to provide holistic nursing care including the ability to perform inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation, and other diagnostic maneuvers as well as gross motor skills such as turning, transferring, transporting, and exercising the patients/client s. The student is expected to have the psychomotor skills necessary to perform or assist with procedures, treatments, administration of medications, and emergency interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of parenteral medicat ion, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, and the suctioning of obstructed airways. A student must also be able to protect the patient in emergency situations such as fire. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movement s, equilibrium and functional use of the sense of touch, hearing, and vision. The student is expected to be able to maintain consciousness and equilibrium, and have the physical strength and stamina to perform satisfactorily in clinical nursing experiences . Additionally, due to patient safety concerns, students are not permitted to wear immobilizing devices in the clinical area . Intellectual - Conceptual Ability The student is expected to have the ability to develop and refine problem -solving skills and dem onstrate the ability to establish plans of care and set priorities. This includes the ability to measure, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthesize objective as well as subjective data in a timely manner and make decisions that reflect consistent and tho ughtful deliberation of the appropriate data. The student is expected to be able to listen, speak, read, write, reason, and perform mathematical functions at a level, which allows the student to process, and understand the materials presented in both a wri tten and a verbal format throughout their course of study. Behavioral/Social Attributes The student is expected to demonstrate compassion, integrity, motivation, accountability, effective interpersonal skills, and concern for others. The student is expect ed to have the emotional stability to fully utilize their intellectual abilities, exercise sound judgment, complete assessment and intervention activities, and develop sensitive interpersonal relationships with patients/clients, families, and others resp onsible for health care. Students are expected to have the ability to establish rapport and maintain sensitive and confidential interpersonal relationships with individuals, families, and groups from diverse social, emotional, cultural, and intellectual ba ckgrounds. The student is expected to have the flexibility to function effectively under stress, including emergency situation; the individual is expected to be able to learn to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, arrive on time and mee t the demands for timely performance of duties, accept and integrate constructive criticism given in classroom and clinical setting and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. (Adapted with perm ission from Creighton University School of Nursing Safety and Technical Standards Policy and Procedure, 2021 ) Students requesting accommodation should contact the Duquesne University Office of Disability Services at 412-396-6658 13 Medical Marijuana Students are not permitted to use marijuana during clinical rotations as it is not permitted by the School of Nursing 's clinical partners while students care for patients due to patient safety considerations. It is up to the student 's physician if they elect not to use marijuana as a medical treatment to enter a nursing school in Pennsylvania. The School of Nursing does not recommend any medical treatments for students. Students will need medical clearance by their physician indicating that they meet the technical s tandards as outlined in this section of the handbook without marijuana use. Any student who receives a positive drug test for marijuana will not be permitted to attend the clinical portion of the program. Confidentiality The handling of all records and sub ject information for all evaluations will be strictly confidential and revealed only to those required to have access. Any breach of confidentiality will be considered serious and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. Misrepresentation Any identif ied misrepresentation, falsification, or material omission of information from an applicant discovered during the admission process or student during ongoing enrollment when clinical course eligibility if deliberated, may result in exclusion from clinica l activities, or immediate dismissal. Technical Standards are posted on the admissions page of the School of Nursing website. All requests for accommodation by applicants or current students are to be directed to the University Office of Disability Service s. In certain circumstances, the Assistant Dean for Recruitment and Enrollment Management, Associate Dean for Student Affairs, Undergraduate Program Chair, or Clinical Coordinator may be consulted, as needed, by the Office of Disability Services to determi ne reasonable accommodation for clinical practice. A student wishing to appeal a decision regarding accommodation should do so, in writing, to the Dean within fourteen (14) working days from the student 's receipt of notice of the decision. The decision of the Dean on appeal shall be final. ACADEMIC CALENDAR The academic year at Duquesne University is based on 3 semesters, fall, spring and summer, which run approximately as follows: Fall semester runs from late August to mid -December Spring semester runs fro m early January to early May Summer semester runs from mid -May to late July/early August For exact dates or changes to the academic calendar , students are referred to the published University Academic Calendar (http://www.duq.edu/academics/academic -calendar ) For dates of final exams and HESI exams in the School of Nursing, students will receive notification from the School of Nursing. Students are expected to take School of Nursing final and HESI exams when scheduled by the School of Nursing, which may vary from the University Academic Calendar. Additional testing policies can be found starting on page 18 of the handbook. 14 ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT Every student attending the University is assigne d a Student Success Coach . The School of Nursing Student Success Coach es are: Stude nts are to consult with their Student Success Coach prior to registering each semester as well as to discuss any questions or concerns related to your progression at any time during the semester. To make an appointment, students must use the Starfish sched uling tool . DUQUESNE ONLINE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION (DORI) DORI is a portal through which you can access Duquesne University information, including the ability to view and print your course schedule, your financial aid package, your tuition bill and a mu ltitude of other resources and services. DORI also serves as your access to CANVAS . Another important resource is the Nursing Student Intranet Site, which is located by clicking on the Index icon at the top of the page, then look for the \"Schools in DORI \" section in the middle of the page and click on Nursing. This site functions as a \"bulletin board \" as well as a resource for a variety of information including announcements, student handbooks and policies, job opportunities, scholarship information, etc. REGISTRA TION OF CLASSES Due to the complexities of ensuring students are achieving all of the required theory and clinical components of the nursing curriculum, the Office for Student Affairs will register all students for the nursing courses associated wit h their program. Students are required to take the nursing courses as assigned by the Office for Student Affairs to ensure that all students have the opportunity to complete their required nursing coursework. The Office for Student Affairs will complete re gistration of Nursing courses prior to the first day students are eligible to register for courses, so that students have the opportunity to register core curriculum, science courses and labs, and elective courses that meet their scheduling needs. As per U niversity policy, students are not permitted to audit required courses for their degree program. Therefore, students are expected to attend the course/section for which they are registered. Non -compliance to this policy may result in disciplinary action an d may incur additional tuition and fees from the University. Students who have completed 15 or more Duquesne credits may register using Self Service Banner ( SSB). First semester Freshmen and ESL students may not use SSB for Registration. Once registration has been completed on SSB, the Student Success Coach will receive notification of your registration within 24 hours. You will be contacted by your Student Success Coach ONLY if there is a problem with your class schedule and will be advised regarding how to revise your schedule. PRINT A COPY of your schedule using SSB. Final course grades can be obtained via SSB at the end of each semester. You will NOT receive a paper grade report.

CHANGE OF SCHEDULE AND ADD/DROP Students requiring a change of class schedule (to change class times or to add/drop a class), are permi tted to do so during the periods of Pre -registration, Final Registration, and Late Registration. Change of class schedule is not permitted after the Latest Date for Change of Schedule as announced in the Academic Calendar published on DORI. All schedule ch anges must be approved by the Student Success Coach . Schedule changes during Late Registration must also have the signature of the faculty members whose classes are being dropped or added. Courses dropped after the deadline for making schedule changes are classified as course withdrawals. Complete withdrawal refunds are based on dates published in the academic calendar. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Under certain circumstances, students may be permitted to take a temporary Leave of Absence. Three types of approved tempo rary leave exist: medical, military, and personal. A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted based upon a recommendation from a certified, licensed health care provider who is not a close family member. Students request a Medical Leave of Absence by submit ting to the academic dean, or the dean's designee, a written request accompanied by a corroborating recommendation from said health care provider. Students who are registered at the time they seek a Medical Leave of Absence should consult the Undergraduat e Catalog for the required procedure to file either a Notice of Complete Withdrawal or to file for a Medical Withdrawal depending on student circumstances and preferences. A Military Leave of Absence is granted based upon a student's call to duty or train ing in the Armed Services or a Reserve Component. Students who are called to active duty or military training of any type, whether voluntary or involuntary, may request a Military Leave of Absence by submitting to the dean, or the dean's designee, a writte n request along with copies of their official military orders. Students who are registered at the time they seek a Military Leave of Absence should consult the Undergraduate Catalog for the required 16 procedure to file a Notice of Complete Withdrawal for Act ive Duty Military Personnel. Requests for military withdrawal should be filed prior to departure but must be filed no later than 60 days following the termination of military orders. Spouses of service members called to active duty may also request a Milit ary Leave of Absence and should follow the same procedure to request the leave. A Personal Leave of Absence may be granted based upon any grounds other than medical reasons or military service. A maximum of three semesters of Personal Leave may be granted. A request should be filed at the time it is determined the leave is needed, since it will not be granted retroactively. Students who are registered at the time they seek a Personal Leave of Absence should consult the Undergraduate Catalog for the required procedure to file a Notice of Complete Withdrawal for the term. Requests for a Personal Leave of Absence are submitted to the designated school committee or office, which forwards a recommendation to the school Dean. The Dean makes the decision about the leave, and that decision is final. Approved Medical, Military, and Personal Leaves of Absences do not count toward a student's statute of limitations. Students granted an approved Leave of Absence will have their time -to-degree extended by the amount of ti me granted by the leave. Readmission of a student following an approved Leave of Absence is granted automatically if the student was in good standing when the Leave was granted. During an approved Leave, students are not enrolled nor do they have an active student status. Students taking an approved Leave of Absence should make every effort to resolve any grades of incomplete that are due to convert to failing grades prior to beginning a leave or should negotiate with the course instructor(s) a time line fo r the completion of remaining work. Any extensions of the I -to-F deadline must be approved by the course instructor(s) and communicated to the University Registrar. Financial aid, insurance, and/or other funding may be affected by federal law and/or univer sity policy when taking an Approved Leave of Absence and should be investigated prior to leave. International students should consult with the Center for Global Engagement before requesting a leave of absence, since visa status and other related issues cou ld be affected . CREDIT OVERLOAD Credit overload is considered a class schedule of more than 18 credits in the fall or spring semester for traditional and BME/BSN nursing students. Nursing students must have a minimum cumulative quality point average (QPA) of 2.75 and obtain permission from the Chair of the Undergraduate Program in order to take credit overload in any semester. Second Degree students are exempt from this policy . Students who wish to register for credit overload in any semester should submit a letter of request, including reasons for the request, to the Chair of the Undergraduate Program who will review the request and make a decision to grant or deny the request . CANCELLATION OF CLASSES/CLINICAL Announcements about class cancellations due to inclement weather or emergencies are made on all local radio and television station cancellation reports. Students will be asked to check the School of Nursing web site homepage for clinical cancellations due to inclement weather or regional emergency. De cisions to cancel clinical will be made by 5 a.m. When the University delays the opening of campus due to inclement weather nursing classroom courses will resume the time the campus is opened. For example, if the University closes campus until 10 a.m. and a nursing course is scheduled from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., the class will resume at 10 a.m. and continue until the scheduled end time at 11 a.m. 17 UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION Although it is possible to update an address in Self Service Banner, it is the re sponsibility of the student to keep the Office for Student Affairs informed of any change in name, address, telephone, or email address. The optimal time to do this is at pre -registration. However, it is the responsibility of the student to verify that the Registrar 's office has made the appropriate changes. If personal contact information changes at any other time, students are to contact the Registrar 's Office and the Office for Student Affairs promptly .18 ACCOMMODATIONS, TESTING INFORMATION, ATTENDANCE & OTHER ACADEMIC POLICIES 19 ACCOMMODATIONS AND TESTING INFORMATION ADA ACCO MMODATIONS Students requesting academic accommodations must register with the Office of Disability Services. This request must be made each term while the student is enrolled at Duquesne University. University policies surrounding academic accommodations can be found here: https://www.duq.edu/life and services at Duquesne University need to present a testing accommodation form to faculty before accommodations can be made. Letters of Accommodations are issued by the University Office of Disability Services directly to faculty via Starfish . TEST PROCTORING PROTOCOL Faculty has the responsibility and obligation to provide a secure testing environment that ensures fairness for all students and supports academic honesty and integrity. Faculty must be empowered to manage the testing area assign ed for the test, the students ' behaviors, and materials used to take or administer the test. The following are some best practice guidelines for proctoring student test taking in undergraduate nursing: Test Materials 1. Faculty may use methods of varying either content and/or physical make up of a test to create such variance that may have prophylactic value against student cheating. 2. Faculty may use varying methods of test distribution and collection to authenticate the test taker. 3. Students must retu rn all test materials to the proctor or designee before retrieving any personal materials. 4. Faculty can invoke various methods of establishing unique identifiers to validate students ' work as authentic. Student Seating 1. Faculty reserves the right to arrange seats in the testing area. 2. Faculty reserves the right to assign students their seats for test taking. 3. Faculty reserves the right to move students during a test, if they suspect that academic integrity has been compromised. When a faculty memb er asks that a student move their seating during a test, this should not be construed as an accusation that the student(s) was cheating. Students ' Belongings and Test Aids 1. Faculty will identify what test aids are to be used for both test taking executi on, (e.g. pencil, computer) and content support (e.g. calculator). Use of any unauthorized aid will result in a zero for the test, and/or an Academic Integrity Violation. 2. Duquesne University makes every reasonable effort to provide an environment condu cive to testing. However, the university cannot guarantee a distraction -free testing environment. Students are permitted to use foam or rubber earplugs during testing , must notify and show the proctor all ear pieces prior to usage . Audio devices of any ki nd are not permitted as substitutions for earplugs. It is the responsibility of the student to bring earplugs to the testing environment 3. Students must place all personal belongings in a designated area established by the proctor and not to access the se belongings until all test materials have been turned into the proctor, unless explicit permission has been given by the proctor. Any unauthorized access of personal belongings will result 20 in a zero for the test and/or an Academic Integrity Violation. 4. All electronic equipment taken into the testing area must be silenced and placed in the front of the room (this could include timepieces if such timepiece is distracting). Students are not permitted to wear any type of smart device during an exam. Devic es include but are not limited to Bluetooth Ear Buds, Apple Watch, smart watch or another wearable smart device. 5. Faculty reserves the right to ask students to remove non -essential clothing (e.g. hat or scarf,) if they suspect that it compromises academi c honesty, and to place such item(s) in the front of the room. Remote Testing Protocols The online testing environment should mimic the \"in class \" testing environment, and must conform to the following: Testing Area: Sit at a clean desk or clean table (n ot on a bed or couch) Lighting in the room must be bright enough to be considered \"daylight \" quality. Overhead lighting is preferred; however, if overhead is not possible, the source of light should not be behind you Be sure the desk or table is cleared of all other materials. This means the removal of all books, papers, notebooks, calculators, etc. unless specifically permitted in posted guidelines for that particular examination No writing visible on desk or on walls The following should not be on your desk or used during your exam unless specifically allowed for that examination: o Excel o Word o PowerPoint o Textbooks o Websites o Calculators o Pen and/or Paper Close all other programs and/or windows on the testing computer prior to logging into the proctored test environment Do not have a radio or the television playing in the background Do not talk to anyone else. No communicating with others by any means No other persons except the test taker should be permitted to enter the room during testing For the 360 -degre e Exam Environment: View process prior to each exam, it is permissible for a student to use a mirror to show the testing environment behind, and on the desktop in front of, the computer screen (including above and on the floor in front of the student) rat her than physically moving a laptop or desktop camera. (Show the camera the back of the mirror before you start.) Behavior: Dress as if in a public setting You must not leave the room during the testing period at any time, unless specifically permitted in posted guidelines for that particular examination. You must not take the computer into another room to finish testing. The exam must be completed in the same room in which the \"Exam Environment View \" is completed. No use of headsets, ear plugs (or similar audio devices) are permitted 21 Do not use a phone for any reason. The only exception is to contact support or your instructor in the event of a technical issue . o Students are not permitted to take pictures of the exam, rationale, or exam review. Policy Violat ion Consequences : 1. There are three potential status levels to exam comments and exam records - Suspicious, Rules Violation, or Clean : a. Suspicious - occurs when the activity directly compromises exam integrity (i.e. cheating) b. Rules Violation - occur s when a rule is broken, but the activity does not impact exam integrity (i.e. playing music) c. Clean - is used when there are no activities that break any exam rules 2. Course faculty will review all exam comments and determine the consequences of the v iolation based upon Duquesne University 's Academic Integrity Policy. 3. Students will be notified by the course faculty of the infraction and the consequences. Test Ending Protocol 1. When the proctor signals that test time is over, students must cease wri ting of any kind (or typing /clicking if using an electronic testing device). If a student continues marking a test, the student could receive a zero and/or an Academic Integrity Violation. 2. Faculty can invoke various methods of establishing unique identi fiers to validate students ' work as authentic. Dealing with Transgressions 1. If the faculty proctor suspects that there has been a violation of academic honesty by a student or group of students, they reserve the right to act in ways that confirm or negat e such acts. These acts may include, among others: a. Ask a student to move their seat or move to another seating area. b. Ask a student to focus their eyes on test materials. c. Ask a student to produce a \"cheating source, \" especially if concealed. d. Ask a student(s) to stop taking a test; collect the test materials. 2. If a student alerts the faculty proctor that another student or group of students are cheating, the faculty member may act in ways that confirm or negate such acts and are delineated abov e. 3. Such acts should not immediately be construed that the student(s) is in fact cheating, but that the faculty member must undertake the appropriate due diligence to ensure academic honesty during test taking. 4. Under no circumstances are students to t ake a photograph of their exam materials during the examination or during the review of the examination with their cell phone, iPad, or any other electronic device. Sanctions Faculty who find students in violation of clear directives related to ensuring the academic integrity of the test taking environment and test taking procedures will result in an academic integrity action and/or an Academic Integrity Violation. Testing Issues Any issue of concern related to testing conditions must be brought to the im mediate attention of the test proctor at the time of the test. The student must notify the course faculty of the issue of concern within 24 hours of the testing experience. The university cannot guarantee a distraction -free environment, but every 22 effort wi ll be made to provide a testing environment conducive to test -taking. REVIEW OF TESTING ITEMS Students are permitted to review quizzes, midterm and final exams with the exception of the HESI examinations . The method for review is determined by the individu al course faculty. Requests to review test items must be made within two weeks of posting of the grade. Requests made after this time may not be considered. Students are not permitted to duplicate or take a screen capture/photograph of the examination mate rials during the review. Students are able to review the rationales immediately after submitting the examination before exiting the secure, locked -down application for non -Exit HESI Examinations. For HESI exams given in eight -week courses, students taking a HESI during term one will receive access to remediation packets for their HESI exam at the end of the full semester. Specific test items/questions are not permitted to be reviewed on any HESI exam. Item rationales and individualized student strengths and opportunity reports are available. EXAMINATIONS AND QUIZZES Students are required to take all examinations and quizzes on the scheduled date. In the extreme, extenuating event that a make -up exam is required, the faculty member will determine the date, t ime, location, and format of the make -up exam. If a student misses both the regularly scheduled exam and the make -up exam, the student will earn a grade of zero for that exam. The student should be aware that as the number of students taking the make -up ex am is typically very small, no statistical inferences can be drawn, and therefore, no numerical adjustment will be applied. Additionally, if a student who is not feeling well elects to sit for an exam, the student 's exam effort cannot be withdrawn . Further more, once the exam containing the exam questions is accepted by the student, the exam effort is considered to have begun. Vacations and social events are not considered to be excused absences. Students are advised not to make any personal or travel plans, including job interviews until all course requirements have been met. Failure to contact a faculty member prior to a student 's absence for an examination or quiz (without a documented emergency) is considered a no call, no show and a grade of 0 will be gi ven for the examination or quiz. Faculty reserve the right to provide an alternate make -up exam for any student with a pre -approved authorization testing outside of the time frame or a regularly scheduled course exam. While content tested would not chang e, the format of the exam may change. FINAL EXAM CONFLICT POLICY Students are responsible for reviewing their own final exam schedule and determining if there may be a conflict with their final exams. If a student identifies a conflict they are to notify the Administrative Assistant for Undergraduate Programs at least two weeks prior to the final exam period. The School of Nursing will move the nursing exam for any direct conflicts (exact or overlapping day AND time), if a student has an EXIT HESI and ano ther final exam scheduled for the same day, or if a student has 3 or more final exams in one day. BSN CLASSROOM ATTENDANCE POLICY Regular and punctual attendance at all classes is mandatory in order for you to have the knowledge to provide safe patient c are. All students are required to notify the faculty member of an absence prior to the start of class they will be absent from. This notification must briefly explain the reason for the absence and must be done via email or by leaving a message with the ti me and date on the faculty member's Duquesne University voice mail. If a student misses an in -class assignment or unannounced quiz, and did not notify the faculty 23 member prior to the class, they will not be allowed to make up the assignment or quiz unless there are extenuating circumstances acceptable to the faculty member. If the student did contact the faculty member prior to a class with an in -class assignment or quiz, it is the faculty member's discretion to allow the student to retake the quiz or submi t the assignment missed. A student's late arrival, early departure, or lack of preparation for class may be counted by the faculty member as an absence. Students will be asked to verify their attendance as per the faculty member. Students may only verify attendance for themselves, verifying attendance for someone that is not in attendance (sending sign -in codes, or signing in for a peer, etc.) will result in disciplinary action up to and including failure of the course. Class absences that are not excused by the faculty member may affect the student's final course grade. Students may not have more than 2 unexcused absences for a full semester class and 1 unexcused absence for half semester (term). Failure to adhere to this will result in a drop in a full letter grade (Example: If you have a B in the class and miss more than 2 classes your grade will decrease to a C, which may lead to a course failure). Six unexcused absences will result in failure of the course. Classes will not be recorded by faculty for students with excused or unexcused absences. Vacations and social events are not considered to be excused absences. Students are advised not to make any personal or travel plans, including job interviews until all course requirements have been met. If synchronous class meetings are scheduled for on -line courses, all students are expected to attend these meetings as assigned. Students are required to notify course faculty of any absence from a synchronized class prior to the start of the class. This notif ication must briefly explain the reason for the absence and must be done via e -mail or by leaving a message with the time and date on the faculty member's Duquesne University voicemail. The faculty member has the freedom to require students who are late to wait until a scheduled break in the class before allowing them to enter the classroom. Lateness to class that is not excused by the faculty member may affect the student's final course grade. If a student is late to class, it is at the faculty member's discretion whether or not to let the student sign the attendance sheet, take a quiz, or complete an in -class assignment. The above policy also applies to students taking classes in either a Hy -Flex, hybrid, or distance learning course. Clinical Attenda nce Attendance for clinical days is mandatory. Clinical tardiness or absence is required to be made up during the scheduled clinical make up. Students who miss clinical days will pay a non -refundable fee of $100 per day, per course when there is more than one missed clinical day within the semester. Students are required to attend clinical practicum for the total number of hours identified for each practicum course. Students who miss 25% or more of clinical will fail the course. A medical excuse is required in instances of injury or illness that extends beyond one missed clinical day. Each student is expected to arrive on the assigned clinical unit as per the time established by the clinical faculty member for the specified hours for the clinical day. The fa culty member has the authority to deny the student the clinical day depending on the amount of time they are late. Additionally, repeated episodes of lateness may result in required attendance at the clinical makeup day and a violation of professional con duct. At the request of the Clinical faculty member, students may benefit from additional clinical time. This clinical time will be scheduled during designated clinical make - up sections. 24 EXCUSED ABSENCES In addition to the University -approved co -curricul ar activities (e.g. meaningful research and/or presentations at academic and professional associations and meetings) and University -sponsored extracurricular activities (e.g. ROTC , Tamburitzans, and varsity athletics) the School of Nursing also recognizes responsibilities of students who are members of the United States Armed Services. Although the School of Nursing supports student involvement in inter -collegiate athletics , ROTC, and the Tamburitzens, the student must recognize the academic nature of a uni versity and a professional education such as nursing. Therefore, it is the student 's responsibility to determine conflicts of classroom or clinical experience with athletic, ROTC, or Tamburitzen events and to plan with the professor to make up the work missed prior to the actual event. Student athletes , ROTC, and Tamburitzens should make arrangements with their Student Success Coach for specific needs prior to pre -registration each semester. If a student has to miss class or clinical due to military orders , the student is required to submit a copy of the orders to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. Once the orders are submitted to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs, they will notify all appropriate course faculty. The student can then work with cours e faculty to make appropriate arrangements. The orders can be redacted as appropriate, but must show the student's name and the dates of military obligation. Vacations and social events are not considered to be excused absences. Students are advised not to make any personal or travel plans, including job interviews, until all course requirements have been met. RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES Embodying a culturally and spiritually diverse community, Duquesne University recognizes that on the occasion of important o r solemn religious days, certain of its members will observe practices that preclude them from attending to their regular duties whether as faculty members or students. On the occasion of such days, it is equally important for all who do not share in these same practices to accommodate their colleagues and peers. Duquesne University supports an environment that respects the religious observances of others, and is committed to make every reasonable effort to accommodate the religious observances of faculty members, students, and staff. The nursing program recognizes that there are other holidays, both religious and secular, which are of importance to some students and faculty. Such occasions include, but are not limited to, Sukkoth, the last two days of Passo ver, Ramadan, Shavuot, Shemini Atzerat, and Simchat Torah, Muslim New Year, and the Islamic holidays, Eid Al -Fitr and Eid Al -Adha. Students who observe such holidays must inform their faculty within the first two weeks of each semester of their intent to o bserve the holiday so that alternative arrangements convenient to both students and faculty can be made at the earliest opportunity. Students who make such arrangements will not be required to attend classes or take examinations on the designated days, and faculty will provide reasonable opportunities for such students to make up missed work and examinations. If an examination is given on the first-class day after one of these holidays, it must not cover material introduced in class on that holiday. Late af ternoon exams should be avoided on these days. Students who miss clinical due to religious observances will not be charged a clinical absence fee for missed. However, all missed clinical hours must be made up. LOST ASSIGNMENTS It is the student 's responsib ility to see that the faculty member receives all work/assignments submitted, including online submissions such as in CANVAS by the designated deadline . Students should always make and keep a copy of all papers/assignments submitted. 25 TIME LIMIT FOR DEGREE COMPLETION Degree requirements must be completed within 6 years after initial enrollment. A student 's academic record is continually evaluated in terms of curriculum and changes that may occur over their enrollment period and the student is advised of any modifications required for graduation. Additional courses may be required. A student with extraordinary circumstances may apply for an extension of this time limit. A written request must be submitted to the Academic Standing Committee for extension of the statute of limitations should include a reason for the request, and a plan and proposed date for completion of the degree. The student will be notified in writing by the Academic Standing Committee of the decision. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY As a stud ent or faculty member at Duquesne University School of Nursing (DUSON), students may have access to \"Confidential Information \". The purpose of this agreement is to help students understand their obligations regarding confidential information. Confidential information is protected by Federal and State laws, regulations, including HIPAA, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations standards, and strict University policies. The intent of these laws, regulations, standards and policies is to ensure that confidential information will remain confidential - that is, that it will be used only as necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it is needed. DUSON has its own policies that reflect these regulations as well as best ethical standards . Additionally, students must also know and abide by the policies of all clinical sites you attend during your time as a DUSON student or faculty member. Students are required to conduct themselves in strict conformance with applicable laws, standards, regulations and University polices governing confidential information. Anyone who violates any of these rules will be subject to discipline, which might include, but is not limited to, expulsion from DUSON. In addition, violation of these rules may lead to c ivil and criminal penalties under HIPAA and potentially other legal action. Students may have access to confidential information, which includes, but is not limited to, information relating to: 1) medical record information (includes all patient data, conv ersations, admitting information, demographic information and patient financial information); and 2) Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by HIPAA. As a DUSON Student: You will only use confidential information/data as needed/necessary to perform your duties as a student or faculty member affiliated with DUSON. You will not in any way divulge, copy, release, sell, loan, review, alter or destroy any confidential information/data except as properly authorized within the scope of your professional act ivities affiliated with DUSON. You will not misuse confidential information/data. You understand that your obligations under this Agreement will continue after your affiliation with the DUSON terminates. You are responsible for knowing and abiding to all confidentiality policies in specific clinical setting where you engage in clinical coursework, rotations, and preceptorships. You must remove ALL patient identifying information from all class assignments. You must ensure that laptops, tablets, iPads or an y other electronic devices used at clinical facilities are password protected. DUSON may take disciplinary action against you up to and including termination or expulsion in the event you violate this Confidentiality Agreement. Clinical sites may refuse cl inical placement of students who violate patient confidentiality. 26 TRANSPORTATION Students are responsible for their own transportation to and from the various clinical facilities or community sites utilized throughout the program. Parking expenses at these facilities vary and are at the expense of the student. Students MUST HAVE access to transportation for clinical experiences, however, most clinical sites can be accessed via public transportation. Students can also use Zip Cars that are available on campu s, taxi services , car services, or carpool. Questions about public transportation can be answered by calling the Port Authority Transit Office or going to their website. Bus schedules for all areas of the city and county are also available in the Commuter Lounge in the Student Union. STUDENT EMPLOYMENT/UNIFORM USE Some students choose to work during the academic year on weekends or during summer months. You are urged to consider your obligations to your academic program first before making any work commitme nts. Students are not permitted to miss class or clinical due to any work obligations and the School of Nursing will not accommodate work schedules for course registration or clinical placement. Additionally, students are not permitted to work overnight/ni ght shift prior to attending clinical as this practice is unsafe for the student and patient(s). If a student is found to have worked overnight prior to attending clinical, they will face disciplinary sanctions. As mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Nursing, students who work in clinical facilities outside of clinical practicum hours may not represent themselves as nurses or take on responsibilities of registered nurses. Duquesne student uniforms are to be worn ONLY during School of Nursing clinica l experiences. Under NO circumstances is the Duquesne student uniform to be worn for other volunteer or paid employment purposes. Second Degree students are strongly discouraged from working during the Accelerated Second -Degree BSN track due to the academi c rigor and intensity of the curriculum. ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN THE CLASSROOM AND CLINICAL SETTING No personal phone conversations or texting are allowed at any time while in patient/client areas or in the classroom. If the student needs to respond to an em ergency text or phone call during class, the student is asked to leave the classroom and respond as deemed necessary. Use of iPad mini computers (notebooks, etc.) during class shall be restricted to note taking and class -room activities. Use otherwise is d istracting for not only the student involved in the activity but those in the immediate area/vicinity. Students are not permitted to wear earbuds during class, testing, or in a clinical setting. Students are expected to take and use their iPads at clinical . They can be carried in their lab jacket/warm up jacket pocket. Smartphones, iPads, and smartwatches can only be used to provide patient care in the clinical setting.

THE NURSING HONORS PROGRAM The Honors program is a way for traditional BSN stude nts with strong academic potential to focus additional studies in an area of interest significant to nursing, develop an undergraduate thesis with faculty guidance, and gain the necessary scholarly inquiry skills needed for graduate school. Under the direc tion of a Nursing Honors Mentor, students will plan, carry out and write about an honors thesis project. Nursing Honors students will graduate with a diploma and transcript that states \"With Honors. \" The Director of the Honors Program administers the Nursi ng Honors program through the School of Nursing. Students will be invited to apply to the program in the fall of their junior year. Decisions will be made by December 1st of the junior year. The work of the Honors Program takes place in three semesters \u2014 spring of junior year, fall of senior year and spring of senior year. In the first semester, students work with their Nursing Honors Mentor to develop their ideas about their Honors Project. Projects should demonstrate evidence of critical and analytical thi nking related to a clinical problem in nursing and may take the form of either an evidence -based practice project or an original research project. In the first semester, students work with their Nursing Honors Mentor to decide on a topic for the project an d begin to search the literature. The second half of the first semester is when students will submit a proposal of the project for Institutional Review Board approval. During the second semester (fall of senior year), students work with the Nursing Honors Mentor to carry out the project and begin to analyze the collected data. The final semester (Senior Elective - Honors) is when the student writes the Honors Thesis and presents the project at the University Undergraduate Research and Scholarship Symposium. This final course has been designated as a writing intensive course and can serve to satisfy one of the required writing intensive courses necessary to meet graduation requirements.

Students who do not successfully complete all required nursing coursework or who do not achieve a passing grade in UPNS 224 Career Management & Professional Development are not permitted t o progress to UPNS 365 Clinical Immersion Leadership in Professional Nursing. A UPNS 224 Career Management & Professional Development course failure will not count toward BSN Program dismissal. PERFORMANCE IN THE CLINICAL PORTION OF A COURSE As student 's progress through each successive nursing course, they are expected to advance in their level of competency. The student should demonstrate a pattern of progression toward achievement of clinical objectives throughout the course. The student whose performa nce in the clinical experience fails to meet any of the established clinical objectives will be considered unsatisfactory (\"No Pass \") for the clinical component of the course. Any episode of unsatisfactory clinical practice will be documented on a Periodic Evaluation Tool, which the faculty member will write, and the student will sign. The form will include strategies for improvement. A student may be placed on \"Clinical Warning \" for persistent unsatisfactory clinical performance or occurrences of unethical conduct at any time during a course. The student will remain on \"Warning \" until the end of the course. At this time, the faculty involved will determine whether the student 's overall clinical performance has been satisfactory and will then determine the s tudent 's eligibility for removal or non -removal from \"Clinical Warning. \" If a student is not removed from clinical warning, he or she will fail the course. Students who have not met the clinical objectives due to repeated absences are at risk for a clinica l failure. A student who is unable to make up clinical absences prior to the end of the semester will receive an incomplete (I) grade for the course. All clinical make up must be completed prior to the first day of the following semester in order for the s tudent to progress in the program. Every effort will be made to provide the student a clinical makeup experience; however, makeup time is not guaranteed. BSN PROGRAM READMISSION POLICY Any student who is dismissed from the BSN Program may be eligible for r eadmission . The student must notify the Chair of their intention to return to the program. A readmission HESI may be required to test mastery of course content depending on the level of student achievement. If a readmission HESI is required, the student m ust meet the following conditions before returning to the program: The student must achieve a conversion score of 77 on a readmission HESI examination. This readmission HESI examination will test curricular content up to the point of the student 's dismissa l. The student has one (1) opportunity to achieve a conversion score of 77 on the readmission HESI examination. The student is permitted and encouraged to use program and university resources to meet this standard. The student is required to pass the HESI readmission examination before the end of the last day of classes in the term following dismissal. The student is not permitted to take any additional nursing courses until the HESI readmission 39 requirement has been met. If readmitted, the student may fol low a decelerated plan of study as determined by the Student Success Coach and the Chair of Undergraduate Program. Any additional course failure will result in program dismissal. Furthermore, the student will not be permitted to apply for readmission to an y Duquesne University pre -licensure BSN program . If a student does not achieve a conversion score of 77 on a readmission HESI examination, the dismissal will be upheld. The student cannot continue in Nursing courses. The dates for the readmission HESI will be determined by the School of Nursing. The student will be sent information about the details of the testing from the Chair of Undergraduate Program. If a HESI readmission examination is not applicable to the readmission process, the student will be re quired to work closely with their Student Success Coach and faculty to formulate and execute an individualized plan of success. This plan may include but is not limited to the following: Individual sessions with the success coach Use of NAP tutors Campus s upport services Develop a personal plan for academic improvement with their Student Success Coach and Chair of Undergraduate Program by a date indicated Schedule regular meetings with their Student Success Coach and Chair of the Undergraduate Program to di scuss progression to goal achievement as stated on personal plan The student will follow a revised plan of study as determined by the Student Success Coach and the Chair of Undergraduate Program. Any additional course failure will result in program dismiss al. Furthermore, the student will not be permitted to apply for readmission to any Duquesne University pre -licensure BSN program . Additionally, requests for readmission from students who are dismissed for unsafe practice or unethical behavior will be revie wed by the Academic Standing Committee. If readmission is approved the student will follow the recommendations set forth by the committee and the same conditions listed above will apply. COURSE OR PROGRAM WITHDRAWAL Nursing students are expected to comply with the University Policy regarding withdrawal from a course as indicated in the current edition of the Duquesne University Undergraduate Catalog. First semester freshmen may withdraw from courses with the approval of the Student Success Coach up to the d ay before final examinations begin and receive a grade of \"W\". Students other than first semester freshmen wishing to withdraw from a course may do so with the approval of the Student Success Coach up to the date announced in the academic calendar for wit hdrawal with a \"W\" grade. If a student wishes to withdraw from a course after the date announced in the academic calendar, the student must seek approval of the Chair of the Undergraduate Program. A student who is not granted approval of the request and wi thdraws unofficially from the course will receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. Tuition refunds are in accordance with the university fee schedule published in the Academic Calendar each semester. For a student who wishes to withdraw from a course up to the date permitted by this policy: Following discussion of the proposed withdrawal with the Student Success Coach , the student must complete the fillable PDF and email it to the student success coach using their DUQ email account. Receipt from the student 's DUQ account constitutes the student's acknowledgement and permission to process the request For a student other than first semester freshman who wishes to withdraw from a course after the date announced in the university calendar: 40 The student must submi t a letter of request to the Chair of the Undergraduate Program. The student will be informed in writing of the decision. If approval is granted, the student follows the procedure above. Written notification of the intent to withdraw from the semester rece ived after the add/drop period is subject to the University's official withdrawal policy which includes varying levels of financial obligation, depending on the formal date of withdrawal. Even though absences from classes may be observed and recorded, a s tudent is considered enrolled and in attendance until formal (written) withdrawal forms are filed in the Registrar's office. No refunds are issued for course withdrawals. All withdrawals result in a final grade of \"W.\" WITHDRAWAL FROM UNIVERSITY/TERMINATIO N OF ATTENDANCE If a student is registered for class(es) but will not be attending, written notification of intention not to attend must be submitted to the Student Success Coach before the first day of class. Students who do not officially withdraw from class or from semester enrollment are subject to university policy, which include s financial consequence s. MEDICAL WITHDRAWAL Definition Duquesne University students may apply for a medical withdrawal due to extreme illness, serious injury, or extended ho spitalization. Because a medical withdrawal affects academic progress, students are encouraged to consider other options that might enable them to remain enrolled (such as \"I\" or \"incomplete \" grades that would enable them to complete coursework after the end of the semester). Students should consult their Student Success Coach , the Office of Student Financial Aid, the Office of International Program and other offices as appropriate. Medical withdrawals constitute complete withdrawals and result in final grades of \"W\" in all courses on the transcript for the semester in question. The University does not grant partial medical withdrawals (i.e., requests to withdraw from some courses but not others). The only exception is if the student has already completed one or more accelerated (i.e., 8 -week) courses, in which case the grades earned in all such courses remain on the student 's transcript and the associated costs are included when calculating the student 's account balance; the medical withdrawal results in final grades of \"W\" for all other courses on the transcript. Withdrawal Except in extraordinary circumstances, students must submit a written request for a medical withdrawal to their Student Success Coach no later than the last day of classes for the seme ster to which the withdrawal would apply. The university does not grant withdrawals for prior semesters. The school or college will then submit to the Registrar (a) either a Notice of Complete Withdrawal form (withdrawing the student from all courses) or a Request for Student Schedule Change form (withdrawing the student from courses still in progress when one or more accelerated courses has already been graded) and (b) authorization from the student to process the withdrawal. This authorization may be eith er in hard copy with the student 's signature or in the form of an email sent from the student 's Duquesne University email account. Students are considered to be enrolled unless and until they submit written notification of their withdrawal. The withdrawa l is effective on the date when notification is received, which constitutes the student 's last day of attendance. Medical Documentation To qualify for a medical withdrawal, the student must also submit to the dean of their school or college (a) a descrip tion of the medical circumstances and (b) documentation from a licensed health care 41 provider that addresses those circumstances and supports withdrawal as medically appropriate. After verifying the illness, injury, or hospitalization, the dean submits the documentation to the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs for review and a final decision. If the student is unable to initiate the medical withdrawal process, the student 's school or college office, parent, spouse, partner, or other designee ma y do so on their behalf. In such cases, the incapacitation of the student must be documented or a formal power of attorney provided. Consequences The approval of a medical withdrawal results in the immediate assignment of a final grade of \"W\" for the relev ant courses on the transcript and an automatic review of the whether the student may qualify for a partial tuition refund (see \"Refunds \" below). Refunds The Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs advises the Vice President for Management and Busin ess whether any tuition for the current semester should be refunded to a student whose request for a medical withdrawal is approved. Based upon the effective date of the medical withdrawal (see under \"Withdrawal \" above), refunds will be calculated by the offices of Student Accounts and Financial Aid as follows: For the first four weeks of the semester, refunds follow the standard refund policy (see the \"Total Withdrawal \" deadlines listed in the Academic Calendar). From the fifth through the eighth week of the semester, refunds will be limited to 20%. From the ninth through the twelfth week, refunds will be limited to 10% and any already graded accelerated courses will be billed at the full per -credit rate. After the twelfth week, no refunds will be due. Any reduction to Title IV funds will be determined using the Federal Financial Aid pro rata refund policy. University gift aid and all other non -Title IV financial aid will be reduced by the same percentage as the tuition reduction and returned to the source of the funds in question. Laboratory fees, University fees, housing costs and fees, refunds prior to withdrawal, and any other fees already committed by the University on behalf of the student will not be refunded. Refunds due as the result of a medical wi thdrawal will be paid to the student within ten business days after the credit balance is created for the semester for which the medical withdrawal was approved. Process Outline Student submits request for medical withdrawal to Student Success Coach School submits Notice of Complete Withdrawal or Request fo r Student Schedule Change with student 's written authorization to Registrar Student submits written description of medical circumstances and documentation from a health care provider to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs The Associate Dean of Student Affairs submits case file to Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Provost reviews case and renders decision Provost notifies the Vice President for Management and Business of any refund due 42 COST S ASSOCIATED WITH REPEATING COURSEWORK The student is responsible for all costs associated with repeating a course. This may include but is not limited to: Tuition Fees Clinical or health requirement renewals HESI examinations ACADEMIC APPEAL PROCESS The School of Nursing is committed to ensuring that all student appeals, grievances and complaints are handled in a systematic way. The following guidelines direct students on the appropriate steps to take if an issue arises. Students should first seek reso lution with the immediate parties involved; for course issues, that means the faculty instructor. If informal efforts are unsuccessful, students should proceed through the appropriate channels. The process for final grade appeals follows the steps listed b elow, which follows the policy adopted by Duquesne University. Beyond final grade appeals, other appeals, grievances or complaints should be addressed formally in writing to the instructor. If a student wishes to appeal or grieve beyond the instructor, the next step would be the Chair of the Undergraduate Program, followed by the Dean of the School of Nursing. The decision of the Dean is final. Issues beyond the scope of the academic affairs policies of the School of Nursing should be addressed in accordan ce with Duquesne University student policy. FINAL GRADE APPEAL POLICY Purpose The purpose of this Final Grade Appeal Policy is to establish a clear, fair, and uniform process by which students may contest the final grade assigned to them for a course or ot her degree requirement. Final grades reflect exclusively the academic achievements of students and will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the appropriate academic college/school dean. General Provisions All parties to a final grade appeal are expected to be polite and respectful throughout the process. All documents and proceedings associated with specific final grade appeals shall remain confidential during and after the process. However, by April 30 of each year, t he dean of each college/school shall submit a summary report of formal final grade appeals filed in that college/school during the preceding twelve months to the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, the President of the Faculty Senate, and the President of the Student Government Association. The report shall list how many formal appeals were received and at what level (as defined later in this document) they were resolved. Students may contact the Student Government Association or the office of their college/school's academic dean for assistance in understanding the appeal process. 43 The timeline for the entire appeals processes in this policy may be shortened by the dean if the new timeline is explicit regarding the time allowed at each level and is agreed to in writing by the student filing the appeal and the faculty member responding to the appeal. If a student fails to comply with the procedures or meet the deadlines provided in this policy, the student will be informed that the grade appeal pro cess is terminated. Grounds for Appeal Grade appeals shall be based on problems of process and not on differences in judgment or opinion concerning academic performance. The acceptable grounds for a grade appeal are: An error was made in grade computation . The grade assignment was capricious or arbitrary. That is, the grade assigned was based on criteria other than the student's performance in the course; was based on standards different than those applied to other students registered in the same course at the same time; or constitutes a substantial departure from the published or announced grading standards for the course. This Final Grade Appeal Policy does not address disputed grades resulting from alleged academic integrity violations or complaints of d iscrimination, which fall under other policies of the university . The University's Academic Integrity Policy is available in the University catalogs. The Director of Anti -Discrimination and Compliance may be contacted at (412) 396 -2073 If a student has not been provided accommodations specified as required by the Office of Disability Services, they should contact the Director, Office of Disability Services . First Level: Informal Appeal to the Faculty Member A student who believes that they have grounds for an appeal shall first attempt to resolve the issue informally with the professor. If such an attempt at informal resolution fails, the student may wish to file a formal appeal. The informal appeal may occur at any time before the deadline to file a formal appeal at the Second Level of the process. Second Level: Formal Appeal to the Faculty Member A student who wishes to file a formal appeal shall do so within 10 business days of the day on which classes start for the fall or spring semester immediately foll owing the award of the grade in question. A formal appeal shall be submitted electronically in writing, dated and signed, and headed with the words \"Final Grade Appeal.\" In addition to stating the reason(s) for the appeal, the student may submit evidence a nd written testimony that directly supports the appeal. Via Duquesne email, the student shall submit one copy of these materials to the faculty member and a second copy to the dean of the college/school in which the faculty member holds her or his academic appointment and in which the course was offered. A student who wishes to appear in person for the Second Level appeal must state that in writing as part of the appeal submission. 44 At the Second Level of Appeal the Dean will determine if the appeal meets t he Grounds for Appeal. If it does not, the student and faculty member will be notified and the appeal process terminated. Record of a Formal Appeal Once the student has presented a formal appeal to the faculty member, that document becomes a part of the record of the appeal, which shall be maintained by the dean of the college/school in which the faculty member holds her or his academic appointment and in which the course was offered. The student's formal appeal document shall be presented in its original f orm at all subsequent levels of appeal. Any additional statements by the student or the faculty member, all evidence submitted relevant to the appeal, and all direct and supporting statements also become part of the record of the appeal and shall be produc ed at each level of appeal. At each level of appeal other than the First Level, a written dated decision and accompanying rationale for the decision shall be provided to all affected parties (the student, the faculty member, and any person who has rendered a decision at an earlier level). Right to Appear in Person A student may choose to present her or his appeal in person at each level of appeal and may have an additional person present as an advisor at each level other than the First Level. However, that person may not serve as the student's representative and has no right to speak or otherwise participate in the appeal process. A faculty member to whom a student appeal is presented may choose to respond in person to the student's appeal at the Third Level of the process and may have an additional person present as an advisor. However, that person may not serve as the faculty member's representative and has no right to speak or otherwise participate in the appeal process. Within 5 business days of receiving the student's formal appeal, the faculty member shall prepare a detailed written decision that is responsive to the student's stated reason(s) for the appeal. This decision shall be emailed to the student at their university email address with a copy to t he dean of the college/school in which the faculty member holds her or his academic appointment and in which the course was offered. If the student receives no response from the faculty member within 5 business days or is dissatisfied with the faculty memb er's decision, they may proceed to the Third Level of appeal. Third and Final Level: Appeal to the Dean A student or faculty member who elects to proceed to the Third and Final Level of appeal shall notify in writing the dean of the college/school in whic h the faculty member holds her or his academic appointment and in which the course was offered. A student who wishes to appear in person for the Third Level appeal must state that in writing as part of the appeal submission. The student or faculty member m ust submit this notification within 5 business days following her or his receipt of the external department chair, division head or program director's email. Within 5 business days of receiving the student or the faculty member's notification, the dean shall notify the student, the faculty member and the faculty member's department chair, division head or program director that the appeal has proceeded to the Third and Final Level. The dean shall also ensure that all parties understand that they have right t o appear in person at this level of appeal. 45 Within 5 business days after receiving the appeal, the dean shall thoroughly review the record of the appeal and email a decision about the appeal to the student and the faculty member at their university email addresses. The dean's decision shall respond to the student's stated reason(s) for the appeal and to the faculty member's response, if one was provided to the student. The decision of the dean is final. Final Grade Appeals when the Faculty Member is no lon ger employed by the University In rare circumstances, a student may wish to contest her or his grade in a course taught by a faculty member no longer employed by the University. In such circumstances, a grade may be changed by the Provost and Vice Presiden t for Academic Affairs upon the recommendation of the appropriate dean and department chair or division head.

Introduction An essential element of Duquesne University's mission to educate the mind, the heart, and the spiri t is the University's commitment to maintaining and promoting an atmosphere where knowledge and inquiry are respected and encouraged. At Duquesne, as at other American institutions of higher education, our individual and collective search for truth and und erstanding is founded on the core principle of academic integrity. For Duquesne students and professors alike, academic integrity is essential to our efforts to master existing knowledge, to discover or create new knowledge, and to demonstrate or transmit our knowledge or understanding through academic endeavors like test -taking, writing, and teaching. Academic integrity at Duquesne can be summarized briefly. In its simplest terms, academic integrity is the pursuit of knowledge and understanding in an hon est and forthright manner. This is because intellectual endeavors -on site or online; in the library or the laboratory; in a classroom, a Living -Learning Center, or any off-campus learning environment -can only be conducted in an atmosphere of respect for th e truth, commitment to the unfettered spirit of inquiry, and acknowledgment of the different contributions and perspectives of others. Academic integrity means pursuing truth with true passion while maintaining the humility to recognize and accept that our own understanding may be incomplete or contingent. Academic integrity means acknowledging the contributions of others, specifically and completely, using the conventions for acknowledging sources that are appropriate to particular intellectual traditions or disciplines. Academic integrity means representing others' work accurately and distinguishing clearly our own ideas and insights, and our language, from the work (and wording) of others. Academic integrity means seeking or receiving credit (including gr ades and other measures of accomplishment) only insofar as we have earned it as a result of our own intellectual efforts; it means not taking credit for work that is not our own. Academic integrity means representing ideas and opinions with which we may di sagree in a clear and fair manner, according the same respect to material we may criticize that we would wish for our own work. Academic integrity means taking examinations and completing assessments honestly, and according to directions, so that results a re a true measure of our own attainments. Academic integrity means treating the work of others -in laboratories, collaborative projects, or any learning endeavors -with the respect we would wish for our own work. Academic integrity means, in short, that we a t Duquesne are dedicated to pursuing our academic and intellectual endeavors with honesty and honor. The Policy and Procedures set forth here govern the administration of academic integrity throughout Duquesne University and cover the specific roles and responsibilities of individual schools and programs. All student appeals related to academic integrity are to be governed exclusively by the University (and College/School) Academic Integrity Policy and Procedures. The University Policy and Procedures will be promulgated on the Duquesne University web site, in the Student Handbook, and through other means so they may be easily accessed by all members of the Duquesne community. 47 All members of the Duquesne University community -including faculty, students, a dministration, and staff -are responsible for upholding academic integrity and maintaining a culture in which academic integrity can flourish. Faculty responsibilities include maintaining integrity in their own work and professional lives. Faculty are als o responsible for teaching students about academic integrity, particularly in accordance with the specific expectations and conventions of their disciplines, and structuring assignments and examinations in ways that will help students maintain academic int egrity. If faculty believe or suspect that academic integrity may have been violated, they must also play a central role in investigating and judging violations and administering sanctions. Student responsibilities include maintaining academic integrity in all class assignments, examinations, research and/or writing projects, and any other academic endeavors related to their courses of study. II. Definitions and Standards: Violations of Academic Integrity Academic integrity can be compromised in any nu mber of ways. Individuals who seek or receive credit for intellectual work that is not their own violate academic integrity, as do individuals who falsify or ignore data or who destroy or contaminate data or intellectual property. Violations of academic in tegrity may include, but are not limited to, the following: Cheating. Cheating on quizzes, tests, examinations, or projects may include giving, receiving, or using unauthorized assistance or material. Unauthorized material may include, but is not limited t o, notes or other written documents as well as wireless communication or computing devices, calculators, formulas, computers, computer programs, software, data, or text. In other contexts (e.g., group projects, labs), cheating may include forms of deceptio n intended to affect grades or other outcomes. Cheating may also include, but is not limited to, student use of sources (including \"answer sites\" such as Course Hero) beyond those authorized by the instructor in fulfilling assignments such as writing paper s, preparing reports, developing course projects, or solving problems. Cheating may also include student possession without permission of tests or other academic material belonging to a member of the University faculty or staff. Selling course material to another person and/or uploading course materials (including but not limited to slides, syllabi, tests, study guides, labs, etc.) to a third party vendor without express written permission of the University and the Instructor is prohibited. Plagiarism. Plagiarism in papers or other written, electronic, or oral work (including essays, research papers, theses, dissertations, presentations, class projects, or work for publication) may include, but is not limited to, the use -whether by summary, paraphrase, copy ing, direct quotation, or a combination of such methods -of the published or unpublished work or the specific ideas of another person or source without full, clear, and specific acknowledgment (including the use of quotation marks or other conventions to in dicate the source's language). Plagiarism may include the submission of material from sources accessed through the Internet or by other means, or from other individuals, without proper attribution. Also, plagiarism may include the submission of a paper pre pared in whole or in part by another person or persons or an agency or entity engaged in providing or selling term papers or other academic materials. Plagiarism may also include the submission, without the instructor's approval, of work submitted for cred it in another course. Deceit in academic matters. Deceit may include, but is not limited to, deliberately furnishing false information to or withholding relevant information from any University instructor, official, or office. 48 Misuse of documents. Misuse m ay include, but is not limited to, forgery, alteration, or improper use of any University document, record, or instrument of identification (written or computerized). It may also include misappropriation, mutilation, or destruction of tangible assets such as books, journals, electronic data, and related resources available in libraries and offices. Assistance in the violation of academic integrity. Assistance may include, but is not limited to, any knowing facilitation of intellectual dishonesty by another person or persons. III. Academic Sanctions Violations of academic integrity -whether or not they are the result of a deliberate intent to deceive -are subject to academic sanctions, including (but not limited to) lowered grade or failure on an assignment; lowered course grade; course failure; suspension or dismissal from a course; suspension or dismissal from the College or School or from the University; and/or revocation of a degree. If a student is accused of an academic integrity violation before the pu blished course withdrawal deadline, he or she may not withdraw to avoid a course grade sanction. If a student is guilty of violating academic integrity, information regarding the violation and sanction will be maintained by the Office of the Provost. ACAD EMIC INTEGRIT Y PROCEDURES All schools of the University will have academic integrity policies and procedures that are consistent with the University Policy and Procedures. As a rule, School procedures will specify standards and expectations appropriate t o that School and its mission; students enrolled in courses offered by that School will be governed by its procedures. Provisions in the policies and procedures of a School may deviate from and supersede the University Policy and Procedures only when they represent accepted practice for the discipline concerned as this is reflected in publications of the relevant professional association or accrediting body. Each such provision must be approved by the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs and clea rly noted as an exception to the University Policy and Procedures wherever the School's policy and procedures are published. In all cases, School procedures will specify mechanisms for insuring that students accused of academic integrity violations are aff orded the protections of due process, including the availability of School - level appeals processes. While individual faculty members will generally have responsibility for course -level sanctions (that is, sanctions up to and including a reduced or failing course grade), schools will follow the procedures outlined for handling more serious situations involving students enrolled in their programs or taking their courses -that is, situations that could potentially lead to more severe sanctions than failure in a course (for example, repeated or particularly egregious violations that might lead to suspension or dismissal from the School or University). The College and individual schools are responsible for promulgating School policies and procedures to their stud ents and faculty alike and providing ready access to their policies and procedures (e.g., on School web sites); educating students about School expectations regarding academic integrity and specific methods and conventions for maintaining it; overseeing ac ademic integrity in their courses and programs; and maintaining School records of academic integrity violations. 49 In courses that are not offered by a specific School (e.g ., courses for the Bridges Common Learning Experience and other University programs) a nd in combined degree programs, the policy and procedures of the department or faculty member offering the course will apply. In areas of the University that do not have their own policy and procedures (e.g., the Honors College), the policy and procedures of the McAnulty College and Graduate School of Liberal Arts will apply by default. ALL academic integrity cases that result in sanctions including, or more serious than, a failing grade for an assignment must be reported to the appropriate offices, inclu ding the Office of the Dean of the School in which the student is enrolled (see below) and the Office of the Provost, which maintains records of violations of academic integrity. Each School (College) should develop guidelines for contacting the Office of the Provost with inquiries about whether a particular student has committed a prior academic integrity violation and evaluating any information it receives. I. Roles and Responsibilities within the College and the Schools Course instructors are responsi ble for upholding academic integrity in regard to work under their supervision performed both in and outside of class. They have primary responsibility for evaluating evidence of violations and imposing appropriate sanctions. All cases that result in sanct ions including, or greater than, a failing grade for the assignment on which the violation allegedly occurred must be discussed with the instructor's department chair or program director within 5 university days. If the student is majoring in a different a rea from the one where the violation occurred, the relevant department chair and Dean should also be notified. If the instructor determines that the sanction to be applied is equivalent to or greater than a failing grade for the assignment, the instructor should inform the student of the sanction in writing or via email, generally within 10 university days. At that time, the instructor should also inform the student that it is his or her right to appeal the instructor's finding of a violation and/or imposit ion of a sanction to the School (College) Academic Integrity Appeals Committee or its equivalent. The student should initiate any appeal within 10 university days after the instructor has communicated with her or him regarding a violation or sanction. The recommendation of the School (College) Academic Integrity Appeals Committee will be communicated in writing or via email to the Dean, and, if the student is not enrolled in that School, the Dean of the student's School. The Dean of the student's primary School/College may impose the sanction as recommended or impose a lesser sanction. For especially serious sanctions (e.g., suspension or dismissal from the University), the Dean will forward a recommendation to the Provost and Vice President for Academic A ffairs for implementation. Each School's (College's) Academic Integrity/Standing Committee should have oversight of matters related to academic integrity in that School (College). II. Role and Responsibilities of Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs In the most serious cases, defined as those that might lead to suspension or dismissal from the University, the Dean's recommendation is transmitted to the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs for action within 10 university days of it s receipt. If the student requests a University -level review (see below) or if the 50 Provost has any concerns about the evidence or the fairness of the School's proceedings, the Provost may refer the case to the University Academic Integrity Appeals Committe e. The Provost will determine the student's ability to attend classes, clinicals or internships during the appeal process, based on the severity and context of the academic integrity violation. If the student's appeal is granted, the student will be provi ded with an accommodation to address any class or clinical time missed during the appeal process. III. Role and Responsibilities of the University Academic Integrity Appeals Committee A student has the right to a University -level review of his or her ca se. Often this will be conducted informally by the Provost (or his or her designee), who will review the written record of the case. The Provost or their designee may refer the case to the University Academic Integrity Appeals Committee for review if the s tudent presents compelling evidence that the proceedings in the School or College were inadequate. The Committee, at its discretion, may wish to go beyond an examination of the written record and hold a hearing at which the student and other witnesses may appear. The Committee must forward its recommendations regarding the case to the Provost within 15 university days or receiving the referral. The University Academic Integrity Appeals Committee will be constituted on an ad hoc basis by drawing three facu lty members from the College/School Academic Integrity Committees or their equivalent, by recommendation of the faculty members' Deans. The faculty members chosen to serve on any academic integrity case may not be members of the department in which the all eged infraction occurred . 51 DUQUESNE UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC INTEGRITY VIOLATION POLICY PROCEDURE AND TIMELINE Faculty Member Evaluates Evidence and Imposes Sanction for Academic Integrity Violation All cases which result in a sanction greater than failure on the assignment on which the Academic violation allegedly occurred must be discussed with the depa rtment chair in an advisory capacity within 5 university days.

Profession of nursing, standards of professional conduct for students of nursing at Duquesne University School of Nursing are defined h erein. During enrollment in the School of Nursing all students are expected to abide by Duquesne University Standards of Professional Conduct . These standards apply both on campus and during all School of Nursing and University off campus experiences, incl uding all course -related practice, online and electronic communication and research activities. 1. Consistent with the professional nurse 's obligations related to professional responsibility and accountability, the student will - a. Initiate and maintain their presence and responsiveness in online courses in which they are enrolled. b. Participate actively in any clinical practicum experiences to which they are enrolled. Unexcused absences are unacceptable and may lead to failure in the course, and/or dism issal from the School of Nursing. c. Prepare for class, clinical practice, and research -related activities in advance to enhance and insure the patient safety and learning. d. Comply with the School of Nursing codes and expectations and those established b y clinical practice and research partners. 2. Consistent with the professional nurse 's obligations related to competent application of knowledge and competence in nursing practice, the student will - a. Evaluate one 's own and one 's colleague 's nursing pra ctice in relation to professional practice standards and guidelines, relevant statutes, rules, and regulations.1 1 Standards of Professional Performance for the Registered Nurse, American Nurses Association 3. Consistent with the professional nurse 's oblig ations related to communication and collaboration, the student will - a. In all professional relationships, including those with faculty, practicum preceptors and colleagues, students, peers, patients, and research participants practice with compassion a nd respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and uniqueness of every individual unrestricted by considerations of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems. 4.

Observe institutional, ethical, and legal parameters regarding confidentiality of patients, families, their records, and all information related to their car e. Personal Conduct Individuals who have applied to or are enrolled in the School of Nursing are expected to adhere to certain standards of personal conduct. These standards of personal conduct include rules of conduct established by the University as well as the School of Nursing, and also to those regulations regarding the use, consumption, or sale of illegal substances, misdemeanor offenses, and felonious convictions. Adherence to all local, state, and national laws in this regard is also expected. A fe lony conviction while enrolled will result in an automatic dismissal from the School of Nursing. Failure to comply with any or all of the standards of conduct may also result in a permanent dismissal from the School of Nursing. 55 Duquesne University expects that all students as well as student organizations will conduct themselves responsibly and in a manner that reflects favorably upon themselves and the University. When a student does not act responsibly and violates the University policies, rules, regulati ons, or standards of conduct, formal disciplinary action may result. The Conduct process reflects the University 's concern that students and organizations maintain high standards. The Conduct process attempts to foster personal learning and growth, while a t the same time holding individuals and groups accountable for inappropriate behavior. The purpose of this section is to provide student and faculty of the School of Nursing guidelines for professional conduct in the classroom, clinical setting, and onlin e classes and communications. This document is express notice to those for whom it is intended as to the minimum standard of conduct that is expected of Duquesne University nursing students. This document explicates the civil, ethical, and respectful beh avior expected of all nursing professionals. Student Civility - Civility and Incivility Defined \"Relationships marred by incivility and bullying can contribute to unhealthy work environments that ultimately have a negative impact on the quality and safety of care delivered (American Association of Critical -Care Nurses, 2005). The establishment of positive, respectful relationships is crucial to preventing incivility, bullying, and workplace violence. Several foundational documents support the need for civil ity and a culture of respect that must be continuously demonstrated by nurses in all areas of nursing education and practice. For example, \"Essential VIII: Professionalism and Professional Values\" described by the American Association of Colleges of Nursin g (AACN, 2008) underscores the importance of nurses being accountable and responsible for their individual actions and of ensuring that civility underlies professionalism. Similarly, Provision 1.5 of the ANA Code of Ethics (2015a) requires nurses to treat colleagues, students, and health care consumers with dignity and respect. It also states that any form of harassment, disrespect, or threatening action will not be tolerated. In addition, an Institute of Medicine (2010) report recommends empowering nurses to participate in collaborative efforts to improve work environments and health care systems. \" ANA Position Statement on Incivility, Bullying, and Workplace Violence, July 22, 2015 Classroom Conduct Students in the Nursing Program at Duquesne University a re engaged in preparation for professional practice. Nursing practice is guided by the ANA Code of Ethics and ANA Standards of Professional Practice, which emphasize respect for others. Students in a professional nursing education program are held to these standards. All communication with faculty and other students should always be respectful. The following are expected behaviors that support the teaching/learning in Hy -Flex, face -to-face, and distance learning environments : Always address the faculty mem ber or clinical faculty member by their title: Professor or Doctor Arrive to class /class session on time Call the faculty member and leave a voice message or email in the event of tardiness or absence prior to class Students should not talk when faculty member or classmates are speaking during class Students who are disruptive or uncivil may be asked to leave the classroom Students are not permitted to bring a guest or children to class without prior permission Electronic equipment or devices shall not be used without the express permission and consent of the faculty member 56 Behaviors considered disruptive, unruly, or that interfere with the ability of the professor to teach may include: Intimidating behavior Persistent argumentation, refusal to comply w ith a direct request, or yelling in class Offensive behavior or gestures Any student who violates expected behaviors or engages in disruptive behavior, as explicated above , may be sanctioned by the School of Nursing and University Conduct Committee. Online conduct reflects the same requirements as classroom conduct. Courtesy, politeness, and good manners must be used when students and faculty are involved in online education and/or communication; the same as if the interaction were to take place in person. Behavior must be responsible and caring toward others and individuals should anticipate the consequences of such conduct. Certain issues are particular to online education conduct. These include assuring that written or audio discussion and email are assur ed the same civility as an on -site classroom situation. Students must arrive to an online class or appointment on time and refrain from disruptive behavior with verbal or written side conversation or background noise when connected to a live online class. The written communication for online learning deserves the same amount of formality and respect as face -to-face communication. Clinical and/or Practicum Conduct Clinical refers to the learning experiences outside of the classroom setting that include but a re not limited to: community agencies and organizations, health care facilities, and the laboratory. Students are expected to maintain professional conduct while in the clinical area. It is imperative that students show respect when interacting with all members of the health care team. The following are expected behaviors that support the clinical and/or practicum teaching/learning environment: Arrive on time . Be prepared with an iPad and electronic resources . Be prepared as required per each course . Ensure patient safety . Fulfill required number of hours . Students must call clinical faculty and leave a voice mail message in the event of tardiness or absence prior to the start of clinical. Failure to contact the faculty of tardiness or absence in advance of the start of clinical is considered patient abandonment (No -Call/No -Show) and may be sanctioned. Students must have knowledge of and adhere to the clinical dress code set forth by the Duquesne University School of Nursing . Use of electronic devices in t he clinical setting is limited to patient care only. Students shall adhere and conform to the ANA Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice. Students shall adhere to all HIPAA regulations and guidelines. Completion of clinical site education modules and acce ss to electronic charting . Social Media Social media has a powerful presence in the world today. Students must conduct themselves with the full knowledge that no online social media site is truly private or temporary, the corporations are constantly colle cting data for use at a later time, and that anything you post may be available at any time. This includes faculty members, patients, families, and future employers. In addition, students must be cognizant of your association with Duquesne University in on line social 57 networks. If you identify yourself as a student and that your views are your own; make sure that everything you post reflects how you wish to be viewed by the world as a professional and ethical health care provider. HIPAA guidelines must be fo llowed at all times. Identifiable information concerning clients/clinical rotations must not be posted in any online forum or webpage and violations could results in academic and professional sanctions, per the \"Confidentiality and Privacy \" policy. Keep in mind that \"identifiable information \" does not just mean names; students should not discuss ANY patient information online in any capacity. Clinical sites may refuse clinical placement of students who violate their social media regulations. In recognition of this issue 's importance, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing has developed a brochure than can be downloaded, \"A Nurse 's Guide to the Use of Social Media. \" (link: https://www.ncsbn.org/S ocial_Media.pdf ) Violations of Professional Standards of Conduct Faculty and administration of the School of Nursing consider violations of professional conduct to be serious. While it is recognized that \"to err is human, \" errors of judgment, failure to demonstrate professional behavior, lack of preparedness and safe practice, incivility (verbally, behaviorally, or in writing, directly or indirectly through a third party), and lack of responsibility as expressed in absence and lateness reflect overall l ack of professional comportment. Dependent upon the nature of the violation, disciplinary action may be applied to an individual violation. In addition, an annual review of accumulated violations may be judged to reflect a pattern of behavior inconsisten t with professional conduct and lead to dismissal. Procedure for Faculty in Responding to Violations of Standards of Professional Conduct in the Student Role 1. When a course Faculty of Record determines that there has been a violation of the professional sta ndards, a Violation of Professional Conduct (VPC) form is completed, signed by the Faculty of Record, discussed with and signed by the student. The student will have the opportunity to add comments. 2. Sanctions are to be determined by the Faculty of Recor d for the course. 3. The Faculty of Record is to send all VPC forms to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, Chair of the Undergraduate program, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and Dean within 3 days of issuance to the students. The VPC forms are re viewed and kept in the Office for Student Affairs . If the violation is of a more serious nature, the Faculty of Record must notify the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs immediately following the issuance of the violation. An immediate course of action will be determined and may be referred to the Academic Standing Committee for review at a special meeting. A violation of a more serious nature may be sanctioned by the School of Nursing. In addition, all acts of this n ature may advance further to the Academic Standing Committee, Duquesne University Office of Student Conduct, which may impose further sanctions depending upon the context and severity of the act. Sanctioning is outlined below. 4. The rights of the student will be safeguarded as set forth in the program specific Student Handbook and the Duquesne University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct. 5. If a student wants to appeal the sanction they may do so in writing within ten business days of not ification of sanction. The appeal should be sent to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. The Academic Standing Committee will review the student 's appeal within ten days and make a recommendation to the Dean for an appropriate sanction. The sanction may be upheld, reversed, lessened, or increased. The Dean will make a final determination and notify the student in writing of the decision. The Dean 's decision is final. 58 Possible Sanctions Informal Reprimand or Warning A written letter of reprimand or warnin g resulting from a student 's misconduct is placed in the student 's file. This letter may be removed from the student 's permanent file upon graduation if no other violations are accrued. Formal Reprimand A written letter of reprimand resulting from a studen t's misconduct is placed in the student 's file. This letter is not removed after graduation, and will become a part of the student 's disciplinary file . Clinical or Course Failure A failure for the clinical portion of a course (which will result in a course failure) or a course failure due to a violation of professional conduct will become a part of the student 's disciplinary file in addition to the failing course grade shown on the student 's transcript. Disciplinary Probation Probation is for a designated period of time and includes the probability of more severe disciplinary sanctions if the student is found in violation of any institutional regulation(s) during the probationary period. Students may not be allowed to participate in School of Nursing act ivities. Suspension Suspension is a sanction that terminates the student 's enrollment in the School of Nursing for a specified period of time after which they may be eligible to return. During the period of suspension, the student is not permitted to atte nd classes or clinical. Conditions for readmission may be specified. Dismissal Dismissal is a permanent separation of the student from the School of Nursing. Requests for readmission from students who are dismissed as a result of a violation of professiona l conduct will be reviewed by the Academic Standing Committee . Discretionary Sanctions Sanctions may be imposed at the discretion of the School of Nursing. Examples include, but are not limited to, making restitution for any property damage or misappropr iation of school property or services, or the property of any person, essays, training, community service projects, service to the School or University, temporary suspension from a class or clinical site, referral to the Office of Student Conduct or other related discretionary assignments . More than one of the above types of sanctions may be imposed for any single violation. Other than dismissal from the School of Nursing, disciplinary sanctions shall not be made part of the student 's permanent academic re cord but shall become a part of the student 's confidential disciplinary record. A student 's confidential disciplinary record will be expunged of disciplinary actions after seven years from the date of the incident. Dismissal is an exception and will remain on file permanently in the Office for Student Affairs . 59 VIOLATION OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT FORM THIS FORM IS TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE ASSOCIATE DEAN OF STUDENT AFFAIRS STUDENT: FACULTY: COURSE NO.

Moreover, it has a responsibility in ensuring that students enro lled in the pre -licensure nursing Program are eligible to secure a license upon successful completion of the program and all students licensed and enrolled in a graduate program are able to maintain their licensure. Furthermore, the School has a duty and o bligation to protect the public health and safety. The School recognizes that a substance use disorder is a medically recognized condition as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) that poses a risk for substantive harm to affected individuals, their contacts, and the general public. Therefore, the School will refer individuals who are identified as being at risk for a substance use disorder for professional assessment and, when so indicated, follow -up treatment. The Uni versity and the School of Nursing are committed to providing compassionate and proactive assistance for students with substance abuse issues and their families and to afford students, who are not legally restricted and are no longer chemically impaired, th e opportunity to continue their education without stigma or penalty, and to protecting society from harm that impaired students could cause. Indications for Referral for Evaluation Students subject to referral for a professional assessment include, but are not limited to, any or all of the following conditions: A positive finding on a criminal background check that suggests a potential active substance use disorder. Please note that the withdrawal or dismissal of legal charges or a \"not guilty\" disposition is separate and distinct from the presence of a substance use disorder and does not relieve the student from complying with referral for assessment when so warranted Referral from the Duquesne University Office of Student Conduct Positive drug test Being identified as the subject of a drug -related criminal investigation Reliable information from independent sources Evidence of drug tampering or misappropriation Accidents or illnesses caused by impairment related to substance use Impairment or intoxication in the clinical and/or didactic setting Following a clinical -related injury or illness Observation of poor judgment or careless acts which caused or had the potential to cause patient injury, jeopardize the safety of self or others or resulted in damage t o equipment Suspicion of a substance use disorder based on behavioral cues as reported by faculty, staff, experiential preceptors, employers, peers, and/or other stakeholders Odor of drugs or alcohol on a student Physical symptoms (including but not limit ed to behavior such as slurred speech, decreased motor coordination, difficulty maintaining balance, etc.). Possession of an illegal substance Self-referral Drug and/or Alcohol Testing The School reserves the right to order a drug/alcohol screen for cause , such as a student who unexpectedly has a major deterioration in academic performance or who demonstrates bizarre, erratic or unprofessional behavior. Drug screens are also to be performed as a condition of participating in the clinical education compo nent of the curriculum. If a didactic or clinical faculty member suspects possible substance abuse by a student who is in class or in a 61 clinical setting, they will report the suspicious behavior to the Faculty of Record and the Associate Dean of Student Aff airs immediately. Once notification occurs that a student is suspected of violating the substance abuse policy, the student will be instructed to report to the designated testing laboratory. The cost of any drug or alcohol testing will be assumed by the n ursing program. The Chair of the Undergraduate program has the authority to temporarily suspend the student from the clinical practicum pending the final results of any tests. Referral for Evaluation: Pennsylvania Nursing Peer Assistance Program Students who are enrolled in the pre -licensure (traditional or second degree) Program at Duquesne University, and those students enrolled in any of the Program at the School of Nursing who hold a nursing license in the state of Pennsylvania, will be referred to t he Pennsylvania Nursing Peer Assistance Program (PNAP) for further assessment. PNAP is an organization sanctioned by the Pennsylvania State Board of Nursing whose purpose is to provide assistance to individuals who may be in need of treatment, protect the ability of individuals to secure and maintain a nursing license, and ensure the public health and safety. Its recommendations are supported by the School and the University. In the event of a positive drug test by an independent drug and alcohol counselor as identified by PNAP, continuation of the student in the pre - licensure program, or post -licensure program if licensed in PA, will be contingent upon compliance with any treatment recommendations endorsed by PNAP. Where so indicated, such students will al so be required to engage in a monitoring contract administered by PNAP. Those individuals who are enrolled in any of the post -licensure nursing Program at Duquesne University and who hold a nursing license in a state other than Pennsylvania will be referre d to the appropriate state board or peer assistance program. Procedure for Violation of Substance Use/Abuse Policy: 1. Students identified as in need for assessment of a possible substance use disorder (via faculty staff report or any other mechanism descr ibed above) will be required to schedule an appointment to meet with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and a designated member of the School of Nursing staff or administration within three (3) university days of notification. 2. If it is determined th at a referral for a professional assessment is indicated, the student must contact PNAP within three (3) university days for an initial intake and referral to a qualified drug and alcohol counselor as selected by PNAP. 3. When referral for assessment is in dicated by PNAP, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Director of the PNAP program must be notified by the student, within five (5) university days, of the scheduled date of the assessment. 4. Signed releases must be executed within five (s) univ ersity days from referral to PNAP, allowing designated individuals to send and receive confidential information regarding the student referral, treatment, and progress, as applicable. 5. Professional assessments must be conducted within ten (10) universit y days of notification of the scheduled appointment. 6. Students who are recommended for treatment will be required to enter into a monitoring contract with PNAP. Designated individuals from the School, including the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Dean, will be signatories to the contract. Enrollment in the PNAP program will continue for the duration of the student's enrollment in the nursing program, but not less than a period of three (3) years. When applicable, students progressing into the p rofession after graduation, who have not yet completed the contracted time period in the PNAP program, will continue to be enrolled in the PNAP program under contract, until they have completed the minimum monitoring requirement. 7. Refusal to contact PNAP , submit to an assessment, enter into a monitoring contract, or comply with treatment recommendations, when so indicated, may result in notification to the Pennsylvania State 62 Board of Nursing and dismissal from the nursing program. 8. A negative diagnostic impression or completion of previous treatment recommendations does not preclude a subsequent referral in the event of a new event, additional evidence, or continuation of a suspect behavioral pattern. 9. Costs for external assessments, treatment Program, monitoring Program and any related fees are the responsibility of the student. 10. All records related to referrals, assessments, and monitoring of substance use disorders will be kept confidential. The School will not support the matriculation, and/ or c ontinued enrollment of anyone found guilty of Illegal possession of controlled substances with the intent to divert or distribute A felony Final decisions for continuance in all nursing program rests with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Written a ppeals can be made to the Dean within ten (10) university days of notification of the dismissal from the program. Failure or refusal to comply with any aspect of the substance abuse policy is grounds for disciplinary sanction, including dismissal from the program. Examples of noncompliance include, but are not limited to, refusal to submit to immediate drug and alcohol testing, tampering or alteration of specimens, attempts to submit the samples of another person as the student's own, and failure to appropr iately complete associated program or testing laboratory documents. Professional Expectation and Conduct Disclosure Statement Students are required to fully disclose any and all institutional actions (student conduct charges and/or results), felony and mis demeanor charges and convictions on clinical clearances to determine eligibility for clinical. Students also are permitted to submit an explanation of the actions or circumstances in writing. Should a student fail to disclose such information (e.g., Reside nce Life violation, charges on a criminal record check), the student may face disciplinary action to be determined by the Academic Standing Committee. STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE All matriculated students must carry comprehensive health protection through eit her an indemnity medical insurance policy or enrollment in a health maintenance organization. ACADEMIC WRITING STANDARDS Professional and credible writing is a key component of education. By the end of the program, students are expected to have developed h igh-level skills in critical thinking and synthesis of complex ideas in writing. Additionally, students are expected to understand and demonstrate the highest ethical standards related to citations, intellectual property, and presenting the work of others . The following guidelines are important components of academic writing for nursing students at Duquesne. The School of Nursing follows the guidelines set forth in the 7th Edition (or most up -to-date version) of the American Psychological Association Publ ication Manual. Students are expected to conform to the guidelines in all academic writing, unless specifically directly otherwise. The School of Nursing provides numerous opportunities for students to improve their writing, starting with the Writing Modul es that are part of the first course. Students are strongly encouraged to take advantage of all school offerings related to improving writing \u2014from opportunities to submit drafts, to webinars on EndNote and other software. 63 The Writing Center at Duquesne U niversity is devoted to the process and practices of writing by helping students become better writers. Writing Center Consultants are available to students of all levels and majors at the university. All papers should be submitted in Microsoft Word. Stude nts should make sure that file names include their last name, assignment information, and date (unless otherwise instructed). Students are expected to follow the rules and regulations sets forth in the Academic Integrity policy, with respect to issues of plagiarism, intellectual property, and academic honesty. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR ADVANCED STANDING CREDIT Courses taken within the past ten years are evaluated for transfer credit in the School of Nursing. The limit for courses in the natural sciences is generally five years. MATH PROFICIENCY REQUIREMENT All students are to complete the required math competency dosage calculation assessments integrated within the clinical nursing courses beginning with UPNS 200: Fundamentals of Nursing Practice & Clini cal Ethics . This initiative is designed to enhance patient safety by ensuring that students are prepared to administer medications. Students will not be permitted to administer medications until the math competency is achieved on each level. Students must pass the required competency with a minimum 92% score and are given two additional opportunities to re -test and achieve a passing score. Assessment of math competency will occur each semester beginning with UPNS 200: Fundamentals of Nursing Practice & Clin ical Ethics . If a student fails to achieve the required score after three attempts the student receives a failing grade in the clinical portion of the course where the competency is assessed, and then receives a failure in the course and must withdraw from any other clinical course the student is registered in that semester, excluding Nursing Care of Children's Health and Nursing Care for Maternal - Newborn Health where medications are not routinely given. Advancement in the program will require a revised cu rriculum plan of studies. Math calculations will also be given routinely on course exams at the discretion of the instructor. AUDIO/VIDEO RECORDING POLICY Duquesne University prohibits recording and/or transmitting classroom lectures, power points, and discussions by students unless express permission had been obtained from the class instructor. This policy flows from a recognition that instructors and the University have intellectual property interests in classroom lectures and related materials; a lso, privacy interests are served when students can engage in open discussion in the classroom; moreover, sensitive materials at times are discussed in classroom settings that could disclose confidential information, reflect negatively on the University and/or violate ethical or professional standards if disseminated beyond the classroom. When permitted by an instructor, audio or visual recording of lectures or class presentations is solely authorized for the purpose of individual or group study with other stude nts enrolled in the relevant course. Permission to allow the recording does not transfer any copyright in the recording. The recording may not be reproduced, disseminated (except to other students in the class) or uploaded to publicly accessible internet o r websites. Additionally, recordings, course materials (whether electronic or paper), and lecture notes may not be disseminated or distributed for commercial purposes, for compensation, or for any purpose other than for study by students enrolled in the re levant course. Public dissemination of such materials may constitute copyright infringement in violation of state and/or federal law. 64 Violation of this policy may also subject a student to discipline under the Duquesne University Code of Student Rights, Re sponsibilities and Conduct. This policy applies to courses taught at Duquesne University including online courses, distance -learning courses and/or courses conducted electronically or over the internet. CALCULATION OF SECOND -DEGREE PROGRAM QPA/GPA Students enrolled in the second -degree BSN program may have completed a previous undergraduate degree at Duquesne University. Because the Banner system does not separate the transcript by program but rather level (UG, GR, Pharmacy, Law) any academic review or dec isions will be limited to the coursework attempted and completed during the student 's enrollment in the School of Nursing Second Degree BSN program. Additionally, the student 's graduating QPA/GPA will be calculated separately to reflect the academic work i n the School of Nursing Second Degree BSN program. NON -NURSING STUDENTS TAKING NURSING CLASSES Non -nursing students taking nursing courses are required to purchase testing software in order to enroll. Students will have the option of purchasing the hard -back book or the eBook. Students can contact the Assistant Dean for Instructional and Clinical Technology for more information on testing software . 65 CLINIC AL POLICIES 66 CLINICAL POLICIES CLINICAL PREPARATION Clinical learning activity is defined as a planned activity occ urring in an agency when the student is identified as a Duquesne University student. The clinical learning activity may or may not include contact with patients. To be eligible for clinical placement, students must complete the following requirements by the deadline of July 15th each year : Participate in the Clinical Preparation Meeting in the Spring semester (rising sophomores only) All School of Nursing undergraduate clinical requirements All School of Nursing undergraduate health requirements Students will not be given a clinical assignment until all requirements are complete. Failure to attend a clinical practicum due to non -compliance is an unexcused absence and places a student in -academic jeopardy. Furthermore, any student with delinquent clinical/ health requirements will be assessed a $100.00 non - refundable late fee and subject to clinical absence fees. SCHOOL OF NURSING UNDERGRADUATE CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS Nursing coursework will require placement in a setting other than the classroom including co mmunity - based settings, hospitals, and other health -care agencies throughout the Pittsburgh area. Prior to any clinical practicum experience, students must complete certain requirements related to personal safety, patient safety, confidentiality, liabilit y, and health. These requirements are imposed by our clinical/ community agency partners, the State Board of Nursing, and the university. It is important that students complete the correct clinical and health requirements for their level/program. Please pay close attention to the table to determine which clinical and health requirements are required. Details on completing these requirements are listed. Any questions about the School of Nursing undergraduate clinical requirements should be directed to the Office of Undergraduate Clinical Affairs at 412 -396-1423 . NURSING HEALTH AND CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS All registered Duquesne nursing students are required to complete specific health and clinical requirements in order to remain enrolled and to be permitted en trance into clinical facilities for student practica. The School of Nursing has contracted with CastleBranch to provide background, FBI and drug screening for all students and to serve as an online storage portal for additional student requirements. Studen ts must establish a CastleBranch account and purchase their package using a specific package code. I t also includes a storage portal to upload all additional r equired health and clinical documents both as an incoming student and annually thereafter even as a graduate nurse .

The student is responsible for obtaining their own transportation to and fr om all clinical sites. Students are not permitted to switch or request any changes to clinical assignments/or sites . Students will be assigned to day and/or evening clinical rotations . These rotations may occur during the week and /or the weekend . Accommoda tions will not be made for clinical assignments based on a student 's personal schedule except in extreme extenuating circumstances. (Extenuating circumstances DO NOT include childcare, transportation, care of family members , personal preference and/or work schedules.) 2. Reassignment of clinical placements by the School of Nursing may be necessary during the semester to accommodate unforeseen circumstances. 3. Clinical assignments will be sent to students via their Duquesne email accounts by their course F aculty of Record at the start of the term. Clinical assignments are not available prior to this date. 72 MEDICAL CLEARANCE When a student discloses an illness, physical limitation, is hospitalized, or placed under any medical restrictions, the School of Nurs ing will consult with the appropriate clinical agency for clearance. Medical clearance must be submitted to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Medical clearances must state the date to which the student can return without restrictions in order to resu me clinical activities including those assigned in the lab. Any student having an illness or physical disability that affects their ability to function satisfactorily in the clinical areas must contact the Disability Services Office. Due to possible expos ure to infectious diseases in the clinical areas, it is important for the student to notify the Associate Dean of Student Affairs of any chronic illnesses or if health status has changed recently (i.e. pregnancy) that may require further considerations . Students taking prescribed medications should be aware of the effects of these medications on alertness, judgment, and the ability to meet all technical standards. Students cannot attend clinical if there is impairment of ability to safely provide care to as signed patients. CLINICAL ATTENDANCE POLICIES Clinical No -Call/No -Show A No -Call/No -Show constitutes a student who neglects to contact their clinical instructor to inform the m that the student will not b e attending clinical. Sending text messages to the instructor is not acceptable. The student is expected to call and email the clinical faculty member at least one hour before their scheduled start of the clinical. If a student does not arrive on time a nd has not contacted their clinical instructor, and if the clinical instructor is not able to reach the student, the clinical instructor will notify the Faculty of Record for the course and document the incident of no call no show on the Violation of Profe ssional Conduct Form . If the Faculty of Record (FOR) is unable to make contact with the student, the FOR will contact the Chair of Undergraduate Program and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs . The Associate Dean will implement additional measures to re ach the student. The first person listed as the student 's emergency contact may also be notified. After the first No -Call/No -Show occurrence and before returning to the clinical site, the student must meet with the Faculty of Record (FOR) . During the me eting, the Faculty of Record (FOR) will notify the student about the mandatory clinical make -up day, discuss and review the Violation of Professional Conduct form, and review the No -Call/No -Show policy. A second No -Call/No -Show occurrence will result in a clinical failure for the course in which the second No -Call/No -Show occurs. This failure will be recorded on the student 's permanent record as an \"F\" regardless of the theory grade achieved. A student who fails a nursing course because of unsatisfactory cl inical performance may repeat the course if it is the first nursing course failure during the program period. Any subsequent failure in a nursing course will result in dismissal from the program. Clinical Tardiness Students are expected to arrive at the cl inical agency early and be \"ready to begin\" the clinical day at the scheduled start time. If a student is between 1 - 30 minutes late to clinical, they may stay for the day, but will receive a violation of professional conduct. If a student is more than 3 0 minutes late for the clinical day, they will be sent home, receive a clinical absence, and need to make up the clinical day. The student will also be written up for a violation of professional conduct. 73 PREPARATION FOR THE CLINICAL DAY Students are expect ed to have an iPad while in the clinical area . It is the student 's responsibility to prepare for the clinical day and have an unde rstanding of their patient 's clinical needs. Failure to demonstrate an understanding of the patient 's basic safety needs will result in an unsatisfactory for the clinical day. In extreme cases, students may be asked to leave the clinical unit related to unsafe practices . CLINICAL AND/OR PRACTICUM CONDUCT 1. The nursing faculty of Duquesne University has an academic, legal, and ethical responsibility to prepare a graduate who is competent as well as to protect the public and health care communit y from unsafe nursing practice. It is within this context that a student may be disciplined or dismissed from the Baccalaureate Nursing Program for practice or behavior which threatens or has the potential to threaten the safety of a client, a family membe r or substitute familial person, another student, a faculty member, or other health care provider. 2. Every student is expected to be familiar with the principles of safe practice and is expected to perform in accordance with these requirements. Within cou rses, counseling and advising processes, and other instructional forums, students will be provided with the opportunity to discuss the policy and its implications. Being unprepared for clinical may constitute an unsafe practice and the student may be sent home at the discretion of the clinical instructor or the Faculty of Record for the course. 3. An unsafe practice is defined as: An act or behavior of the type which violates the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Code, Title 49. Professional and Vocational Stan dards, 21.18 Standards of Nursing Conduct. An act or behavior of the type which violates the Code for Nurses of the American Nurses ' Association. An act or behavior which threatens or has the potential to threaten the physical, emotional, mental or enviro nmental safety of the patient, a family member or substitute familial person, another student, a faculty member or other health care provider (e.g. lack of sleep, medication side effects, substance abuse, mental or physical conditions). An act of behavior (commission or omission) which constitutes nursing practice for which a student is not authorized or educated at the time of the incident. 4. When an incident occurs in which a clinical faculty member or course Faculty of Record believes may constitute an unsafe practice, they will immediately notify the student and instruct the student to leave the clinical setting. 5. The unsafe behavior will be documented on the Clinical Incident Report within 24 hours by the clinical faculty or the Faculty of Record, and the Director of Adjunct Faculty and Clinical Affairs will be notified. 6. The Director of Adjunct Faculty and Clinical Affairs in collaboration with the course Faculty of Record will investigate the incident within 24 hours to determine whether ther e are grounds for believing that an unsafe practice has occurred. If the incident is deemed minor, the course Faculty of Record may require remediation and an improvement plan or instruction for the student. 7. If the incident is deemed major, the Director of Adjunct Faculty and Clinical Affairs will contact the Chair of Undergraduate Program and Ass ociate Dean for Student Affairs. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs will call an Academic Standing Committee Meeting, to review the student's clinical performance evaluations, academic record, and potential for successful completion of the major in nursing. Based upon this careful and deliberate review, a decision to reprimand the student, require withdrawal from the clinical course, give a failing grade in the clinical course, impose other sanctions, or dismiss the student from the program will be recommended to the Chair. The Chair will review the 74 evidence and send written notification of the decision to the student via certified mail. Should the student wi sh to appeal the decision, the student will follow the academic appeal process outlined in the Duquesne University Student Handbook. REPORTING OF INCIDENTS OR ILLNESS AFFECTING A STUDENT Pregnancy Exposure to certain pathogens, toxic chemicals, drugs, radi ation , and/or unsafe conditions during clinical rotations may endanger a pregnant student or her baby 's health. If a student is pregnant, or becomes pregnant anytime during the program, students are strongly advised to contact the Ass ociate Dean for Studen t Affairs. For the student 's safety and the safety of her baby, the clinical faculty member and course coordinator will be notified of the pregnancy.

Pregnant students will be consulted about the potential risks in clinical to the student and baby. Confidentiality of the student will be maintained . The student must be examined by her health care provider and cleared medically for each semester during her pregnancy as well as for the period following delivery. The student will not be able to participate in clinical without medical clearance. Any restrictions or limitations and the expected date of delivery must be included in the medical clearance. If any restrictions or limitations are recommended by the health care provider, the student must meet with the appropriate faculty/staff to make the appropriate clinical accommodation to review options for completing the clinical rota tion. The clinical rotation completion plan will be documented in writing. A student still must meet all student curriculum requirements and responsibilities during the period of the pregnancy. Any applicable policies at the clinical site must also be foll owed. The student should immediately notify her clinical faculty member if the student at any time believes they are unable to perform their clinical responsibilities in which case the pregnant student may apply for a leave of absence from the program. Blood or Body Fluid Exposure Students who sustain significant blood or body fluid exposures (including needle sticks, scalpel cuts, splashes to face, etc.) will be seen immediately at the Occupational Health/Injury Center of the clinical site where the studen t is doing their rotation or the Emergency Room of a hospital affiliated with the clinical site.

The student is responsible for obtaining follow -up test results from where the incident occurred. Clinical Communicable Disease Policy The faculty believes that nursing students provide services with respect for human dignity and the uniqueness of the client unrestricted by conside rations of social or economic status, personal attributes or the nature of health problems. Students with a communicable disease may not pose a health risk to other students in an academic setting, but the CDC guidelines must be followed in the clinical se tting. If an accidental exposure occurs to a communicable disease , faculty and students should follow the Clinical Exposure Policy. Clinical Exposure Policy This policy is to be followed when a student has been exposed to an occupational hazard in the clinical setting. A significant exposure is defined as: A needle stick or cut caused by a needle or sharp that was actually or potentially contaminated with blood or body fluids; 75 A mucous membrane (i.e., splash to the eye or mouth) exposure to blood or body fluids; or A cutaneous exposure involving large amounts of blood or prolonged contact with blood especially when the exposed skin was chapped, abraded or affected with dermatitis. If the student incurs an exposure the following must occur : The student shou ld immediately notify the Clinical Instructor of the incident. The student and clinical instructor should follow the health care agency 's \"Blood Borne Pathogen Exposure Control Policy \" or other exposure/incident policies (this includes washing the area of exposure, informing patient, obtaining consents for blood draw of the source patient, etc.). An incident report should be completed and submitted per clinical site policy by the clinical instructor . The clinical instructor must submit a copy of the incide nt report to the Director of Adjunct Faculty and Clinical Affairs.

CHILD ABUSE RECOGNITION AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS The Pennsylvania Department of State released a special notice that EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015 all persons applying for issuance of an initial license shall be required to complete three (3) hours of Department of Public Welfare -approved training in child abuse recognition and reporti ng requirements as a condition of licensure. Act 31: New Requirement for All Health -Related Licensees: All health care -related licensees are considered mandated reporters under the Child Protective Services Law. PA Act 31 requires child abuse recognition a nd reporting training for both new licenses and license renewals, effective Jan. 1, 2015. In order to apply for licensure in the state of Pennsylvania (and most other states at this time) the student is required to complete this training prior to submissio n for new licensure. Failure to do so will result in a declined license application. For those students planning to apply for licensure in Pennsylvania, the State Board of Nursing and the Child 87 Welfare Resource Center have established a system that is set up to automatically provide the information for each graduate when they apply to take NCLEX. While there are many online training sites available we recommend students in PA use the following link to complete the training: www.reportabusepa.pitt.edu The following are some important points to keep in mind: When you click on the training site, be sure to carefully enter your information and then establish a Username and Password. Write those down or keep th em in a place where you can access them when needed. o Be sure to enter your name EXACTLY as it will be written on your NCLEX application. o The two names must be exactly the same. o You will be asked to enter the last 4 digits of your SS# . o Your DOB . o Be sure to click the box that asks if you are applying for recertification of nursing license or first time applying for license. While completing the course you may start and stop and complete the course over time. You will need to have the Username and Password in order to get back into the course to continue. The course will take about 3 hours to complete. When completed, you can print out your certificate but you will not be able to download the certificate. Be sure to keep a copy of this certificate in a safe pla ce. You do not need to do anything with the certificate other than keep it in your own files. When you complete the course the course facilitators will then upload your certificate to the Department of State (DOS) website where it can then be accessed by the NCLEX staff. When you apply to take the NCLEX exam you will be asked if you completed the training. You will mark \"yes\" and then NCLEX staff will go to the DOS to access your certificate. You do not have to do anything else on your part. BE SURE to co mplete the course at least 3 weeks before you apply to sit for the NCLEX exam. It takes about 2 -3 weeks for the certificate to be uploaded. If it is not uploaded you will not be able to sit for NCLEX at that time. For graduates who will be applying for li censure outside of Pennsylvania, you will need to contact the Board of Nursing in that state to investigate procedures around this training and how to complete them. We can help you with accessing this information if you need assistance. However, if you g o online and get the contact information from the Board of Nursing in the state where you will be applying, you should have no problem getting an answer. The student may have to take a training course in that state. We encourage students to be proactive an d complete this before the end of the student 's final semester so that this does not delay the processing of license.
