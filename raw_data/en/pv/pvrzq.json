This was because the rate of serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) reported after these 2 vaccines is slightly higher (around 5 to 10 per million doses) than after other vaccines (normally 1 per million). Why is this changing Due to the Omicron variant, the booster programme for adults is being accelerated. As part of this, and given the very low rate of anaphylaxis, the 15 minute wait has been suspended, as we now have much more experience with giving these vaccines to millions of people. People are not normally observed for 15 minutes after other vaccinations. Who is advising this change The change has been advised by the Chief Medical Officer, and has the support of the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). What should I do when I attend for vaccination If you have a history of allergies, particularly to other vaccines, or if you had an immediate reaction after your previous doses, you may be advised to stay for the 15 minutes. Please make sure you tell the vaccination centre. Note that a family history of allergies (or even anaphylaxis) is not a risk factor. Please also tell them if you have previously fainted following vaccination. Otherwise you will be able to leave the centre straight after your vaccine as long as you feel OK. You must not drive for 15 minutes after the vaccine - this is because of the risk of fainting. Waiting after your COVID-19 vaccination Withdrawn September 2023These symptoms typically happen within 15 minutes of vaccination. If you experience any of these, call out for help and/or ring 999 immediately (or ask someone to do this for you). The following symptoms ON THEIR OWN are not anaphylaxis, but imply a more mild reaction: swollen lips, face or eyes itchy skin rash e.g. \"hives\", urticaria If any of these symptoms occur and you need advice, contact 111 or your health professional. Simple faints are much more common after vaccination. If you do faint, stay flat on your back with your legs raised. If this doesn't make you feel better, then call for help.What happens if I do experience allergic symptoms Keep this flyer handy.
