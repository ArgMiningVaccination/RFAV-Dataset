Their unique vulnerabili es make it vital that their special needs are addressed in eve ry stage: preven on, preparedness, response, and recovery. Healthcare ins tu ons have a responsibility to ensure the highest quality care is provided under standard and emergency and/or surge condi ons. This collec on of modules emphasizes family-centered care and evidence-bas ed prac ces within the limits of the emergency response. The NW Oregon Health Preparedness Organiza on created this Annex to provide hospital personnel an overview of planning tools and concepts that may assist them in developing emergency plans that include speci c content on the care of children. The Annex is not prescrip ve; it is assumed that any hospital u lizing it does their due diligence to shape their plan's conte nt in accordance with applicable statutes, cer ca on regula ons, and/or accredita on principles. EOP Annex Goal: Ensure that a hospital EOP addresses the unique needs of childr en across an all-hazards planning environment. Module Content: This Pediatric Annex includes a series of modules. Each module of the Annex covers a di erent response opera on or planning concept. They ar culate an organiza on's response to pediatric needs within cover are opera onal plans ac vated in response to a speci c pediatric surge event. Addi onally, this Annex uses infec ous disease (slow moving event) and mass trauma (fast moving event) as star ng points for planning. Any of these modules can be adapted t o other hazards or threats; fl exibility is key. The modules rely on de ned outcomes, clear de ni on of roles and responsibili es, and clear communica on channels across the response. General Pediatric Surge Assump ons: 1. Ins tu ons will likely exceed their internal capaci es quickly (a er hospital-focused surge interven ons), and must collaborate with their peer ins tu ons (pediatric specialty care hospitals) to ensure maximum u liza on of scarce pediatric resources (i.e. cri cal care beds). 2. Pediatric specialty care hospitals will be the rst er of medical response to a pediatric surge event (either medical or trauma) in the Portland Metropol itan Area and/or the State of Oregon. Subsequently, these hospitals may also advise and/or su pport hospitals that do not have pediatric special es.

US Department of Health and Human Services. 2017. h ps://chemm.nlm.nih.gov/chempack.htm#overviewModule 1: HIPPA, Informed Consent, & Informa on SharingPediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 1: HIPAA, Informed Consent, and Informa on Sharing Module Purpose To outline legal considera ons for informa on sharing regarding pediatric care within the con nes of a disaster. Background: Emergencies can strike with li le or no warning and may present poten al threats to pa ents' right under HIPAA and the Privacy Rule. Well-inten oned as it may be, sharing or viewing of a pa ent's status or condi on by those who are not directly involved in pa ent care or otherwise authorized violates these rights and jeopardizes the hospital. Hospitals can be rapidly inundated with pediatric pa ents, worried family and friends looking for loved ones, and the media reques ng pa ent informa on. Knowing what informa on can be released in an emergency, to whom, and under what circumstances is cri cal to understand and incorporate into the Emergency Opera on Plan (EOP). The hospital will assign a spokesperson when the EOP and/or thi s Annex are ac vated to coordinate and approve sharing approved pa ent informa on. De ni ons 1. Disaster: an occurrence that has resulted in property damage , deaths, and/or injuries to a community (FEMA de ni on). 2. Pediatric: HIPPA guidelines refer to minor children (under 1 8); State healthcare regula ons vary depending on care/service provided. 3. Informed Consent: a process of communica on between a pa ent and physician that results in the pa ent's authoriza on or agreement to undergo a speci c medical interven on. 4. Life or Limb Excep on: a concept in emergency medicine related to informed consen t procedures allowing medical sta to intervene in a situa on where the pa ent is incompetent due to medical reasons, or if the pa ent is a child not accompanied by a parent or guardian to give speci c consent. The necessary situa on required is if inac on due to a lack of consent would result in loss of life or loss of a limb. Planning Guidelines/Assump ons I. HIPAA Guidelines The procedures below are authorized and approved by Legal Couns el and/or the Privacy O cer of the hospital. Non-compliance with these procedures is subject to signi cant civil and criminal penal es at the individual and organiza onal level. A. Providers and sta can share pa ent informa on as necessary to provide treatment as outlined in policies. B. Providers and sta can share pa ent informa on as necessary to support family no ca on as outlined in policy. C. Providers and sta can share pa ent informa on if the pa ent is in imminent danger as outlined in policies. D. Providers and sta can share pa ent informa on if the pa ent is in the facility directory as outlined in policies. Planning Guidelines/Assump ons (cont.) II. Sharing Informa on when a Federal Disaster Declara on is Ac ve The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has c ommented that the HIPAA Privacy Rule is not suspended during a disaster or public hea lth emergency. However, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) may issue a waiv er following a disaster. In such a case, no sanc ons or penal es will be assessed against a hospital for speci ed viola ons of HIPAA. A. If the President of the United States declares an emergency or disaster and the Secretary of HHS declares a public health emergency, the Secretary of HHS may waive sanc ons and penal es against a covered hospital that does not comply with certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule: i. Requirements to obtain a pa ent's agreement to speak with family members or friends involved in the pa ent's care (45 CFR 164.510(b)). ii. Requirement to honor a request to opt out of the facility directory (45 CFR 164.510(a)). iii. Requirement to distribute a no ce of privacy prac ces (45 CFR 164.520). iv. The pa ent's right to request privacy restric ons (45 CFR 164.522(a)). v. The pa ent's right to request con den al communica ons (45 CFR 164.522(b)). B. If only the Secretary of HHS issues such a waiver, it only applies: i. In the emergency area and for the emergency per iod iden ed in the public health emergency declara on. ii. To pa ents within the hospital if the EOP has been ac vated. Sta only access or share the minimally necessary pa ent informa on. iii. For up to 72 hours from the me the EOP is ac vated. C. When the declara on terminates, the hospital must comply with all the requirements of the Privacy Rule for any pa ent s ll under its care (even if 72 hours have not passed). D. Regardless of the ac va on of an emergency waiver, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits disclosures for treatment purposes and certain disclosures to disaster relief organiza ons. E. HIPAA guidelines are to preserve current state laws regardi ng minors. Generally, minor children (under the age of 18) may have informa on released with the consent of a parent or legal guardian, in accordance with the ins tu on's guidelines. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 1: HIPAA, Informed Consent, and Informa on Sharing Planning Guidelines/Assump ons (cont.) III. Informed Consent for Minors Guidelines The process to ensure healthcare access, con den ality, and privacy can be complex when it pertains to minors, and even moreso in crisis and disaster scenarios. No one single rule can be applied to all situa ons. A. Minor Rights: Access and Consent to Health Care; a Resource for Providers, Parents, and Educators. This resource is intended to provide basic informa on about minors' ability to consent to healthcare services , and how healthcare informa on is treated in Oregon. It is not intended to be a legal doc ument or a subs tute for legal advice or direc on on speci c clients or healthcare provider ques ons. This guide is included as Appendix A to this module. B. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statemen t that in disasters, healthcare workers may be able to treat min ors without securing proper consent where \"the minor's life or health would be jeopardized by delay.\" When it is not possible to secure mely informed consent for trea ng the minor, Healthcare Workers must provide stabilizing treatment and act in the pa ent' s best interest un l consent is properly secured. This policy statement is includ ed as Appendix B to this module. IV. Informa on Sharing at the Switchboard Ins tu ons need protocols regarding informa on sharing for pa ents admi ed to the facility. In mes of disaster this may change, depending on the strategies f or informa on management. The Public Informa on O cer (PIO) can collaborate with the Privacy O cer to discuss how informa on about pa ent admissions and status will be shared in a crisis or disast er situa on. The hospital switchboard operator is key to implemen ng policies on controlling informa on sharing. The presence of a Presiden al Disaster Declara on will change the environment for what informa on can be disclosed and to whom. It is recommended that a central pa ent informa on center not run by the hospital be established to appropriately redirect persons seeking individua ls, if these individuals are not admi ed to the facility they are calling. To expedite community-wid e informa on gathering, the hospital can decide not to provide informa on to public callers, and route all calls and public informa on requests to a central collec on point. Appendix C to this module provides an example tool for switchboard sta to manage incident informa on. NOTE: The Ins tu on's AOC can decide not to release informa on if it is in the pa ent's best interestPediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 1: HIPAA, Informed Consent, and Informa on Sharing Facility-Based Opera onal Details I. Create and Maintain sta ng enhancements for surge response sta ng (including Job Ac on Sheets) A. Maintain call down lists with sta distance from hospital. B.

This resource is intended to provide basic information about minors' ability to consent to health care services, as well as how health care information is treated in Oregon. It is not intended to be a legal document or a substitute for legal advice or direction on specic client or health care provider questions related to the topics covered in this publication. Adults will wa nt to be aware of minors' consent rights in order to support good communication with the youth in their lives. The information in this guide summarizes and references, to the best of our understanding, federal laws and Oregon state laws (e.g., Oregon Revised Statutes or ORS), and not those of other states. The document also does not attempt to address other physician \"best practices,\" recommended standards of care or institutional policies related to client decision-making.

PUBLIC HEALTH DIVISION Adolescent Health ProgramMinor Rights: Access and Consent to Health Care A resource for providers, parents and educatorsThe dilemma The process to ensure health care access, confidentiality and privacy can be quite complex when it pertains to minors. Every day, health care providers are attempting to figure out: (1) which services a minor can obtain without parental consent; (2) when a parent can access a minor's health information; and (3) when minor consent must be obtained before the provider can share the minor's health information. State statutes, federal laws and regulations provide a complicated patchwork of requirements that often do not fit neatly together and may be challenging to interpret and implement. Unfortunately, no single rule can be applied to all situations. However, a good place to start is with a resource like this that compiles all the requirements. Great care has been taken to present accurate information that is as clear as possible with citations to the entire text of the law or regulation. We encourage anyone wrestling with these issues to use this document as a starting place while establishing a process that will encourage minors to seek care while maximizing their confidentiality and privacy. Who is considered a minor and why does this matter? Under Oregon law, anyone under the age of 18 is considered a minor (ORS 419B.550 [definition of minor] and ORS 109.510 [age of majority]). However, if a minor has been formally emancipated by the courts, some laws pertaining to minors are waived (ORS 419B.552 [emancipation of a minor]). See ORS 419B.550 through 419B.558 for further details. In general, a minor's age determines whether he or she is able to access health care services independently or if parental or guardian consent is required. Additionally, some services that a minor can access independently can be kept confidential, while others cannot. This can be helpful information in order to plan the most appropriate health services for children and youth. Understanding consent What is consent? Consent is an acknowledgement (usually in writing) of any or all of the following: The patient understands the treatment he/she will receive. The patient authorizes the treatment. The patient understands how private information will be shared. All consent should be informed consent ( ORS 677.097 ). Informed consent for health services should be verbal or in writing and includes: a description of the treatment the patient will receive, a description of alternative treatments and a description of any risks involved with the treatment. Below are some examples of when written consent is needed: If someone outside of your health care system requests your health records; or If you want someone else to have access to your health information. Minors may be able to request certain levels of confidentiality or consent to various health care matters depending on their age. Health care professionals may be able, or even required, to disclose certain health information about minor patients (such as reportable diseases or suspected abuse or neglect).Minor Any person under the age of 18. - 1 - Common health services and consent Although many adults help minor children make health care decisions, there can be times when a minor child does not need or want this involvement. Below is a brief (not exhaustive) list of common services and their consenting requirements in Oregon. Medical and dental services (ORS 109.640) Minors who are 15 years or older are able to consent to medical and dental services without parental consent. This includes hospital care, as well as medical, dental, optometric and surgical diagnostic care. This would include services such as: Treatment for illnesses or injuries (colds, sprained ankle); Sports or camp physicals; Dental visits (check-ups, cleanings, fillings); X-ray services; Emergency room visits; Vision care (except for first time contact lens visit); and Immunizations. Mental health and chemical dependency (ORS 109.675) A minor who is 14 years or older may access outpatient mental health, drug or alcohol treatment (excluding methadone) without parental consent. These services may include: Seeking help from a psychiatrist or psychologist; Seeking mental health therapy from a doctor or social worker; and Seeking help for drug or alcohol use. Providers are expected to involve parents by the end of the minor's mental health, drug or alcohol treatment unless: The parent refuses involvement; Clear clinical indications to the contrary exist and are documented in the treatment record; There is identified sexual abuse; or The minor has been emancipated and/or separated from the parent for at least 90 days. For mental health and chemical dependency services, the provider may disclose health information to a minor's parent or guardian per ORS 109.680 if: It is clinically appropriate and in the minor's best interests; The minor must be admitted to a detoxification program; or The minor is at risk of committing suicide and requires hospital admission. Mental health and chemical dependency Although minors age 14 and older can access outpatient mental health and chemical dependency services independently, parents are expected to be involved in their treatment at some point. Involvement does not mean that adults always have access to a minor's mental health or chemical dependency records. Federal regulation 42 CFR 2.14 states that if a minor is able to self-consent for drug or alcohol treatment, the minor's treatment records cannot be disclosed without the minor's written consent (including to the parent or guardian). - 2 - Common health services and consent, cont. Family planning/sexual and reproductive health (ORS 109.610, ORS 109.640) Minors of any age are allowed to access birth control-related information and services as well as testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV, without parental consent. What about consent to sex? Oregon law does not give individuals the ability to consent to sex until the age of 18; however, there are a few important points to consider. Sexual activity is a normal part of development, and according to the 2009 Oregon Healthy Teens Survey 1 of 11th grade students: Forty-eight percent have had sexual intercourse. Of those, 58 percent reported using a condom. Ensuring that young adults have proper resources and information on sexual activity is important for them to make healthy choices. Condentiality of minor health care services Oregon law does not give minors a \"right\" to confidentiality or parents a \"right\" to disclosure . However, federal law may offer additional protections in some circumstances. When a minor self-consents for health care services, providers are encouraged to use their best clinical judgment in deciding whether to share information with the parent or guardian (ORS 109.650). * However, most people, minors included, expect some level of confidentiality when receiving health care services. Providers and adolescent patients should discuss usual confidentiality practices, as well the types of information that providers are required to report. This will have an impact on a minor's willingness to seek health care services they may have otherwise avoided. Rules that providers or facilities may have about minor confidentiality and disclosure are not intended to prohibit or discourage minors from accessing needed health care services, but to encourage proper support in the decision-making process. Oregon law does protect providers from civil liability when a diagnosis or treatment is provided to an authorized minor without the consent of the parent or legal guardian of the minor. (ORS 109.685). * For minors who self-consent for drug or alcohol treatment services in certain settings, providers are not permitted to disclo se the minor's treatment records to the parent/guardian without written consent by the minor per federal regulation 42 CFR 2.14(b). All clinics and/or providers who participate in Title X grant programs must follow federal regulations regarding confidentiality per 42 CFR 59.11. Sharing, protecting and accessing health information Health records include personal health and other identifying information. There are laws in place that help make sure these records are kept as private as possible and are only shared with those who have been authorized to receive this information. Below is a quick overview of different forms of protection related to health records and other private information. Condentiality Confidentiality is an agreement between the patient and provider to ensure personal information is only shared with those whom the patient agrees to share information with. For the most part, providers are not allowed to share private health information with anyone, unless a signed a release of information is on file stating otherwise. There are also national laws, such as HIPAA and FERPA, that help to protect patient confidentiality. However, there are a few exceptions when health information can or must be shared, called mandatory reporting (see page 4 for more information). - 3 - Sharing, protecting and accessing health information, cont. Mandatory reporting There may be times when a minor's health information must be reported to other entities. Some health information must be shared with local health authorities, including cases of certain infections and communicable diseases (such as tuberculosis, West Nile virus or HIV/AIDS). This information is gathered in order to monitor disease patterns with the goal of preventing further infections or outbreaks. To find out more about Oregon physician reportable diseases and conditions, visit http://public.health.oregon.gov/diseasesconditions/ communicabledisease/reportingcommunicabledisease/pages/index.aspx . Other times, appropriate authorities must be notified if there are health or safety concerns regarding a minor child or vulnerable adult, even if the minor provided this information in confidence (such as abuse, neglect, or imminent harm to the minor or another person). Certain health and social service professionals in the community are legally required to report these types of health and safety concerns. Mandatory reporters include (ORS 419B.005 *): Doctors & Nurses Social workers Teachers Day care providers Police officers Other state employees Mental health counselors (in certain circumstances) University and community college employees Coaches & youth group leaders. Additionally, if a person is under the age of 18, there are circumstances when providers are allowed to share the minor's health information with a parent or guardian (ORS 109.680). See the mental health and chemical dependency section on page 2 for details. * Refer to ORS 419B.005 for a full, detailed list of positions that are defined mandatory reporters and those that are excluded . National privacy laws: HIPAA and FERPA What is HIPAA? HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This law created national standards to protect a patient's identifiable information in health records. HIPAA also allows a patient greater access to his or her own records. HIPAA governs privacy policies in health care settings, hospitals and other free-standing clinics, including Oregon's certified school-based health centers. What is FERPA? FERPA stands for the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act. This federal law is similar to HIPAA, but it applies to the school setting and defines access to and protects the educational record of a student, including a school health record maintained by a school nurse. Under FERPA, the educational record can be requested by parents and some school officials. However, records maintained at Oregon's certified school-based health centers are governed by HIPAA, not FERPA. Both of these privacy laws are meant to protect confidential information of individuals in different settings where private information is used. It is important to know what information is considered \"protected\" under both HIPAA and FERPA when providing and accessing health information (see page 5 for links to more information). - 4 -Mandatory reporting circumstances There are times when condential information must be reported: Reportable infectious and communicable diseases; Suspicion of abuse or neglect of a vulnerable individual; Entering a drug or alcohol detoxication program; and Individual is a health or safety risk to themselves or others.

However, children and adolescents mightrequire evaluation of and treatment for emergency medical conditionsin situations in which a parent or legal guardian is not available toprovide consent or conditions under which an adolescent patientmight possess the legal authority to provide consent. In general, amedical screening examination and any medical care necessary andlikely to prevent imminent and signicant harm to the pediatric patientwith an emergency medical condition should not be withheld or de-layed because of problems obtaining consent. The purpose of this pol-icy statement is to provide guidance in those situations in which pa-rental consent is not readily available, in which parental consent is notnecessary, or in which parental refusal of consent places a child at riskof signicant harm. Pediatrics 2011;128:427-433 INTRODUCTION Minors(personsundertheageoflegalconsentasdenedbystatelaw) often require care in the prehospital environment and present toemergency departments (EDs) with medical concerns. Parental con-sent generally is required for the medical evaluation and treatment ofminor children. In most cases, children will present to the ED with aparent or legally authorized decision-maker who can provide informedconsent for evaluation and treatment. However, a number of well-recognized exceptions to this \"general rule\" have been outlined in commonandstatutorylawtoallowforthetreatmentofminorswithout parental consent in situations that frequently occur in EDs. 1-14The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for those situations inwhich parental consent is not readily available, in which parental con-sent is not necessary, or in which parental refusal of consent places achild at risk of harm. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports the principle that all pediatric patients who present to any emergency medical services (EMS) provider or ED for evaluation and treatment should receive aninitial evaluation or medical screening examination (MSE) regardless of ability to pay or presence of a legally authorized decision-maker who can provide consent. The AAP has written 2 previous versions of thisdocument. The original document, \"Consent for Medical Services forChildren and Adolescents,\" was published in 1993 and subsequentlyrevised in 2003. 15The recommendations made in the 2003 revision remain important and pertinent to current practice.

EVALUATION AND TREATMENT OF THE UNACCOMPANIED MINOR If a parent or legal guardian is present or available, the health care profes-sional treating the child should makeevery reasonable effort to obtain anddocument informed consent. Childrenoccasionally present to the ED unac-companied by a parent or legal guard-ian. In some cases (discussed later inthis statement), adolescents may havethe legal authority to consent for treat-ment without a parent present. In mostsituations, however, the child or ado-lescent will either not have the author-itytoconsentorwillbeunabletodoso.Common and statutory law generallyhas supported the health care profes-sional in evaluating these children andproviding emergently needed carewhile attempts are made to locate aparent or legally authorized decision-maker. In addition, current federal lawunder the Emergency Medical Treat-ment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)mandates an MSE for every patientseeking treatment in an ED of any hos-pital that participates in programsthat receive federal funding, regard-less of consent or reimbursement is-sues. 16-19The purpose of the MSE is to determine if an emergency medical condition (EMC) exists, including life- or limb-threatening conditions, severepain, or conditions with the potentialfor serious impairment or dysfunctionif left untreated. The MSE might re-quire the use of extensive ED re-sources, including laboratory testing,radiographic imaging, and subspe-cialty consultation, as needed for diag-nosis. Although the ED should attemptto contact the unaccompanied pa-tient's parent or legal guardian to seekconsent for evaluation and treatment,the performance of the MSE and thestabilization of the patient with anidentied EMC must not be delayed. If an EMC is not identied, EMTALA regu-lations no longer apply, and the physi-cianorhealthcareprofessionalgener-allyshouldseekproperconsentbeforefurther (nonemergent) care is pro-vided. In cases of suspected abuse orneglect, child protective services or lo-cal law enforcement ofcers may havethe authority to consent for evaluationand treatment, although the extent ofthis authority might differ from one ju-risdiction to the next. In situations in which a minor has a condition that represents a threat tolife or health and a parent or legallyauthorized decision-maker is not read-ily available to provide consent, healthcare professionals may provide neces-sary medical treatment or transportthe child for more denitive evaluationand stabilizing treatment. The ethicalbasis for this approach is based in theprofessional's duty to seek the best in-terest of the child. The legal basis fortaking action in an emergency whenconsent is not available is known asthe \"emergency exception rule.\" The emergency exception rule is also known as the doctrine of \"impliedconsent.\" This emergency exceptionrule is based on the assumption thatreasonable persons would consent to emergency care if able to do soand that if the legal guardian knewthe severity of the emergency, he orshe would consent to medical treat-ment for the child. Under the emer- gency exception rule, a medical pro- fessional may presume consent andproceed with appropriate treatmentand transport if the following 4 con-ditions are met: 1. The child is suffering from an emer- gent condition that places his or her life or health in danger. 2. The child's legal guardian is un- available or unable to provide con-sent for treatment or transport.3. Treatment or transport cannot be safely delayed until consent can beobtained. 4. The professional administers only treatment for emergent conditionsthat pose an immediate threat tothe child. Any time a minor is treated without consent, the burden of proof falls onthe professional who is evaluating, treating, or transporting the child to jus-tify and document that the emergencyactions were necessary to prevent immi-nent and signicant harm to the child. Inaddition to actions necessary to save aperson's life and prevent permanent dis-ability or harm, the treatment of frac-tures, infections, pain, and other condi-tions may broadly be considered asemergent conditions that require treat-ment. As a general rule, health care pro-fessionals should always do what theybelieve to be in the best interest of theminor. The emergency exception existsto protect the health care professionalfrom liability with the assumption that ifthe parents were present, they wouldconsent to treatment. 20The professional must clearly document in the child's re-cord the nature of the medical emer-gency and the reason the minor re-quired immediate treatment and/or transport and the efforts made to obtain consent from the patient's legal guard-ian, if unavailable. 15 EMANCIPATION AND THE MATURE MINOR DOCTRINE There are 3 situations in which a mi- nor, rather than his or her parents,has the legal authority to make deci-sions regarding his or her health care: emancipation; the mature minor ex-ception; and exceptions based on spe-cic medical conditions. In fact, everystate has enacted minor consent stat-utes that address some or all of theseexceptions to the \"general rule.\" 21,22 In general, an emancipated minor can function as an adult, independent from 428 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on July 13, 2018 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from his or her parents, with regard to con- sent for medical evaluation and treat-ment. 23Children who are legally eman- cipated may give consent for medicaltreatment and transport. They mayalso refuse medical care and/or trans-port. Although emancipated minorlaws vary from state to state, moststates recognize minors to be emanci-pated if they are married, economi- cally self-supporting and not living athome, or on active-duty status in themilitary. In some states, a minor who isa parent or who is pregnant might alsobe considered emancipated. Otherstates might require a court to declarethe emancipation of a minor. Most states also recognize a mature minor exception, in which a minor,usually 14 years old or older, displayssufcient maturity and intelligence tounderstand and appreciate the bene-ts, risks, and alternatives of the pro-posed treatment and to make a volun-tary and reasonable choice on thebasis of that information. States varyin terms of whether a physician canmake this determination or whether ajudicial determination is required. 23 Finally, most states allow a minor toconsent to evaluation and treatment ofspecic medical conditions withoutthe consent of a parent, generally in-cluding mental health services, treat-ment for drug and alcohol addiction,pregnancy-related care, contraceptiveservices,andtestingforandtreatmentof sexually transmitted diseases. Thespecicnatureoftheseexceptionsandthe age at which they apply vary fromstate to state. Because state laws vary,it is important to be familiar with thespecics of emancipated and matureminor laws in the state in which care isbeing provided. If none of the 3 scenarios described previously (emancipation, mature mi-nor, or condition-specic exceptions)are applicable, then the minor has nolegal authority to either provide con-sent or refuse medical care. Regard- less of whether a child has the legalauthority to provide or withhold con-sent, it is always prudent to attempt toget the child's agreement or assent totreatment and transport. This ap-proach respects the personal dignityand self-determination of the child/pa-tient and minimizes confrontation. Awillingness to provide the child withsome control and some choice mightallow for a compromise that allowstransport personnel to achieve a safetransfer. Using force or restraint toevaluate, treat, or transport a childshould be reserved only for those situ-ations in which all efforts to negotiaterespectfully with the child have failedand the child is at risk of serious harmif he or she is not restrained. In theseunusual circumstances, appropriatemeasures should be taken to ensurethe safety of the patient. CONSENT FOR NONURGENT PEDIATRIC CARE OF CHILDRENACCOMPANIED BY SOMEONE WHOIS NOT AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDELEGAL CONSENT Health care professionals should re- frain from providing nonurgent testingand treatment to children who presenttomedicalfacilitiesunaccompaniedbya custodial parent or legal guardian.An MSE should be performed to ensurethatthechilddoesnothaveaconditionthat requires emergent attention, andany treatment necessary to preventimmediate and serious harm to the child should be provided while an at- tempt is made to obtain consent froma legally authorized decision-maker.The AAP clinical report \"Consent forNonurgent 24describes the issue of \"consent by andprovides practical steps that will helpto balance a patient's ready access tomedical care, family integrity, and thehealth care professional's need tolimit his or her exposure to liability.Unless a minor's right to consent hasbeen legally established, health care professionals should attempt to notifyparents or legal guardians of their in-tentions to test and/or treat the minorand consider delaying all nonurgentdiagnostic and treatment decisionsuntil the parent or legal guardian canbe reached for informed permissionor consent. 24 REFUSALS OF CONSENT FOR EMERGENT EVALUATION ANDTREATMENT A particularly challenging situation oc- curs when the health care profes-sional is faced with a legal guardianwho refuses to give permission fortreatment of a child in situations inwhich such treatment is consideredessential to the child's well-being.Competent adult patients have theright to refuse evaluation and treat-ment, even for EMCs, unless they aredetermined to lack decision-makingcapacity. Under US law, minors aregenerally considered incompetent toprovide legally binding consent re-garding their health care; parents orlegal guardians are empowered tomake those decisions on their behalf,and those decisions are considered le-gally binding. Except for the exceptionscited previously, parental permissionis required before the evaluation andtreatmentofachild.Parentalauthorityis not absolute, however, and when aparental decision places a child at sig-nicant risk or serious harm com-pared with an alternative decision, thestate may intervene to require inter-vention over the objections of the legaldecision-maker. As long as a child's legal guardian pos- sesses medical decision-making ca-pacity, he or she has the right to refusemedical care for the child. However,the guardian is required to act in thebest interest of the child. When a legalguardian refuses to consent to medi-cal care or transport that is necessaryFROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Number 2, August 2011 429 by guest on July 13, 2018 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from and likely to prevent death, disability, or serious harm to the child, law en-forcement ofcers may intervene un-der local and state child abuse and ne-glect laws. It is always preferable tonegotiate with the legal decision-maker and attempt to achieve anagreeable plan for safely managingthe child's medical condition. When faced with a guardian who re- fuses to allow the provision of neces- sary medical care or transport of a child when it is necessary to save achild's life or prevent serious harm, itmight be necessary to notify the policeand enlist their assistance in placingthe child in temporary protective cus-tody.Inalife-threateningemergency,itmight be necessary to involve hospitalsecurity so that emergent evaluationand treatment can begin while childprotective services and the police arenotied. Likewise, when a legal guard-ian appears to be intoxicated or other-wise impaired, involvement of law en-forcement ofcers might be necessaryto place a minor in temporary protec-tive custody. Once the professional hasreceived authorization to treat from astate child protective agency or police,the emergency medical professionaldoesnothavetherighttotreataminor for medical conditions that are not se-rious or life-threatening. Under these circumstances,amedicalprofessionalshould provide medical treatmentwithout consent only when the childhas a medical condition that poses arisk of death or serious harm, whenimmediate treatment is necessary toprevent that harm, and when only those treatments necessary to prevent the harm are provided. 25 INFORMED CONSENT AND THE LANGUAGE BARRIER If a language barrier exists, informed consent for medical treatment should,when clinical circumstances permit,be obtained through a trained medicalinterpreter. Using an interpreter not only increases the likelihood of trulyinformed consent but also enhancesthe possibility of optimal medicaltreatment by allowing the professionalto obtain accurate information about achild's underlying medical conditions,allergies, current medications, orother relevant and important informa-tion. Such interpretation may be per-formed in person, via videoconferenc-ing, or by telephone, but a certiedmedical interpreter should be used.Using a family member as interpretershould be avoided unless absolutelynecessary, and the medical profes-sional should be aware that transla-tion might not be accurate when atrained interpreter is not used. CONSENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY State statutes that allow the consent ofaminordonotallguaranteeanadoles-cent protection from parental disclo-sure. However, some states explicitlyrequire either condentiality or paren-tal notication. Other states requirethe health care professional to at leastmake a good-faith effort to involve thefamily of the minor in his or her treat-ment. The only federal law that re-quires condentiality for minors is theFamily Planning Act. 26It is crucial that every health care professional beknowledgeable of his or her respectivestate and all federal laws relating tocondentiality and minors. 27 The issue of adolescent condentialitywas addressed in the recently pub-lished AAP technical report \"Patient-and Family-Centered Care and the Roleof the Emergency Physician Providing Care to a Child in the Emergency De- partment.\" 28This report suggested that ED health care professionals befamiliar with the limitations to and ob-ligations for providing care to the un-accompanied older pediatric patientseeking care without the knowledge ofhis or her family 15,24,29and make thoselimits and obligations clear to the pa- tient.Forexample,boththepatientandthe health care provider should iden-tify a secure and condential means ofreceiving follow-up information laboratory billing notication. Inparticular, condentiality can only bereliably realized when attached to -nancial accountability. The child mustbe willing and able to pay the bill forthe ED visit or risk a breach of con-dentiality as a result of billing notica-tion. Some professional organizationshave formalized their opinions on theissue of condentiality. The AmericanMedical Association recommends aconservative approach to condential-ity and encourages parental involve-ment whenever possible. 30The Society for Adolescent Medicine believes thathealth care professionals have an ob-ligation to protect patient condential-ity when appropriate. 31 As discussed previously, the lack of le-gal clarity provides health care profes-sionals with some discretionary con-trol over whether to provide testingand treatment to a minor without pa-rental notication. That responsibilityshould not be taken lightly, and consid-eration for issues such as family dy-namics (eg, will the child be punishediftheparentsareconsulted?),develop-mental maturity (eg, is the child a run-away risk?), and the actual scope oftesting and treatment must be takeninto consideration before excluding orincluding parents in the discussion. Inaddition, health care professionalsshould be honest and consistent with their patients and families. A clinicianshould never promise a patient con-dentiality if he or she might not be able to honor that promise. PREHOSPITAL CONSENT EMS providers and EMS medical direc-tors caring for minors might nd it dif-cult or impossible to make real-time 430 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on July 13, 2018 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from contact with parents or legal guard- ians of patients, despite the increasedavailability of communication tools inthe prehospital environment (eg, cellphones). Although most EMS systemspromote a effort on the partof the prehospital provider to makecontact with the parents and legalguardians of minors, many systems donot have formal policies addressingthe lack of informed minor or parentalconsent. If at all possible, an assess-ment should be performed to deter-mine if there is a medical emergency,and medical consultation should besought if the emergency medical tech-nicians are unclear about whether athreat to life or limb exists. If parentsare present or accessible and refusecare for their injured or ill child, theymust be informed of the risk of nottransporting a sick or injured pediat-ric patient, which might include deathor permanent disability. Regardless ofreligious beliefs or parental desires,every attempt should be made to treatand/or transport a child with a life-threatening emergency or if providerssuspect child abuse. EMS providersshould involve medical control early inthese situations and use law enforce-ment resources as necessary to en-sure that the patient receives the nec-essary emergency stabilization andtransport. CONSENT DURING A DISASTER Health care professionals evaluatingand treating a minor during a disastershould always attempt to obtain con-sent from the parents or legally autho-rized decision-maker. The mere exis-tence of a disaster event does notautomatically authorize emergencymedical professionals to evaluate andtreat minors without parental consentunless the minor's life or health wouldbe jeopardized by delay. 32However, in an overwhelming disaster scenario,time pressures on medical providers,a chaotic environment, interruption ofnormal communication methods, the inability to identify patients, and multi-ple casualties might make it impossi-bletoseektimelyinformedconsentforthe evaluation and treatment of mi-nors. In such a situation, medical pro-fessionals should act in the best inter-est of the patient and providestabilizing care until consent can beobtained. CONSENT FOR RESEARCH IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING For research protocols that enroll ED patients, informed consent will re-quire a process separate from that ofinformed consent for evaluation andtreatment. Whether to enroll a child ina research project can never be de-cided solely by a health care profes-sional but must occur in accord withtherequirementsofaninstitutionalre-view board (IRB). The IRB will deter-mine the requirements for informedconsent, including the content of theinformed consent, who can obtain con-sent, and whether consent requiresthe agreement of 1 or both parents. In some cases, research in the emer- gency environment is designed to in-vestigate emergency procedures thatoffer the prospect of direct benet topotential participants, and in these sit-uations, enrollment must take placeimmediately, and parents might notyet be available to provide permis-sion. 33Such special situations are gov- erned by special rules. Under these circumstances, the research can pro- ceed without permission of the par-ents only under restricted guidelinesoutlined by federal regulation. These guidelines require that the subject be facing a life-threatening or perma-nentlydisablingsituationforwhichthe only known therapy is investigational, unproven, or unsatisfactory; that thechild is incapable or unable to providevalid consent, and the parents cannotbe reached for permission before thetime the investigational treatment must be started; and that there is noaccepted therapy that is clearly supe-rior to the experimental therapy. In ad-dition, the research protocol musthave received IRB approval that the ex-perimental treatment has a realisticprobability of benet that equals or ex-ceeds that of standard care, that therisks of the experimental therapy arereasonable in comparison to the pa-tient'sconditionandstandardtherapy,that there is minimal added risk fromparticipation in the research protocol,that there is no possibility of gettingprospective consent from those whoare likely to need the experimentaltherapy, that participants and/or par-ents will be provided with all pertinentinformation regarding the study assoon as possible, and that alterationor waiver of consent will not adverselyaffect the rights and welfare of thesubjects. Once the legal decision-maker has been informed of the re-search, he or she might choose to dis-continue participation at any timeafter being fully informed of the conse-quences of doing so. Finally, federalregulations require that input fromcommunity representatives be soughtregarding the protocol before IRB ap-proval to gain a form of \"communityconsent\" to proceed with the researchand that public disclosure of the re-search and its risks and benets bemadetothecommunityfromwhichpo-tential participants will be enrolled be-fore initiation of the research. Publicdisclosure of study results is also re-quired by law in this situation.

RECOMMENDATIONS 1. An MSE and any medical care neces- saryandlikelytopreventimminentandsignicantharmtothepediatricpatientwith an EMC should never be withheldor delayed because of problems withobtaining consent. 2. The physician or health care profes- sional should document in the pa- tient's medical record all informed-consent discussions, including theidentity of the person providing con-sent (if the patient) or permission fortreatment (if a parent or anotheradult with legal decision-making au-thority) and the efforts made to ob-tain consent from the patient's legalguardian, if unavailable. 3. The physician or health care profes- sionalshouldbefamiliarwithEmer-gencyMedicalTreatmentandActiveLabor Act federal regulations, statelaws concerning consent for thetreatment of minors, and state lawsenumerating the conditions underwhich minors can provide consentfor their own care. 4. Unless a minor is allowed to con- sent under the law, health care pro-fessionalsshouldconsiderdelayingall nonurgent diagnostic and treat-ment decisions until the parent orlegal guardian can be reached forinformed permission or consent. 5. The physician or health care profes- sional should seek patient assent formedical testing and treatment fromthe pediatric patient as appropriateforthepatient'sage,stageofdevelop-ment, and level of understanding.6. If a language barrier exists, in- formed consent for medical treat-ment from health care profession-als should be obtained through atrained medical interpreter. 7. Every EMS agency and ED should de- velop written policies and guide-lines that conform to federal andstate laws regarding consent forthe treatment of minors, includingspecic guidelines on nancial bill-ing, parental notication, and pa-tient condentiality for the unac-companied minor. 8. For research protocols, the deci- sion to enroll a child in a researchproject must occur in accord withthe requirements of an IRB. LEAD AUTHORS Paul E. Sirbaugh, DO Douglas S.

Background: Providing sta con nuing educa on outside of required licensing and cer ca on requirements is vital to an e ec ve emergency response organiza on. The module lists sugges ons for disaster educa on and outlines a training and educa on strategy for the ins tu on. De ni ons 1. Disaster: an occurrence that has resulted in property damage , deaths, and/or injuries to a community (FEMA de ni on). 2. Pediatric: Various life stage cohorts (Newborns, Infants, Ch ildren, and Adolescents); in trauma centers, de ned as a person under 15. Planning Guidelines/Assump ons In emergencies, sta may need to assume roles outside of their normal role or work with materials and equipment that is di erent than their normal work. The ins tu on can prepare sta and clinical workers by ensuring they have the proper educa on and training to ll disaster based roles. Formal classes (online and inperson) are encouraged as supplemental educa on or for the development of sta that may par cipate in a pediatric mass casualty incident or a medical response impac ng children (i.e. pandemic). Hospital Emergency Managers and Administrators will develop str ategies to maximize the use of space, sta , and supplies to care for the most people possible as safely as possible. To support the iden ed strategies, nurse/physician/other clinical con nuing educa on and training o ces are engaged to support all sta across the hospital/health system enterprise. Addi onally, a review of exis ng training policies/requirements, labor agreements, and other personnel manangement documents with an eye toward the im pact on disasters will provide context and fl exibility when it is needed most. Facility-Based Opera onal Details I. Develop required/recommended list of disaster care traini ngs for employees. II. Provide opportuni es for licensed administra ve sta to re-engage in pa ent care skills.III. Understand which disaster roles do not require a license, but support pa ent surge or create capacity for licensed sta to work at the top of their licenses in pa ent care se ngs. IV.

Background: A centralized incident command system (ICS) is essen al to managing emergency e orts and minimizing chaos during emergency response. Pediatric-spec i c job roles are proposed in this unit to enhance the use of the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS), ensuring that pediatric care needs, concerns, and resources are considered in conjunc on with their adult counterparts. De ni ons 1. Disaster: an occurrence that has resulted in property damage , deaths, and/or injuries to a community (FEMA de ni on). 2. Pediatric: Various life stage cohorts (Newborns, Infants, Ch ildren, and Adolescents); in trauma centers, de ned as a person under 15. 3. Hospital Incident Command System (HICS): a methodology for o rganizing hospital opera ons during a disaster or emergency event that improves emergen cy management planning, response, and recovery capabilites for planned and unplanned events. 4. Hospital Command Center (HCC): a centralized loca on in an ins tu on where members of the HICS team gather to coordinate the response. 5. Na onal Incident Management System (NIMS): a comprehensive, na onal approach to incident management that is applicable at all jurisdic onal levels and across disciplines. It is the \"glue\" that holds response together and allows organiza ons to collaborate and support with common language and roles when in response. HICS is part of the NI MS system. Planning Guidelines/Assump ons Hospitals and Health Systems use HICS as an incident management system to assist in planning, response, and recovery capabili es. Ac va on of the Hospital Command Center (HCC) and assigning sta to ll posi ons within are likely decisions made by Emergency Managers and Execu ve Leader- ship based on good informa on sources from within and from outside the organiza on. Consider developing a policy sta ng that your hospital will employ a standard HICS structure to manage any emergency response as part of your Emergency Opera ons Plan. The roles within HICS include Command Sta (Incident Commander, Public Informa on O cers, Safety O cer) and General Sta to support Opera ons, Logis cs, Planning, and Finance/ Administra on (See Figure 1). It is important that all job ac on sheets for HICS roles include a pediatric considera ons/ac on/task sec on to support pediatric integra on across the incident response. These roles in HICS work to collect pa ent informa on, and track pa ents, vic ms, and fatali es. They are also used to account for personnel me, u liza on of resources, track communica ons, and opera onal ac vi es. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 3: Adap ng HICS for Pediatric Response Planning ons (cont.) Figure 1: Example HICS structure Pediatric-intensive incidents/events can manifest in a no-no ce situa on, such as a mass casualty/trauma response. Conversely, a pediatric-heavy infec ous disease event (i.e. pandemic impac ng predominately children) will likely grow over me and come in waves. Any pediatric surge event will warrant the ac va on of the HCC to manage the exis ng space, sta ng, and supplies owned by the ins tu on; and to partner with other healthcare en es to nd regional or state solu ons to a crisis. Facility-Based Opera onal Details I. Incorporate HICS use policy in EOP II. Incorporate Pediatric-speci c posi ons and Job Ac on Sheets in your HCC/ HICS documenta on (See Appendix A) a.

Background: Children (<18 years of age) make up about 25% of the popula on in the United States and, therefore, represent a large demographic popula on who require planning for di erent medical needs during emergencies that are di erent than the needs of adult popula ons. Within the pediatric popula on: 1. Approximately 14% have special healthcare needs (and o en more than one condi on). 2. One in six children has a developmental disability. 3. Nearly 20% of children discharged from hospitals have some level of technology that must be maintained at home. Children with chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or e mo onal condi ons u lize care more frequently than their age or developmental peers. Condi ons may include those with physical problems, those who are immunosuppressed because of an underlyi ng malignancy, diabetes mellitus, or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. Other pediatric spe cial needs popula ons include children with intellectual and developmental disabili es. Some children have mul ple healthcare considera ons and they rely on mul ple medica ons, medical technology devices, and/or complex management plans. Ch ildren with func onal and access needs are at increased risk of acute deteriora on, medical errors, and subop mal outcomes that are o en exacerbated by a disaster event. Some examples of these ch ildren are: children with cerebral palsy who may be wheelchair-bound children with indwelling tracheostomy tubes and enteral feed ing tubes ven lator-dependent children those with au sm, learning disabili es, cogni ve disabili es, and limita ons in vision or hearing. De ni ons 1. Access-based needs: All people must have access to certain resources, such as social services, accommoda ons, informa on, transporta on, medica ons to maintain health, etc. 2. Children and Youth with Special Healthcare Needs (CYSHCN) a re those children who have, or are at risk for, chronic physical, developmental, behav ioral, or emo onal condi ons who require health and related services of a type or amount be yond that required by children and youth generally. 3. Func on-based needs: Func on-based needs refer to restric ons or limita ons an individual may have that require assistance before, durin g, and/or a er a disaster or public health emergency.Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 4: Children with Func onal, Access, & Special Healthcare NeedsA child's developmental level, underlying medical condi on(s), and mobility status may a ect his or her need for support and the e ec veness of medical countermeasures such as vaccines or other medica ons (e.g., an microbials). These pa ents may need addi onal supports in order to recieve decontamina on or evacua on. Facility-Speci c Opera onal Details I. Implement the Emergency Informa on Form in the admi ng/recep on process. The Emergency Informa on Form (EIF), as developed by the American College of Emergen cy Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics (Appen dix A), is an important document that assures prompt and appropriate care for Ch ildren with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) who present to emergency depar tments or healthcare professionals with an acute illness or injury. Physicians, parents, EMS professionals, and nurses will be able to use the EIF as a tool to transfer cri cal informa on and ensure that a child's complicated medical history is concisely summarized and available when it is needed mos t - when the child presents with an acute health problem at a me when neither parent nor pediatrician is immediately available. Addi onally, this form can be used as part of a \"bedside go-kit\" with pa ent care needs to support pa ent evacua on and transfer to another healthcare partners. II. Determine how your organiza on will adapt its Standard Opera ng Procedures, including your Emergency Opera ons Plan (plus Annexes for response ac ons and stratagies) to meet the needs of all three types of n eeds listed here (func onal, access, and medical). To facilitate this review, use the evalua on grid in Appendix B for each opera onal module in the Annex. Develop a plan to keep families together during emergenc y response. Family members are the best caregivers because they understand the pa ent's needs best. III. Understand how your language services provider will opera te in a disaster response to support transla on/interpreta on/TTY/video. Review service contracts for language regarding rapid se rvices and how they will be compensated. Review labor contracts to determine how sta language skills can be compensated for and used outside of their rou ne job du es.

The emergency informationform (EIF) is a medical summary that describes medical condition(s),medications, and special health care needs to inform health care pro-viders of a child's special health conditions and needs so that optimalemergency medical care can be provided. This statement describesupdates to EIFs, including computerization of the EIF, expanding thepotential benets of the EIF, quality-improvement programs using theEIF, the EIF as a central repository, and facilitating emergency pre-paredness in disaster management and drills by using the EIF.Pediatrics 2010;125:829-837 INTRODUCTION Children with chronic medical conditions, including children with spe- cial health care needs, rely on multiple medications, medical techno-logic devices, and complex management plans, which can cause themto be at increased risk of acute deterioration, medical errors, andsuboptimal outcomes. Their conditions make them particularly vulner-able and prone to complications; therefore, they frequently rely onemergency care in the ongoing management of their special medicalconditions. A detailed understanding of an individual's special healthcare needs is required to provide optimal emergency care. 1-9 When children with special health care needs access emergency med-ical services (EMS) or seek emergency care in a busy emergency orurgent care facility (or in the midst of a disaster), it is difcult for EMSpersonnel and/or the attending physician to review lengthy medicalrecords (if they are available at all) and coordinate care with multiplespecialty care providers. 9A summary describing their medical condi- tion(s), medications, and special health care needs is necessary toreduce delays in diagnosis and treatment and facilitate greater ef-ciency in the provision of emergency care to children with specialhealth needs. The transfer of traditional health-record information is slow and be- coming more difcult for the following reasons: 1. Because of greater documentation requirements, health records are more comprehensive, which makes it more difcult to nd im-portant items related to the patient's condition.AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS COMMITTEE ON PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE AND COUNCIL ON CLINICAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYAMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANSPEDIATRIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE COMMITTEE KEY WORDS EIF, emergency information form, children with special healthcare needs, EMS, emergency medical services, disasterpreparedness, emergency preparedness, quality improvement ABBREVIATIONS EMS\u2014emergency medical servicesHIPAA\u2014Health Information Portability and Accountability ActEIF\u2014emergency information Academy of PediatricsACEP\u2014American College of Emergency PhysiciansEHR\u2014electronic health recordVAC\u2014volts of alternating current This document is copyrighted and is property of the American Academy of Pediatrics and its Board of Directors.

Delays are often caused by information-transfer consent re-quirements and misunderstand-ings surrounding the regulations ofthe Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 3. Minimum necessary standards for release of information under HIPAAcan interfere with gathering a com-plete set of pertinent information. 4. In a disaster scenario, the transfer of health records can be problem-atic because of an inability to ac-cessthem,orpaperrecordsmaybedestroyed in the disaster. The emergency information form (EIF) was proposed as a means to provide rapid access to a health summary forchildren with special health careneeds in a 1999 joint policy statement(reafrmed in 2002) by the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) and theAmerican College of Emergency Physi- cians (ACEP). 9The EIF is a type of per- sonal health record that was introduced as a concise, single-sheet summary de-signed to provide the essential informa- tion needed initially to treat a patientwith special health care needs. Experience since publication of the 1999 statement has identied thefollowing: The EIF has been underused, because many health care providers and fam-ilies of children with special healthcare needs are unaware of the EIF. Many providers consider EIF comple-tion to be time-consuming and do notrecognize the need for the EIF. The paper-based EIF is helpful but suboptimal for incorporation intoelectronic health records (EHRs)and for central repository access. 10 Maintaining and/or updating EIFs canbedifcultandtime-consuming. Vaccine schedules and require- ments change frequently, so the im-munization table on the EIF needs tobe able to accommodate these changes. Disaster-management plans must in- clude medical care for children withspecial health care needs. If a disas-ter compromises the availability ofhealth records, an EIF would be bene-cial in providing useful informationsuch as medication doses. 11,12 ADVANCING THE EIF TO A COMPUTER APPLICATION The computerized EIF can be easily updated with new information (eg,newly identied allergies, change inseverity, addition of new problems,change in advance directives,change in specialists and their con-tact information) and provides anautomated date stamp as to when itwas most recently updated. The computerized EIF can be modi- ed to accommodate systemchanges, such as legal require-ments, immunization tables, andconsents. A paper form physically limits the amount of information provided onthe form and is not sufcientlyadaptable for patients with a largeset of problems. A computerized EIFcan expand and adapt to the needsof the patient. The use of a computer-based EIF permits a central repositorythrough which the EIF can be ac-cessed remotely via the Internetrapidly. A capability to access anumber of EIFs can also be built intosuch a system to facilitate a coordi-nated disaster response for chil-dren with special health care needs. Computerization of EIFs facilitates quality-improvement measures tar-getedatchildrenwithspecialhealthcare needs and the use of the EIF. Computerization of EIFs facilitates the deployment of EIFs as a data-base that can be integrated into theEHR and can potentially be shared and networked between compatiblehospitals and systems. A computerized EIF can accept tem- plates or cut-and-paste managementroutines (clinical pathways) that arefrequentlyrecommended,suchasthestandard initial management of achild with tetralogy of Fallot. It should be noted that a computer- ized EIF might not be retrievable in theevent of a power failure or damage tocommunication infrastructure (in-cludes the Internet). An inkjet-printedpaper document will smear. A water-resistant paper document or a\"thumb drive\" or compact disc con-taining the le in a plastic bag (to-gether with insurance papers andotherkeydocuments)ismorelikelytobe usable under certain disasterconditions. EXPANDING THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF THE EIF The process of initiating an EIF by the medical home and the patient'sspecialists should include a reviewof likely emergencies and recom-mended therapies in the event of anacute exacerbation ists encountering their patients forthe rst time and facilitates the cod-ication of initial management mea-sures to improve communicationwith other care providers involvedin the patient's care. Examples ofthis include which laboratory testsshould be ordered for a patient withan inborn error of metabolism,what type of intravenous fluidshould be started, and whether thepatient should be fed or kept off oralintake (NPO). Because EIF use is not yet routine, quality-improvement programsshould target EIF initiation and 830 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS by guest on July 18, 2018 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from maintenance, and this should be added to the growing list of qualityindicators for a primary care medi-cal home that manages childrenwith special health care needs. 9 The process of initiating an EIF af- fords the primary care physicianand appropriate specialists an op-portunity to further explore and dis-cuss the difcult issues surround-ing end-of-life care options forchildren and the inclusion of ad-vance directives. Updating the EIFpermits recurring opportunities toconrm or update these advance di-rectives. Many states have an of-cial form that permits out-of-hospitalproviderstohonoradvancedirectives that must be completed,and in these instances, this formcould be electronically attached tothe EIF, or the EIF could list the phys-ical or online location of the com-pleted ofcial form. The process of initiating and main- taining an EIF should include an ac-tion plan for a disaster and amethod to monitor disaster pre-paredness as part of a quality-improvement program. QUALITY-IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS USING THE EIF \"EIF maintenance\" includes the ini- tial EIF as well as updating it whenappropriate and conrming its va-lidity during each health care visit.Each review or modication of theEIF should be dated. Thepercentageofchildrenwithspe- cial health care needs with an EIF inapracticecanbeauditedbydividingthe number of EIFs in the practicethat are known to exist by all chil-dren with special health care needsin the medical home primary carepractice (EIF-eligible patients). Acentral repository of computerizedEIFs would facilitate the identica-tion of all the EIFs in the practice.Improvements in this percentage demonstrate quality improvement. EIF maintenance can be monitored by the mean number of days sincethe last EIF update or conrmationfor all the EIFs in the practice. Re-ducing this mean value demon-strates quality improvement, be-cause more-current EIFs are moreaccurate. The EIF can be used to track the par- ticipation level and frequency of di-saster drills. Whether this is an ac-tual drill done at home or adiscussion or mental review of whattodointheeventofaspecictypeofdisaster can be documented in theEIF.Becauseelectricalpowerfailureis such a common event, the EIFshould document that an actionplan for this has been reviewed withthe family and whether an actualtrial or drill has been done at home.The percentages of EIFs with a doc-umented electrical power failureaction plan review and/or an actualhome drill can be used as a qualityparameter. Increasing percentagesdemonstrate quality improvement.As this number approaches 100%,further quality improvement can bedocumented by monitoring themean number of days since the lastelectrical power failure action planreview and/or actual home drill. Re-ducing this mean value demon-strates quality improvement, be-cause recent review and practice ofa disaster action plan should im-prove the likelihood of success. EIF CENTRAL REPOSITORY A central repository would provide access by primary care providers, patients, parents, pharmacies, otherspecialists, and emergency carepractitioners. Although central EIF-repository conflict with measures thatpreserve condentiality of protectedpatient information. Routine access can be secured by user authentication via the standardmethod (log in plus password). Knownauthorized users have access to the EIFs of patients with whom they areknown to be linked but not to those ofother patients, which permits the ex-pected users of the EIF to have easy access to conrm, update, and revisethe EIF at each routine visit. Emergency access to the EIF is a more difcult issue. The Midwest EmergencyMedical Services for Children Informa-tion System (www.memscis.org) is anEIF central repository program in Min-nesota that uses a \"break-the-glass\"entry for emergency access to EIFinformation. 10This terminology clearly distinguishes routine EIF-maintenance activities from emer-gency information access. Emergencyaccess via the \"glass breaker\" is ob-tained by entering the requestor'sidentifying information. No systemwith broad access can totally guaran-tee patient condentiality. The Internet is far-reaching and is the obvious means to achieve broad ac-cess via a centralized server or alinked set of servers. Sophisticatedtraces can identify unauthorized ac-cess sources; however, tracing accessfrom public terminals, unauthorizeduse of an open terminal, freestandingInternet stations, unsecured wireless networks, and foreign-country accessis substantially more difcult orimpossible. Although high security is desired to protect patient information when de-veloping new information systems, itshould be noted that standard paper-record systems in use have relativelylow security/protection measures.Parents and patients should be madeFROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS PEDIATRICS Volume 125, Number 4, April 2010 831 by guest on July 18, 2018 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from aware of the inherent compromises in patient condentiality that must bemade to facilitate emergency access.Although perfect condentiality is of-ten expected or desired, it is unrealis-tic, especially when compared with thecurrent security status of all healthrecords (paper and electronic). The Midwest Emergency Medical Ser- vices for Children Information Systemhas demonstrated feasibility on asmaller scale, and its experience sug-gests the need for the advocacy of lo-cal physician champions and referralcenter entities for enrollment successto be achieved. 10 THE ROLE OF THE EIF IN PREPARING FOR A DISASTER11,12 The EIF permits many different health care providers, regardless ofbackground, to provide initial careto children with special health careneeds. The EIF should include a plan in the event of a disaster, the most com-mon of which is the loss of electricalpower. Lack of access to medica-tions, water, food, shelter, andtransportation should also be con-sidered. At a minimum, medicalhome practitioners should considerthe planned response for likelyemergencies and disasters. For technology-dependent children, the loss of electrical power (a com-mon occurrence even in the ab-sence of natural disasters) is a sig-nicant disaster event. A simpletemporizing measure is that all crit-ical life-support devices should in-clude an internal battery back-up, apower-failure and a second-ary means of back-up power (seeTechnical Appendix 1). A hospital'sback-up generator electricity is afairly reliable source of electricity,and transport to the hospital to useit can be considered, but it shouldnot be relied on entirely, becauseback-up generators are not always reliable, there might be signicanttrafc getting to the hospital, andthere might be overcrowding at thehospital because of other patientsdoing the same thing. Identifying al-ternate sites of back-up powershould be part of a disaster plan.Hospitals should anticipate theirrole as a source of electrical powerduring a prolonged power failureand should plan back-up generatorcapacity to meet the needs ofthe hospital plus the needs oftechnology-dependent patients whoare likely to use the hospital's elec-trical power. The EIF should include a prompt to enter the date of the most recentdisaster drill for the most commontype of disaster that is anticipated,such as the loss of electrical power. The different types, severity, and du- ration of disasters make it practi-cally impossible to develop a singleaction plan to specically and com-prehensively manage all disasters.Some geographic regions are moreprone to specic types of disasters,and some patients are particularlymore vulnerable to specic types ofdisasters. Determining the mostlikely disaster (after electricalpower failure) is geographic andpatient specic. Extreme disasters are uncommon, yet survivability during an extremedisaster depends on being pre-pared in knowing what to do andhaving the necessary equipment and resources to survive. Extremeand less common disasters aremore difcult to drill and are morerealistically reviewed with mentalexercises that verbally simulatewhat might happen and what the re-sponse would be. Because disasters are usually un- common and difcult to predict, itmight be more useful to prepare forgeneric categories of shortages rather than for a specic type of di-saster. For example, several differ-ent types of disasters will result inthe nonavailability of an importantresource that is normally available,such as food, water, shelter, cloth-ing, medication, electrical power,transportation, and medical ser-vices. However, mass trauma,bioagent, chemical, or radiation ex-posure disasters represent chal-lenges that are not necessarily re-lated to resource shortages. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Medical home primary care phy- sicians (ideally together withmotivated families) are the mostqualied persons to globally coor-dinate completion of the EIF forchildren with special health obtaining specic the pertinentspecialists (eg, what type of intra-venous fluid to use for a patient withametabolicconditionorwhat antidysrhythmia measures shouldbe tried rst in a patient with re-current dysrhythmias).

Updating the EIFpermits recurring opportunities toconrm or update these advance di-rectives. Many states have an of-cial form that permits out-of-hospitalproviderstohonoradvancedirectives that must be completed,and in these instances, this formcould be electronically attached tothe EIF, or the EIF could list the phys-ical or online location of the com-pleted ofcial form. The process of initiating and main- taining an EIF should include an ac- tion plan for a disaster and amethod to monitor disaster pre-paredness as part of a quality-improvement program. QUALITY-IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS USING THE EIF \"EIF maintenance\" includes the ini- tial EIF as well as updating it whenappropriate and conrming its va-lidity during each health care visit.Each review or modication of theEIF should be dated. Thepercentageofchildrenwithspe- cial health care needs with an EIF inapracticecanbeauditedbydividingthe number of EIFs in the practicethat are known to exist by all chil-dren with special health care needsin the medical home primary carepractice (EIF-eligible patients). Acentral repository of computerizedEIFs would facilitate the identica-tion of all the EIFs in the practice.Improvements in this percentage demonstrate quality improvement. EIF maintenance can be monitored by the mean number of days sincethe last EIF update or conrmationfor all the EIFs in the practice. Re-ducing this mean value demon-strates quality improvement, be-cause more-current EIFs are moreaccurate. The EIF can be used to track the par- ticipation level and frequency of di-saster drills. Whether this is an ac-tual drill done at home or adiscussion or mental review of whattodointheeventofaspecictypeofdisaster can be documented in theEIF.Becauseelectricalpowerfailureis such a common event, the EIFshould document that an actionplan for this has been reviewed withthe family and whether an actualtrial or drill has been done at home.The percentages of EIFs with a doc-umented electrical power failureaction plan review and/or an actualhome drill can be used as a qualityparameter. Increasing percentagesdemonstrate quality improvement.As this number approaches 100%,further quality improvement can bedocumented by monitoring themean number of days since the lastelectrical power failure action planreview and/or actual home drill. Re-ducing this mean value demon-strates quality improvement, be-cause recent review and practice ofa disaster action plan should im-prove the likelihood of success. EIF CENTRAL REPOSITORY A central repository would provide access by primary care providers, patients, parents, pharmacies, otherspecialists, and emergency carepractitioners. Although central EIF-repository conflict with measures thatpreserve condentiality of protectedpatient information. Routine access can be secured by user authentication via the standardmethod (log in plus password). Knownauthorized users have access to the EIFs of patients with whom they areknown to be linked but not to those ofother patients, which permits the ex-pected users of the EIF to have easyaccess to conrm, update, and revisethe EIF at each routine visit. Emergency access to the EIF is a more difcult issue. The Midwest EmergencyMedical Services for Children Informa-tion System (www.memscis.org) is anEIF central repository program in Min-nesota that uses a \"break-the-glass\"entry for emergency access to EIFinformation. 10This terminology clearly distinguishes routine EIF-maintenance activities from emer-gency information access. Emergencyaccess via the \"glass breaker\" is ob-tained by entering the requestor'sidentifying information. No systemwith broad access can totally guaran-tee patient condentiality. The Internet is far-reaching and is the obvious means to achieve broad ac-cess via a centralized server or alinked set of servers. Sophisticatedtraces can identify unauthorized ac-cess sources; however, tracing accessfrom public terminals, unauthorizeduse of an open terminal, freestandingInternet stations, unsecured wireless networks, and foreign-country accessis substantially more difcult orimpossible. Although high security is desired to protect patient information when de-veloping new information systems, itshould be noted that standard paper-record systems in use have relativelylow security/protection measures.Parents and patients should be madeFROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS PEDIATRICS Volume 125, Number 4, April 2010 831 by guest on July 18, 2018 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from aware of the inherent compromises in patient condentiality that must bemade to facilitate emergency access.Although perfect condentiality is of-ten expected or desired, it is unrealis-tic, especially when compared with thecurrent security status of all healthrecords (paper and electronic). The Midwest Emergency Medical Ser- vices for Children Information Systemhas demonstrated feasibility on asmaller scale, and its experience sug-gests the need for the advocacy of lo-cal physician champions and referralcenter entities for enrollment successto be achieved. 10 THE ROLE OF THE EIF IN PREPARING FOR A DISASTER11,12 The EIF permits many different health care providers, regardless ofbackground, to provide initial careto children with special health careneeds. The EIF should include a plan in the event of a disaster, the most com-mon of which is the loss of electricalpower. Lack of access to medica- tions, water, food, shelter, andtransportation should also be con-sidered. At a minimum, medical home practitioners should considerthe planned response for likelyemergencies and disasters. For technology-dependent children, the loss of electrical power (a com-mon occurrence even in the ab-sence of natural disasters) is a sig-nicant disaster event. A simpletemporizing measure is that all crit-ical life-support devices should in-clude an internal battery back-up, apower-failure and a second-ary of back-up power (seeTechnical Appendix 1). A hospital's back-up generator electricity is a fairly reliable source of electricity,and transport to the hospital to useit can be considered, but it shouldnot be relied on entirely, becauseback-up generators are not always reliable, there might be signicanttrafc getting to the hospital, andthere might be overcrowding at thehospital because of other patientsdoing the same thing. Identifying al-ternate sites of back-up powershould be part of a disaster plan.Hospitals should anticipate theirrole as a source of electrical powerduring a prolonged power failureand should plan back-up generatorcapacity to meet the needs ofthe hospital plus the needs oftechnology-dependent patients whoare likely to use the hospital's elec-trical power.

However, mass trauma,bioagent, chemical, or radiation ex-posure disasters represent chal-lenges that are not necessarily re-lated to resource shortages. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Medical home primary care phy- sicians (ideally together withmotivated families) are the mostqualied persons to globally coor-dinate completion of the EIF forchildren with special health obtaining specic the pertinentspecialists (eg, what type of intra-venous fluid to use for a patient withametabolicconditionorwhat antidysrhythmia measures shouldbe tried rst in a patient with re-current dysrhythmias).

CompletionoftheEIFshouldbethe responsibility of the medical homeprimary care physician and spe-cialty care providers for everychild with special health careneeds. Medical home primarycare physicians should bestrongly encouraged to include anEIF as part of the patient's healthcare maintenance and medicalhome. For the onset of new condi-tions for which the tertiary pediat-ric center has initial access to thepatient, an EIF should be initiatedduring hospitalization (eg, a pre-terminfantisborn,hospitalizationfor newly diagnosed diabetes mel- litus, hospitalization for a trau-matic brain injury sustained in anautomobile collision). 3. Ideally, EIFs should be reviewed periodically by local emergency care providers to conrm that therecommendations are clear andthat the necessary specialized equipment, medications, and ser-vices are available at the emer-gency care center. 4. EIFmaintenanceshouldbearoutine part of the ongoing care of childrenwith special health care needs andshould be performed every 6months (and at each health encoun-ter as needed) to conrm the valid-ity of the EIF and/or update specicchanges in the patient's clinical sta-tus on the EIF. 5. End-of-life planning and advance- directive updates and conrma-tions should be included in theEIF-maintenance process whenappropriate. The EIF affords medi-cal home primary care physicianswith an opportunity to discuss thismost difcult but necessary topicas part of the patient's ongoingcare. This can also serve as a re-minder for the medical home pri-mary care physician to discusswith the family the need for anyforms required by out-of-hospitalproviders to honor advancedirectives. 6. A central standardized electronic repository of EIFs needs to be es-tablished and maintained to facili-tate updates to and retrieval ofEIFs. The repository should be setup by a national medical leadagency, such as the AAP and/orthe ACEP, a private national healthcare organization, and/or anagency of the federal government. 7. An electronic EIF that is compliant with existing American Society forTesting and Materials Continuity of Care Record (ASTM CCR) andHealth Level 7 Continuity of CareDocument (HL 7 with HIPAA requirementsshould be endorsed by the AAPand ACEP as a rst step toward anational repository of EIFs. Whenpossible, the EIF data elementsshould use standardized nomen-clature such as the SystematizedNomenclature of Medicine(SNOMED). In addition, the EIF should be accessible via the In-ternet. EIF standardization willfacilitate EHR development andhelp to ensure that the contentof the EIF is accessible in a vari-ety of clinical settings. 8. A central repository does not guar- antee availability of the information.A water-resistant paper documentor a thumb drive or compact discthat contains the le, kept in a plas-tic bag (together with insurance pa-pers and other key documents), ismore likely to be usable under cer-tain disaster conditions. 9. Quality-improvement parameters of EIF use and maintenance shouldbe added to the growing list ofquality indicators for a primarycare medical home. 10. Disaster planning should be in- cluded as part of the EIF-maintenance process. Medicalhome primary care providersmust consider and anticipate themost likely emergencies and otherpotentially serious disasters and review the planned response withpatients and caregivers. At a mini-mum, medical home practitionersshould consider the planned re-sponse for likely emergencies anddisasters. 11. Although it might be an expecta- tion that the computerized EIFshould be included in this policystatement, the specications ofcreating a computerized entity with all the functionality describedis a difcult task given the evolu-tion of computer systems, EHRs,access methods, condentiality/security requirements, and the ex-perience of pilot projects that arecurrently determining the bestway to achieve this. The actualcomputerized EIF and a reason-able implementation plan shouldbe developed into a technical re-port to follow. Although other com-puterized EIF entities have beenproposed, it would be prematurefor the AAP to endorse any of theseat this time. A sample computer-ized EIF is provided for reference(see Appendix 2). The paper EIFversion (www.aap.org/advocacy/eif.doc) contained in the statement (www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/fu ll/104/4/e53) can still be manually modied toachieve part of the functionalitydescribed above until a computer-izedEIFstandardcanbedevelopedand recommended. 12. Fair reimbursement for these ser- vices is necessary. Initiating, com-pleting, and maintaining an EIF andother quality-improvement activi-ties associated with the EIF addvalue but are time-consuming activ-ities that optimize care coordinationfor children with special health careneeds. Optimal care coordination isworthy of and, indeed, contingent onfair reimbursement for these ser-vices by medical home primary careand specialty care providers. Cur- rent Procedural Terminology (CPT) codesfortelephonecalls,prolonged service, team conferences, andcare-plan oversight and manage- ment already exist and can be usedtobillfortheseservices.Reimburse- ment for these services should be a standard part of all health benetpackages.

By plugging into a 12-V life-support device can befurthersustainedbyusingtheautomo-bile's battery, which can providepower on its own for a moderate pe-riod (depending on the power require-ments of the life-support device) and indenitely as long the automobile'sengine is running (until the car runsout of gas). There are different powercapacities of 12-V inverters (measuredin watts) that must exceed the sum to- tal of the power requirements of the life-support devices required by thepatient. For example, if the patient'sventilator is rated at 110 to 120 VAC,100 W, and the patient's oxygen con-centrator is rated at 110 to 120 VAC,150 W, then the 12-V inverters must beable to match this power capacity. Thiscan be accomplished by having two 12-V inverters (one rated at /H11022100 W and the other rated at /H11022150 W) or asingle 12-V inverter rated at more than 250 W. Using two 12-V inverters re-quires that 2 cigarette-lighter socketsbe available. in-verter requires that this inverter havetwo 120-VAC outlet sockets on the in-verter to accommodate both devices. Thepowerratingsofthe12-Vinvert- ers are limited by the electrical cur-rent capacity of the automobile's wir-ing and fuses. Typically, most cigarettelighters are on 20-ampere 10-A) lines, which meansthat if the 12-V inverter draws morethan 20 A of current, the fuse will blow(break) and no power will be availableuntil the fuse is replaced. Replacingthe fuse with a 30-A fuse (ie, one that israted higher than what is in the car) isdangerous, because the higher cur-rent will exceed the electrical-currentcapacity of the wiring and could causea re. Power in watts is calculated bymultiplying voltage and current (am-peres). Thus, the 20-A circuit fuse lim-its the maximum wattage to 240 W (12V/H1100320 A). Having 2 cigarette-lighter sockets in the same car does not in-crease this maximum, because it islikely that both cigarette lighter out-lets are on the same circuit. If the sumexceeds20Aor240W,the20-Afusewillstill blow. The watt rating (power rating) of the life-support device should bestamped on the device itself. If it is not,then the current rating (in amperes ormilliamperes) should be stamped. Ifthe device plugs into a standardhousehold outlet, it will be rated at 120VAC. If the device is rated at 1.5 A, thenthepowerratingwillbe180W(120V /H11003 1.5 A). The power rating (in watts) ofthe 12-V inverter must exceed thepower rating of the life-support device.These calculations are all theoreticaland must be tested in a drill to deter-mine if everything will actually work.During the drill, it should be conrmedthat the life-support device is in factrunning off of the 12-V inverter and notthe device's internal battery. Depleting the internal battery will test the 12-Vinverter's ability to charge the batteryas well, but a back-up power optionmust be available in case this does notwork. Note that it will take more powerand current to run the life-support de-vice and charge the battery at thesame time, so the drill should testthe 12-V inverter under these morestressful conditions. Some deviceshave uneven power requirementssuch that periodic surges of powerare required. For example, a feedingpump might have a low power con-sumption while pumping formula,but its power consumption will in-crease if pumping in somethingmore viscous, such as formula withcereal. Power surges must also bewithin the range of power that theinverter can deliver. There are high-wattage (eg, 500, 1000, and 2000 W) 12-V inverters, butthey cannot be plugged into an auto- mobile cigarette lighter. They can runoff of an automobile battery directlywith high-capacity cables. This re-quires more technical expertise and ismore risky, because there is the possi-bility of a battery short circuit, whichcould melt wires, damage the life- support device, or cause a re. If thelife-support device requires such highpower, it would be useful to get sometechnical advice on how to do this. Theprocess is similar to \"jumping\" a deadcar battery with jumper cables. A high-wattage life-support device will de-plete the automobile's battery rapidly,so the car's engine should be running to prevent the battery from dying. Theprocess of starting the car (ie, turningthe key) will place a large stress on thecar'sbatterybriefly,whichcouldcauseabrief decrease in power to the life-support device if it is running on thecar's battery when the car is started. Portable generators can also be used to provide electrical power.Thesegeneratorsrequiregasolineand FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS PEDIATRICS Volume 125, Number 4, April 2010 835 by guest on July 18, 2018 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from motor oil to run. Small generators are rated at approximately 500 W, withlarger generators capable of 5000 Wand higher. Generators are fairly reli-able, but they are often kept in storageand difcult to access when they aresuddenly needed. Also, storage doesnot necessarily guarantee that thegenerator will work when it is needed.It should be noted that gasoline cannotbe stored. Its composition changeswith time, and old gasoline will likelydamage the generator (similar to put-ting gum in it) regardless of whetherthe gasoline is stored in the genera-tor's tank or in a gasoline-storage con-tainer. Because gasoline cannot beeasily stored, it is often siphoned fromautomobile gas tanks. This can be haz-ardous to the siphoner's lungs if doneincorrectly. Most generators requirespecial motor oil, so several liters ofthe correct oil need to be available when the generator is run. All of thesefactors require that periodic drills bedone to be certain that the generatorwill run when it is needed. Follow thegenerator's maintenance instructionsduring periods of nonuse to reduce thelikelihood of generator failure when itis truly needed. The generator or automobile en- gine must be run in a well-ventilatedlocation to avoid carbon monoxideaccumulation. When traveling out-side of the United States, it should benoted that different countries usedifferent voltage, current, and outlet-socket congurations. Sophisticated generators that burn propane, natural gas, liquid petroleumgas, diesel fuel, or fuel oil or use fuelcells are much more expensive and be-yond the scope of this report.Disclaimer: The information con- tained in Technical Appendix 1 doesnot represent the opinion, recommen-dation, or policy of the AAP and is pro-vided for information and consider- ation only.

When the hospital's MCI plan is ac vated, disaster triage ac ons are the rst step in pa ent care. Disaster triage is a cornerstone of fair and successful medical management in an MCI. Disaster triage requires a paradigm shi away from the daily rou ne and towards priori zing treatment and transporta on assets. Thus, the hospital is working for the greatest amo unt of good for the greatest number of pa ents. De ni ons 1. Rou ne Triage: Process of determining the priority of pa ents' treatments based on their severity. Typically, Emergency Departments use the Emergency Severity Index to guide their opera ons. 2. Disaster Triage: Sor ng and alloca on of treatment to pa ents/vic ms according to a system of priori es designed to maximize the number of survivors. Field Triage Done at the scene of a MCI by Emergency Medical Services to d etermine transport priori es. For pediatrics, they will employ the JumpSTART algorithm. Primary Triage Done immediately upon arrival to the hospital at Emergency De partment. U lizes the pediatric JumpSTART algorithm and establishes if the eld triage determina on is s ll accurate or needs to be updated. Secondary Triage Clincal assessment to priori ze the pa ent's care needs, place orders, and render ini al care. May be infl uenced by which resources are unavailable to provide the care needed due to disaster condi ons.

Reverse Triage: Rapidly crea ng inpa ent surge capacity by iden fying hospitalized pa ents who do not require major medical assistance for at least 96 hours, and who only have a small risk of serious complica ons resul ng from early discharge. Planning Guidelines/Assump ons The objec ve of a hospital's pediatric triage plan is to op mize the number of pediatric vic ms triaged in an MCI to improve resource alloca on, and reduce emo onal burden on triage personnel. An important skill in disaster triage is the ability to dis nguish those requiring immediate lifesaving care, from those who can receive delayed care, and making these decisions based on survivability. The use of disaster triage involves a change of thinking from e very day care. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 5: Pediatric Disaster Triage Planning Guidelines/Assump ons (cont.) In a disaster/MCI hospital will a empt to: 1. Iden fy vic ms with the best chance of survival for immediate interven on. Focus will be on the care for those with serious and cri cal injuries, but who are salvageable. 2. Iden fy vic ms by sor ng those who are lightly injured and those who are so severely injured that they will not survive.3. Provide high intensity or cri cal care to the sickest vic ms, while balancing the greatest good for the greatest number.4. Provide immediate treatment to only those vic ms for whom procedures or interven ons may make a di erence in survival. 5. Implement altered standards of care based on resource availa bility. As of yet, there is no one standard approach to triage that is accepted na onally. The type of triage used depends on local, regional, or state protocols/guidance. All agencies use a standard, validated triage system. This can cause inconsistency or a lack of intero perability between jurisdic ons. This module outlines triage procedures that begin at the doors of a hospital's Emergency Department. Facility-Speci c Opera onal Details I.

Develop a list of related policies/plans to this Annex to assist in cross-referencing Module Content Policies Content Plans Content The JumpSTART\u00a9 Tool For Pediatric MCI Triage By Lou E. Romig MD, FAAP, FACEP Miami Children's Hospital Medical Director FL-5 DMAT Vol. 11, Issue 2, April 2002 Disasters large and small frequent ly include pediatric victims. When faced with multiple victims or mass casualties, emergency medical services (EMS) and even emergency department personnel must be prepared to triage victims of all ages in order to assure t hat limited resources are alloc ated in the most efficient and effective manner. Primary triage, usually performed at the incident site, is a very rapid objective sorting of victims into priority categories based on physiologic threats. Each indiv idual is triaged without rega rd to the status of other victims. Secondary triage is a more subjective phase that inc ludes consideration of the detail ed patient assessment, me chanism of injury and overall numbers and acuity of other victims. The most commonly used objective primary mass casualty incident (MCI) triage system in the United States is START (Simple Triage And Rapid Tr eatment), developed by the New port Fire and Marine Department and Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, California. START has also been adop ted for use by agencies outside the United States. The START system triages victims into four categories: red is critical, yellow is delayed, green is ambulatory and black is dead or expected to die. The assessment is based o n a sequential analysis of the ability to ambulate, presence/absence of respirations , respiratory rate, capillary r efill and ability to obey simple commands. All patients who can walk are advised to clear the scene and walk to a desig nated area for secondary triage. All are initially triaged in the green category, so designated by a triage tag or a green ribbon tied around a wrist. Apneic patients are triaged in the black category if they do not start to breat h after upper airway positioning. These patients undergo no assessment for sustained circulat ion. An apneic patient who starts to breathe after up per airway positioning is triaged into the red category. Other red category indices are: a respiratory rate > 30/min, capillary refill > 2 seconds and the inability to obey simple commands. A nonambulatory pati ent with a respiratory rate of = 30, a cap refill of = 2 seconds and the ability to obey commands is triaged into the yellow (delayed) category. In essence, this means they can't walk but have adequate respirations and circulation and a neurological status that allows the patient to protect his/her own airway. The developers of START determine d they would recommend use of their system for patients who weigh 100 pounds or more. They state they never intended it for use with pediatric victims. When the EMS agencies in the Miami-Dade metropolitan area decided to use START as a unified MCI triage system, I recognized it had several pitfalls that might result in both under- and over-triage of ch ildren and so developed JumpSTART as a parallel algorithm for pediatric victims. JumpSTART may be best used in conjunction with START but can also act as a stand-alone pediatric system. JumpSTART not only sets objective criteria based on a range of pediatric \"normals\" but also helps to assure that c hildren will be triaged more by the head and less by the hea rt. Providers of all levels readily admit their tendencies to \"go the extra mile\" for child ren. Many providers have told me they would simply \"make all the kids reds,\" thereby potentially consuming resourc es that might be more e ffectively assigned and potentially exposing children to unnecessary painful and trauma tizing interventions. In a ddition, providers have admitted their hesitance to leav e a child for dead under almost any circumstances. An objective system takes the personal responsibility for making that decision away from the triage officers, thereby eas ing some of the guilt and preventing resource consumption in fruitless resuscitation effo rts. I recommend that the transition from JumpSTART to START be somewhere in the teenage years. Ages and weights ma y not be easy for triage officers to judge. Triage \"adult sized\" teens with START and smaller teens with Ju mpSTART. The JumpSTART algorithm (see Figure) parallels the START algori thm. The triage officer first instructs all who can walk to move to a designated area for secondary triage. Some ch ildren may be developmentally unable to walk (due to age or disability) or carried by their ambulatory guard ians. These children should be triaged as soon as possible at the green rendezvous point using the JumpSTART algo rithm. At that time, children meeting red criteria should be transported to the on-scene treatment area. Children who meet yellow criteria should be assessed briefly for obvious or suspected exter nal or internal injuries. Those w ith such injuries are classified as yellow (and moved Appendix A: JumpSTART Ar cleto the treatment area) and those without may be classified as g reen. Triage continues with the officer moving to the closest victim. As with START, he/she looks for spontaneous respirations. If present, the respiratory rate is assessed. If the child is apneic, the office r positions the upper airway. If no breathing ensues, JumpSTART deviates from the START algor ithm to include a pulse check. Cardiopulmonary arrest in childr en most often stems from primar y respiratory failure. Children may have a \"window of salvage ability\" in which the patient is apneic but circulat ion is still present because the heart muscle has not yet failed due to anoxia. In Jump START, the apneic patient without a peripheral pulse is tagged in the black category. Those with a peripheral pulse are given the \"jumpstart\" of five mouth-to-barrier ventilations. This is a lower airway- opening maneuver similar to the jaw-thrust or head-tilt, chin l ift used to open the upper airway. Those who remain apneic after the ventilatory tria l are tagged black. Those who start to breathe are tagged red and the triage officer moves on to the next patient . They must not stay to continue to treat the child or they are defeating the purpose of the triage officer. For those patients with initial spontaneous respirations, the a lgorithm continues in parallel with START. Note the respiratory rate parameters (15- 45/min) incorporate not only th e normally higher rates of c hildren but also reflect the significance of slow rates. The combined respiratory rate param eters for both systems can be remembered as increments of fifteen (15-30-45) . Palpation of peripheral pulse s takes the place of capillary refill, which is very dependent on environmental temperature and the rescuer's abilit y to see the refill. For the neurological assessment, the widely recognized AVPU (Alert, Verbal, Pain, Un responsive) assessment replaces ability to obey commands, which may be dependent on both the child's developmen tal and emotional stat us. Patients with response levels from alert to appropriate response to pain (loc alization of painful stimulus and localized reaction) are deemed capable of protecting their own airways and are tagg ed yellow. Those with inappropriate (generalized) response to pain, posturing or no response are tagged red. The JumpSTART algorithm satisfies a number of needs. It provide s a physiology-based, age-appropriate primary triage tool for children. Any tool that enhances any component of triage enhances the entire triage process and appropriate resource allocation fo r all victims in the MCI. Jum pSTART also addresses the emotional issues common to EMS providers with regard to children. Its objectivit y helps to exclude emotio ns from the triage process and helps to shield the provider f rom the emotional consequence s of such an extremely stressful mission. The system matches START's goal of triaging each victim within a 30 second time frame and requires only one addition to the triage officer's equipmen t, in the form of a barrier dev ice for ventilation. JumpSTART closely parallels the most widely recognized adult triage system, minimizing problems in initial training and skills retention. JumpSTART was developed for use in the f ield but can also be used by emer gency department personnel for primary triage of self-referred victims in mass casualty incidents. JumpSTART has been well received nationally, thanks in large pa rt to support from federal and state emergency medical services for children (EMSC) programs. It is currently being taught in at least ni ne states and is mandated in three states. Israel will be considering adding JumpSTART to its national protocols. JumpSTART has been included in several course curricula, including the Pediatric D isaster Life Support course and the core curriculum for the National Disaster Medical System. JumpSTART will very likel y be added to the curriculum of the CDC- sponsored First Responder training program for underdeveloped E MS systems internationally. A training video is available through the EMSC Natio nal Resource Center (www.ems-c. org).

Disaster triage: START, then SAVE - a new method of dynamic tri age for victims of a catastrophic earthquake, Benson M, Koenig a Hospital EOP Module 6: Pediatric Safe Area (PSA) Module Purpose During a pediatric surge event a hospital may serve as a safe h aven, and may need to host displaced and unaccompanied children. The hospital provides a safe space appropriate for children that are awai ng reuni ca on with parents, guardians or caregivers. The safety and secu rity needs of these children during a response is of paramount concern. Addi tonally, hospital sta may need child- care support in order to report to work for disaster response. The PSA can be stood up to support both sets of childcare needs. De ni ons 1. Pediatric Safe Area: A secure area of the hospital that ser ves as a holding area for uninjured, displaced, or released children awai ng adult caregivers/guardians/parents. 2. Children: Any dependent under the age of 18. Children with disabili es above 18 may also be covered in this de ni on. 3. Pediatric Popula on: Birth to 16 years, including age groups of neonates, infan ts, children, and adolescents. 4. Separated Child: A separated child is a child who is separa ted from both parents or from his/her previous legal or customary primary caregiver, but not nec essarily from other rela ves. These may, therefore, include children accompanied by other adult fam ily members. 5. Unaccompanied Child: A child who has been separated from bo th parents and other rela ves and is not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so. 6. Orphans: Children deprived of both parents by death. 7. Missing children: Children who have become separated from t heir families and cannot be located. 8. Parent: The birth parent or adop ve parent of a minor. 9. Legal Guardian: An adult with a legal right to physical cus tody of a minor bestowed by a court order or state law. 10. Family Member: A person related to another by blood, adop on, or marriage. Planning Guidelines/Assump ons There are four popula ons of children during a disaster to address in your PSA plann ing: 1. The injured pediatric who is a hospital pa ent as a result of the disaster. This child could become separated from the responsible adult during tr eatment. 2. The uninjured pediatric who is not a hospital pa ent but who is accompanying an adult person who is a pa ent. 3. The unaccompanied child who is not injured that has been bro ught to the hospital. 4. The children of sta that require care while their parent is at work. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 6: Pediatric Safe Area (PSA) Planning Guidelines/Assump ons (cont.) A goal of disaster care is to treat families together whenever possible. However, if caregivers and children become separated or are triaged to di erent levels of care, the hospital will secure the safety of these unaccompanied children un l government o cials or extended family can take temporary custody.

The PSA can be ac vated at any me to hold uninjured, unaccompa- nied, or discharged children who are awai ng arrival of adult caregivers. The PSA can also be used to care for the children of [Ins tu on's] sta . A Pediatric Safe Area Checklist has been provided in Appendix A to assist in the establishment of such areas. 1. PSA Ac va on Process Based on the nature of the event, the [Ins tu on] Hospital Command Center (HCC) will ac vate the PSA as needed. The PSA will be located in the Opera ons Sec on. 2. Iden ca on Process for Unaccompanied Children The rapid iden ca on of unaccompanied children within [Ins tu on] is impera ve to reduce the poten al for maltreatment, neglect, exploita on, and emo onal injury. During a pediatric surge event, [Ins tu on] will iden fy children at all points of entry that may need to be placed in the PSA to wait for a parent or adult caregiver. A. Survey all children at [Ins tu on] not accompanied by an adult. i. These children have a high probability of being listed as missing by family members. Note: the names of these children are provided to the HCC for a referral to law enforcement. B. Place a colored band on the child. i. If the child has a supervising adult, a [color] band on the child will correspond with the responsible adult. This process includes the chi ldren of sta . The informa on on the [color] band will include name of pediatric pa ent/visitor and DOB, name of adult and DOB, admission date, and date of vi sit of pediatric visitor. ii. If the child does not have a supervising adult, the child will receive a [color] band and be taken to the PSA. The informa on on the band will include name of child (if known), DOB, and date. C. Bring iden ed child to PSA. i. Once the child is iden ed, a [Ins tu on] sta member will bring them to the PSA. Each child will be registered on the PSA Registra on Form with as much informa on as possible. If no informa on is available, indicate this on the form. D. Child Pick up Procedures. i. Adults coming to claim a child they believe is in the care of the hospital must be interviewed in a separate area away from the pediatric saf e area. Reuni ca on is managed by Law Enforcement with support from the hospital. ii. If a child is not reunited with a parent or guardian and has been in the care of the facility for 24 hours, contact a Child Welfare Hotline [XXX-XXX-XXXX] to develop a plan for the child's safety and l egal custody.Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 6: Pediatric Safe Area Appendix B: Pediatric Safe Area Example SOP E. Visita on of unaccompanied minors . i. For unaccompanied minors and missing children, there are NO visitors allowed in the PSA. 3. Children of Sta Members in the PSA [Ins tu on] recognizes that in order to support a surge response, sta may need to report to work with their children. This service is not \"child care\" in t he tradi onal sense but a \"pop-up\" resource that is an emergency func on. It should not be relied on for long-term needs, but can s upport sta repor ng to work during a crisis, especially outside of their normal working hours. A . Parent brings child (under 13) to Pediatric Safe Area. i. Parent lls out registra on form and provides contact informa on while on duty in the facility. ii. Both parent and child are banded with color band. Put th e child's rst name, DOB, and parent name and contact info on both bands. iii. Parents are allowed to come visit or c heck in on their child via the PSA phone line provided at registra on. iv. Parents should provide any supplies needed to car e for special diet or hygiene needs of their child; especially diapers, formula, and food. B. Parent checks out child. i. Parent and child are checked for matching informa on on the bands. ii. Parent signs out child on PSA log. 4. Sta Access to the PSA Only [Ins tu on] sta with ac ve iden ca on badges are able to access the PSA. Consider restric ng access further to sta who have completed a background check. 5. Sta ng the PSA [Ins tu on] will assign appropriate sta to assist with the PSA. A. The Pediatric Safe Area (PSA) Coordinator will assume the responsibility of se ng up and supervising the PSA, and will be the primary conduit for HCC informa on. The PSA Coordinator can be a non-medical sta member such as a social worker, a child life specialist, or a quali ed volunteer. B. Other sta may be needed in the PSA, depending. on the number of childre n present (which will fl uctuate over me). Based on the Oregon Licensing Standards for Day Care Centers, general sta ng guidelines for the PSA are as follows: Age Range Sta Ra os Infants (newborn to 2 years) 1 sta to 4 infants Toddlers (2 years to 3 years) 1 sta to 4 toddlers Preschool (3 years to 6 years) 1 sta to 10 children School age (6+ years) 1 sta to 15 childrenPediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 6: Pediatric Safe Area Appendix B: Pediatric Safe Area Example SOP PSA sta do not have to be clinical. Look to Social Work, Child Life s pecialists, and [Ins tu on] volunteers with pediatric experience for addi onal sta ng. C. Addi onal Sta ng Considera ons i. Clinical Sta : although children in the PSA will have been assessed and/or treated for any injuries, it is highly reccomended that a clinical sta person with pediatric exper se be part of the PSA. ii. Behavioral Health: children in the PSA may begin to show fear or signs of mental health issues as a result of being involved in a disaster and separated from family. It is important to have a pediatric behavioral health spe cialist as a part of the PSA. iii. Security: Security sta may be needed in the PSA to enforce the security procedures. Children will not be able to leave without an escort, and the PSA will not allow visitors per policy. 6. Pediatric Safe Space Supply Considera ons When the PSA is ac vated, speci c supplies will be needed. [Ins tu on] will ensure these supplies are available upon ac va on: A. Basic supplies and equipment necessary for children ( rst aid kit, diapers, cots/beds/cribs) B. PSA Sta Sign-in sheet C.

Module 7: Disaster Behavioral Health (DBH) for Children & FamiliesPediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 7: DBH for Children & Families Module Purpose To describe Disaster Behavioral Health (DBH) resources availabl e internally and externally to support pa ents, families, and hospital sta during and a er a surge event. De ni ons 1. Pediatric: Children under the age of 18. Adolescents 14 and older can consent for mental health services without parental consent. 2. Trauma c Stress : A common term for reac ve anxiety and depression that can occur in a manner similar to post-trauma c stress disorder, but lacking the same intensity. 3. Disaster Behavioral Health Triage: A tool to support a disas ter behavioral response that quickly iden es individuals with mental health emergencies, and those at ri sk for more chronic disorders and impairment in mass casualty events. PsyStart is a too l commonly used to accomplish this work. 4. Vicarious Trauma: Work-related trauma exposures that can occ ur in the process of caring for others who are vic ms of violence (emo onal, physical, etc.) 5. Trauma Informed Care: An organiza onal structure and treatment framework that involves understanding, recognizing, and responding to the e ects of all types of trauma. It also emphasizes physical, psychological, and emo onal safety for both consumers and providers, and helps survivors rebuild a sense of control and empowerment. 6. Mental Health First Aid: A na onal movement to help iden fy, understand and respond to signs of mental illnesses and substance use disorders in a commun ity. In a disaster, this approach can iden fy individuals who have mentally decompensated or relapsed in substance use to cope with the stress and trauma of a disaster. 7. Psychological First Aid: An approach to helping people a ected by an emergency, disaster or trauma c event. It includes basic principles of support to promote na tural recovery. 8. Family-Centered Care: An approach to the planning, delivery, and evalua on of healthcare that is grounded in mutually bene cial partnerships among pa ents, families, and healthcare professionals.Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 7: DBH for Children & Families Planning Guidelines/Assump ons Children respond to trauma and disasters di erently than adults. There will be a large range of responses based on the child's age, developmental and cogni ve abili es, socio-cultural background, and personality. Some may have overt reac ons in the acute phase, while others may not manifest symptoms for many weeks or months. It is helpful to know age-sp eci c reac ons, however, and to know what interven ons may be bene cial. A hospital's behavioral health and/or child life sta will use speci c screening tools to iden fy children su ering from psycological and emo onal issues, and to provide or refer them and their families to appropriate interven ons, stabiliza on, and treatment. It is recommended that hospitals iden fy a pediatric disaster champion to oversee the development of a disaster behavioral health program across all emergency response opera ons in the hospital. Hospitals will be balancing the need to provide care for pa ents, with managing the impact of sta burnout and trauma (primary and vicarious). To best serve sta , Occupa onal Health o ces, in partnership w h a community health provider, can develop a plan to provide C ri cal Incident Stress Management debrie ngs on a rou ne schedule to support responder mental health. Planning for a trauma informed care environment is not something done \"Just-in -Time\" in a disaster, but done with planning and forethought. Thus, trauma informed care is not par t of this module. Minors consen ng for services is dictated by the disaster impacts, age of th e pa ent, and whether or not they are unaccompanied in the facility. Review Module 1 to learn more about Oregon's rules on informed consent for mental health services. In a disaster, keeping the focus on screening and Psychological First Aid skills will likely be within the scope of prac ce. If the pa ent indicates suicidal or self-harm idea on, the \"life or limb loss\" concept of implied consent may exi st. Consult your legal counsel and privacy o cers for speci c guidance. This module focuses on the impact of disasters on children and families, not on managing con nuity of care for mental health pa ents served by the ins tu on prior to the incident. Hospitals are encouraged to collaborate with their healthcare coali on partners to develop rapid discharge, trans- fer, or community based intensive treatment op ons to lessen the impact of inpa ent psychiatric bed use in a medical disaster.

Displacement from the child's home, community/neighborhood and even worse delayed reunification with parents can add to the child's stress. During this time parents and other supporting adults are very important as they are most familiar with the child and can respond to the child's reaction(s). For pre-adolescents and adolescents, peer support and peer engagement also becomes an important support system.

Depending on a complex dynamic of inci- dent-speci c, individual, family, and community factors, there are severa l di erent poten al path- ways individuals can take. Among the most common is the so-call ed \"resilience pathway\" which involves the ini al development of one or more post-trauma c stress symptoms. While these symptoms may partly resemble the clinical diagnosis of Post-tra uma c stress disorder (PTSD), they are transitory, sub-syndromal, and resolve without any men tal health interven on. The other most common outcome involves so-called \"chronic dysfu nc on,\" which is the develop- ment of one or more comorbid clinical condi ons that are associated with func onal impairment, and which require evidence-based interven ons such as Prolonged Exposure Cogni ve Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in the case of adults, and Trauma Focused CBT for children, to resolve. The best available epidemiological evidence (Galea et al, 2005, 2008) su ggests that somewhere between 50-90% of individuals have transitory distress while 30-40% of those directly impacted develop a new clinical disorder that they did not possess pre-event. PTSD is the most common, however it is frequently comorbid with depression, anxiety, or substance abus e disorders. There is also emerg- ing evidence that if individuals at high risk are iden ed early, within the rst weeks a er single incident trauma, and provided acute, highly truncated variants of these evidence-based interven- ons, subsequent development of clinical disorders may be reduc ed. New therapeu c approaches are therefore focused on reducing the popula on level impact of disasters and trauma c events by rapidly iden fying the high-risk subset of adults and children and providing them targeted, acute evidence-based interven ons. Adults and children who expe- rience trauma c injury and present to the Emergency Department (ED) or traum a center, either in the context of disaster, terrorism, or uninten onal injury, are a known high-risk group, and rep- resent an important sub-popula on requiring targeted risk iden ca on and linkage to e ec ve mental health interven ons. Tradi onal approaches have used symptom-based screeners to iden fy those with disorders. How- ever, in the immediate a ermath of trauma c events with pa ents presen ng to the ED or oth- er disaster medical se ngs, including up to 30 to 45 days post-event, symptom-based screeners are problema c because they both fail to di eren ate those with transitory distress trajectories (resilience pathway) from those with disorder trajectories, and because administra on of symp- tom-based screening tools are imprac cal for ED use. The PsySTART rapid mental health triage system was developed to address these limita ons. As op- posed to symptom-based PTSD screening tools, PsySTART is an evi dence-based rapid mental health triage system that can be completed by non-mental health worker s and responders. Instead of subjec ve symptoms, it relies on evidence-based, mul -variate, objec ve risk factors such as \"being trapped, deaths of family members, displacement from home, and exposure to mu lated bodies (Theinkrua et al 2006). Once familiar, prac oners can apply PsySTART in a ma er of seconds. PsySTART is currently used in hospitals and clinics, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) pre-hospital systems, schools, and mental health response teams in Los Angel es County, Sea le and King Coun- ty, the States of Tennessee and Minnesota, Lake County Californ ia, District of Columbia, and the North Central Texas Trauma Regional Advisory Council. It is a c omponent in a new Federal Emergen- cy Management Agency (FEMA) Pediatric Disaster Training Course and was part of the U.S. Depart- ment of Health and Human Services (HHS) eld responses in the Sandy Hook, Boston Marathon, and Roseburg, Oregon terrorism and ac ve shooter incidents. Using a novel informa on technology pla orm, PsySTART scores are collated into a database system that provides: Real- me situa onal awareness of a ered system of mental health risk using a rapid triage tool completed in a few seconds by non mental health workers Geo-coded informa on that is end user scalable at the individual site level (e.g . hospital, shelter, clinic, mobile team), as well as county, region, or statewide, depending on informa onal requirements Real- me \"decision support\" at the individual/clinical and popula on level Data-driven leveraging real- me PsySTART evidence-based metrics informs situa onal awareness for crea on of incident ac on plans, gap analysis, mutual aid requests, Federal Sta ord Act assistance, and vic ms of crime funding requests Metrics include, e.g. numbers at risk, sources of risk, loca ons, and also include separate informa on for children Guidance in alloca on of scarce mental health resources to those at greatest risk by an ethical, evidence-based risk protocol, conforming to \"crisis standar ds of care\" Includes \"fl oa ng triage algorithm\" which matches risk to actual available re sources, allowing available resources to reach those most at risk in real me Novel Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) compliant job ac on sheets to guide response in the hospital or clinic Common opera ng picture of popula on level risks speci c to public health emergencies (e.g. Ebola virus disease) Risks for isolated pa ents, quaran ned (including family members, co-workers etc.), \"worried well\" (including neighbors, co-workers, other fa mily members, healthcare workers), and those experiencing loss of loved one s PsySTART is the rst known metric to iden fy \"worried well\" trends, which can then inform targeted risk communica on or other crisis management strategies speci c to the healthcare se ng and popula on (e.g. in Ebola virus healthcare workers) Decision support tool for mental health workers who follow up on those at higher risk \"Solu on focused crisis interven on\" using the triage informa on to guide prac cal crisis interven on and assign individuals based on need (for example those exp eriencing loss of loved one could be matched with chaplaincy support or trained grief counselors) Stepped \"con nuum of care\" approach to provide those at risk with early int erven on to facili- tate resilience PsySTART dissemina on e orts around the United States have resulted in various \"disast er sys- tems of care\" (Schreiber, 2005) with pre-hospital emergency res ponses, emergency departments, schools, casualty collec on points, and shelters serving as common popula on level loca ons to approach risk iden ca on. This informa on can be shared across local disasters systems of care to inform recovery strategies and popula on level risk with trending by age groups and geocod- ed loca ons. Dynamic me trends for speci c PsySTART risk markers can be observed. PsySTART has been used as part of comprehensive community health disaste r epidemiology by the CDC in the American Samoa catastrophic earthquake and Tsunami (King et al, 2012) and in the California Napa Valley Earthquake (CDC, 2014). In the rst 3 weeks a er the hurricane Superstorm Sandy, the American Red Cross captured some 20,000 PsySTART triage enc ounters in New York state shel- ters (Schreiber,et al, 2012). PsySTART has also been used to es mate mental health consequences of catastrophic disasters including earthquakes in California a nd the New Madrid Seismic Zone (USGS, 2008). Currently, our research is focused on pediatric trauma pa ents. Approximately 20% of pediatric pa ents develop PTSD within the rst year a er a trauma c injury (Mehta S., Ameratunga SN., 2012). Our e orts are aimed at re ning the PsySTART predic on model with risk factor weigh ng and improved e ciency of risk iden ca on in the context of life-saving trauma care. For exam- ple, a quality improvement e ort at CHOC Children's Hospital of Orange County has incorpora ted PsySTART into its electronic medical record for comple on on every pediatric trauma ac va on. High- risk pa ents are then routed for secondary clinical assessment by the mental health team, thus leveraging the early opportunity to reduce or prevent psyc hological consequences. Once re- ned and validated, PsySTART could be incorporated into trauma assessments at EDs na onwide, poten ally leading to early iden ca on of pa ents at high risk for mental health disorders, and the opportunity for early therapeu c interven on.4/16/2019 Disaster Management: Mental Health and Naveen C.

Abstract Disaster mental health is based on the principles of 'preventiv e medicine' This principle has necessitated a paradigm shift from relief centered post-disaster management to a holistic, multi-dimensional integrated community approach of health promotion, disaster prevention, pr eparedness and mitigation. This has ignited the paradigm shift from curative to preventive aspects of disaster management. This can be understood on the basis of six 'R's such as Readiness (Prepared ness), Response (Immediate action), Relief (Sustained rescue work), Rehabilitation (Long term remedial mea sures using community resources), Recovery (Returning to normalcy) and Resilience (Fostering). Pr evalence of mental health problems in disaster affected population is found to be higher by two to th ree times than that of the general population. Along with the diagnosable mental disorders, affected community also harbours large number of sub- syndromal symptoms. Majority of the acute phase reactions and d isorders are self-limiting, whereas long- term phase disorders require assistance from mental health prof essionals. Role of psychotropic medication is very limited in preventing mental health morbidity. The role of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in mitigating the mental health morbidity appears to be promising. Role of Psychological First Aid (PFA) and debriefing is not well-established. Disaster management is a co ntinuous and integrated cyclical process of planning, organising, coordinating and implementing measures to prevent and to manage disaster effectively. Thus, now it is time to integrate public health pr inciples into disaster mental health. Keywords: Disasters , mental disorders , disaster psychiatry , disaster mental health , psychiatry , post- traumatic stress disorder , survivors INTRODUCTION In the contemporary world, disasters are inevitable truth of ou r life, preventable but completely unavoidable and they are part of our living in this complex glo balised, industrialized and civilized world. Disasters are as old as mankind. Disaster is a very a broad ter m, which implies a diverse set of circumstances from an act of terrorism (manmade disaster) to na tural calamities like earth quake.1 1 Health Perspective https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4649821/?report=pr intable 2/18Developing countries are at high-risk for disaster proneness an d also they have to face challenges like poverty, meager resources, illiteracy, poor infrastructure, cor ruption, lack of trained manpower and poor knowledge of disaster mental health.[ 1] Disasters are known to have substantial effect on both physic al and mental health of the affected population.[ 2] The burning issue is, what constitutes a disaster? Can a railway accident be a disaster? Terrorist attack? Religious Rio ts? War? Rapid spread of Ebola virus? Difficulty to define a disaster has been further accentuated by the inconsistent use of terminologies such as calamity, catastrophe, crisis, emergency, misfortune, tragedy, trauma and stress. Defining 'Disaster' is inevitable because it poses a real challenge to any country to know what to include and what not, for planning, policy making, legislation and for research purpose. Disasters cannot be avoided completely but we need to learn how to prepare, respond, recover, rehabilitate and re-integrate. There is a need to understand the effects of disaster on health so that precaution ary measures can be adopted to mitigate the suffering. Hence, this article attempts to define, classify and discuss the management of disasters from mental health perspective. METHODOLOGY OF THE REVIEW The authors conducted an electronic search of articles publishe d in 'Pubmed' from 1978 to March 2013. The term 'disaster planning' was introduced in pubmed MeSH voca bulary as early as 1978. The MeSH term such as 'disaster planning' [Mesh] were combined with vari ous terms using Boolean operator (AND). A PUBMED search for all published studies involving disaster me ntal health/disaster psychiatry was performed till 2013. To answer the objectives of the review fol lowing MeSH Boolean operator (AND) was also employed in combination of the above key words. In addition, th e reference sections of major articles, and reviews were also screened. We employed the usual hierarchy of evidence to write the review. Systematic reviews and meta- analyses of randomised controlled studies (RC T) were considered the best evidence base followed by RCTs, open-label studies, case series and case reports. In addition, we also considered clinical, consensus and disaster guidelines in writing this edu cational review. WHAT IS DISASTER? The root of the word disaster (\"bad star\" in Greek) comes from an astrological idea that whe n the stars are in a bad position a bad event will happen.[ 3] Disasters can be simply defined as violent encounters with nature, technology or humankind.[ 4] In 1978, Lazarus & Cohen defined it as a specific cataclysmic event, that is, a stressor depicted by immense power, large scope, sud denness, and placing excessive demands on individual coping.[ 5] Similarly, in 1992 the World Health Organisation's (WHO) defi ned disaster as 'a severe disruption, ecological and psychosocial, which greatly e xceeds the coping capacity of the affected community'.[ 6] In 1995, Federal Emergency Management Agency of US have defined 'disaster' as, 'Any natural catastrophe, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion that causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant assistance supplementing State, local, and disaster relief organization efforts to alleviate damage, loss, hardship, or suffering'.[ 7] The Disaster Management Act 2005 of India[ 8], disaster is defined as a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or manmade c auses, or be accident or negligence which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or damag e to, and destruction of property, or damage to, or degradation of, environment, and is of such a nature or magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area. From above various definitions it is clear that there is no one single acceptable definition of disaster. However, there are some common characteristics across all defin itions. They are:4/16/2019 Disaster Management: Mental Health 3/18a. Sudden onset, b. Unpredictability, c. Uncontrollability, d. Huge magnitude of destruction, e. Human loss and suffering and f. Greatly exceed the coping capacity of the affected community . HOW CAN WE CLASSIFY DISASTERS? Disaster can be classified as natural and manmade ones.[ 9] Natural disasters are usually considered as 'Acts of God' to punish human beings for their past deeds and a re frequently referred to as 'Karma' . This attribution has positive consequences in terms of coping and ne gative consequences by way of hindering planning and preparedness.[ 9] In terms of evoking mental health morbidity, natural disaster s are mild in nature, human errors and technological accidents are moderate i n nature and willful acts like terrorism are most severe in nature.[ 10] Furthermore, in rare instances these survivors may become per petrators of the disaster to avenge their sufferings. This is well-known in war and terrorist attack.[ 11] WHAT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF DISASTER MENTAL HEALTH? Disaster mental health services are based on the principles of 'preventive medicine'.[ 12] This principle of 'prevention' has necessitated a paradigm shift from relief cent ered post-disaster management to a holistic, multi-dimensional integrated community approach.[ 13] This has ignited the paradigm shift from curative to preventive aspects of disaster management. This can be under stood on the basis of six 'R's such as Readiness (Preparedness), Response (Immediate action), Relief ( Sustained rescue work), Rehabilitation (Long term remedial measures using community resources), Recove ry (Returning to normalcy) and Resilience (Fostering).[ 14,15] WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF DISASTER MENTAL HEALTH? Community's and individual's reactions to the disaster usually follow a predictable phase as shown in Figure 1 . They are heroic phase, honeymoon phase, disillusionment phase and restoration phase.[ 1] Immediately after the disaster, survivors in the community usua lly show altruistic behaviour in the form of rescuing, sheltering, feeding, and supporting the fellow human beings. Hence this phase is called as heroic phase. This phase usually lasts from a day to weeks depending u pon the severity, duration of exposure and availability of the relief sources from various agencies. Once the relief agencies step in, survivors are relocated to safer places like relief camps. Media attention, f ree medical aid, free food and shelter, VIP visits to the camp, administrations' sympathy, compensation pac kage, rehabilitation promises provides immense sense of relief and faith in survivors that their commu nity will be restored in no time and their loss will be accounted through monetary benefits. Hence this ph ase is called honeymoon phase, which usually lasts for 2-4 weeks. At the end of 2-4 weeks, relief materials and resources start w eaning. VIPs and politicians visit stops. Media coverage reduces. Administration, relief agencies and NGO 's involvement start fading. This brings the survivors to the ruthless world of post disaster life. The reality of complex process of rebuilding and rehabilitating appears a distant dream because of administratio n hurdles, bureaucratic red tapism, discrimination, injustice and corruption. This harsh reality of the disillusionment phase provides a fertile soil for breeding mental morbidity which lasts for 3-36 months before the community restores to harmony. The role of mental health workers is immense during this phase. WHAT ARE THE NORMAL HUMAN RESPONSES TO A DISASTER?4/16/2019 Disaster Management: Mental Health Perspective https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4649821/?report=pr intable 4/18Grief is the response to any loss. Grief reactions are normal r esponses to abnormal situations. Its intensity is directly proportional to the severity, duration and intensit y of exposure to the disaster. Grief process occurs through various stages[ 16] and are often experienced in waves or cycles or episodes with periods of intense and painful emotions. Usually normal grief follows the above phases with a possibility of some variation and resolves over a period of few months. Remember, s urvivours are normal people in abnormal situations. This issue needs to be kept in mind. The validation of their emotions needs to be done during the therapy to address the issue of: a. Survivor's guilt, b. Fear of losing control on overwhelming emotions, c. Becoming mentally ill, d. Substance use, e. Death wishes and suicidal ideas. By validation of emotions a sense of justification is provided to the overwhelming emotions. WHAT ARE THE ABNORMAL HUMAN RESPONSES TO A DISASTER? A recent study reported that the existence of complicated grief in more than two-thirds of the survivors of the earthquake.[ 17] Abnormal grief reactions can be grossly classified into delay ed, absent, oscillating and exploding grief responses.[ 18] Abnormal or complicated because they interfere in the process of healing and also interfere in the biological, social and occupational f unctioning.[ 19] Resolution of abnormal grief reaction can be facilitated in these groups by fostering the cu ltural-religious rituals of grieving. Hence, the mental health professional needs to liaison with the disaster r elief administration, educate them regarding proper closure of the missing people and to facilitate the mass grieving through cultural-religious death rituals of grieving. Many of the survivors may require trauma/g rief-focused interventions, within a comprehensive disaster recovery programme.[ 20] WHAT IS THE PREVALENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH MORBIDITY IN DISASTER AFFECTED POPULATION? Prevalence of mental morbidity in disaster affected population varies from 8.6 to 57.3 percent.[ 21] This magnitude of variation can be attributed to methodology of the study, defining a 'case', sampling procedure, timing of the study, recall bias, systematic under-r eporting, cross-cultural differences and type and severity of the disaster.[ 22] Mental health disorders noted during disasters can be classifie d into acute phase (1-3 months) and long- term phase (>3 months). Majority of the acute phase reactions a nd disorders are self-limiting, whereas long-term phase disorders require assistance from mental health professionals. Along with the diagnosable mental disorders, affected community also harbors large number of sub-syndromal symptoms population. Majority of them report of medically unexplained somatic sympto ms, and unusual symptom clusters are classically seen.[ 23] Mental health professionals should be aware of this phenomeno n and restrain themselves from labeling this population with mental disorder a nd treating them aggressively with medications.[ 12] Overall, prevalence rates of mental morbidity can be approxim ately estimated to be two to three times higher than that in the general population. WHAT ARE THE COMMON MENTAL DISORDERS SEEN IN THE DISASTER AFFECTED POPULATION?4/16/2019 Disaster Management: Mental Health Perspective https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4649821/?report=pr intable 5/18Common disorders are: Adjustment disorders, depression, post tr aumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, non-specific somatic symptoms and substance abuse.[ 7,9,24,25,26,27] Researchers have assigned that the PTSD as the signature diagnosis among post di saster mental morbidity.[ 9] Prevalence of PTSD reported PTSD[ 29] and substances use disorders[ 30,31,32] are diagnosed frequently along with other psychiatric disorders. Depression is a well-known co -morbidity and can pose a challenge to any treating team.[ 33,34,35] Mental health morbidity continues to be prevalent even after 3-5 years in the disaster affected community.[ 26] Most commonly noted mental health problems during the initial phase among the Asian tsunami survivours were as follows in Table 1 .[1,12,36] WHO ARE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING MENTAL HEALTH MORBIDITY? Earlier studies predicted the following high risk variables: Se verity of the disaster, threat to life, loss of life, loss of family members and duration of exposure.[ 27] Recent additions are: Female gender, children, elderly, physically disabled, single, ethnic minority, displace d population, poverty, substance use like smoking, loss of economic livelihood, poor social support and f amily support.[ 9,12,27,37,38,39,40] Most children and young people are resilient, but also very vul nerable to the psychosocial effects of disasters.[ 40,41] People with pre-existing mental disorders are well known to r elapse during disasters. [39,42] Similarly, people with poor coping capacity, substance use an d chronic general medical conditions are also at the high risk.[ 9,43] Hence, general physician practicing in the area of disaster z one should be aware of high prevalence of mental health disorders in chronic medically-ill patients.[ 44] Similarly, disaster rescue workers are at high risk of developing psychiat ric morbidity.[ 45] WHAT IS THE ROLE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN DISASTER SITUATION? Many mental health professionals have poor understanding of the ir role in a disaster response team. They are neither part of a pre-existing or post- disaster response t eam. They have to play a multi-dimensional role from educating, training, negotiating, administrative, fun d raising, collaborative, skill transferring, treating, advocating and rehabilitating. Please see the Table 2 . In addressing the spectrum of problems during post-disaster, me ntal health clinics in relief camps are useful in identifying and treating moderate-to-severe cases onl y. Hence, the role of specialist as a clinician is very minimal. However, specialist has very important role in training local resources in simple community-based interventions. These include art therapy; infor mal education; group discussions; drama; structuring of daily activities; engaging in activities such as yoga, meditation, prayers, relaxation, sports, and games; spiritual activities; providing factual information; educating parents and teachers.[ 36,46] They were intended to provide important components of psychosocial r ehabilitation such as normalizing, stabilizing, socializing, defusing of emotions and feelings, an d restoration of a sense of identification with others and of safety and security.[ 13] These will not only help in the recovery of milder and sub-sy ndromal symptoms, but also in the prevention of adverse mental health c onsequences. Such interventions, when feasible, should begin as early as possible, targeting all high -risk populations in the affected area; however to encourage participation and avoid stigmatisation, the 'menta l health/psychiatric' label needs to be avoided.[ 1] Specialised care is required only in a small group of populatio n. Majority of the care occurs informally outside the medical settings by community level workers. Traini ng these community level workers is highly essential ingredient of the disaster management. There i s a need to de-medicalise the survivor's disaster response and also to de-professionalise the service de livery and focus on capacity building of the4/16/2019 Disaster Management: Mental Health Perspective https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4649821/?report=pr intable 6/18local community. By de-medicalising and de-professionalizing, g ives us an opportunity to train the survivours, lay-public, local administration, community leaders , NGO's, faith healers, religious leaders, community level workers and significant others in providing car e to the survivors during disaster. Another important role is providing care to the disaster relief workers. Disaster relief workers encounter considerable stress while providing services to people affected by a disaster and they are exposed to the same risk factors that affect clients, hence disaster workers a re at risk for compassion fatigue, burnout and vicarious traumatisation.[ 47] In simple words it is the 'emotional cost on the relief worke rs by caring the disaster victims'. Vicarious trauma can also impact the relief worker's personal life, as well as the relief operation. It is essential to monitor the disaster relief worke rs mental and physical health status during disaster pre-deployment (assessment of personality and training ), deployment (hand holding) and post- deployment phase (to build resilience). Majority of the disasters require temporary external aids. Thes e should be culturally appropriate and targeted towards empowering the affected community to enhance t heir camaraderie and competence to cope with future disasters.[ 12] Disaster management needs to follow the principle of democracy . That is 'of the people, by the people and for the people' for disaster assistance to be acceptable, accessible, adaptable and adoptable for long-term community participation a nd empowerment.[ 14] Similarly The Sphere Project advocates humanitarian charter and identifies mi nimum standards for disaster assistance to promote accountability and share standards of good practice.[ 48] Recent, Uttarakhand Disaster relief work team in 2013 from Nati onal Institute of Mental Health Neuro sciences, Bangalore reported that the mental health infrastruct ure and manpower is abysmally inadequate, none of the district in the Uttarakhand had District Mental Hea lth Programme and Substance use was highly prevalent in the community and at the same time it is to be noted that there are no treatment for de- addiction or de-addiction rehabilitation centre was available a cross the entire state of Uttarakhand. Hence, the disaster relief team submitted a report to the Government o f India to implement the National Mental Health Programme to increase the mental health infrastructure a t least in the four major disaster affected districts in Uttarakhand.[ 49] Thus, mental health professional plays crucial role in variou s forms from providing care, training, advocacy, rehabilitation to hand hold ing of the other disaster relief workers. WHAT IS THE EFFICACY OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS? Psychological First Aid Survivors may exhibit a range of physical, emotional, and cogni tive symptoms. This heightened emotional state is similar to classical fight/flight/freeze reaction of s tress. Affected person may not be in a position to think and act rationally during disaster. Similar to medical fi rst aid, psychological first aid techniques can be performed by minimally trained nonprofessionals within the a ffected community.[ 50] Disaster relief workers need to be trained in assessing the high-risk survivors . The assessment need to be initiated by the relief worker for assessment of: a. Dangers to self and others b. Disoriented to time/place/person c. Death of family member/s in disaster d. Direct threat to life because of disaster e. Disaster related significant physical injury to self or fami ly members f. Delayed relief/evacuation g. Missing family member/s and4/16/2019 Disaster Management: Mental Health Perspective https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4649821/?report=pr intable 7/18h. Past history of mental illness and substance use. After the brief assessment appropriate steps needs to be taken by providing psychological first aid[ 51] as shown in Table 3 . More recently, there has been a revived interest in 'psychologi cal first aid' (PFA). It was initially described by Raphael (1986) for use in the civilian domain.[ 52] The main goal of this is to relieve immediate distress and to prevent or minimize the development of pathological sequ elae.[ 53] The concept of psychological first aid for individuals exposed to highly traumatic events ha s been used in the field of crisis management and disaster mental health for many years.[ 54] The psychological first aid was developed to reflect current best practices in disaster mental health based on research, exp ert consensus, and practical experience. However, there are no systematic studies to answer the efficacy and usefulness of the PFA. Debriefing It is defined as group discussions that occur within 48-72 h af ter an event and are often referred to as 'psychological de-briefings'.[ 55] In general, these sessions encourage participants to describe and share both factual and emotional aspects of their disaster experience .[43] Principle behind this debriefing is that immediate processing gives an individual the ability to cogniti vely restructure the perceived disaster event so that it is remembered in a less traumatic way.[ 7,55] There are various modified forms of debriefing such as Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD)[ 56] and Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM).[ 57] Debriefing is successfully used and implemented in military com bat settings and in relief workers.[ 58,59] However, effectiveness of debriefing in survivors is controvers ial. While some studies do suggest, it may actually produce harm.[ 60,61,62,63,64] However, debriefing occurring outside the therapeutic setting is unaccounted till date. Many of the survivors and relief workers like to talk about the disaster responses to family members, spouse, friends, colleagues and significant oth ers.[65] Effect of such debriefing is not been explored in a systematic way. Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (CBT) CBT have been found to be effective in reducing subsequent psyc hopathology after the exposure to disaster.[ 66,67] There are randomised controlled studies to support the findin gs that early intervention CBT group had less of PTSD when compared a control group.[ 68,69,70,71,72] Although these studies report of positive results but there are no long-term follow-up studies. Recent review by Robert and his colleagues[ 73] reported that trauma-focused CBT within 3 months of a traumat ic event appears to be effective CBT appears to be promising in mitigating the sufferi ng of disaster. However, in a developing country like India, where the availability of the trained manpo wer is meager, use of computerised version of CBT requires to be explored.[ 74] Other interventions Recently there has been re-emergence of interventions such as E ye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)[ 75,76,77] and trauma counseling[ 78] in management of disaster. However, the effectiveness of these procedures requires to be established. I n a recent Cochrane review by Bisson and Andrew 2007, reported that there was evidence individual CBT, E MDR, stress management and group TFCBT are effective in the treatment of PTSD.[ 75] Community-Based Interventions Non-specific community based interventions plays major role in fostering the healing process. These intervention include, structuring of daily activities; avoiding displacement; fostering the family, cultural and religious rituals; group discussions; validation of the emo tions of the survivor's experience and also survivor's guilt; providing factual information; educating pare nts and teachers; engaging the children in4/16/2019 Disaster Management: Mental Health Perspective https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4649821/?report=pr intable 8/18various informal education methods with innovative ideas like d rawing, sketching, singing, miming and so forth by using available community resources; engaging the adul t survivours in camp activities like cooking, cleaning and assisting in relief work; to start school s in the disaster affected area at the earliest so that normalisation and structuring of the daily activities occu rs in children[ 36]; at least to initiate informal education; teaching simple sleep hygiene techniques; educating survivours about harmful effect of substance use; community-based-group interventions can be plann ed like art therapy (painting/drawing), group discussions, dramas, storytelling, structuring their day, engaging in activities, prayers, yoga, relaxation, and sports/games; stress management of the relief w orker is essential; engaging the willing survivors in spiritual activities and involving the survivors i n re-building their community is essential. [12,36] These non-specific interventions not only help the high-risk population but also the affected disaster general population. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS IN DISASTER MANAGEMENT? Generally use of psychotropic medications is discouraged in dis aster management because of the popular notions like a) disaster reactions are generally normal people in abnormal situations and b) majority of the symptoms are self limiting. Prophylactic uses of psychotropic m edications in survivors are discouraged. There are no well controlled studies to say that prophylactic u se of medicine decreases psychiatric morbidity. Various medications have been tried such 87] and Temazepam[ 88] for longer duration have been considered to be greater risk factors for developing PTSD. None of the medica tion has been found to be effective in preventing psychiatric morbidity in well-controlled studies. Ma jority of the studies were open label trial, small sample size and from different population such as combat veterans, accidents victims and burns victims. Extrapolation of data from these studies cannot be use d as justification to use in a disaster settings. However, use of prophylactic psychotropic medications may be ju stified in pre-existing mental illness to avoid relapse, in acute substance withdrawal to avoid complicat ions, suicidal attempt and severe depression. Considering the paucity of evidence it is difficult to recommend prophylactic psychotropic medication in the disaster setting. WHAT RESILIENCE FACTORS NOTED IN MITIGATING THE SUFFERING? Resilience means the speed with which homeostasis is achieved a fter displacement.[ 89] This concept of resilience has been applied to describe the adaptive capacities of individuals or community in response to adversity like disaster. Majority of the research on disaster i s on psychopathology rather than on resilience factors which protect the people in developing mental health mo rbidity.[ 90] There are no systematic studies, however preliminary research have yielded following re silience factors; a cohesive community, community resources, minimal displacement, good social support and network, preserved family system and support, altruistic behavior of the community leaders, mini mal materialistic needs, religious faith and spirituality have been associated with the good outcome and com munity resilience. This was noted in the native population of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India[ 12] and in survivors of Thailand. Contemporary civilised world requires much learning from the na tive's of Andaman and Nicobar islands. The resilience factors need to be identified and studied system atically in a well controlled disaster population. CONCLUSIONS Disasters are inevitable truth of life. Planning and preparedne ss is highly essential to meet challenges. Disaster management is a continuous and integrated cyclical pro cess of planning, organizing, coordinating and implementing measures to prevent and to manage disaster eff ectively. Thinking from 'when' the disaster strikes to 'if' the disaster strikes has necessitated a paradigm shift from relief centered post-4/16/2019 Disaster Management: Mental Health Perspective https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4649821/?report=pr intable 9/18disaster management to a holistic, integrated and preventive ap proach based upon principles of disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation. It revolves in respond ing to the emotional and psychosocial needs of people affected by disaster. Community-based group intervent ions should begin as early as possible, targeting all high-risk populations in the affected area; howev er to encourage participation and avoid stigmatisation, the 'mental health/psychiatric' label needs to be avoided with disaster mental health programmes. Approach towards management should be conservative in medication and avant-garde in psychosocial approach. There is a need to de-medicalise the sur vivor's disaster response and also to de- professionalise the service delivery through local community le vel workers. Rehabilitation efforts planned should be culturally appropriate and targeted towards empowerin g the affected community to enhance their camaraderie and competence to cope with future disasters. Invol ving the local affected community not only helps in capacity building but also in community participa tion.

De ni ons 1. Airborne transmission: occurs when the organism enters the b ody when ny droplet nuclei are coughed or sneezed into the environment and are inhaled into th e lungs. 2. Communicable Disease Event: an infec ous disease incident that is severe, moves quickly from person-to-person, to which there is li le or no immunity and for which countermeasures may be non-existent or not widely or immediately available. Agents tha t could cause a communicable disease emergency may occur naturally or may be deliberately in duced. Such agents are characterized by: person-to-person transmission, high a ack rates, high morbidity, and high mortality. 3. Contact transmission: occurs when the organism enters the bo dy through the mucosa of the mouth, eyes, or nose either directly (skin-to-skin contact with an infec ous individual or with infec ous secre ons) or indirectly when a contaminated intermediate object (un washed hands or equipment) transfers organisms to mucosal surfaces and is absor bed. 4. Droplet transmission: occurs when the organism is sneezed or coughed into the environment within large, wet, respiratory droplets; organisms land on the mucosal surfaces of the nose, mouth or eyes, are absorbed and enter the body. 5. Standard Precau ons: the basis for infec on preven on in all healthcare se ngs. A. Must be used whether or not other \"transmission-based\" prec au ons are in place. B. Are based on the principle that any moist body substance (b lood, secre ons, excre ons, non-intact skin) may contain infec ous organisms regardless of the pa ent's diagnosis or assumed state of health. C. Must be used in healthcare se ngs whenever contact with moist body substances is an cipated. 6. Transmission-based precau ons: supplement to standard precau ons in trea ng pa ents with documented, or suspected to be infected with, highly transmissi ble pathogens. Apply both Standard Precau ons and Transmission-based Precau ons when managing adults and children who are ill with a communicable disease. Planning Guidelines/Assump ons In an emergency caused by communicable disease, the management of children and their caregivers at [Ins tu on] may be complicated by variables such as exposure and infec ous status. [Ins tu on] will need to: 1. Prevent exposure to and contamina on of sta , pa ents, and families. 2. Manage contact tracing and no ca on of possible and con rmed exposures of sta , pa ents, and families. 3. Separate, isolate, and care for persons who are ill and/or possibly infec ous. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 8: Infec on Control Prac ces for Pediatrics Planning Guidelines/Assump ons (cont.) Even though the characteris cs of the next epidemic or pandemic cannot be predicted, e ec ve cre- a on and implementa on of a facility-wide Emergency Infec ous Disease Plan is essen al. Assembling a mul disciplinary emergency management team, careful surveillance, rapid ins tu on of infec on preven on measures, disaster simula ons and con nued analysis of past events will help [Ins tu on] be prepared for the next communicable disease outbreak. In the incident of a large-scale communicable disease outbreak: 1. Children and caregivers will arrive at hospitals in large n umbers . 2. Some will be symptoma c (cases) and some will have no symptoms but will have been exposed to their symptoma c charges or caregivers (contacts). 3. Cases and contacts will be separated because: A. Ill caregivers accompanying asymptoma c children will require admission. B. Asymptoma c caregivers may need to accompany an ill child into the clini cal se ng, leaving other children who are in their care in hospital custody. C. Emergency condi ons will delay the arrival of parents or alternate caregivers. D. Hospitals will be required to provide temporary shelter fo r exposed or asymptoma c child contacts to cases. E. Hospital sta ng will be reduced following the emergency, which will requir e parent/ caregiver assistance on the clinical pediatric units. The hospital's Emergency Infec ous Disease Plan accounts for pediatric-speci c issues to include: 1. Clear expecta ons of parents for compliance with Personal Protec ve Equipment (PPE) restric ons when their children are hospitalized and considered highly contagious. 2. Issues with children being able to comply with PPE use. 3. Infec on control issues in play areas. 4. Visi ng ons and sibling visi ng restric ons during infec ous disease outbreaks. 5. PPE supplies for children (simple masks, hand hygiene, etc. ). 6. Cohor ng plans for pediatric surge during an epidemic. 7. Prepara on in the pharmacy to address medica on issues that may arise during an infec ous disease such as the availability or compounding of palatab le liquid forms of certain medica ons and adequate stocks of an -viral medica ons and an bio cs. 8. Plans for con ngency sta ng if pediatric sta are dispropor onately absent due to infec on or ill family members. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 8: Infec on Control Prac ces for Pediatrics Planning Guidelines/Assump ons (cont.) The hospital's Emergency Infec ous Disease Plan accounts for clinical considera ons for pediatric pa ents: 1. Infec on control measures for exposed/symptoma c children: A. HICPAC isola on guidelines applied appropriate to the nature of the illness / exposure. B. Cohort as necessary, same exposure/same symptoms (see abov e) C. It is not prac cal to place masks on infants or young children to contain res piratory droplets/droplet nuclei. Subs tute hand hygiene/face washing/nose wiping. D. It is not prac cal to place infants or young children in portable isola on units alone to contain respiratory droplets/droplet nuclei. E. Young children and infants are not to be le alone. Adult caregivers of children placed in isola on precau ons need to be instructed on appropriate infec on control measures such as do ng and donning of gowns, gloves, and masks, hand hygiene, and cough e que e. F. Ensure that adult caregivers are following appropriate in fec on control measures. 2. Infec on Control Measures for Exposed/Asymptoma c Children: A. Promptly evaluate and separate as soon as possible from sy mptoma c children and symptoma c adults. B. Children exposed to a comparable situa on may be cohorted. C. Daycare approaches apply (see above). D. Hand hygiene is paramount. E. Educate emergency caregivers about sanitary considera ons. Facility Based Opera onal Details Once the hospital is alerted to or recognizes the poten al for severe communicable disease condi ons, ins tute exposure preven on measures at or before the point of entry to the facility. Rapid iden ca on of symptoma c individuals will permit ac ons to protect the facility, its pa ents, visitors and the physical environment from exposure and contami na on. 1. Obtain case de ni on from the local health authority in order to instruct screen ing, triage, and recep on sta in procedures related to: A. Symptom recogni on, mode of transmission, and speci c infec on and exposure preven on measures. B. In the absence of con rmatory diagnos c informa on, make decisions according to symptoms and epidemiology, as advised by the local healt h authority and/or hospital's infec ous disease department. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 8: Infec on Control Prac ces for Pediatrics Facility Based Opera onal Details (cont.) 2. Pa ent Iden ca on A. Screen persons to iden fy symptoma c individuals at or before the point of entry to implement exposure preven on measures. B. Conduct contact iden ca on procedures among persons accompanying an ill child or adult to the facility. As requested by the local healt h authority, obtain iden ca on and locate informa on for contacts. C. Symptoma c adults and symptoma c children who are old enough (generally three years of age and older) need to wear a surgical mask to prevent the release of organisms into the environment. i. Consider cohor ng non-compliant pa ents together. 3. Educa on and Instruc on to Visitors and Pa ents A. Instruct pa ents and/or caregivers about respiratory e que e, hand hygiene, and ` other relevant infec on and exposure preven on measures; observe and supervise them to ensure compliance. B. Ensure that respiratory e que e signs are prominently placed in the entry and wai ng areas. C. Provide adequate supplies of ssues and provide an easy and sanitary way of disposing of used ssues. D. If the child is too young for a mask, instruct and supervi se parents/caregivers in Standard Precau ons and emphasize importance of respiratory e que e and hand hygiene. E. Instruct, observe, and supervise to ensure that appropriat e infec on and exposure control measures are being followed by contacts, cases, p ersonnel and adult caregivers providing care to ill children. F. Ensure scrupulous and frequent hand washing with soap and water. Be sure to: i. Provide instruc ons about hand hygiene. ii. Ensure that caregivers wash the hands of young children before and a er meals, a er toile ng, and frequently in between. iii. Supervise children who can wash their own hands\u2014encoura ge them to wash their hands for at least 15 seconds (the dura on of the Happy Birthday song). i v . Consider that anxious children may regress to earlier behavio rs; provide comfort and non-judgmental assistance with toile ng and hygiene. v . Ensure that caregivers wash their hands before feeding childr en (and prior to preparing formula) and a er diapering, toile ng, cleaning, or any contact with moist body substances or with items soiled with mo ist body substances even if gloves are used. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 8: Infec on Control Prac ces for Pediatrics Facility Based Opera onal Details (cont.) 4. Cohorts A. Separate persons with similar symptoms from persons who ar e asymptoma c. The excep on may be asymptoma c adult caregivers who may need to remain with ill children to provide care and comfort. These adults will require instruc on and supervision. B. Consult with the local health authority or with the hospit al's infec ous disease department for speci c recommenda ons about cohor ng pediatric contacts and cases. C. Cohor ng of Children in a Hospital Se ng: i. Ideally cohort according to age group to accommodate sani tary needs of infants and young children (diapering, toile ng, hand hygiene, feeding, cleaning). ii. Trauma zed children may regress under duress and may require addi onal help with sanitary hygiene needs. iii. Support infec on control by aiming for recommended age appropriate sta - to-child ra os a. Smaller group size is associated with a lower risk of infec on in child care se ngs. Pa ent Age Maximum Child: Sta Ra o Maximum Group Size 12 months 3:1 6 13-35 months 4:1 8 3 year olds 7:1 144 year olds 8:1 165 year olds 8:1 16 6 to 8 year olds 10:1 20 9 to 12 year olds 12:1 24 (Source: CFOC Standards Database, Item: 1.1.1.2) D. Ensure that cohort spaces used are child-safe and that fa cili es and supplies are adequate to permit sanitary toile ng, hand hygiene, diaper changes, disposal of soiled diapers and other items, and frequent cleaning an d disinfec on. E. Screen children and accompanying adults for symptoms at t he point of entry into the cohort area. Redirect symptoma c individuals. F. Monitor cohorted children, adult caregivers and hospital personnel for symptom onset at intervals, and using methods advised by the loc al health authority or by the hospital infec ous disease department and document the results. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 8: Infec on Control Prac ces for Pediatrics Facility Based Opera onal Details (cont.) 5. Iden ca on A. Ensure that all children have been issued hospital iden ca on bands that include parent/caregiver informa on and contact status. B. Create a log or tracking mechanism that lists all persons, including personnel that enter the cohort se ng and include the following informa on (Appendix A): i. Date ii. Name and brief iden fying informa on (child, caregiver, sta ) iii. Time in/ me out i v . Informa on about any subsequent exposure within cohort including date, me, dura on of exposure v . Name of symptoma c individual C. Establish a basic medical record for each cohorted individ ual that includes: i. details i v . Ini al exposure informa on (date of exposure, name of person to whom exposed) v . S y m p t om onset and monitoring informa on vi. Subsequent exposure informa on 6. Environmental Measures for Pediatric Units: A. Establish hand hygiene procedures and ensure adequate supp lies of soap, sinks, paper and paper towels. Ensure cleaning/disinfec ng materials are stored in a child- safe manner. B. For infants/young children: i. Establish diapering protocols if not already in place (ma y adapt adult diapering protocols). ii. Ensure adequate clean linens, disposable diapers, baby w ipes and changes of clothing. C. For young children: i. Toys that are easy to clean (hard plas c). Appropriately clean all reusable equipment or toys following the hospital's infec on control procedures. ii. Assign individual sleeping mats, pillows and linen (if u sed). D. Waste and soiled linen collec on units should be child-safe, adequate in number, and constructed to permit hands-free use. E. Have cleaning and disinfec on procedures and schedules in place for toilets, bathrooms, changing sta ons, sleeping mats, toys, etc. Note any restric ons on disinfectants. F. Use an EPA-registered disinfectant that has microbicidal proper es e ec ve against organisms most likely to be present in the environment ( consult with local health authority or hospital's infec ous disease department), or use a chlorine bleach solu on (1/4 cup of bleach per gallon of cool water prepared within 24-hours). G. All sani zers, disinfectants and other poten ally toxic materials must be kept out of the reach of children.

Module 9: Pediatric Decontamina on Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 9: Pediatric Decontamina on Module Purpose To facilitate mely decontamina on of children presen ng to a hospital a er an event resul ng in a need for decontamina on. Children require special considera ons that may not be addressed in the hospital's Decontamina on Plan. De ni ons 1. Contamina on: When a radioisotope, chemical, or biologic agent is releas ed into the environ- ment and then ingested, inhaled, or deposited on the body surfa ce. Pa ents contaminated with radioisotopes on or in the body are radioac ve. 2. Decontamina on: The process of cleansing an object or substance to remove contaminants such as mico-organisms or hazardous materials, including chemicals, rad ioac ve substances, and infec ous diseases. 3. Exposure: When all or part of the body absorbs (either by in jes on, inhala on, or dermally) a hazardous substance from an external source. Planning Guidelines/Assump ons A hospital's decontamina on plan includes the unique needs of infants and children that present for treatment. These unique needs and considera ons include: 1. A emp ng to keep families together, especially under condi ons that involve large numbers of pa ents in a chao c situa on. However, medical issues will take priority and may result in the separa on of families. 2. Planning for older children who may resist or be di cult to handle due to fear, peer pressure, and modesty issues (even in front of their paren ts or caregivers). 3. Assis ng parents or caregivers with decontamina ng themselves and their children at the same me. 4. Incorpora ng high-volume, low-pressure water delivery systems (e.g., han dheld hose sprayers) that are \"child-friendly\" into the h ospital decontamina on showers. 5. Understanding that the risk of hypothermia increases propor onally in smaller, younger children when the water temperature in the decontamina on shower is below 98\u00b0F. 6. Paying a en on to airway management; a priority in decontamina on showers. 7. Supplying the decontamina on area with re-dress kits and gowns in appropriate sizes, and baby shampoo to avoid eye irrita on. Understand that the smaller the child, the bigger the problem r egarding any of the above consider- a ons (hypothermia, airway management, the ability to e ec vely decontaminate the child) and the separa on of families.Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 9: Pediatric Decontamina on Facility-Based Opera onal Details A hospital Pediatric Decontamina on Plan is based on three categories of children. 1. Infants and Toddlers (typically younger than 2 years of age) Infants and toddlers are the most challenging group to decont aminate, as special considera ons are of the utmost importance for this age. Follow the gui delines below during treatment to ensure children are properly and th oroughly decontaminated. A. Make every a empt to keep families together unless cri cal medical issues take priority. B. Parents or caregivers should avoid carrying the child beca use of the possibility of injury from a fall or from dropping a slippery and squir ming child. Use a plas c laundry basket to carry the child safely and decontamina te the child. C. Hot zone personnel or the child's caregiver need to place non-ambulatory children on a stretcher or in a basket, undress the child, (using trauma shears if necessary), and escort them through the decontamina on shower. D. Give special a en on to the child's airway while in the shower. E. Once through the shower, the child's caregiver or post dec ontamina on (\"cold zone\") personnel dry o the child. F. Prevent or treat hypothermia by providing addi onal towels, gowns, or warming blankets as necessary. G. Immediately be give each child a unique iden ca on number on a wrist band, and triage to an appropriate area for medical evalua on or to the Pediatric Safe Area. 2. Preschool Children (typically older than 2 but up to 6-8 yea rs of age) Children ages two to eight years are able to walk and speak, yet (with considerable varia ons in physical characteris cs), are clearly children. [Ins tu on] will follow the guidelines below to ensure children are properly and thorough ly decontaminated. A. Make every a empt to keep families together unless cri cal medical issues take priority. B. Use a plas c laundry basket or tub to carry children safely and during decontamina on to avoid injury from a fall or from dropping a slippery and squirming child. C. Assist ambulatory children in undressing with help from ei ther the child's the child's caregiver or decontamina on personnel need to place non-ambulatory children on a stretcher on in a basket, u ndress them (using trauma shears if necessary), and escort the ch ild through the decontamina on shower . E. Give special a en on to the child's airway while in the shower. F. Once through the shower, the child's caregiver or post de contamina on (\"cold zone\") personnel dry o the child. If the child is able, he or she can dry and dress in a hospital gown. G. Prevent or treat hypothermia by providing addi onal towels, gowns, or warming blankets as necessary. Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 9: Pediatric Decontamina on Facility-Based Opera onal Details (cont.) 2. Preschool Children (typically older than 2 but up to 6-8 yea rs of age) H.Immediately provide a unique iden ca on number on a wrist band, then triage to an appropriate area for medical evalua on or to the Pediatric Safe Area. 3. School-Aged Children (typically 8-18 years of age) At the age of 8 years and upward, the airway anatomy of schoo l-age children approximates that of an adult. Although it is temp ng to regard this age group as \"small adults,\" there are special needs unique to this age gr oup. A. Make every a empt to keep families together unless cri cal medical issues take priority. B. Ambulatory children disrobe when instructed to do so by th eir parent, care giver, or \"hot zone\" personnel. C. Each child can walk through the decontamina on shower, preferably in succession with their parent or caregiver, and essen ally decontaminate him/herself. D. Either the child's caregiver or decontaminia on personnel will place non-ambulatory children on a stretcher, undress them (us ing trauma shears if necessary), and escort the child through the decontamina on shower. E. Once through the shower, each child is given a towel to dr y and sheets and a hospital gown. F. Immediately give a unique iden ca on number on a wrist band,then triage to an appropriate area for medical evalua on or to the Pediatric Safe Area. Clinical Considera ons for Pediatric Chemical Exposures and Decontamina on 1. A chemical agent is a substance which could kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate humans through its toxicological e ects. Chemical agents have been used in warfare and in acts of terrorism. Clues signaling a chemical or (biological) a ack: A. An unusual increase in the number of pa ents seeking care for poten al chemical release-related illness. B. Unexplained deaths among young or healthy persons. C. Emission of unexplained odors by pa ents. D. Clusters of illness in persons who have common characteris cs, such as drinking water from the same source. E. Rapid onset of symptoms a er an exposure to a poten ally contaminated medium (e.g. paresthesias and vomi ng within minutes of ea ng a meal). F. Unexplained death of plants, sh, or animals (domes c or wild). Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 9: Pediatric Decontamina on Clinical Considera ons for Pediatric Chemical Exposures and Decontamina on (cont.) G. A toxic syndrome -or toxidrome- is a constella on of toxic e ects compromising a set of clinical symptoms for a group of toxic chemicals. Toxicdrome r ecogni on is important because it provides a tool for the rapid detec on of the suspected cause and can focus on the di eren al diagnosis to the considera on of only a few chemicals with similar toxic e ects. During the early phases of a toxic chemical incident, iden fying toxidromes that are present can be a useful decision-making tool and determined with only a few observa ons, such as: Vital signs Mental status Pupil size Mucous membrane irrita on Lung exam for wheezes or rales Examining skin for burns, moisture, and color If suspec ng toxidrome, ac vate chemical decontamina on plan to: A. Prevent further injury to the pa ents B. Protect hospital sta C. Protect the hospital environment Clinical Considera ons for Pediatric Radia on Exposur es and Decontamina on A . How to diagnose contaminated pa ents: i. External Contamina on: scan with appropriate radia on survey meter. ii. Internal Contamina on: Swab each nostril separately to help es mate the level of internal (lung) contamina on. Collect 70 mL spot urine sample for isotope measurement. iii. Consider total body radia on survey with hospital nuclear medicine equipment. iv. Proper collec on and disposal of wastes (feces, urine, wound secre on and d r essings) from internally contaminated pa ents avoids further contamina on of healthcare workers. B. How to diagnose exposed pa ents / Acute Radia on Syndrome (ARS) ARS may result if the dose from the whole or par al body exposure is high enough. Es mate whole body dose and clinical severity by using: i. Time to onset of vomi on kine cs. The faster the decline, the higher the degree of irradia on dose). iii. Physical exam. Look for ARS ndings as suggested below:Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 9: Pediatric Decontamina on Clinical Considera ons for Pediatric Radia on Exposur es and Decontamina on (cont.) iv. Clinical signs and symptoms associated with ARS and its sub syndromes. As described above, physical exam focuses on four systems: cutaneous, neurovascular, gastrointes nal and hematopoie c complica ons. B. Ini al Decontamina on P a ents with external or internal contamina on con nue to receive addi onal ionizing radia on un l they are decontaminated. As these pa ents are moved within the healthcare system they may contaminate healthcare workers and facili es. i. Pa ents should be decontaminated prior to their entrance. ii. Water used in decontamina on should not be disposed in the municipal sewer system; store it separately. iii. Pa ents who present with trauma or burn plus irradia on are at increased risk of mortality. Treat severely inju red individuals rst. iv. Trauma c and other life-threatening injuries take precedence over radia on survey and treatment. Do a primary survey rst and stabilize the pa ent, then proceed with irradia on management.

Contamination: Contamination results when a radioisotope (as gas, liquid, or solid) is released into the environment and then ingested, inhaled, or deposited on the body surface. Contaminated patient has radioisotopes on or in the body and are radioactive . How to diagnose t\u0001 External contamination Scan with appropriate radiation survey meter t\u0001 Internal contamination Swab each nostril separately to help estimate level of internal (lung) contamination collect 70 mL spot urine sample for isotope measurement Instructions for sample collection, labeling, packaging and shipping (HHS/CDC) t\u0001 Consider total body radiation survey with modied hospital nuclear medicine equipment t\u0001Proper collection and disposal of wastes (feces urine, wound secretion) from internally contaminated patients avoids further contamination of health care workers. Exposure: Radiation exposure occurs when all or part of the body absorbs penetrating ionizing radiation from an external radiation source, as shown in the illustration above. t\u0001Exposure from an external source stops when a person leaves the area of the source, the source is shielded completely, or the process causing exposure ceases.Irradiated patients have no radioisotopes on or in the body and are not radioactive. Radiation exposure also occurs after internal contamination, i.e., when a radionuclide is ingested, inhaled or absorbed into the blood stream. t\u0001This kind of exposure stops only if the radionuclide is totally eliminated from the body, with or without treatment. An individual exposed only to an external source of radiation, as shown above, is NOT radioactive or contaminated and may be approached without risk, just like after a chest x-ray or CT scan. Radiation from external exposure alone is either absorbed without the body becoming radioactive, or it can pass through the body completely. Therefore, if a person is scanned with a radiation survey monitor after external exposure alone, the device will not register radiation above the background level. Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) may result if the dose from whole or partial body exposure is high enough. How to diagnose ARS Estimate whole body dose and clinical severity by using: t\u0001 Time to onset of vomiting (If Vomiting <1hr, 100% mortality) t\u0001 Lymphocyte depletion kinetics (The faster the decline, the higher the degree of irradiation dose) t\u0001 Physical exam look for ARS t\u0001 Clinical signs and symptoms associated with ARS and its subsyndromes As described above, physical exam should focus on particularly four systems; cutaneous, neurovascular, gastrointestinal and hematopoietic complications. Clinical Considerations 189 Pediatric/Neonatal Disaster Reference Guide Initial decontamination: Patients with external or internal contamination continue to receive additional ionizing radiation until they are decontaminated. As these patients are moved within the healthcare system they may contaminate healthcare workers and facilities. t\u0001Patients should be decontaminated prior to their entrance into a healthcare facility t\u0001Healthcare workers, responder should wear protected gear t\u0001Water used in decontamination should not be disposed in the municipal sewer system, but stored separately t\u0001Patient who presents with trauma or burn plus irradiation are increased risk of mortality. Severely injured individuals should be treated rst. t\u0001Traumatic and other life-threatening injuries take precedence over radiation survey and treatment. We must do a primary survey rst and stabilize the patient then proceed with irradiation management. t\u0001 Follow the algorithm below provided by US Department of Health and Human ServicesPrinciples of Pediatric Decontamination Dennis Heon, MD, FAAP,* George L. Foltin, MD, FAAP, FACAP Since the 9-11 attack, there has been increased attention on disaster preparedness. First responders and first providers are now being trained to respond to disaster scenarios; however, there is little to no standardization in this training.1Although there has been much effort to consider children's needs during decontamination, best practices forpediatric decontamination have not been established. Eventhough children comprise 22% of the US population, there arefew published reports detailing the appropriate medical needs, care, and decontamination of a child, of which none are based on scientifically rigorous studies. 2-4 NEED FOR DECONTAMINATION Chemical The need for decontamination from chemical incidents or chemical terrorism has been well documented.5Decontamination is an essential early step in the mitigation of victim exposure tochemical and certain forms of radiological exposure. Propertraining in decontamination will decrease the risk of secondarycontamination to medical personnel, transport vehicles, andhospitals, in addition to improving the outcome of exposed victims. 6If appropriate plans are not in place, the ability of the medical care system to remain effective during these events canbe compromised when personnel, ambulances, and hospitalemergency departments become contaminated. Although large-scale industrial incidents such as the methyl isocyanate toxicity 7 in Bhopal India in 1982 are rare, smaller scale incidents arecommon. Large-scale terrorist attacks have also occurred such asthe Tokyo subway Sarin gas attack in 1995 8and a nicotine- containing insecticide that was placed in ground beef in GrandAbstract: Although the principles of pediatric decontamination are similar as those for adults, the actual practice is much more challenging. Theunique needs and vulnerabilities of children will require health care personnel to be sensitive to devel- opmental stages of the victims and physiological hazards during decon- tamination. Unless medically indi- cated, families should undergo decontamination together. This arti- cle provides an overview of the need for decontamination and the pro- cess of decontamination for hospi-tals. Practical guidance on decontamination methods for chil- dren of different ages is presented. Recommendations for training and communication during decontami- nation are also reviewed. *Clinical Pediatrics and Emergency Med- icine NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY; Center For Pediatric EmergencyMedicine NYU Langone Medical Center/ Bellevue Hospital Center, and Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY.

The latter affected more than 40 children, making this the largest chemicalterrorism attack on children in the United States 9. Children are a vulnerable population for a future attack because they regularly congregate together inschools and camps. Most of these locations havelittle to no security and are categorized by emer-gency planners as soft targets. 10In addition, in the event of a mass casualty incident, children will bemore vulnerable to psychosocial sequelae. Radiological Although decontamination is not useful for radio- active fallout from a nuclear bomb, decontamina-tion will be necessary after exposure from a dirtybomb and the resultant spread of dust and othersolid debris. Disrobing the patient will remove mostof the dust, and thorough showering with watershould remove all of the contamination. If thepatient has a life-threatening injury, some authors believe that decontamination should be done after the patient has been stabilized; 11however, this approach puts the trauma team at risk for radiationexposure. Depending on the radioactive substance,the time, and distance from the radioactive source,this exposure can be significant. 12Currently, most institutions, to ensure the safety of hospital person-nel and the hospital structure itself, recommend that all patients undergo decontamination before entering the facility regardless of the delay indefinitive treatment. The only exception is if aspecific and well-drilled strategy for victims of adirty bomb exposure has been implemented beforethe incident. Biological In contrast to the previous sections, the role for decontamination from biological agents is minimal. This is due to the incubation period of many of thepotential pathogens. Most patients will not presentto a health care facility until days after the attackmaking decontamination unnecessary. 13A possible exception might be acute aerosolized anthraxexposure in which the patient will be contaminatedwith spores. PROCESS OF DECONTAMINATION Decontamination is the removal or reduction of harmful substances from the victim's body. The goalof decontamination is to ensure that the toxicsubstance, whether chemical, biological, or radi-ological, is no longer in direct contact with thepatient. This prevents further absorption by thepatient and will decrease the possibility of transfer of the toxin to health care workers. 14The military model of 3 zones \u2014hot, warm, and cold \u2014is now used throughout the country by local emergency medical services and HAZMAT (hazardous materi-als) teams. 15The hot zone is where the incident occurred and therefore poses the greatest risk forcoming into contact with dangerous toxins solid,liquid, or gaseous. Rescuers entering the hot zonetypically need the highest level of personal protec-tive equipment (PPE) available \u2014level A. Level A protection includes a che mical-resi stant splash proof suit combined with a self-contained oxygensupply. Level A apparatus will protect the rescueragainst all solids, liquids, vapors, aerosols, and gases.A list of all levels of PPE is shown in Table 1 . There is little dexterity for rescuers wearing these suits. In the United States, only the most basic life-saving treatments such as airway opening, hemor- rhage control, and antidote therapy (eg, Mark 1 kits) may be performed in a hot zone. 14Many disaster response systems will not provide even thislevel of care until the victim has been removed fromthe hot zone and decontaminated. Other countries,such as Israel, regularly practice and performmore extensive rescue tasks in full PPE. 16 The only prehospital multicasualty triage system that incorporates the unique differences of children is the JumpSTART algorithm.17,18JumpSTART's objectives are 3-fold: to optimize the triage ofinjured children in a multicasualty setting, toimprove resource allocation for all victims, and todecrease the emotional burden of triage personnel.Neither JumpSTART nor any other mass casualtyincident triage system has been clinically or scientifically validated; however, this is the system in use in most areas of the country today. TheJumpSTART algorithm is shown in Figure 1 . In theory, all patients should be decontaminated on scene; however, it is well described in theliterature that many victims will bypass decontami-nation at the scene and self-present to hospitals. 19 Therefore, each hospital must have their own system for decontamination of potential victims. In planning for such an event, it is generally assumed that the hospital will not be the site of theinitial incident. Although victims may present to thehospital within minutes of the incident occurrence,they will have traveled some distance from theprimary site. Whatever exposure the patientreceived, the hospital health care worker in theory should receive far less. 20The hospital \"hot zone \"is in reality a \"warm zone \"with a lower risk of secondary contamination than that of the site of the primaryincident. Thus, recommendations for PPE forPRINCIPLES OF PEDIATRIC DECONTAMINATION / HEON AND FOLTIN VOL. 10, NO. 3 187hospital-based decontamination are less restrictive \u2014 level C.21Level C includes a chemically resistant suit, boots, and gloves as well as a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The PAPR is battery powered and contains 3 double-layer filters \u2014one high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and one chemical. Becausethere is no oxygen tank, the PAPR weighs much lessthan a level A breathing apparatus. Patients will be decontaminated to lessen the severity of their symptoms. By the JumpSTARTtriage system, red victims should be decontami-nated first, followed by yellow victims and, lastly, green victims. Black-tagged patients should not be decontaminated until all survivors have beentreated. Families should not be separated unlessthere is a medical necessity. Keeping a parent orregular caregiver with children during an masscasualty incident will help to reduce the psycholo-gical stress for children and will also decrease theresources the hospital would otherwise have to deploy for decontamination and postdecontamina-tion care. Simply having the patient undress will remove up to 85% of the contaminants. 5Children will be hesitant to disrobe in the presence of strangers. Even with a parent, the process of disrobing a frightened, unwilling child may take longer than expected, particularly toddlers.22Using a hospital worker of the same sex as the child duringthe undressing process may make the child morecomfortable and decrease the time the task takes to accomplish. 23The clothes and any valuables (wal- lets, cell phones, iPods, and jewelry) should beplaced in labeled bags, so they can be returned to the patients if the contamination is unfounded or the agent is not dangerous. Once the patients have disrobed, they should immediately enter a decontamination shower. Wateris the decontamination solution of choice due to itsease of availability. Some exceptions are contamina-tion with sodium, potassium, cesium, lithium, andcertain concentrated acids; 14however, it is rare that the agent is identified before decontamination willTABLE 1.

Alkali soap has been suggested to improve removal of some toxins from the skin;however, its efficacy has not been proven. 15A potential advantage of using soap is that the suds will remind the patient to rinse all areas of their body and hair. A disadvantage of soap is that it can get inthe patient's eyes or cause mild skin reactions. Thereis no clear consensus on whether soap and water aresuperior to water alone. Dilute bleach has also beensuggested to aid in the removal of certain skincontaminants; however, bleach cannot be used nearthe eyes or on mucous membranes; it may irritate the skin and be systemically absorbed if the skin barrier is compromised significantly. 24 The recommendation for the duration of shower- ing was set by Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration in 2004. 25They suggest a 5- to 6-minute shower; however, this recommendationwas based on opinion of experts and not on actualdata. A retrospective, hospital-based decontamina- tion protocol demonstrated showerwas adequate for external decontamination. 26Symp- tomatic patients should have a longer shower thanasymptomatic patients do because they may have been exposed to a higher dose of the toxin. Ideally, water temperature should be 98\u00b0F. 22Although colder temperatures may cause peripheral vasoconstric-tion, thereby decreasing absorption of toxins, it mayalso induce hypothermia in pediatric patients. 27The risk of hypothermia is exacerbated in children dueto their increased surface area to body mass ratio.Another variable is water pressure. The water pressure in most showers is sufficient to clean the skin without being painful. Very high-volumeshowers should have adjustable flow handheldsprayers to decrease the water pressure to nomore than 60 psi (413 kPa) so as not to injurechildren. 5Young children, infants, or any child that cannot protect their own airway will need to behand sprayed or have their airway closely moni- tored and protected. Some hospital centers may have different options on shower devices. The decision to \"set up the tent \" or just use hoses with hand sprayers or preexistingregular shower rooms will be determined by theoverall patient volume. Including extra time to disrobe, one should plan on a minimum of 10 minutes per child. This estimate includes the 5 minutes spent in the decontamination shower. Ideally, wait time should be no more than 1 hour to minimize ongoingexposure and confusion in the crowd. If the ambienttemperature is warm and there are privacy ponchosavailable, children may disrobe in advance of enter-ing the shower to increase throughput time. Children who need to undergo decontamination should be categorized into nonambulatory or ambulatory groups. Nonambulatory children of any age will be disrobed by \"hot zone \"staff, placed on a stretcher, and escorted through the shower orhand sprayed. Hospital personnel should ensure thechild's airway remains patent during decontamina-tion because the child will be unable to protect hisor her own airway. This is a particular concern forimmobilized children in a cervical collar. The ambulatory children should be further broken down by age groups: 8-18, 2-8, and 0-2years. 22The 8- to 18-year age group should be able to self-disrobe and function independently through theshower. They should also be grouped by sex formodesty issues. The 2- to 8-year olds will likely needassistance in disrobing (this should be done bycaregivers if at all possible) and will need super- vision from hot zone workers to thoroughly decon- taminate themselves. This age group will often need extra time to disrobe and be coaxed into the shower. Children younger than 2 years should be disrobed FIGURE 1 . JumpSTART prehospital pediatric mass casualty triage algorithm.39PRINCIPLES OF PEDIATRIC DECONTAMINATION / HEON AND FOLTIN VOL. 10, NO. 3 189by a caregiver or, if none present, by hot zone hospital personnel. They should then be placed on astretcher or a container with apertures to allow fluid drainage. This prevents the potential risk of drop- ping them during the process. It also allowscaregivers to adequately decontaminate themselveswithout holding the child. A hot zone worker shouldaccompany this age group through the shower toensure that the infants' airway remains secure andthat they are completely washed. Developmentallydelayed children are another subgroup that will require extra time to disrobe and may be fearful ofthe decontamination process. If a caregiver is present and able, they should assist the childthrough the entire process of decontamination. If no caregiver is present and there are multiple developmentally delayed victims, additional staffwill be needed in the hot zone to assist thesechildren. An algorithm for decontamination ofpediatric patients is shown in Figure 2 . For small-scale disasters, everyone should be able to be decontaminated without a considerable wait.It is likely that the hot zone team will not need relief before they complete their task for small scale FIGURE 2 . Algorithm for decontamination of pediatric patients.190 VOL. 10, NO. 3 PRINCIPLES OF PEDIATRIC DECONTAMINATION / HEON AND FOLTINevents. For larger scale disasters, issues of crowd control and waiting time until decontaminationbecome important concerns. At the recommended duration of 5 minutes per patient, that translates to 12 patients per hour for each shower head available. For a disaster involving several hundred victims, this process may take hours to complete. Childrenmay become impatient and disrupt the process.Also, rescuer fatigue and heat exhaustion willbecome evident necessitating switches in hot zonehospital personnel. 25Personnel relief recommenda- tions vary between 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on ambient temperature, physical fitness of rescuer, and the amount of exertion required. Because mostcontamination will be on clothing, if there will be aprolonged wait for the decontamination, childrenshould be given a privacy poncho in the hot zoneand encouraged to disrobe ahead of time, weatherfactors permitting. This will minimize the child'srisk while they wait and speed overall throughput through the showers. Decontamination of children who are equipment dependent, such as ventilators, pose an additionalproblem because these devices are not designed forexcessive contact with water. If the patient isasymptomatic, there is little likelihood that theventilator is significantly contaminated. It should bevisually inspected for solid or liquid foreign bodies.A Geiger counter can be used to assess for radio- activity. If no visible contamination is found, it is safe to use. This may be helpful if there is a shortageof ventilators during a crisis. If there is doubt aboutthe device, it is best to leave it in the hot zone anduse a hospital ventilator. If the patient is sympto-matic, the device should be assumed to be con-taminated and remain in the hot zone. Otherdevices such as hearing aides or insulin pumps should follow a similar strategy. Eye glasses may be washed in the shower with the patient. Mostprosthetic limbs are able to get wet and thus canbe removed, thoroughly decontaminated along withthe patient, and returned in the cold zone. The physical layout of the hospital decontamina- tion area should be optimized to maximize theoverall speed of patient decontamination whiletaking into account a number of considerations: There should be a separate entrance and exit, so\"hot\"patients do not recontaminate patients who have already gone through the shower. The shower should be as close as possible to the resuscitation area of the hospital (the patientswill be unclothed and wet making hypothermia a concern in cold weather environments).Male and female patients should be grouped separately through the shower to afford mod-esty and minimize embarrassment with theexception of keeping a caregiver with a child. Antechamber rooms where the patient can undress with some privacy prior to shower-ing and be covered with a sheet, blanket, ortowel upon exiting the shower, are useful but not mandatory. For best results, hospitals should try to follow the above guidelines as closely as possible, understand- ing that most decontamination areas are retrofittedto an existing hospital footprint. Once victims are decontaminated by hospital hot zone personnel, they must be retriaged in thehospital because their condition may have changed.This triage must be quick and accurate. There is a tendency to overtriage children, which can poten- tially misallocate already strained 28Hospitals 3-tiered jumpstart algorithm or a 2-tiered system.29The 2- tiered system incorporates 2 forms of triage: a rapidvisual assessment to quickly identify the sickestpatients, followed by a more detailed triage assess-ment. 30These detailed assessments will include a more involved physical examination and pertinent history taking. There will always be changes in triagestatus of patients because of triage error (mostlyovertriage but some undertriage) and progression ofdisease state. Awareness of changes is vital toutilization of emergency department resources. 30 Challenges and Recommendations During mass casualty scenarios, it is optimal that at least 1 member of the hot zone team havepediatric clinical experience. A physician or nurse capable of recognizing respiratory distress, shock, or an evolving toxicological syndrome in a child isbest. 21The rest of the decontamination personnel can be nonclinical hospital staff who have receivedthe necessary training. Unless the event is a large,ongoing disaster, the use of trained volunteers willbe impractical because patients will start arrivingbefore volunteers can be called. Hot zone workers should be replaced frequently because working in a PPE suit is tiring and exposesthe individual to heat exhaustion, particularly inwarm climates. Recommendations vary dependingon the exertion level, ambient temperature, andphysical fitness of the hot zone worker. Mostrecommendations for hospital hot zone workerswearing level C protection are between 20 to 60 minutes. 21A designated person in the cold zonePRINCIPLES OF PEDIATRIC DECONTAMINATION / HEON AND FOLTIN VOL. 10, NO. 3 191triage area should be monitoring the amount of time each worker has spent in a decontamination suit,switching personnel as needed. Planning for large-scale disasters is challenging and generally impractical. It would have beendifficult to drill to evacuate the entire city of NewOrleans before Hurricane Katrina. There are guide-lines for smaller scale disasters. The Joint Commis-sion has set emergency preparedness standards forhospitals throughout the United States, includingthe expectation that they hold disaster drills for the benefit of the community. 31Hospitals must test their emergency management plans at least twiceper year including 1 drill per year. 32Despite this mandate, there is no set curriculum that hospitalsuse to train for disasters and no mandate by JointCommission to conduct and include a pediatricmass casualty drill. Different training formatsinclude disaster drills, tabletop sessions, technol- ogy-based sessions, skills sessions, and classroom lectures. A meta-analysis by Hsu et al 33in 2004 evaluated different training methods. Hsu et alwere able to demonstrate that drills were usefulfor finding flaws in hospital disaster plans. Theseareas included incident command, communica-tions, triage, patient flow, materials/resources, andhospital security. There were insufficient data to make valid recommendations on other training methods. In a later study, Hsu et al 34created a list of 7 core competencies for disaster training derivedfrom an expert panel. The core competencies areas follows: 1. Recognize a potential critical event and implement initial action. 2. Apply the principles of critical event management. 3. Demonstrate critical event safety principles.4. Understand the institutional emergency operations plan. 5. Demonstrate critical event communications. 6. Understand the incident command system and your role in it. 7. Demonstrate the knowledge and skills needed to fulfill your role during a critical event. Despite having identified these core competen- cies, a meta-analysis by Williams et al 35found that there is insufficient evidence to determine effective training interventions for hospital-based health care providers. Some hospitals have used multimodality course training. Participants in these courses had increasedknowledge on a posttest compared with a pretest; however, there are no data on knowledge retentionor if this translates into improved performance during an actual disaster. 36A smaller study on training for pediatric disaster victims used lectures and table top exercises37These investigators demon- strated increased retention of knowledge during a 6-month period. 37In view of the previous discussion, all emergency department personnel (physicians,nurses, ancillary workers) should receive training indecontamination. The training should be bothknowledge based (reasons for decontamination)and practice based (how to prepare for the hot zone). A minimum of 2 hours of training time is needed to assess risks and become familiar with theequipment. This training should be repeated every 6months. There is often little to no warning beforedisaster events, so \"just in time \"training is impractical in this setting and may endanger thehealth care provider because they will be entering apotentially dangerous area (hot zone) with little training and no practice. Communication during a disaster is vital to assure optimal outcomes. Although there are dataon the effectiveness of telephone chains to alertphysicians about a disaster, 38there are few pub- lished data on communication strategies for pedia-tric decontamination. For provider-to-providercommunication from hot zone to cold zone, there are 2 possible modalities. The first is by radio signal. There are many different models and manufac-turers for these devises. The most efficient, butperhaps the most expensive, is a voice-activatedthroat microphone with an earpiece receiver. Thishas the least likelihood of becoming displaced whilewearing a PAPR hood. The next best setup is amicrophone connected to an earpiece that is worn under the PAPR. The microphone is activated by a large button that is worn on the chest under thesplash suit. The relative disadvantages with thisdevice type are that users will need to use theirhands to talk and the headset can get displacedunder the PAPR. This type of setup can be securedto the rescuer's head with an additional strap todecrease the chance of displacement. The second modality of communication is through the use of simple hand signals. For example, a palm held upvertically would mean stop. The advantage of thistechnique is that there is no dependence ontechnology that can potentially malfunction. The disadvantage is that it requires the use of one or both hands, thereby limiting communication tosimple commands. Patient communication with a rescuer wearing a PAPR is quite difficult. Powered air-purifyingrespirators -deaden sound, making all communica- tion challenging. This is further exacerbated by the192 VOL. 10, NO. 3 PRINCIPLES OF PEDIATRIC DECONTAMINATION / HEON AND FOLTINnoisy, chaotic environment. In addition, children will not always get to see the rescuer's face, whichmay increase their anxiety. A bullhorn may be usedto amplify one's voice over a wider area. Wheneverpossible, the rescuer should kneel down to thepatient's eye level to maximize a verbal exchange. A summary of key points is as follows: The smaller the child, the bigger the problem. Many children will be fearful of a shower andresist disrobing. Extra personnel and time willbe needed to effectively manage a large group of children. Separation of families should be avoided, but medical issues take priority (eg, red parentand green child). Do not assume that parents or caregivers can decontaminate both themselves and theirchildren at the same time. They will needassistance by hot zone personnel. It is recommended to have both male and female hot zone personnel to assist olderchildren who may have modesty issues. Airway management through the shower is a priority. To help prevent asphyxia or drown- ing, handheld hose sprayers (large volume,low pressure) should be incorporated intohospital decontamination showers. Thesechild-friendly devices may also decreaseyoung children's fear of the process. Children are especially prone to hypother- mia. Ensure that the shower temperature is at least 98\u00b0F. Once they are through the decon- tamination shower, they must be immediatelycovered with sheets, blankets, or a Mylar wrapand brought into the hospital. As soon as the patients exit the decontamina- tion shower, a band with a unique hospitalidentification number must be placed on the patients to facilitate tracking during their hospital stay. As patients are medically cleared, they must be kept in a child-friendly environment(pediatric safe area) that is supervised bystaff knowledgeable about pediatric issues such as social workers or child life specia-lists. Reunion of unaccompanied childrenwith family members should occur here. Strict documentation is required to ensure that pediatric victims are released to theappropriate legal caregiver. Depending on the scale of the disaster, this process may take hours or days.Aftertheevent,pediatricvictimswillneedtobe evaluated for long-term psychological issues such as posttraumatic stress disorder. At thetime of discharge, a list (with telephone numbers) of practitioners or hospital clinicsshould be given to each family because psy-chological trauma may not manifest itselfimmediately but may become a significant issue for the patient and family in the future.

Ann Emerg Med 1999;34:191-204.PRINCIPLES OF PEDIATRIC DECONTAMINATION / HEON AND FOLTIN VOL. 10, NO. 3 193Module 10: Pediatric Nerve Agent Response (CHEMPACK) Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 10: Pediatric Nerve Agent Response Module Purpose To provide hospitals with supplementary informa on speci c to pediatrics to the exis ng CHEMPACK program, administered by the Oregon Health Authority. De ni ons 1. CHEMPACK: a series of deployable containers of nerve agent a nd organophosphate an dotes that work on a variety of nerve agents and organophosphates that can be used even if the actual agent is unknown. 2. CHEMPACK EMS Containers: containers designed to be used by rst responders in the eld. Comprised of mostly autoinjectors (85%), with approximately a 454 casualty capacity. 3. CHEMPACK Hospital Containers: containers designed to be use d in a clinical environment. 85% of each containers' are mul -dose vials. Approximately 1,000 casual es can be treated with each hospi- tal container. 4. Medical countermeasures (MCMs): FDA-regulated products (biol ogics, drugs, devices) that may be used in the event of a poten al public health emergency stemming from a terrorist a ack with a bio- logical, chemical, or radiological/nuclear material, a naturall y occurring emerging disease, or a natural disaster. MCMs can be used to diagnose, prevent, protect from, or treat condi ons associated with chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) threats, or emerging infec ous diseases. 5. Nerve Agent: a toxic, usually odorless organophosphate (such as sarin, tabun, or VX) that disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses, and may cause breathing di cul es, coughing, vomi ng, muscle weakness or paralysis, convulsions, coma, and death. Nerve age nts can be used as a chemical weapon in gaseous or liquid form. 6. Strategic Na onal Stockpile (SNS): a CDC asset and the na on's largest supply of poten ally life-saving pharmaceu cals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to exhaust local supplies. The SNS ensures that medicine and s upplies get to those who need them most during an emergency. Planning Guidelines/Assump ons A nerve agent exposure presents an addi onal set of problems and concerns for a hospital's pedi- atric popula on. Hospitals are familiar with almost all treatment protocol s in a disaster, except for nerve agent exposure. Low familiarity with nerve agents comes f rom lack of experience dealing with accidental exposures to high doses of pes cides. Hospitals strive to be pro cient in these scenarios and be prepared for containment, decontamina on, and treatment of pediatrics pa ents exposed to nerve agents that may arrive at at their door.

More than 90 percent of the United States popula on is within one hour of a CHEMPACK loca- on. CHEMPACKs are containers of nerve agent an dotes placed in secure loca ons at local lev- els around the country. These caches allow for rapid response t o a chemical incident where nerve agent or organophosphate (common in agricultural insec cides) exposure has occurred. There are 17 CHEMPACK sites across the Oregon (See Appendix A for map). W ithin Region 1, there are ve loca ons: Loca on Address CHEMPACK Type(s) Adven st Medical Center 10123 Market Street Portland, OR 972141 Hospital Pack 1 EMS Pack Multnomah County EMS/AMR 1 SE 2nd Avenue Portland, OR 972141 EMS Pack OHSU - Logis cs 3990 SW Macadam Portland, OR 972391 Hospital Pack OHSU - Hospital 3181 SW Sam Jackson Portland, OR 972391 Hospital Pack Providence St. Vincent Hospital 9205 SW Barnes Portland, OR 972252 Hospital Packs The Oregon Health Authority is responsible for the CHEMPACK pro gram in Oregon. Ins tu ons housing CHEMPACK(s) are required to have a plan in place for ac va ng their cache. Hospitals with- out a cache on site can develop a plan to request CHEMPACK asse ts. Contact the Oregon Health Authority's Health Security, Preparedness, and Re sponse program to learn more about the program ( h ps://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/PREPAREDNESS/PARTNERS/Pages/medical counter- measures.aspx ). The CHEMPACK formulary consists of three types of drugs: one th at treats excess secre ons caused by nerve agents (e.g. excess saliva, tears, urine, vomi ng, and diarrhea); a second one that treats symptoms such as high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, weaknes s, muscle tremors and paralysis; and a third that treats and can prevent seizures.Pediatric Annex for a Hospital EOP Module 10: Pediatric Nerve Agent Response Facility-Based Opera onal Details When a suspected nerve agent or organophosphate exposure may re quire CHEMPACK deployment and the CHEMPACK is deployed, the hospital will be ready to rec eive and dispense the materials included. Refer to your hospital's ac va on protocol and incorporate pediatric dosing informa on from the Appendices into your treatment guidelines for nerve ag ent exposure. Planning Assump on: Most pa ents will be given ini al countermeasures in the eld by EMS. Hospitals are more likely to be providing addi onal doses to treat pa ents once they are on site.
