You are in the right place My primary goal is to promote and achieve optimal health by finding and treating the underlying cause of your symptoms so that you can pursue your highest purpose. Hi, I'm Dr. Sayre Consulting Naturopathic Physician I received my degree from Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, AZ. I am a primary care specialist who provides natural medicine by first meeting my patients where they are and then working with their health goals to create an individualized plan. I am passionate about teaching healthy and sustainable ways of living to find true vitality. I believe quality healthcare should have an emphasis on customer service, optimism, and teamwork. I always say, \"The human body is the most technologically advanced system on this planet. When the body is imbalanced, that is where dis-ease begins. My goal is to help recondition the body so that it can heal itself.\" My drive to help the body heal comes from my belief that when people have their health in the balance, they can then pursue their purpose in the greater community. Naturopathic principles One First, Do No Harm Utilize the most natural, least invasive, and least toxic therapies Two The Healing Power of Nature The inherited wisdom of the body's ability to heal itself Three Identify and Treat the Cause Look beyond the symptoms of the underlying root cause Four Doctor as Teacher Educate patients in the steps to achieving and maintaining health Five Treat the Whole Person View the body as an integrated whole in all physical and spiritual dimensions, and not as separate entities Six Prevention Focus on overall health, wellness, and disease prevention What to expect First schedule a free 15-minute call to establish health goals and make sure we are a great fit! The initial consultation includes a 1-2 hour visit depending on what we decide you need to achieve, including a comprehensive history, review any labs, and education on a treatment plan which will usually have a Homeopathic remedy, etc. I will also be happy to consult with any other member of your health team. Follow-ups are typically 30 minutes to evaluate progress and make adjustments to treatment protocol as needed. Remote Healthcare I will see patients locally in Washington or remotely when appropriate. For remote patients, I require a primary care provider on board for medication management, labs, and physical examination. Office hours are dependent on each patient's location and availability. "}
