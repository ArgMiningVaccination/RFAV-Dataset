While both side s of the political spectrum have campaigned heavily on various policy initiatives and tort reform programs to combat the skyrocketing insurance premium rates, I believe they have i gnored best solution. Afte r a thorough analysis of the relevant factors contributing to the rising insurance premium ra tes, I strongly advocate for the implementation of state compensation funds throughout the nation. The crisis has created epidemic problems for doctors, patients, and insurers. The median annual premium increase for internists, genera l surgeons, and obstetricians/gynecologists increased from 0-2 percent in 1996-97 to 17-18 pe rcent in 2003, climbing to 60 percent in some states in 2001-02, after adjusting for inflati on (Danzon, Patricia, Andrew Epstein and Scott Johnson, 2004). Many insurance companies have had to exit the market, because they were unable to cover their costs. This has left ma ny patients without adequate care and many doctors without insurance coverage. There are many factors affectin g the rise in premium rates throughout our country. Although many factors a ffect the rates, the use of the state compensation fund appears to be th e most significant in this study. The insurance companies, doctors and th e Republican Party explain the malpractice \"crisis\" by referring to the fri volous lawsuits by patients and excessive jury awards. The patients, lawyers and the Democratic Party argue it is more complicated than jury awards and lawsuits; they claim that failing investments in the insurance market coupled with many other 2 confounding factors have contributed to this nationwide problem. In response to the past problems in medical malpractice, many states have adopted reforms of tort law, intended to reduce the level and unpredictabi lity of claims, including ca ps on awards for noneconomic damages, collateral source off-set and short stat utes of limitations. Some states focused on measures to assure the availability of insuran ce and reduce the costs to physicians through joint underwriting associations and patient compensati on funds (Danzon et al., 2004). But have these reforms actually led to lower premium rates for do ctors? Does tort reform solve the problem? Determining the factors that affect premium rates will allow policy makers to develop and implement policy that will decrease premium rates and lead the nation towards a more affordable and available healthcare system. Literature Review Many scholars have proposed a series of diffe rent rationales for the difficulties of the system, which have only led to continued debate on the best policy action to take. The liability system is a primary political concern, especially as it was a key issue in the 2004 presidential election between President George W. Bush and U.S. Senator John Kerry. The opposing viewpoints of President Bush and Senator Kerry cl early illustrate the more general perspectives on this issue. The Case for Damage Limits President George W. Bush's Proposal President Bush strongly stands behind the cl aim that \"junk lawsuits\" are the main cause of rising medical liability prem iums and consequently the sour ce of skyrocketing healthcare costs (Office of the Press Secretary, 2003). He be lieves that limiting the claims made against 3 doctors and hospitals and enforcing strict tort reform will create a more efficient healthcare system. The specific proposals the President has made to Congress include the following: Secure the ability of injured patients to get quick, unlimited compensation for their \"economic losses,\" includ ing the loss of ability to provide unpaid services for care for children or parents. Ensure that non-economic damages do not exceed $250,000. Reserve punitive damages for cases where they are justified and limit punitive damages to reasonable amounts. Provide for payments of judgments over ti me rather than in a single lump sum. Ensure old cases cannot be brought forward years after the event. Reduce the amount that doctors must pa y if a plaintiff has received other payments from an insurer to compensate for their losses. Provide that defendants pay judgments in proportion to their fault. (Office of the Press Secretary, 2003). Articles Supporting Bush's Proposal The Republican doctrine strongly maintains the belief that our medical malpractice insurance premiums are rising because of frivolous lawsuits and excessive jury rewards. If the government regulates the amount of money availabl e to plaintiffs, through the use of damage caps, the Administration believes the crisis will be solved. Not only do they believe it will solve the medical malpractice crisis, but President Bush claims that these regulations will decrease the overall cost of healthcare in our nation and allow healthcare access to all patients. While speaking to a group in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the President said, \"For th e sake of affordable and accessible health care in America, we must have a limit on non-economic damages.... Excessive jury awards will continue to drive up insurance costs, will put good doctors out of business or run them out of your communit y, and will hurt communities like Scranton, 4 Pennsylvania\" (2003). Many scholars and advocacy groups have agreed with the President's proposals and conducted studies to pr ove the viability of his plan. A 2002 study , Confronting the New Health Care Crisis: Improving Health Care Quality and Lowering Costs by Fixing Our Medical Liability System , agreed with the President's plan. This study emphasized, \"Americans spend proportio nally far more per person on the costs of litigation than any other country in the world. The excesses of the litigation system are an important contributor to \"defensive medicine.\" As multi-million dollar jury awards have become more commonplace in recent years, these problems have reached epic proportions. Insurance premiums for malpractice are increa sing at a rapid rate, particularly in states that have not taken steps to make their legal systems function more predictably and effectively. Doctors are facing much higher overall costs and some cannot obtain insurance despite having never lost a single malpractice judgment or even faced a cl aim (\"Confronting the New Health,\" 2002). By analyzing data published by the Medical Liability Monitor, this study confirmed that medical malpractice insurance premiums have been rapidly increasing in many states. Rates have increased excessively for doctors who are in a specialty practice such as internal medicine, general surgery, and obstetrics/gynecology. The av erage increases ranged from 11% to 17% in 2000 and are continuing to rise. A recent special re port revealed that rate increases are averaging 20% (\"Confronting the New Health,\" p. 12). Th e report by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) further reported find ings regarding the comparison of states with caps with states without noneconomic caps. The overall increases in the states without caps are greater than those with damage limits. The states with limits of $250,000 or $350,000 on non-economic damages have an average combined lowest premium increase of 12-15%, compared to 44% in states without caps on non-economic damages( \"Confronting the New Health,\" p. 12). 5 Therefore, the conclusions made by the HHS during this investigation strongly favor the proposals made by the President. A 2004 study done by Emory Professor Kenneth E. Thorpe comes to the same conclusion regarding tort reform. Thorpe used data from the National Association of Insurance Companies (NIAC) to study state-level trends in insurance premiums earned and loss ratios experienced by insurers for 1985-2001. Thorpe compared the tre nds for those states that capped non-economic damages, modified joint-and-se veral liability, capped attorneys' fees, or changed collateral- source rules, with those that did not. He also controlled for a number of state characteristics, including the degree of competition in the insu rance market of the state and the number for physicians practicing (\"The Eff ects of Tort Reform,\" p. 18). Thorpe found that the medical community is ex periencing a true crisis. As seen on the next page, the malpractice premiums are contin uously rising in all sp ecialties (Thorpe, 2004, pg. 21). From 2001-2002 there was a percentage ch ange of 14.2 for OB/GYN, 20.0 percent change for internal medicine and even a 21.9 percent increase for general surgery. Table 1. As seen in Table 2 below, loss ratios in st ates capping awards were 11.7% lower than in states without caps (Thorpe, 2004, pg. 26). In ad dition, there were significant decreases from the 6 implementation of discretionary collateral offset. This offset means that some states have adopted a rule whereby the amount a plaintiff receives is reduced by the amount he/she receives from other sources. This is to avoid a plai ntiff receiving the amount asked for from several different sources. Thorpe also controlled fo r competition in the insurance market, which indicated that a 10% increase in the index (less co mpetition) is associated with a 2% increase in premiums (p < .05). The results found by Thorpe indicated that capping non-economic damages would help to decrease premium rates, suppor ting the President's tort reform package. Table 2. The Case Against Damage Limits Senator John Kerry's Proposal Critics of the President's view see alterna tive explanations to the cause of the medical malpractice crisis and therefore propose a different plan to combat the issue. The Democratic plan is a multi-pronged approach that is based on maintaining a nd protecting patient rights, while also monitoring the liability system. Accordi ng to the Democrats, the current Administration appears to have good intentions re garding the elimination of excessi ve jury awards and frivolous law suits, but they are missing a crucial point. In order to understand th e malpractice insurance 7 system, we must take into account the many causa l factors. Senator John Kerry believes that solving the crisis of medical malpractice will not be accomplished by the tort reform proposed by the President. During the 2004 presidential campaign, the Democratic nominee advocated the following: Eliminate the special privileges that allow insurance companies to fix prices and collude in ways that increase medical malpractice premiums. Require that individuals making medical malpractice claims first go before a qualified medical specialist to make su re a reasonable grievance exists Require states to ensure the availa bility of non-binding mediation in all malpractice claims before cases proceed to trial. Support sanctions against plai ntiffs and lawyers who br ing frivolous malpractice claims, including a \"three strikes an d you're out\" provision preventing lawyers who file three frivolous cases from bring another suit for ten years. Oppose punitive damages - unless intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless indifference to life can be es tablished (\"Real Plan to Lower,\" 2004). Articles Supporting Kerry's Position Many scholars agree with the stance taken by th e Senator John Kerry and the Democratic Party and have analyzed all face ts of the situation in order to understand its complexity. Scott Harrington and Robert Litan exte nsively researched the cause of the medical malpractice insurance crisis. In their article, Causes of the Liability Insurance Crisis , these two scholars examined available data on industry premiums, lo sses, and expenses in order to understand the dramatic premium increase. They concluded that the total increase in general liability insurance premiums since 1980 can be largel y explained by growth in the discounted value of expected future losses. The evidence further suggests that liability insurers fail ed to anticipate rapid growth in losses in recent years. The growth in premiums was also aggravated by the reductions in interest rates that led to an even greater increase in the discounted value of losses (Harrington 8 & Litan, 1988, pg. 741). Harrington and Litan identify an important point that is crucial to Senator Kerry's proposal; the insurance market is partially to blam e. It is more complicated than an abundance of lawsuits bo mbarding our courtrooms. Specifically looking at the effect of jury aw ards and tort litigati on on medical liability insurance, Harrington and Litan found no significant evidence to determine a direct relationship. Admitting that standards of proof have been rela xed within the legal system, and a variety of legal doctrines have made it easier for accident victims to recover damages for their injuries (Harrington & Litan, 1988, pg. 740), th ey still determine lit tle correlation. The jury award data from Cook County, Illinois and San Francisco, Calif ornia shows that the average awards for both product liability and medical malpractice cases have grown significantly faster than the GNP and CPI for medical care. The award data also overs tates the amount plaintiffs eventually receive because they do not reflect reductions in verdic ts by appellate courts (Harrington & Litan, 1988, pg. 740). In short, Harrington and Litan found that the picture of medical malpractice was more complicated that it initially appeared and mere ly capping damages would not solve the problem; a multi-pronged approach was needed. Many civic organizations, such as the Ameri cans for Insurance Reform (AIR) have also looked beyond damage caps and into the cyclical nature of the insurance companies. In their publication, Medical Malpractice Insurance: Stable Losses/Unstable Rates 2004, the AIR examined the trends in medical malpractice in surance - both premiums and claims - over the past 30 years. They found that the amount that medical malpractice in surers have paid out, including jury awards and settlements, directly track the rate of medical inflation. On the other hand, medical malpractice premiums charged by in surers have not corresponded to increases or decreases in payouts. Rather, th ey have moved in sync with th e state of the economy, reflecting 9 gains or losses experienced by the insurance indus try's market investments. Figure 1 shows the market in the past few decades; the recent medi cal malpractice crises exactly corresponds with the cycles in the market (Americans for Insurance Reform, 2004) Figure 1. In this study, the AIR examined the medical malpractice insurance market and found that it operated in cycles of \"hard\" and \"soft\" mark ets. A \"soft\" market is when the market experiences high interest rates, excellent in surer profits, and high competition within the insurance market. Insurers seve rely under price their policies and insure very poor risks just to get premium dollars to invest. When investment income decreases - because interest rates drop or the stock market plummets - the industr y responds by sharply increasing premiums and reducing coverage, creating a \"har d\" insurance market, usually de signated a \"liability insurance crisis\" ((Americans for Insurance Reform, 2004, pg. 3-4). The market has gone through periods of economic growth and many periods of hard ship, which we have found ourselves in once again. Loss ratios are the percent of premiums that insurers pay out in claims. These ratios will drop during hard market years reflecting sudden rate hikes, as they did during the years 1985- 1987, and as the did again after 2001. Table 3 shows the exac t phenomenon at hand regarding 10 the market. Insurers did not respond to higher loss ratios during these years by raising rates because they were making significant money from investments. In fact, during the soft market, insurers are expected to take a larger underwriting loss (a comb ined loss ratio over 100 percent) than during the hard market as they benefit from more investment during these times. As shown below, when the income drops, insurers will then raise rates and loss ratios will drop as well (Americans for Insurance Reform, 2004, pg. 7-8). This study concluded that insurance payouts may follow the track of medical inflation, but prem iums rise and fall in re lationship to the state of the economy. Capping non-economic damages would not remedy the situation of medical malpractice; rather, the overall economy must improve and insurance companies must have less latitude to arbitrarily change rates. Table 3. Loss Ratios from 1975 to 2003 11 Time Magazine has written many articles on this subjec t, one citing relevant data from a well-known independent insurance -rating agency, Weiss Ratings. In a study done in 2003, they found that in states without non-economic caps, median annual premiums for standard medical- malpractice coverage rose 36 percent between 19 91 and 2002. But in states with caps, premiums rose even more, 48 percent. In the two groups of states, median 2002 premiums were about the same. Weiss found nine states with flat or decl ining premiums; two of them had caps, and seven didn't. They further speculated that regula tion of premium increases made the difference (Thottam, 2003). Data and Methodology 12 In order to determine the causes of medical malpractice premiums in the United States, three multivariate regressions were performed using premium rates from the Medical Liability Monitor (MLM), a newsletter publishing malpractice informati on since 1975. The panel data sets included rates from three different practice specialties (internal medicine, general surgery, and obstetricians/gynecologists) and two di fferent years (1993 and 2003). The thirteen independent variables were tested against each of the three different rates included the following: insurance market competition, mean family inco me, incarceration rates, politics, educational attainment, race, non-economic damage limits, patient compensation funds, and year. The MLM is a general survey us ed to assess the medical liabili ty condition of each state. Each year the Monitor surveys major writers of professional liability insu rance for physicians. They ask for mature claims-made manual rate s with limits of $1 million/$3 million for each specific specialty and report those companies that maintain filed and approved rates (Dillard, 2003). The survey also reports the states that have implemented patient compensation funds, which are currently only a handful. Physicians in these states pay surcharg es to the state funds that can range from a modest percentage to a re latively large percentage. In addition to varying surcharges, each state varies in the limit of coverage th at the fund will provide for. Although this newsletter is the most compre hensive report of medi cal liability rates, accounting for 65 to 70 percent of the insurance ma rket, there are several flaws in it. Because much of the insurance and claim information is pr ivate and difficult to determine, the Monitor is unable to account for a few factors. They do not reflect credits, de bits, dividends or other factors that may reduce or increase final premiums. Rates reported also do not include underwriting factors that can increase rates (D illard, 2003). Several state premiu ms were also unavailable for 13 lack of information; this was more likely in th e 1993 survey. Despite the shortcomings of using the premium rates from the MLM, the survey prov ided the most comprehensive data available. The independent variables were compiled fr om the United States Census of 2000 and 1990, along with information from the National Conference of State Legislatures and the American Tort Reform Association. Much of the Census data created a demographic and socioeconomic picture of each state, using mean family income, population, educational attainment and race. Each variable was placed into the regression for a unique and different purpose. 'Educational attainment' was the percenta ge of the state populati on that had received a bachelor's degree or more. I included education because it may have an impact on the actions of the doctors and patients. If the education leve l is low, patients may not know their rights and may be less likely to bring about a lawsuit. If the education level is high, doctors may be less likely to be found of malpractice. Race was broken into percentage of Blacks, Whit es, Asians, and Hispanics in each state. This variable was included to see if there were any variations am ong racial lines. The 'competition' variable was comprised of the actual number of insurance companies who reported to the MLM for that state. This variable ma y indicate whether increased competition will help decrease rates in this market or maybe there is no effect. The 'politic s' variable accounted for the party affiliation of the Congressional De legation of the specific year (2=Republican, 1=Equal, 0=Democratic). I incorporated this variable with the hope of determining if the political affiliation of a state would have any effect. The politics of a state could affect the laws enacted and/or regulations put forth. The incarceration rates were obtained from Felon Disenfranchisement: Causes and Consequences , a study done by Hamilton College Student Sean Thorsen. This variable was included to reflect th e nature of the court system of the state. I 14 hypothesized that a state with a high level of incarceration would be seen as relatively harsh, therefore not allowing for frivolous suits that ma y affect a states rates. On the other hand, a lenient court system may afford plaintiffs money more often. The last two independent variables included in this multivariate regression were the actual limits on non-economic damage s of each state and the existence and condition of a state patient compensation fund. In order to account for the different limits of each state the following scale was created, placing each state in a category. 1 = no limit on noneconomic damages 2 = $1 million limit 3 = $750,000 limit 4 = $500,000 limit 5 = $250,000 limit The comprehensive and complicated nature of the last variable, the patient compensation fund, called for several measures to be taken into account. The first regressions were performed using a dummy variable for each state that had a state fund (1 = fund in e ffect, 0 = no fund), with data provided by the National Conference of Stat e Legislatures. Upon fu rther investigation of the complexity of state compensation funds, thre e more regressions were performed to account for the differences in each state fund. Each st ate had varying requireme nts and limits concerning the participation requirements, primary coverage required and th e maximum fund coverage. The following scale was created to reflect the variations in each fund. 0 = no state fund 1 = weak state fund; has none of the follo wing: mandatory participation, primary coverage required is low, and maximum fund coverage is high 15 2 = moderate state fund; has one of th e following: mandatory participation, primary coverage required is low, and maximum fund coverage is high 3 = strong state fund; has two of the following: mandatory participation, primary coverage required is low, and maximum fund coverage is high Mandatory participation means that each person is mandated to participate, or pay into, in the state fund, as well as their own specific insu rance carrier. Primary coverage signifies when the fund will \"kick in\" and begin paying a patient. If the primar y coverage is low, then the private insurance carrier will only pay a small amount and then the state will begin payment. As seen in Table 13 of the Appendix, Louisiana ha s the lowest primary coverage required; only $100,000 paid by the carrier and then the state will start to pay. The maximum fund coverage indicates the amount the state fund will cover. For example, some states will cover an unlimited amount of money (South Carolina and Wisconsin), while others will only pay up to a certain amount (Louisiana, Nebraska, etc.). Therefore, a state receives a \"1\" if they have none of the three outlined characteristics, signifying that their state fund is not well established, having a small impact on the state. A \"strong\" state fund has two of the characteri stics, meaning the fund has a larger impact on the state. Results The six regressions performed in this study s eek to determine the si gnificant factors that affect the medical malpractice premium rates se t by insurance companies across the nation. In order to account for the vast difference in rates between internal medicine, general surgery, and obstetricians/gynecologists, separate regressions were computed for each specialty. The first set of regressions was computed using a dummy vari able for \"patient compensation fund,\" while the second set used the above-mentioned scale to in dicate differences between each state fund. The 16 computations revealed the significance of many im portant variables that may help to determine future policy action. In order to provide a perspective when read ing the following regressions, it is helpful to have a grasp on the range of premium rates used. Table 4 below outlines the average premium rates in 1993 and 2003 for each specialty. As show n, the rates have significantly increased over the span of ten years and in some cases almost doubled. Table 4.

Therefore, if the year in question is 2003, versus 1993, there is a 1743 dolla r increase in the dependant va riable, the premium rate for internal medicine. The following equation represents the results of testing the internal medicine premium with all of the indepe ndent variables and a dummy vari able for the compensation fund. Regression 1: Internal Me dicine (Dummy Variable) Internal Medicine = -21791 + 1743Yr - 326Comp + 0Pop + .34Income + + 160Limit - 944Funddummy + e Although the coefficients are important in a regression equation, the more important indicator is the p-value. This value is used to indicate the st atistical significance of a given 17 variable. A variable is consider ed significant if its p-value is le ss than or equal to 5%, indicating that there is a less than 5% chance that the esti mated coefficient would have occurred by chance. The p-values for this regression are shown in Table 5 below and those values considered significant are in bold. Table 5.

Other significant variab les were 'population' (p = sation fund' (p = 5.7%). The latter two are just over the important 5% mark; however, I tho ught they were worth mentioning. 'Politics' accounts for the political affiliation of the Congressi onal delegation of that specific year, which in this case increased the premium rate. The ex istence of a patient comp ensation fund decreased 18 the premium rate by 2,749 cents ( p = 5.7%), si gnificantly bringing down premium rates. Interesting in this regression is the insignifi cance of the independent variable of interest, noneconomic damage caps. Regression 2: General Su rgery (Dummy Variable) The following equation is the result of the general surgery regression: General Surgery = -52852 + 8298Yr - 1581Comp + 0Pop + 1.03Income Premium + - + + 6Blk + 900Asian + 1101His + 1010Limit - 3618FundDummy + e The second regression resulted in somewhat different results, placing importance on various other independent variable s used in the equation, as show n in the table below. 'Race' and 'educational attainment' were statistically significant when tested against general surgery premium rates. In terms of education in each state, for every additional person who attained a bachelor's degree or more, the premium rates de creased by 1,354 cents (p = 4.3%). Also, if a state has more Black and Hispanic people, th e premium rate will increase. 'Mean family income' (p = 5.2%), 'politics' (p = 2.6%), and 'population' (p = 2.4%) also had significant positive effects on the premium rates. Surprising ly, the existence of a patient compensation fund had no significant effect on the ra tes of general surgery doctors and the non-economic damage caps (limits) also had no significant effect.

Mean family income seems to again hold a significant statistic (p = 2.1%) calc ulating that with every dollar increase in the state's mean family income, there is a $1.36 increase in the pr emium rate. The R-squared is .44 (44%), which means that 44% of the deviation in the premium rates is explained by th e independent variables present in the regression. Although a higher R- squared is ideal, accounting for 44% of the changes in premium rates is significant. What is once again interesting in this equation is the insignificance of the independent variable of interest , non-economic damage caps. The patient compensation fund also had no significance in this regression, resulting in a p-value of 14%. 20 Table 7.

The only two independent variables that Coefficients Standard Error t Stat 0.032701 21 were significant were 'population' (p = 0.3 %) and 'mean family income' (p = 3.4%). Interestingly the population continued to have a ve ry small coefficient, meaning there is a zero unit increase in dependant variable with each unit increase in the population. Unfortunately there was no significance in eith er variable of interest, non-economic damage limits (p = 77%) or patient compensation fund (p = 15.9%). The full regression summary output is displayed below. Table 8.

This means that for every increase in the percentage of the popul ation that holds a bach elor's degree or more, there is a 1,281 dollar decrease in the premium rate charged to general surgeons. 'Population' ( p p = 1.1%) are also significant variables in th is equation, all having positive eff ects on the dependant variable. There is still no importance in the variable of interest, patient compensation fund ( p = 28.9%). Table 9.

Similar to the other specialties, the variab le of interest, patient compensa tion fund, has no significant effect on the premium rates of this specialty. Also, the original variable of in terest, damage cap limits remains insignificant in each of the three regression equations. Table 10.

There are many reasons why this study may have resulted in a different produc t. This study used a multivariate regression including many socioeconomic variables that may have an impact on premium rates. Few other studies I have encountered used a comprehe nsive multivariate regression including a wide variety of independent variables. The Thorpe article was the only article that controlled for many independent variables, but did not include a variable for patient compensation fund. What was interesting from the Thorpe article was the significance he also found in market competition. He found that a 10% increase in the index (less co mpetitive) is associated with a 2% increase in premiums ( p = .05). This study found competition to have no significant effect. Also, the R- squared results throughout the study were some what low (~.40-.50), meaning there are other relevant factors that play a role in the premium rates. Other f actors may include specific state data beyond the scope of this study or market factors that I was unable to account for. Differences in results such as this may be attrib uted to the other confoundi ng factors used in each study. Thorpe failed to account for the patient co mpensation fund states, which definitely proved to have an effect. Other articles failed to use multivariate regressions, instead using \"raw\" figures and percentages and case studies, which are the lowest on a hierarchy of statistical information (Wyckoff, 2004). However, this study accounted for an array of possible contributing factors and therefore has le d to interesting and promising results. Conclusion The results of the six regressi ons performed in this study have the ability to have a major effect on the future of the medical malpractice crisis. Even though each of the regressions had a 25 distinct and individual result, th ey painted a picture of the current malpractice situation in our nation and pointed us in the right direction. The results of all the regressions counter Pr esident Bush's main tort reform to place significant damage caps (limits) on the noneconomi c damages of medical malpractice cases. This independent variable of inte rest had no significant effect in any regression performed in this analysis, resulting in exceptionally high p-values (77%). The insignificance of limits in this study speaks to the importance of Senator Kerry's stance on not limiting the noneconomic damages awarded to patients. If caps have no significant effect on decreasing the overall malpractice premiums, there is no reason to restri ct the patients who deserve such awards. Another independent variable that had a sign ificant positive effect several times was the political factor. The implications of the posit ive effect from a more Republican congressional delegation are difficult to understand. Although the Republican Party tends to push for tort reform against the lawyers and patients by rest ricting awards and payments, it seems unlikely that this would result in an increase in prem ium rates. Traditionally the Republican Party supports \"big business\" and a free market economy with less interv entionist policies. Therefore, it is only logical that their stance on medical malpractice would favor the insurance companies and hospitals. After surveying ot her studies in the matter of polit ics and health care policy, I was unable to find a like correlation between politics and premium rates. There are many studies that analyze the success and/or failure of certain heal th care reforms enacted by the different political sides. However, a link between two factors repr esenting the two discussed in this study was not available. Perhaps a more Republican state ha s been less focused on insurance regulation and therefore, the rates have failed to decline. Typically Republican s are wealthier than Democrats; maybe a Republican state has high premium rates b ecause of a higher level of income. In any 26 event, this political factor calls for a more deta iled analysis, controlling for other possible factors that may be at play. The most noteworthy and promising result of this study is the e ffectiveness of state compensation funds on medical malpractice premiu m rates. When using a dummy variable to control for a state having any type of patie nt compensation fund, OBG/YN had a significant negative effect on premium rates. While internal medicine was al most significant ( p = 5.7%). Currently there are only seven st ates across the nation that have working patient compensation funds, each of which is slightly different. Even after controlling for the differences between the state funds, there seemed to only be an effect on the premium rates when there was a dummy variable used. This evidence sp eaks to the fact that more states should consider implementing patient compensation funds in order to deal with the malpractice crisis. These funds do not erase the costs of healthcare and malpr actice; they simply divide the costs between the state and the primary insurer, allowing for a better overall system. Basicall y, physicians pay a surcharge to the state fund and then pay a fee to their primary carrier. In the case of a suit, the primary carrier will pay the award up to a certain amount, when the state fund will begin payment. The varying conditions for the seven states that have implem ented a patient compensation fund are outlined in Table 11 in the Appendix (\"South Carolina Legisl ative,\" 2000). The varying spectrum of state funds demonstrates that states do not need to adopt a uniform method; different forms will work to reduce rates. The medical malpractice system in our country is in dire need of assistance. The rising premiums are causing turmoil in our courtrooms a nd hospitals. Although the results of this study do not recommend either candidate's proposal, ther e is an interesting and promising outcome. The idea of a patient compensati on fund may be difficult for stat es to implement immediately, 27 but according to the results of this study, a co mpensation fund will decrease premium rates, creating a more efficient and affordable medical malpractice system for our nation.
