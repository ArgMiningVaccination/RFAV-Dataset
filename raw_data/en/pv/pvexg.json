But you might be feeling nervous as well. If it's your first baby, it's hard to know what to expect. Your mum, colleagues, friends and relations might all be giving you advice. And then there is all the information on the internet as well as in magazines and books. At times it can feel overwhelming and it's hard to know who is right when people say different things. This book brings together everything you need to know to have a healthy and happy pregnancy, and to make sure you get the care that is right for you. The guidance about pregnancy and babies does change, so it's important to get up-to-date, trusted advice to help you make the right decisions and choices. If you have any questions or concerns - no matter how trivial they may seem - talk to your midwife or doctor. They are there to support you. Your pregnancy at a glance 5Your pregnancy at a glance Before you get pregnant T hink about the lifestyle factors that might affect your ability to get pregnant and have a healthy pregnancy (see Chapter 5). This applies to men too. You are more likely to get pregnant if you are both in good health. - If you smoke, get advice ab out stopping. You are up to four times more likely to stop smoking successfully with support. V isit www.stopsmokingni.info further information on the 650+ specialist stop smoking services that are available across Northern Ireland. T hese free stop smoking services provide N RT and are run by specially trained staff who can advise you on the best way to manage your cravings and become smoke free. Services are off ered in many GP practices, community pharmacies, H SCT premises, and community and voluntary worganisations. They can be set up in workplaces. Eat a balanced diet. - Maintain a healthy weight. - Y ou should avoid drinking alcohol if you are pregnant or trying to conceive. - T ake exercise. If you or your partner take any medication, talk to your doctor ab out whether it will affect your pregnancy. T ake 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. You should continue to take this until you are 12 weeks pregnant (see page 35). If you already have a baby with spina bifida, or if you have coeliac disease, diabetes, are obese or take anti-epileptic medicines, ask your G P or midwife for more advice. You will need to take a bigger dose of folic acid that requires a prescription. If you have a health condition, for e xample mental health problems, diabetes or a family history of any inherited diseases, talk to your GP or a specialist before you try to get pregnant. T alk to your GP or a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or need support. 6 As soon as you know you are pregnant, get in touc h with a midwife or your GP to organise your antenatal care (see Antenatal care on page 54). Begin to think about where you want your baby to be born (see page 60). A leaflet outlining your choices is available from your midwife and GP. S ome pregnant women start to feel sick or tired or have other minor physical problems for a few weeks (see page 75). T ake 10 micrograms of vitamin D per day. You should continue to take vitamin D throughout your pregnancy and while you are breastfeeding. If you qualify for Healthy Start (you are at least 10 weeks pregnant and in receipt of certain benefits) you will be entitled to Healthy Start vitamins which contain vitamin D and folic acid. If you do not qualify for Healthy Start your midwife may recommend other supplements. If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes or a past history of gestational diabetes, telephone the antenatal clinic for an early appointment as soon as you realise you are pregnant. If you are not already taking folic acid supplements, you should start now. If you already have a baby with spina bifida, or if you have coeliac disease, diabetes, are obese or take anti-epileptic medicines, ask your GP or midwife for more advice. You will need to take a bigger dose of folic acid that requires a prescription. 0-8 weeks Y ou will usually attend your first booking appointment by 12 weeks. A t the booking appointment, your weight, height and body mass index will be measured. You will be asked about your health and family history as well as about your baby's father's family history. This is to find out if you or your baby are at risk of certain conditions. Y our hand-held notes and plan of care will be completed. Y ou will be offered blood tests for hepatitis B, HIV, syphilis and rubella. Y our midwife will discuss various tests you will be offered during your pregnancy, one of which is an ultrasound scan to check for abnormalities in your baby (see page 65). You will be offered information about what to expect during pregnancy and how to have a healthy pregnancy. Ask if you are unsure about anything. Y our midwife will also discuss the whooping cough and flu vaccines which are offered to all pregnant women. Y our midwife or GP will be able to give you your flu vaccine at any stage of pregnancy during flu season. Y ou can ask your midwife about your rights at work and the benefits available. Y ou will usually be offered an ultrasound scan between eight and 14 weeks. This will check the baby's measurements and give an accurate due date. The scan can also detect some abnormalities and check if you are carrying more than one baby. Your partner can come along to the scan (see Antenatal care on page 54). Make a dental appointment. H SC dental care is free during pregnancy and for a year after the birth of your baby. Just 12 weeks after conception, your baby is fully formed. It has all its organs, muscles, limbs and b ones, and its sex organs are well developed. Y our baby is already moving about but you cannot feel the movements yet.8-12 weeks Your pregnancy at a glance 7 Find out ab out antenatal education (see Antenatal care on page 54). Start to think ab out how you want to feed your baby (see Feeding your baby on page 119). Make sure you are wearing a supportive bra. Y our breasts will probably increase in size during pregnancy so you need to make sure you are wearing the right sized bra. If you have been f eeling sick and tired, you will probably start to feel better around this time. A t 14 weeks, your baby's heartbeat is strong and should be heard using an ultrasound detector. Y our pregnancy may just be beginning to show. This varies a lot from woman to woman.12-16 weeks Y ou may start to feel your baby move (see How your baby develops on page 23). Y our tummy will begin to get bigger and you will need looser clothes. Y ou may feel a surge of energy. T ry to do your pregnancy exercises regularly (see Your health in pregnancy on page 31).

T hink about who you would like to have with you during labour. Get your bag ready if you are planning to give birth in hospital or in a midwif ery unit. Y ou will probably be attending antenatal classes now (see Antenatal care on page 54). Y ou may be more aware of your uterus tightening from time to time.

See pha.site/nice-induction-lab our for guidelines on induction of labour.41 weeks101Becoming pregnant Ovulation occurs each month when an egg (ovum) is released from one of the ovaries. Occasionally, more than one egg is released, usually within 24 hours of the first egg. The 'fingers' at the end of the fallopian tubes help to direct the egg down into the tube. At the same time, the lining of the uterus begins to thicken and the mucus in the cervix becomes thinner so that sperm can swim through it more easily.The egg begins to travel down the fallopian tube. If a man and woman have recently had sex, the egg might be fertilised here by the man's sperm. The lining of the uterus is now thick enough for the fertilised egg to be implanted.If the egg is not fertilised, it will pass out of the body during the woman's monthly period along with the lining of the uterus, which is also shed. The egg is so small that it cannot be seen. Ovulation 1 2 3 Egg being releasedFallopian tubeVaginaOvaryEgg progressing down the fallopian tubeUterus lining being shed A B C DE FAB CDE F1 Becoming pregnant 11Conception Conception is the process that begins with the fertilisation of an egg and ends with the implantation of an egg into a woman's uterus. 1 2 3 A B CD EF EggSperm being ejaculatedPenisEgg being fertilisedSperm Attached embryo A BD EF Ovulation A woman conceives around the time she is ovulating; that is, when an egg has been released from one of her ovaries into one of her fallopian tubes.Fertilisation During sex, sperm are ejaculated from a man's penis into a woman's vagina. In one ejaculation there may be more than 300 million sperm. Most of the sperm leak out of the vagina but some begin to swim up through the cervix. When a woman is ovulating, the mucus in the cervix is thinner than usual to let sperm pass through more easily. Sperm swim into the uterus and into the fallopian tubes. Fertilisation takes place if a sperm joins with an egg and fertilises it.Implantation During the week after fertilisation, the fertilised egg (which is now an embryo) moves slowly down the fallopian tube and into the uterus. It is already growing. The embryo attaches itself firmly to the specially thickened uterus lining. This is called implantation. Hormones released by the embryonic tissue prevent the uterus lining from being shed. This is why women miss their periods when they are pregnant. C12 Hormones Both men and women have hormones, which are chemicals that circulate in the bloodstream. They carry messages to different parts of the body and result in certain changes taking place. Female hormones, which include oestrogen and progesterone, control many of the events of a woman's monthly cycle, such as the release of eggs from her ovaries and the thickening of her uterus lining. During pregnancy, your hormone levels change. As soon as you have conceived, the amount of oestrogen and progesterone in your blood increases. This causes the uterus lining to build up, the blood supply to your uterus and breasts to increase and the muscles of your uterus to relax to make room for the growing baby. The increase in hormone levels can affect how you feel. You may have mood swings, feel tearful or be easily irritated. For a while you may feel that you cannot control your emotions, but these symptoms should ease after the first three months of your pregnancy. Boy or girl? Every normal human cell contains 46 chromosomes, except for male sperm and female eggs. These contain 23 chromosomes each. When a sperm fertilises an egg, the 23 chromosomes from the father pair with the 23 from the mother, making 46 in all. Chromosomes are tiny, thread- like structures which each carry about 2,000 genes. Genes determine a baby's inherited characteristics, such as hair and eye colour, blood group, height and build. A fertilised egg contains one sex chromosome from its mother and one from its father. The sex chromosome from the mother's egg is always the same and is known as the X chromosome. The sex chromosome from the father's sperm can be an X or a Y chromosome. If the egg is fertilised by a sperm containing an X chromosome, the baby will be a girl (XX). If the sperm contains a Y chromosome, the baby will be a boy (XY). Twins, triplets or more Identical twins occur when one fertilised egg splits into two; each baby will have the same genes - and therefore they will be the same sex and look very alike. Non-identical twins are more common. They are the result of two eggs being fertilised by two sperm at the same time. The babies may be of the same sex or different sexes, and will probably look no more alike than any other brothers and sisters. A third of all twins will be identical and two-thirds non-identical. Twins happen in about 1 in every 65 pregnancies. A couple is more likely to have twins if 1 Becoming pregnant 13there are twins in the woman's family. Triplets occur naturally in 1 in 10,000 pregnancies and quads are even rarer. Nowadays, the use of treatments such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has made multiple births more common. Are you carrying twins? You might suspect that you are carrying more than one baby if: you are very sic k in early pregnancy; you seem bigger than you should be for your 'dates'; you have had f ertility treatment. It is usually possible to find out through your dating ultrasound scan, which happens between eight and 12 weeks (see page 63). You may need another scan after this to find out whether the babies share a placenta (are identical) or if they have two separate placentas, in which case they can be either identical or non-identical. It is important to know this because women with babies who share a placenta will need to have more appointments and scans. If this cannot be determined, you should be offered a further scan. A third of identical twins have two separate placentas. This happens when the fertilised egg splits in the first 3-4 days after conception and before it implants in the uterus. What is different about being pregnant with twins or more? Multiple pregnancies have a higher risk of complications - particularly premature birth. If your babies share a placenta (identical twins) or if you are having more than two babies, you should be offered pregnancy care at a special clinic for multiple pregnancies. These clinics are not held in every hospital in Northern Ireland, and you might need to travel to another hospital. Your doctor might also refer you to the Regional Fetal Medicine Service in Belfast if you require more specialised care. If your babies are triplets or if they share a placenta it is recommended that you are scanned every two weeks from 16 weeks onwards, and every four weeks if your babies have separate placentas. You are more likely to have a caesarean section but twins can sometimes be delivered vaginally. Your doctor should discuss this with you. It is possible to breastfeed twins and triplets and there is more information about how you can do this in chapter 10. Advice on the care you might expect during pregnancy is available from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),pha.site/multiple-pregnancy 2Now you are pregnant 14When you first make contact with your midwife or GP you will be given information about: folic acid and vitamin D supplements; nutrition and diet; food hygiene; lif estyle factors that may affect your health or the health of your baby, such as smoking, recreational drug use and alcohol consumption. Your booking appointment Most women have their 'booking appointment' with a midwife between the 8th and 12th week of pregnancy. This can take a couple of hours. You will also be offered an ultrasound scan to confirm you are pregnant and when your baby is due. You will be offered a single Protecting you and your baby Blood tests at your first antenatal visitThe time from when you find out you are pregnant until you have your baby is the antenatal period and during this time you will receive your care from the most appropriate person for your pregnancy. As soon as you know you are pregnant, you should get in touch with a midwife to organise your antenatal care. It's best to see them as early as possible. You can contact a midwife in your local Health and Social Care Trust directly, or contact your GP surgery and they will refer you to maternity services where you will see a midwife.blood test that will test for a number of health problems. This is known as antenatal screening. You will be given information on these tests and asked for your consent prior to testing. For more information see pha.site/antenatal-blood-tests This appointment will usually take place in the community although it may be necessary to then attend the hospital for your scan or if you need to see a doctor. At this appointment you will be given information about: how the baby develops during pregnancy; nutrition and diet; e xercise and pelvic floor exercises; your antenatal care including group-based care and education; flu and whooping cough vaccines to protect you and your baby; breastf eeding; antenatal education; your options for where to have your baby; your green maternity hand-held record (MHHR) should also be given at this visit for you to keep during your pregnancy. Questions at the booking appointment At your booking appointment you will be asked a lot of questions to build up a picture of you and your pregnancy. This is so that you are given the support you need and any risks are spotted early. You will probably want to ask a lot of questions yourself. You may be asked about: your health and any family health issues; any previous illnesses and operations; details of any previous pregnancies or miscarriages; your and your baby's father's origins. T his is to find out if your baby is at risk of certain inherited conditions, or if there are other factors, such as a history of twins; how you are f eeling and if you have been feeling depressed; family history of inherited disorders. A t the end of your booking appointment, you should understand the plan of care for your pregnancy and have your hand-held notes to carry with you at all times. 2 Now you are pregnant 1516 Your booking appointment is an opportunity to tell your midwife or doctor if you are in a vulnerable situation or if you need extra support. This could be because of issues such as domestic violence, sexual abuse or female genital mutilation. Let your midwife know if you have a disability that means you have special requirements for your antenatal appointments or labour. If you don't speak English as your first language and need an interpreter, let your midwife know and arrangements will be made. At this appointment the type of care you will have during your pregnancy will be discussed and decided. If all is well with your pregnancy you will have the majority of your appointments with your midwif e in the community, usually close to where you live. If there are complications with your pregnancy (either your health, your baby or with previous pregnancies) you will have the majority of your care in the maternity hospital where you are going to have your baby and be seen by an obstetrician throughout your pregnancy . Sometimes the type of care may change during your pregnancy, for example if your obstetrician is happy for you to receive care in the community or your midwife discovers a problem which means you need to be seen by a doctor and continue your care in the hospital. Where to have your baby You can have your baby at home, midwife-led unit (MLU) or in hospital. It is important that you make an informed decision about where you would like to give birth. It is up to you where you can have your baby. Even after you have decided, you can still change your mind. Your midwife will discuss the options that are available to you locally, though you are free to choose any maternity services in Northern Ireland, if you are prepared to travel. At the booking appointment, your midwife will discuss options with you, using evidence-based information including: T he Place of Birth tables. These are included in your hand-held maternity record (your green notes). GAI N/RQIA Guidelines on Planning to give birth in a midwife-led unit in Northern Ireland. This is available online. There are two versions, one aimed at women and their partners: pha.site/rqia-midwife-led and the full guideline: pha.site/midwife-unit-guidelines 2 Now you are pregnant 17 R QIA 'Planning birth at home' guideline www.rqia.org.uk (search or 'Planning birth at home') Please ask for this information if it is not provided. There are two main types of maternity care in Northern Ireland: a) Midwife-led b) Consultant-led (In this case the consultant is a doctor known as an obstetrician, and the units are called obstetric units). Your options are described in more detail below: a) Midwife-led Care This includes birth at home or in a midwife-led unit.Benefits of midwife-led care you can give birth in surroundings where you may f eel more relaxed and able to cope with labour; you are more likely to be looked after by a midwif e who you have got to know during your pregnancy; most MLU teams offer complimentary therapies during pregnancy; you are twice as likely to have a normal lab our and birth; Planning a hospital birth Many women will be advised to give birth in a consultant-led hospital. Your midwife can give you information to help you decide which hospital you want to have your baby in. If there is more than one hospital in your locality you can choose which one to go to. Find out more about the care provided in each so that you can decide which will suit you best.General questions about midwife-led units and consultant-led units Here are some of the questions that you might want to ask: Are tours of maternity facilities for birth available before the birth or does the unit provide D VDs? W hen can I discuss my birth plan? Are TE NS machines available (see page 104) or do I need to hire one? W hat equipment is available - for example mats, a birthing chair or beanbags? Are there birthing pools? Are partners, close relatives or friends welcome in the delivery room? Are birthing partners ever asked to leave the room? W hy? Can I move around in lab our and find my own position for the birth? W hat services are provided for sick babies? W ho will help me breastfeed my baby? W ho will help me if I choose to formula feed? How long am I likely to be in hospital? W hat are the visiting hours?

For consideration you may need to transf er from home to a MLU/ obstetric unit or from a MLU to an obstetric unit during labour or after your baby is born, though emergency transfers are uncommon; epidurals are not available in midwif e-led care - however a birthing pool can be used during labour and birth, if available; you can access gas and air and medication suc h as diamorphine. Further information is available online at pha.site/place-of-birth Home Home birth is particularly suitable for women with a straightforward pregnancy because the rate of intervention is lower. If you have had a baby before, the outcome for the baby is no different compared with an obstetric unit. More details are available in your maternal hand-held record (green notes) and online at www.rqia.org.uk (search 'Planning birth at home') and at pha.site/place-of-birth Midwife-led Unit Midwife-led units are staffed by midwives and are particularly recommended for women with a straightforward pregnancy, because the rate of intervention is lower and the outcome for the baby is no different compared with an obstetric unit. More details are available in your maternal hand-held record (green notes). You can also find additional information online at pha.site/rqia-midwife-led Your care in labour will be provided by midwives and if a problem arises you will be transferred to the local consultant-led unit, via 2 Now you are pregnant 19What is a midwife? The midwife is the main provider of care for most pregnant women. Midwives are highly skilled, qualified professionals who care for women during normal pregnancy, childbirth and after the birth. You will be introduced to your midwife, who will care for you during pregnancy and when you go home. You may meet different members of a team of midwives throughout your pregnancy. Midwives are trained to make sure everything goes as well as possible and to recognise any potential problems for you and your baby. Midwives work both in maternity units and in the community, often in a team system. The style of care may depend on where you live. Community midwives may visit you at home before the birth and will continue to care for you after the birth. ambulance if needed. There are two types of midwife-led units - freestanding and alongside. Freestanding midwife-led units There are currently three midwife-led Northern Ireland: Lagan Valley Downe (Downpatrick) and The Mater (Belfast). Alongside midwife-led units There are currently six alongside midwife-led units (AMU) in Northern Ireland: Altnagelvin, Craigavon, Daisy Hill, Royal Maternity (ABC - Active Birth Centre), South Western Acute Hospital, Ulster Hospital (Home from Home); with further units in development - ask your midwife for details. b) Consultant-led care In hospital There are currently eight obstetric units situated within hospitals in Northern Ireland: Antrim Area, Altnagelvin, Causeway, Craigavon, Daisy Hill Royal Maternity, South Western Acute Hospital, Ulster Hospital. Planning your birth in these units is recommended particularly for women who have additional health needs or have complications, or whose pregnancy has not been straightforward. You will be looked after by a midwife, but doctors will be available if you need their help. Benefits of consultant-led care you can access specialised medical services, including doctors who support women with health complications suc h as diabetes, heart conditions, thyroid problems, neurological conditions, or cancer;Options for place of birth Midwife-led care Consultant-led care or Home Midwife-led unitsObstetric unit20 you can access specialised medical services, including doctors who support babies with health complications; epidurals are normally available. F or consideration when you arrive in lab our you may go to an antenatal ward, followed by delivery suite (where you will have your baby). Afterwards you may go home within a few hours or be transferred to a postnatal ward; there is a greater c hance that you will have a caesarean section, a ventouse (vacuum) birth, or forceps birth; you are more likely to need a blood transfusion; you are unlikely to see the consultant at your clinical appointment and are more likely to be seen by a wide range of health prof essionals including doctors in training; your partner is unlikely to be able to stay overnight.Help for young mums If you are a young mum, there are a wide range of services to support you when you are pregnant and after you have had your baby . Your midwife or health visitor will be able to give you details of local services. If you are on your own If you are pregnant and on your own, it is even more important that there are people with whom you can share your feelings and who can offer you support. Sorting out problems, whether personal or medical, is 2 Now you are pregnant 21Help and support The following national organisations can also give you help and advice: Common Y outh If you are under 19, you can visit Common Y outh for free, confidential advice. To findyour nearest centre, go to www.commonyouth.com T he young woman's guide to pregnancyThe young woman's guide to pregnancy is written specifically for women under the age of 20 and includes the real pregnancy experiences of young mums. It is produced by the charity Tommy's and is available free to teenagersfrom the Tommy's website at www.tommys.org often difficult when you are by yourself, and it is better to find someone to talk to rather than let things get you down. Carrying on with your education Becoming a mother certainly does not have to mean the end of your education. If you are still of compulsory school age, your school should not exclude you on grounds of pregnancy or health and safety issues connected with your pregnancy. However, they may talk to you about making alternative arrangements for your education. You will be allowed up to 18 calendar weeks off school before and after the birth.After your return to education, you can get help with childcare costs through the Care to Learn scheme. Care to Learn also provides support with childcare costs for teenage parents above the compulsory schooling age who want to study.22Somewhere to live Many young mothers want to carry on living with their own family until they are ready to move on. If you are unable to live with your family, your local authority may be able to help you with housing. Some local authorities provide specialised accommodation where young mothers can live independently while getting support and advice from trained workers. For more information about housing, contact the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. (www.nihe.gov.uk) Family Nurse Partnership Programme If you are under 20 and expecting your first baby, a family nurse can visit you to help you have a healthy pregnancy and enjoy being the best mum you can be. Your specially trained family nurse will help you understand all about your pregnancy and how to care for yourself and your baby. Your nurse will visit you regularly during your pregnancy and then after the birth until your baby is two years old. You and your family nurse will decide together what you will cover in each visit. Your nurse will share lots of information with you about pregnancy, giving birth and looking after babies and toddlers, helping you to prepare well and decide what is right for you and your family. You and your family nurse will get to know each other well and you will be able to rely on her to help you out if things get difficult in any way. Your nurse will help you plan for your future. You can talk about childcare, education, training and gaining new skills as well as about housing and finances. Together, you decide what you want and how to make it happen.3 How your baby develops and grows 233How your baby develops and grows Measuring your pregnancy Doctors and midwives in the UK measure the duration of pregnancy from the first day of your last menstrual period, not from the day you conceive. So when you are 'four weeks pregnant', it is actually about two weeks after you conceived. Pregnancy normally lasts for 37-42 weeks from the first day of your last period. The average is 40 weeks. If you are not sure about the date of your last period, then your early scan will give a good indication of when your baby will be due.In the very early weeks, the developing baby is called an embryo. From about eight weeks, it is called a fetus. Week 3 This is three weeks from the first day of your last period. The fertilised egg moves slowly along your fallopian tube towards your uterus. It begins as one single cell, which divides again and again. By the time the fertilised egg reaches your uterus, it has become a mass of over 100 cells, called an embryo. It is still growing. Once in your uterus, the embryo attaches itself into your uterus lining. This is called implantation. Week 3 15 234Ovary Egg is released from the ovary Egg is fertilisedFertilised egg divides andtravels down fallopian tube Embryo implants itself in uterus lining Uterus1 2 3 4 5 6 624Weeks 4-5 The embryo now settles into your uterus lining. The outer cells reach out like roots to link with your blood supply. The inner cells form two - and then later three - layers. Each of these layers will grow to be different parts of your baby's body. One layer becomes their brain and nervous system, skin, eyes and ears. Another layer becomes their lungs, stomach and gut. The third layer becomes their heart, blood, muscles and bones.The fifth week is when you will miss your period. At this time, most women are only just beginning to think they may be pregnant. Already your baby's nervous system is starting to develop. A groove forms in the top layer of cells. The cells fold up and round to make a hollow tube called the neural tube. This will become your baby's brain and spinal cord, so the tube has a 'head end' and a 'tail end'. Defects in this tube are the cause of spina bifida. The heart is also forming and your baby already has some blood vessels. A string of these blood vessels connects your baby to you - this will become the umbilical cord. Weeks 6-7 There is now a large bulge where your baby's heart is and a bump for the head because the The umbilical cord The umbilical cord is a baby's lifeline. It is the link between you and your baby. Blood circulates through the cord, carrying oxygen and food to the baby and carrying waste away again. The placenta The placenta is attached to the lining of the uterus and separates your baby's circulation from your circulation. In the placenta, oxygen and food from your bloodstream pass into your baby's bloodstream and are carried to your baby along the umbilical cord. Antibodies that give resistance to infection pass to your baby in the same way. Alcohol, nicotine and other drugs can also pass to your baby this way. The amniotic sac Inside the uterus, the baby floats in a bag of fluid called the amniotic sac. Before or during labour the sac, or 'membranes', break and the fluid drains out. This is known as the 'waters breaking'.1 2 3 123 Week 4 The actual size of the embryo is about 5mm 1 month 2 months3 How your baby develops and grows 25brain is developing. The heart begins to beat and can be seen beating on an ultrasound scan. Dimples on the side of the head will become the ears and there are thickenings where the eyes will be. On the body, bumps are forming that will become muscles and bones. Small swellings (called 'limb buds') show where the arms and legs are growing. At seven weeks, the embryo has grown to about 10mm long from head to bottom. This measurement is called the 'crown-rump length'.Weeks 8-9 Your baby's face is slowly forming. The eyes are more obvious and have some colour in them. The fetus has a mouth with a tongue. There are the beginnings of hands and feet, with ridges where the fingers and toes will be. The major internal organs - the heart, brain, lungs, kidneys, liver and gut - are all developing. At nine weeks, the baby has grown to about 22mm long from head to bottom. Weeks 10-14 Just 12 weeks after conception, the fetus is fully formed. Your baby has all of their organs, muscles, limbs and bones, and their sex organs are developed. From now on your baby will grow and mature. Your baby is already moving about, but you will not be able to feel movements yet. By about 14 weeks, your baby's heartbeat is strong and can be heard by an ultrasound scanner. The heartbeat is very fast - about twice as fast as a normal adult's heartbeat. At 14 weeks, the baby 3 months 4 months 5 monthsWeek 6 The actual size from head to bottom is about 8mm Week 7The actual size from head to bottom is about 10mm Week 9The actual size from head to bottom is about 22mm 26is about 85mm long from head to bottom. Your pregnancy may start to show, but this varies a lot from woman to woman. Weeks 15-22 Your baby is growing faster than at any other time in their life. Their body grows bigger so that their head and body are more in proportion, and they don't look so 'top heavy'. The face becomes much more defined and the hair, eyebrows and eyelashes are beginning to grow. Their eyelids stay closed over their eyes. Your baby already has their own individual fingerprints, as the lines on the skin of their fingers are now formed. Their fingernails and toenails are growing and their hands can grip. At about 22 weeks, your baby becomes covered in a very fine, soft hair called lanugo. We don't know what this hair is for, but it is thought that it may keep the baby at the right temperature. The lanugo disappears before birth or soon after. Between 16 and 22 weeks, you will usually feel your baby move for the first time. If this is your second baby, you may feel it earlier - at about 16-18 weeks. At first, you feel a fluttering or bubbling, or a very slight shifting movement. This can feel a bit like indigestion. Later, you will be able to tell that it is the baby's movements and you may even see the baby kicking about. Sometimes you will see a bump that is clearly a hand or a foot. Weeks 23-30 Your baby is now moving about vigorously, and responds to touch and sound. A very loud noise close by may make them jump and kick. They are also swallowing small amounts of the amniotic fluid in which they are floating, and are passing tiny amounts of urine 6 months 7 months 8 monthsWeek 14 The actual size from head to bottom is about 85mm Week 22The actual size from head to bottom is about 27cm back into the fluid. Sometimes your baby may get hiccups, and you can feel the jerk of each hiccup. Your baby may also begin to follow a pattern for waking and sleeping. Very often this is a different pattern from yours. So when you go to bed at night, your baby may wake up and start kicking. Your baby's heartbeat can be heard through a stethoscope. Later, your partner may be able to hear the heartbeat by putting their ear to your abdomen, but it can be difficult to find the right place. Your baby is now covered in a white, greasy substance called vernix. It is thought that this may be to protect its skin as it floats in the amniotic fluid. The vernix mostly disappears before the birth. From 24 weeks, your baby has a chance of survival if it is born. Most babies born before this time cannot live because their lungs and other vital organs are not developed well enough. The care that can now be given in neonatal units means that more and more babies born this early do survive. Babies born at around this time have increased risks of disability. At around 26 weeks your baby's eyelids open for the first time. A babies' eyes are almost always blue or dark blue, although some babies do have brown eyes at birth. It is not until some weeks after they are born that your baby's eyes will become the colour that they will stay. The head-to-bottom length at 30 weeks is about 33cm. Weeks 31-40 Your baby continues to grow. Their skin, which was quite wrinkled before, becomes smoother, and both the vernix and the lanugo begin to disappear. By about 32 weeks, the baby is usually lying with its head pointing downwards, ready for birth. The baby's head can 'engage', or move down into the pelvis, before birth. Sometimes the head doesn't engage until labour has started.3 How your baby develops and grows 27Week 30 The actual size from head to bottom is about 33cm 9 months 284Getting to know your baby Baby brain development During the last three months of pregnancy and the first two years of life your baby's brain is developing at a rapid rate. Responding to your baby's needs can support emotional and mental development. Developing a close and loving relationship with your baby will lay the building blocks for growing into a secure and confident child and adult. Saying 'hello' to your baby can start today Pregnancy is a special time and you are probably already starting to connect with your baby. This will help you form a strong and loving bond with your baby after birth. You can start to build your relationship by taking time out every day to relax, stroke your bump, talk or sing to your growing baby and respond to your baby's movements.Scans and research show that even in the womb, babies yawn, suck their thumbs and respond to familiar voices and music, perhaps even the theme tune to your favourite TV soap! Many dads like to get involved at this stage too. Have you thought about who your baby might look like? Looking after yourself It is not uncommon to feel a bit anxious or depressed during pregnancy. If you are feeling stressed, try to take some time out for you - have a nice relaxing bath or go for a gentle walk. If you are feeling overwhelmed, talk to your GP or midwife. Your relationship with your partner may also be under pressure at this time. If you think you or your partner need further support, you can talk to your midwife in complete confidence.Myth Babies must get into a routine as this makes your life easier. Reality Young babies are not capable of learning a routine. Responding to their cues for feeding and comfort makes babies feel secure, so they cry less, which makes your life easier too. You are about to become a mum, again or maybe for the first time. This is a time of great change, on the outside and inside! This chapter will help you understand what your baby needs to feel safe and secure and will help you get off to a good start with caring for your baby. It will also explain where to get help if you need it.4 Getting to know your baby 29Giving a warm welcome after birth Skin-to-skin contact Even if you have a caesarean section or a difficult delivery, try to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby as soon as possible after the birth. This will: keep your baby warm and calm; help regulate breathing and heartbeat; release mothering hormones to help with b onding. Try the following: place your baby on your tummy with their head near your breast; gently stroke and caress your baby; allow the baby to focus on your face; ask to be left undisturbed to get to know your baby .What your newborn baby can do Babies are born knowing how to suck. During the first few days they learn to coordinate their sucking and their breathing. Newborn babies will automatically turn towards a nipple or teat if it is brushed against their cheek, and they will open their mouths if their upper lip is stroked. They can also grasp things (like your finger) with either their hands or feet, and they will make stepping movements if they are held upright on a flat surface. Apart from sucking, these automatic responses will go, and your baby will begin to make controlled movements instead. Newborn babies can use all of their senses. They will look at people and things, especially if they are near, and particularly at people's faces. They will enjoy gentle touch and the sound of a soothing voice, and they will react to bright light and noise. Having conversations with your baby from day one Communicating Babies can recognise their mother's voice from birth. From the moment your baby is born, they will want to communicate Myth Babies become spoilt and demanding if they are given too much attention. Reality Babies will be calmer and grow up to be more confident if their needs for love and comfort are met. 30 with you through eye contact, facial expressions and body movements. It is good to try to understand how your baby might be feeling. Your baby will enjoy being talked and sung to and being held, touched and comforted. Your baby needs you to be interested in how they feel as well as their physical needs such as feeding and changing. Young babies are unable to cope with delays in having their needs met. Learn to understand your baby's needs and comfort your crying baby as soon as possible. Keeping your baby close It is good for both you and your baby to stay close together, including sleeping in the same room (the hospital may call this 'rooming-in'). This helps your baby feel safe and secure and allows you to be more confident about caring for them. It is also reassuring to have your baby close by and means that feeding is established more quickly, especially if breastfeeding. You can also keep the close relationship going by placing your baby's cot or moses basket beside your bed at night and using a soft baby carrier (sling) during the day. When choosing a pram or buggy, go for one that faces towards you as this allows your baby to see your face, and you will be able to respond and talk to your baby, which helps her feel safe and secure. Responsiveness During the first few months almost all of your time will be taken up with getting to know your baby and responding to their needs. Caring for babies in a responsive way helps build a strong and loving bond. This involves keeping your baby close, cuddling and stroking them, talking to them in a soothing voice, learning about their signs when they want to be fed or comforted, and comforting them as soon as possible when they cry.Trust your instincts - responding quickly to your baby's cries will not 'spoil' them, but make them feel safe and loved and help them grow up to be confident and happy. Security comes from not having to wait too long to be comforted. Dads Dads should also spend time holding and being close to the baby. They may feel a little left out, especially if they have to leave you and the baby in hospital and return to an empty home. They may need support and encouragement to get involved. The more you can both hold and cuddle your baby, the more confident you will all feel. Myth Babies need lots of toys to help them learn. Reality The best way for your baby to learn is by looking at your face. Talking, listening and smiling triggers hormones that help your baby's brain to grow.5 Your health in pregnancy 315Your health in pregnancy More information For useful information on what you should eat when you are pregnant or trying for a baby, go to pha.site/healthy-pregnancy-diet A healthy diet and lifestyle can help you to keep well during pregnancy and give your baby the best possible start in life. This chapter explains some of the things you can do to stay healthy. What should you eat? A healthy diet is very important if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. You don't need to go on a special diet, but make sure that you eat a variety of different foods every day in order to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need. You should also avoid certain foods - see Foods to avoid on page 34. You will probably find that you are more hungry than normal, but you don't need to 'eat for two' - even if you are expecting twins or triplets. Have breakfast every day - this will help you to avoid snacking on foods that are high in fat and sugar. 32 The Eatwell Guide The guide below shows how much of each type of food you need to have for a healthy and well-balanced diet. Fruit and vegetables As well as vitamins and minerals, fruit and vegetables provide fibre, which helps digestion and prevents constipation. Eat at least five portions of fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced fruit and vegetables each day. Always wash them carefully. To get the most out of vegetables, don't over cook them. For more information and portion sizes, visit pha.site/5-a-day Dried should only be eaten at mealtimes to reduce the risk of tooth decay. **Juices should be limited to once a day at a mealtime, as crushing releases sugars which can damage teeth.Potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy carbohydrates Carbohydrates are satisfying without containing too many calories, and are an important source of vitamins and fibre. They include bread, potatoes, breakfast cereals, pasta, rice, oats, noodles, maize, millet, yams, cornmeal and sweet potatoes. These foods should be the main part of every meal. Eat wholegrain varieties when you can as these add extra fibre to our diet. Foods high in fat, salt and sugars This includes products such as chocolate, cakes, biscuits, full-sugar soft drinks, butter and ice-cream. These foods are not needed in the diet and so, if included, should only be done infrequently and in small amounts. If you consume these foods and drinks often, try to limit their consumption so you have them less often and in smaller amounts. Food and drinks high in fat and sugar contain lots of energy, particularly when you have large servings. Check the label and avoid foods which are high in fat, salt and sugar! 5 Your health in pregnancy 33Beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins Good sources of protein include beans, pulses, fish, eggs and meat (for information on peanuts see page 34). These foods are also good sources of essential vitamins and minerals. Eat moderate amounts each day. Choose lean meat, remove the skin from poultry and cook using only a little fat. You should try to limit the amount of red meat or processed meat (for example sausages, bacon, cured meats) to no more than 90g per day. Make sure poultry, pork, burgers and sausages are cooked all the way through. Check that there is no pink meat and that juices have no pink or red in them. Try to eat two portions of fish a week, one of which should be oily fish. There are some fish that you should avoid - see Foods to avoid on page 34 for more information. Due to improved food safety controls in recent years you are unlikely to get food poisoning from raw or lightly cooked UK hen eggs from reputable suppliers which have been produced under the British Lion Code of Practice. Oils and spreads This food group includes all unsaturated oils including vegetable oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil sunflower oil and soft spreads made from unsaturated oils. Butters are not included in this section as these are high in saturated fat and should be eaten less often and in small amounts. Although some fat in the diet is essential, generally we are eating too much saturated fat and need to reduce our consumption. Unsaturated fats are healthier fats that are usually from plant sources and in liquid form as oil, for example vegetable oil, rapeseed oil and olive oil. Swapping to unsaturated fats will help to reduce cholesterol in the blood, therefore it is important to get most of our fat from unsaturated oils. Choosing lower fat spreads, as opposed to butter, is a good way to reduce your saturated fat intake. Remember that all types of fat are high in energy and should be limited in the diet. Dairy and alternatives Milk and dairy foods (or dairy alternatives) like cheese, fromage frais, soya drinks and yogurts (choose unsweetened calcium fortified milk alternatives) are important because they contain protein, calcium and other nutrients that your baby needs. Eat two or three portions a day, using low-fat varieties whenever you can - for example, semi-skimmed or skimmed milk, low-fat yogurt and half-fat hard cheese. However, there are some cheeses that you should avoid - see Foods to avoid on page 34 for more information. Hydration Aim to drink 6-8 glasses of fluid every day. Water, lower fat milk and sugar-free drinks including tea and coffee all count. Fruit juice and smoothies also count towards your fluid consumption, although they are a source of free sugars* and so you should limit consumption to no more than a combined total of 150ml per day. Sugary drinks are one of the main contributors to excess sugar consumption in the UK. Swap sugary soft drinks for diet, sugar-free or no added sugar varieties to reduce your sugar intake in a simple step. * free sugars are sugars added to foods by the manufacturer/cook or consumer or sugars naturally present in honey, syrups or fruit drinks.34Foods to avoid There are some foods that you should not eat when you are pregnant because they may make you ill or harm your baby. You should avoid: Some types of c heese. Don't eat mould-ripened soft cheese, like Brie, Camembert and others with a similar rind. You should also avoid soft blue-veined cheese, like Danish blue. These are made with mould and they can contain listeria, a type of bacteria that can harm your unborn baby. Although listeriosis is a very rare infection, it is important to take special precautions during pregnancy because even the mild form of the illness in the mother can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or severe illness in a newborn baby. You can eat hard cheeses such as cheddar and parmesan, and processed cheeses made from pasteurised milk such as cottage cheese, mozzarella and cheese spreads. Raw or under cooked meat. Cook all meat and poultry thoroughly so that there is no trace of pink or blood. Take particular care with sausages and minced meat. It is fine to eat steaks and other whole cuts of beef and lamb rare, as long as the outside has been properly cooked or sealed. Liver pr oducts. Don't eat liver, or liver products like liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 or liver sausage, as they may contain a lot of vitamin A. Too much vitamin A can harm your baby. P\u00e2t\u00e9. Avoid all types of p\u00e2t\u00e9, including vegetable p\u00e2t\u00e9s, as they can contain listeria and also be a source of vitamin A. Supplements cont aining vitamin A. Don't take high-dose multivitamin supplements, fish liver oil supplements or any supplements containing vitamin A. Some types of fish . Don't eat shark, marlin and swordfish, and limit the amount of tuna you eat to no more than two tuna steaks a week (about 140g cooked or 170g raw each) or four medium-sized cans of tuna a week (about 140g when drained). These types of fish contain high levels of mercury, which can damage your baby's developing nervous system. Don't eat more than two portions of oily fish per week. Oily fish includes salmon, mackerel, sardines and trout. Fresh tuna was classified as an oily fish until recently. Recent studies have shown the fish oil content of fresh tuna is similar to that of white fish. Raw shellfish . Eat cooked rather than raw shellfish as they can contain harmful bacteria and viruses that can cause food poisoning. P eanuts. If you would like to eat peanuts or foods containing peanuts (such as peanut butter) during pregnancy, you can choose to do so as part of a healthy balanced diet, unless you are allergic to them or your health professional advises you not to. This is different from previous advice on the consumption of peanuts during pregnancy. Preparing food W ash fruit, vegetables and salads to remove all traces of soil, which may contain toxoplasma. This can cause toxoplasmosis, which can harm your baby (see page 50). Heat r eady-meals until they are piping hot all the way through. This is especially important for meals containing poultry. K eep leftovers covered in the fridge and use within two days. W ash all surfaces and utensils, and your hands, after preparing raw meat. This will help to avoid infection with toxoplasma.5 Your health in pregnancy 35Your weight It is recommended that if you are thinking of having a baby, your BMI* should be between 20 and 25 (a healthy weight). If you are overweight, ie BMI of over 25 you should aim to lose weight before becoming pregnant. Being obese (having a BMI greater than 30) during pregnancy can put you at increased risk of pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes and thromboembolism. Therefore if you are planning a pregnancy speak to a health professional about achieving a healthy weight. It can be dangerous for your baby too, causing premature birth, birth defects, miscarriage and stillbirth.If your BMI* is over 38 you will receive extra support throughout your pregnancy as part of the weigh to a healthy pregnancy programme to help ensure the best outcome for you and your baby. *BMI is a calculation that health professionals use to work out whether a person is a healthy weight. It is calculated by weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Use an online calculator which can be found at pha.site/bmi-calculator Unpasteurised milk . Drink only pasteurised or UHT milk which has been pasteurised. If only raw milk is available, b oil it first. Don't drink unpasteurised goats' or sheep's milk or eat certain food that is made out of them, suc h as soft goats' cheese. Vitamins and minerals Eating a healthy, varied diet will help you to get the vitamins and minerals you need while you are pregnant. However some vitamins and minerals that are especially important include: F olic acid. Folic acid is important as it can reduce the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida in your unborn child. If you are thinking about getting pregnant, you should take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day until you are 12 weeks pregnant. If you did not take folic acid before you conceived, you should start as soon as you find out that you are pregnant. You should also eat foods that contain folic acid, such as green leafy vegetables, fortified breakfast cereals and brown rice. Some breakfast cereals, breads and margarines have folic acid added to them. If you already have a baby with spina bifida, or ifyou have coeliac disease, diabetes, are obese or take anti-epileptic medicines, ask your GP or midwife for more advice. You will need to take a bigger dose of folic acid that requires a prescription. See the PHA leaflet Folic Acid at www.publichealth.hscni.net Iodine supplements There is no current recommendation in the UK to take iodine supplements during pregnancy, and you should be able to get all the iodine you need by eating a varied diet. If you do choose to take iodine supplements, do not take more than 0.5 milligrams a day, as this could be harmful.36 V itamin D. All pregnant women should take 10 microgram supplement of vitamin D during autumn and winter months as sunlight is not strong enough to make vitamin D during this time (October to the end of March). You need vitamin D to keep your bones healthy and to provide your baby with enough vitamin D for the first few months of their life. Vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, and these are needed to help keep bones and teeth healthy. The best source of vitamin D is summer sunlight. The amount of time you need in the sun to make enough vitamin D is different for every person and depends on things like skin type, time of day and time of the year but you don't need to sunbathe: the amount of sun you need to make enough vitamin D is less than the amount that causes tanning or burning. Deficiency of vitamin D can cause children's bones to soften and can lead to rickets. Only a few foods contain vitamin D, including oily fish like sardines, fortified margarines, some breakfast cereals and eggs. Breastfed babies from birth to one year of age, should be given a daily supplement of vitamin D throughout the year to make sure they get enough, as their bones are growing and developing very rapidly in these early years. Babies fed infant formula will only need a vitamin D supplement if they are receiving less than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day, because infant formula has vitamin D added during processing. Children aged 1 to 4 years require a daily supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D throughout the year. Everyone aged five and over should consider taking a supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D every day. Between late March/April to the end of September the majority of people aged five years and above will probably obtain sufficient vitamin D from sunlight when they are outdoors. So you might choose not to take a vitamin D supplement during these months. If you have dark skin or always cover your skin, you may be at particular risk of vitamin D deficiency. Talk to your midwife or doctor if you are worried about this. (See also Vitamin supplements on page 131 and the PHA leaflet Vitamin D and you at www.publichealth.hscni.net ) Ir on. If you are low in iron, you will probably get very tired and you can become anaemic. Lean meat, green, leafy vegetables, dried fruit and nuts all contain iron. Many breakfast cereals have iron added. If the iron level in your blood becomes low, your 5 Your health in pregnancy 37GP or midwife will advise you to take iron supplements. These are available as tablets or a liquid. V itamin C. Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron. Citrus fruits, tomatoes, broccoli, peppers, blackcurrants, potatoes and some pure fruit juices are good sources of vitamin C. If your iron levels are low, it may help to drink orange juice with an iron-rich meal. Calcium . Calcium is vital for making your baby's bones and teeth. Dairy products and fish with edible bones like sardines are rich in calcium. Breakfast cereals, dried fruit such as figs and apricots, bread, almonds, tofu (a vegetable protein made from soya beans) and green leafy vegetables like watercress, broccoli and curly kale are other good sources of calcium. Which supplements? You can get supplements from pharmacies and supermarkets or your GP may be able to prescribe them for you. If you want to get your folic acid or vitamin D from a multivitamin tablet, make sure that the tablet does not contain vitamin A (or retinol). Healthy Start vitamins for women contain the correct amount of folic acid and vitamins C and D and are f ree from the HSC without a prescription to pregnant women receiving Healthy Start vouchers. (see 'Healthy Start' on this page). Healthy Start Healthy Start is a scheme that provides vouchers that can be exchanged for milk, plain fresh or frozen fruit and vegetables and infant formula milk. You can also receive Healthy Start vitamins. You qualify for Healthy Start if you are pregnant or have a child under four years old, and you or your family receive certain benefits. For further information: ask your health visitor for mor e information or visit www .healthystart.nhs.uk. Vegetarian, vegan and special diets A varied and balanced vegetarian diet should give enough nutrients for you and your baby during pregnancy. However, you might find it hard to get enough iron and vitamin B12. Talk to your doctor or midwife about how you can make sure that you are getting enough of these important nutrients.38You should also talk to your doctor or midwife if you have a special dietary requirement (such as coeliac disease) or for religious reasons. Ask to be referred to a dietitian who can give you advice on how to get the nutrients you need for you and your baby. More information For further information, visit: pha.site/vegetarian-diet pha.site/vegan-diet Healthy snac ks You may find that you get hungry between meals. Avoid snacks that are high in fat and/or sugar. Instead you could try: F resh fruit. Sandwic hes or pitta bread filled with grated cheese, lean ham, mashed tuna, salmon or sardines and salad. Salad vegetables. L ow-fat yogurt or fromage Hummus and or prunes. V egetable and bean soups. Unsweetened breakfast cereals or porridge and milk. Milky drinks. Baked beans on toast or a baked potato. Caffeine High levels of caff eine can result in babies having a low birth weight, which can increase the risk of health problems in later life. Too much can also cause miscarriage. Caffeine is naturally found in lots of foods, such as coffee, tea and chocolate, and is added to some soft drinks and energy drinks. It can also be found in certain cold and flu remedies. Talk to your midwife, pharmacist or another health professional before taking these remedies. You don't need to cut caffeine out completely, but you should limit how much you have to no more than 200mg a day. Try decaffeinated tea and coffee, fruit juice or water and limit the amount of 'energy' drinks, which may be high in caffeine. Don't worry if you occasionally have more than this, because the risks are quite small.

The safest approach in pregnancy is to choose not to drink at all. The risk of damage to your baby's physical and mental development increases the more you drink which is why binge drinking is especially harmful. This risk relates to a range of conditions including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The Chief Medical Officers' guideline is that: If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum. Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to your baby, with the more you drink the greater the risk.Therefore, it is important to be aware that: Drinking heavily or 'binge' drinking (over 6 units in one session) in early pregnancy can be harmful to your baby and there is an increased risk of early miscarriage. S ome women may be unaware of their pregnancy for several weeks or months. If there is any chance you may be pregnant, avoid drinking alcohol until you are sure you are not pregnant. P regnant mums should always consult with a health professional if they have any concerns about their alcohol intake. How does alcohol affect the unborn baby? Alcohol is a toxic substance. It takes a woman's liver 1\u00bd hours (approx.) to break down 1 unit of alcohol.However, in pregnancy, the alcohol passes from the mum's bloodstream through the placenta and into the baby's blood stream. The placenta is not a filter. The unborn baby does not have a developed liver to process alcohol. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can affect: T he way the baby develops in the womb. T he baby's health at birth and increases the risks of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). T he baby's long-term physical and mental health. T he child's ability to learn (learning difficulties).40What does FAS/FASD mean? Most women are aware of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Children born with FAS can have growth problems, facial defects, and lifelong learning and behaviour problems. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) describes the range of less obvious effects ('sleeping symptoms') that can be mild to severe and relate to one or more of the following range of symptoms of FASD: L ow birth size. P roblems eating and sleeping. P roblems seeing and hearing. T rouble following directions and learning to do simple things. T rouble paying attention and learning in school. T rouble getting along with others and controlling their behaviour.Children born with FASD may need medical care all their lives, and/or may need special educational support. Remember that FAS and FASD are 100% preventable by not drinking alcohol during your pregnancy.Getting help with drinking If you have difficulty cutting down what you drink, talk to your doctor, midwife, pharmacist or other healthcare professional. Confidential help and support is available from local counselling services. Visit www.drugsandalcoholni.info for more information.

Cigarettes restrict the essential oxygen supply to your baby. So their tiny heart has to beat harder every time you smoke. Cigarettes contain over 4,000 chemicals. Protecting your baby from tobacco smoke is one of the best things you can do to give your child a healthy start in life. You will be offered carbon monoxide testing at your booking appointment to assess the level of carbon monoxide to assist with the decision to quit smoking. It's never too late to stop. Getting help with stopping smoking Support and advice on stopping smoking is available at www.stopsmokingni.info You can also ask your midwife, health visitor, practice nurse or pharmacist for advice and for the details of your local stop smoking service. These free stop smoking services offer one-to-one or group sessions, provide nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and are run by specially trained staff who can advise you on the best way to manage your cravings and become smoke free. They can offer advice about dealing with stress, weight gain and provide information on stop smoking medications such as NRT, Champix and Zyban, to help you manage your cravings. If you smoke, get advice about stopping. You are up to four times more likely to stop smoking successfully with support and stop smoking medication. If you stop smoking now Stopping smoking will benefit both you and your baby immediately. Carbon monoxide and chemicals will clear from the body and oxygen levels will return to normal. If you stop smoking: Y ou will have fewer complications in pregnancy. Y ou are more likely to have a healthier pregnancy and a healthier baby. Y ou will reduce the risk of stillbirth. Y our baby will cope better with any birth complications. Y our baby is less likely to be born too early and have to face the additional breathing, feeding and health problems which often go with being premature (see chapter 15). Y our baby is less likely to be born underweight and have a problem keeping warm. Babies of mothers who smoke are, on average, 200g (about 8oz) lighter than other babies. These babies may have problems during and after labour and are more prone to infection. Y ou will reduce the risk of sudden infant death, also known as 'cot death'. See page 152 for more information about how to reduce the risk of sudden infant death. The sooner you stop, the better. But stopping even in the last few weeks of pregnancy will benefit you and your baby. Secondhand smoke If your partner or anyone else who lives with you smokes, it can affect you and your baby both before and after birth. You may also find it more difficult to quit. Secondhand smoke can cause low birth weight and sudden infant death. 42Infants of parents who smoke are more likely to be admitted to hospital for bronchitis and pneumonia during the first year of life, and more than 17 ,000 children under the age of five are admitted to hospital every year because of the effects of secondhand smoke.Advice on e-cigarettes E-cigarettes are designed to look and feel like cigarettes. Devices currently on the market do not meet appropriate standards of safety and quality. The level of risk associated with their use is not known. The Public Health Agency recommends if you wish to stop smoking and are ready to do so you should use one of the free stop smoking services available across Northern Ireland, for information on these services visit www.stopsmokingni.info Find out more on e-cigarettes at www.publichealth.hscni.net Stopping smoking action plan 1 Think T hink about: W hat you and your baby will gain if you stop smoking (see above).

It can help to: Give up with someb ody else, so that you can support each other. Change the habits you associate with smoking. Plan how you will deal with difficult situations without the use of cigarettes. Choose a day to stop. W ill the first few days be easier during a working week or over a weekend? When you are busy or relaxed? Whatever you choose, stop completely on that day. Review your plan and get rid of all of your cigarettes the day before your day for stopping. 4 Stop smoking Lots of people start smoking again because they feel they cannot cope with the withdrawal symptoms. The first few days may not be much fun but the symptoms are a sign that your body is starting to recover. Take one day at a time and reward yourself for success. Go through your list of reasons for going smokefree to remind yourself why you have given up. If you have had a scan, use your scan images to keep you going through the times when you are finding it tough.5 Your health in pregnancy 43Pills, medicines and other drugs Some medicines, including some common painkillers, can harm your baby's health, for example medication to treat long-term conditions such as asthma, thyroid disease, diabetes and epilepsy. To be on the safe side, you should: K eep taking your medication until you check with your doctor. Always c heck with your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before taking any medicine. Make sure that your doctor , dentist or other health professional knows you are pregnant before they prescribe you anything or give you treatment. T alk to your doctor if you take regular medication - ideally before you start trying for a baby or as soon as you find out you are pregnant. Use as f ew over the counter medicines as possible. Medicines and treatments that are usually safe include paracetamol, most antibiotics, dental treatments (including local anaesthetics), some immunisations (including tetanus, pertussis and flu Make sure the medicine is safe to take when pregnant.

Illegal drugs Illegal drugs like cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine and heroin can harm your baby. If you use any illegal drugs, it is important to talk to your doctor or midwife so that they can provide you with advice and support to help you stop. They can also refer you for additional support. Some dependent drug users initially need drug treatment to stabilise or come off drugs to keep the baby safe. For more information visit www.drugsandalcoholni.info Herbal and homeopathic remedies and aromatherapy Not all 'natural' remedies are safe in pregnancy. Tell your practitioner that you are pregnant, and tell your midwife or doctor and pharmacist which remedies you are using. X-rays X-rays should be avoided in pregnancy if possible. Make sure that your dentist knows you are pregnant. Keeping active The more active and fit you are during pregnancy, the easier it will be for you to adapt to your changing shape and weight gain. It will also help you to cope with labour and to get back into shape after the birth. Keep up your normal daily physical activity or exercise (sport, dancing or just walking to the shops and back) for as long as you feel comfortable. Don't exhaust yourself, and remember that you may need to slow down as your pregnancy progresses or if your doctor advises you to. As a general rule, you should be able to hold a conversation as you exercise. If you become breathless as you talk, then you are probably exercising too strenuously. 150 minutes of moderate physical activity spread throughout the week is recommended in pregnancy. If you were inactive before you were pregnant, don't suddenly take up strenuous exercise. Begin exercising gradually with 10 minute bouts of moderate intensity continuous exercise building up to a total of 150 minutes across the week. Exercise tips Exercise doesn't have to be strenuous to be beneficial. Make sure that you warm up and cool down. Try to keep active on a daily basis. Half an hour of walking each day can be enough. If you cannot manage that, any amount is better than nothing. A void any strenuous exercise in hot weather. Drink plenty of water and other fluids. If you go to e xercise classes, make sure that your teacher is properly qualified and knows that you are pregnant and how far your pregnancy has progressed. Y ou might like to try swimming, because the water will support your increased weight. Some local swimming pools provide aquanatal classes with qualified instructors. 5 Your health in pregnancy 45Exercises to avoid L ying flat on your back - particularly after 16 weeks. The 'bump' presses on the big blood vessels and can make you feel faint. Contact sports where there is a risk of being hit, suc h as kickboxing, judo or squash. Horse riding, downhill skiing, ice hoc key, gymnastics and cycling, because there is a risk of falling. Scuba diving, because the baby has no protection against decompression sic kness and gas embolism. Exercising at heights over 2,500 metres until you have acclimatised. T his is because you and your baby are at risk of acute mountain sickness (decrease in oxygen). Exercises for a fitter pregnancy Try to fit these exercises into your daily routine. They will strengthen your muscles so that you can carry extra weight, make your joints stronger, improve your circulation, ease backache and generally make you feel well. Stomach-strengthening exercises These strengthen your stomach (abdominal) muscles and ease backache, which can be a problem in pregnancy. As your baby gets bigger you may find that the hollow in your lower back becomes more pronounced, which can lead to backache. Start in a b ox position (on all fours), with your knees under your hips, your hands under your shoulders, your fingers facing forward and your stomach muscles lifted so that your back is straight. Pull in your stomach muscles and raise your back up towards the ceiling, curling your trunk and allowing your head to relax gently forward. Don't let your elbows lock. Hold for a f ew seconds then slowly return to the box position. T ake care not to hollow your back - it should always return to a straight or neutral position. Do this slowly and rhythmically 10 times, making your muscles work hard and moving your bac k carefully. Only move your back as far as you can comfortably. Pelvic tilt exercises Stand with your shoulders and bottom against a wall. Keep your knees soft. Pull your belly button towards your spine, so that your back flattens against the wall. Hold for four seconds and release. Repeat up to 10 times. Pelvic floor exercises Pelvic floor exercises help to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor, which are placed under great strain in pregnancy and childbirth. The pelvic floor consists of layers of muscles which stretch like a supportive hammock from the pubic bone (in front) to the base of the backbone. During pregnancy you may find that you leak urine when you cough or strain. This is known as stress incontinence of urine and it can continue after pregnancy. By performing pelvic floor exercises, you strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and this helps to reduce or avoid this problem after pregnancy. It is important to do them even if you are young and not suffering 46from stress incontinence now. Close up your bac k passage as if trying to prevent a bowel movement. A t the same time, draw in your vagina as if you are gripping a tampon, and your urethra as if to stop the flow of urine. First do this e xercise quickly - tightening and releasing the muscles straight away. T hen do it slowly, holding the contractions for as long as you can before you relax. Try to count to 10. T ry to do three sets of eight squeezes every day. To help you remember, you could do them once at each meal.As well as these exercises, you will also need to practise tightening up the pelvic floor before and during coughing and sneezing. Ask your midwife or doctor about these exercises. Your local maternity unit should run classes where a specialist physiotherapist attends. They can instruct you in groups or individually. Feel free to ask them for advice and help. Foot exercises Foot exercises can be done sitting or standing. They improve blood circulation, reduce swelling in the ankles and prevent cramp in the calf muscles. Bend and stretc h your foot vigorously up and down 30 times. Rotate your foot eight times one way and eight times the other way . Repeat with the other foot. T o protect your back Sit up straight with your b ottom against the back of your chair. Tuck a small cushion behind your waist if you wish. W hen you pick something up, bend your knees, not your back. T ry to stand tall. Infections Influenza While flu is a mild illness for most people, it can be very serious for pregnant women. Pregnant women are more likely to develop serious complications as a result of flu, and rarely even death, compared to women who are not pregnant. There are also risks for the baby, including 5 Your health in pregnancy 47 miscarriage and premature labour. Receiving the flu vaccine during pregnancy is the best way to protect you and your unborn baby from getting serious complications of flu, including death. The flu vaccine is licensed for use by the European Medicines Agency. It is regularly used for pregnant women across the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries. Millions of pregnant women have received the flu vaccine and the safety of the vaccine has been carefully monitored. This has shown that it is extremely safe to give in pregnancy, both for the mother and the unborn baby. The flu vaccine becomes available every year from late September onwards, at the start of the winter flu season. If you are pregnant during flu season you will be offered the flu vaccine by your GP or midwife. You can have the vaccine at any stage in pregnancy. You should get it as early in the season as possible in order to receive the best protection for you and your baby. If you become pregnant later in the winter you should get the vaccine as soon as you know you are pregnant. Even if you received the flu vaccine in the past, you still need to get the vaccine as flu protection only lasts for one flu season.Pregnant women can suffer the same minor side effects as anyone else, including soreness where the vaccine was injected and, less often, a slight temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days after being vaccinated. Other reactions are very rare. Flu vaccine does not contain live virus and so it cannot give you flu. It will only protect you against flu. There are many other viruses around every winter which cause flu-like symptoms, but these are not usually as serious as flu. For more information about the flu vaccine talk to your GP, practice nurse, district nurse or pharmacist.Whooping cough Whooping cough (pertussis) is an infection which can affect people of all ages but is particularly serious for babies. Most babies who get it will have to be admitted to hospital, some will end up in intensive care and it can even result in death. Very young babies (under three months) are at most risk of serious disease. All babies are vaccinated against whooping cough at two, three and four months of age. This means they can be vulnerable to the infection in the first two to three months of life before they get their vaccines. The best way to protect babies during this time is to give the mother the vaccine during pregnancy, at any stage after 16 weeks. She will make antibodies that are passed onto the unborn baby, which then protect the baby after it is born until he or she gets their own vaccines. The vaccine needs to be repeated during each pregnancy. All pregnant women are offered the whooping cough vaccine between 16 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. This is the recommended time to receive it so that the unborn baby receives the highest level of protection. Recent studies have shown that when the vaccine is given to pregnant women at this time, over 90% of newborn 48babies do not get whooping cough. Studies also show that giving the vaccine to pregnant women is very safe for both the woman and unborn baby. For more information about the whooping cough vaccine talk to your GP, practice nurse, district nurse or pharmacist. Rubella Rubella (or German measles) generally causes a mild illness with a range of symptoms including slight temperature, coughing, sneezing, rash, swollen glands or sore throat. If you catch rubella in the first four months of pregnancy it can seriously affect your baby's sight and hearing and may cause brain and heart defects. If you are more than four months pregnant, it is unlikely that rubella will affect your baby. Rubella infection can be prevented by measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. All children are offered two MMR vaccines, at 13 months and three years. Most women in Northern Ireland are therefore protected against rubella, either from having had the infection previously or having received MMR vaccine as a child. If you are protected against rubella you cannot pass it on to your unborn baby. As part of your antenatal care you will be offered a number of blood tests (see page 61), one of which will check if you are immune (protected) for rubella. If you are not immune you will be offered two MMR vaccines after your baby is born as it is not recommended in pregnancy. If you are not immune and you come into contact with someone who has rubella or if you develop a rash you should tell your midwife or GP at once. A blood test will then be carried out to show if you have been infected. Sexually transmitted infections Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are on the increase. The most common is chlamydia. Up to 70% of women and 50% of men who have an STI show no symptoms, so you may not know if you have one. However, many STIs can affect your baby's health during pregnancy and after birth. If you have any reason to believe that you or your partner has an STI, you should go for a check-up as soon as you can. You can ask your GP or midwife, or go to a genitourinary medicine (GUM) or sexual health clinic. You will be guaranteed strict confidentiality. You can find your nearest GUM clinic or sexual health clinic online or at www.sexualhealthni.info If you are under 19, you can visit Common Youth to get free, confidential advice. To find your nearest centre, visit www.commonyouth.com or emailhello@commonyouth.com HIV and AIDS You will be offered a confidential HIV test as part of your routine antenatal care. You can get infected with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C if you: have se x with someone who is infected without using a condom; use injectable drugs and share equipment with an inf ected person. You may have already been infected with hepatitis B if you were born or spent your childhood outside the UK in a country where hepatitis B is common. (You may have acquired the infection at birth.) You may have been infected with hepatitis C if you: received a blood transfusion in the U K prior to September 1991, or blood products prior to 1986; received medical or dental treatment in countries where hepatitis C is common and the inf ection is not controlled properly.5 Your health in pregnancy 49Your doctor or midwife will discuss the test with you and counselling will be available if the result is positive. You can also go to a GUM clinic for an HIV test and advice. Current evidence suggests that an HIV positive mother, in good health and without symptoms of the infection, is unlikely to be adversely affected by pregnancy. HIV positive mothers can pass on the virus through breastmilk. However, it is possible to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to your baby during pregnancy and after birth (see box on page 62). If you are HIV positive, talk to your doctor about your own health and the options open to you. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is an infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. The infection mainly affects the liver, but is present in blood and body fluids. Many people with hepatitis B infection have no symptoms and do not know they are infected. Most adults infected with hepatitis B fully recover, but in some cases the virus remains in the blood. If this happens, the people affected will develop lifelong hepatitis B infection and they can pass the infection on to others, most commonly from an infected mother to her baby. The virus can only be identified by a blood test.You will be offered a blood test for hepatitis B as part of your antenatal care. If the blood test shows that you have the infection, you will be referred for specialist assessment and follow-up. Even if you know you have hepatitis B and already attend a specialist, it is still important that you are seen again as early as possible during your pregnancy. Your baby will also be offered a course of hepatitis B vaccine in the first year of life and be referred for specialist assessment and follow-up. Hepatitis B vaccine is 90-95% effective in preventing babies from getting hepatitis B and developing lifelong infection. The first vaccine is given within 24 hours of birth, followed by at one month and 12 months of age, as well as in the routine vaccinations at two, three and four months of age. A small number of babies may also need an injection of hepatitis B antibodies at birth, at the same time as the first vaccine. Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. Many people with hepatitis C may have no symptoms and be unaware that they are infected. If you have hepatitis C, you might pass the infection to your baby, although the risk is much lower than with hepatitis B or HIV. This cannot be prevented at present. Your baby can be tested for hepatitis C. If they are infected, they can be referred for specialist assessment.50Herpes Genital herpes infection can be caught through genital contact with an infected person or from oral sex with someone who has oral herpes (cold sores) and can be dangerous for a newborn baby. Initial infection causes very painful blisters or ulcers on the genitals. Less severe attacks usually occur for some years afterwards. If you or your partner are infected, use condoms or avoid sex during an attack. Avoid oral sex if either of you have cold sores or active genital herpes. Tell your doctor or midwife if either you or your partner have recurring herpes or develop the symptoms described above. If your first infection occurs in pregnancy, there is treatment available. If your first infection occurs towards the end of your pregnancy or during labour, a caesarean section may be recommended to reduce the risk of transmission to your baby. Chickenpox Chickenpox (varicella) causes a blistering, itchy rash and mild temperature in most people, although it can be more serious in pregnant women and may adversely affect your baby. Around 95% of women are immune to chickenpox from having had the infection as a child, although this may be lower in women who were born outside the UK and Ireland. Most women are therefore not at risk of catching chickenpox and passing it on to their unborn baby. If you have never had chickenpox or received a varicella-containing vaccine, you may not be immune. If you develop a rash or come into contact with someone who has chickenpox or shingles, you should speak to your GP, midwife or obstetrician at once. A blood test will be carried out to see if you are immune, and you may receive an injection of varicella antibodies.Toxoplasmosis This infection can damage your baby if you catch it during pregnancy, so take precautions. Most women have already had the infection before pregnancy and will be immune. If you feel you may have been at risk, talk to your GP, midwife or obstetrician. If you do catch toxoplasmosis while you are pregnant, you can get treatment (see page 51). Parvovirus B19 (slapped cheek disease) Parvovirus B19 infection is common in children aged 6-10. It causes a temperature and a characteristic red rash on the face, so it is often called 'slapped cheek disease'. 50-70% of women are immune to this infection. However, parvovirus B19 is very infectious 5 Your health in pregnancy 51and can be harmful to your baby. If you come into contact with someone who is infected you should talk to your midwife or doctor, who can check whether you are immune through a blood test. In most cases, the baby is not affected when a pregnant woman is infected with parvovirus. Rash in pregnancy If you develop a rash or illness at any time in pregnancy you should contact your midwife, GP or obstetrician urgently for advice. You may need some investigations. You should avoid antenatal clinics or maternity settings until you have been assessed to avoid coming into contact with other pregnant women. If you have been in contact with someone with a rash, or known infection such as chickenpox, shingles, slapped cheek syndrome or rubella, you should also contact your midwife, GP or obstetrician for advice. Group B streptococcus Group B streptococcus (also called GBS or strep B) is a bacterium carried by up to 30% of people without causing harm or symptoms. In women it is found in the intestine and vagina and causes no problem in most pregnancies. In a very small number it infects the baby, usually just before or during labour, and can lead to serious illness or death. If you have had GBS in a previous pregnancy you will be offered either testing for GBS at 35-37 weeks or antibiotics in labour. Your obstetrician or midwife will assess whether you needto be given antibiotics duringlabour. If you need antibiotics,they will be given through a vein (intravenously). Treatment for GBS In some circumstances antibiotics can reduce the risk of a baby developing GBS. You should be offered antibiotics during labour if: Y ou have previously had a baby with invasive GBS infection. G BS has been found in your urine in your current pregnancy. G BS has been found on swabs from your vagina which have been taken for another reason during this pregnancy. Y ou have a high temperature during labour. Y ou have an infection of the membranes around the baby (Chorioamnionitis). Screening for GBSIn Northern Ireland, as in the rest of the UK, routine testing for GBS in pregnancy is not currently recommended because there is insufficient evidence to support it. This position is kept under regular review. If you are concerned about GBS, discuss it with your doctor or midwife.

Avoid emptying cat litter trays while you are pregnant. If no one else can do it, use disposable rubber gloves. Trays should be cleaned daily and filled with boiling water for five minutes.52Avoid close contact with sick cats and wear gloves when gardening - even if you don't have a cat - in case the soil is contaminated with faeces. Wash your hands and gloves after gardening. If you do come into contact with cat faeces, make sure that you wash your hands thoroughly. SheepLambs and sheep can be a source of an organism called Chlamydia psittaci, which is known to cause miscarriage in ewes. They also carry toxoplasma. Avoid lambing or milking ewes and all contact with newborn lambs. If you experience flu-like symptoms after coming into contact with sheep, tell your doctor. Pigs Research is going on to see if pigs can be a source of hepatitis E infection. This infection is dangerous in pregnant women, so avoid contact with pigs and pig faeces. There is no risk of hepatitis E from eating cooked pork products.Inherited conditions Some diseases or conditions are inherited from one or both parents. These include medium chain acyl dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) cystic fibrosis, haemophilia, muscular dystrophy, sickle cell disorders and thalassaemia. If you, your baby's father or any of your relatives has an inherited condition or if you already have a baby with a disability, talk to your doctor. You may be able to have tests early in pregnancy to check whether your baby is at risk or affected (see page 52).Ask your GP or midwife to refer you to a genetic counsellor (a specialist in inherited diseases) for advice. Ideally, you should do this before you get pregnant or in the early weeks of pregnancy. Work hazards If you work with chemicals, lead or X-rays, or are in a job with a lot of lifting, you may be risking your health and the health of your baby. If you have any worries about this, you should talk to your doctor, midwife, occupational health nurse, union representative or personnel department. If it is a known and recognised risk, it may be illegal for you to continue in your current role, and your employer must offer you suitable alternative work on the same terms and conditions as your original job. If no safe alternative is available, your employer should suspend you 5 Your health in pregnancy 53on full pay (give you paid leave) for as long as necessary to avoid the risk. If your employer fails to pay you during your suspension, you can bring a claim in an employment tribunal (within three months). This will not affect your maternity pay and leave. See also page 187 . Coping at work You might get extremely tired - particularly in the first few and last few weeks of your pregnancy. Try to use your lunch break to eat and rest, not to do the shopping. If travelling in rush hour is exhausting, ask your employer if you can work slightly different hours for a while. Don't rush home and start another job cleaning and cooking. If you have a partner, ask them to take over. If you are on your own, keep housework to a minimum, and go to bed early if you can. Flying and travel Flying is not harmful for you or your baby, but some airlines will not let you fly towards the end of your pregnancy, and you should check conditions with them.Long distance travel (longer than five hours) carries a small risk of thrombosis (blood clots) in pregnant women. If you fly, drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and do the recommended calf exercises. You can buy a pair of support stockings in the pharmacy over the counter, which will reduce leg swelling. Before you travel, think about your destination. Could you get medical help if you needed it? Are any immunisations needed which might be harmful to the pregnancy? Safety on the move Road accidents are among the most common causes of injury in pregnant women. To protect yourself and your baby, always wear your seatbelt with the diagonal strap across your body between your breasts and with the lap belt over your upper thighs. The straps should lie above and below your bump, not over it. Computer screens The most recent research shows no evidence of a risk from visual display units on computer terminals and word processors. 6Antenatal care Information An important part of antenatal care is getting information that will help you to make informed choices about your pregnancy. Your midwife or doctor should give you information in writing or some other form that you can easily use and understand. Your midwife or doctor should provide you with information in an appropriate format if you: have a physical, learning or sensory disability; do not speak or read English. You may have lots of things you want to ask the midwife. It's a good idea to write your questions down, so you don't forget. Tell the receptionist or your midwife if you require an interpreter or information in another language. If you have any questions or worries, talk to your midwife or doctor. Talking is as much a part of antenatal care as tests and examinations. P rivacy - at your first appointment the midwife will ask you some very personal questions about your past history. To ensure your privacy the midwife will ask your partner or anyone else who accompanies you to remain in the waiting room until this part of your interview is completed. They can join you for the rest of your interview if you want them to. You will all have an opportunity to ask questions and discuss any concerns. 54Antenatal care is the care that you receive from healthcare professionals during your pregnancy. You will be offered a series of appointments with a midwife, or if needed with a doctor (an obstetrician). They will check that you and your baby are well, give you useful information about being pregnant and what to expect as well as answering any questions you may have. As soon as you know you are pregnant, you should get in touch with a midwife or your GP (see chapter 2) to organise your antenatal care. It's best to see them as early as possible. Let your midwife know if you have a disability that means you have special requirements for your antenatal appointments or labour. If you don't speak English, let your midwife know and arrangements will be made for an interpreter. If you have a long-term condition such as diabetes or epilepsy you should contact your hospital team as soon as possible.55Antenatal appointments If you are expecting your first child, you are likely to have up to 10 appointments. If you have had a baby before, you should have around seven appointments. In certain circumstances, for example if you have or develop a medical condition, you may have more appointments. Early in your pregnancy your midwife or doctor should give you information about how many appointments you are likely to have and when they will happen. You should have a chance to discuss the schedule with them. The table on page 66 gives a brief guide to what usually happens at each antenatal appointment. Your appointments may take place at your home, in your GP's surgery, hospital or in an alternative venue. You may be asked to go to hospital for your scans. Your antenatal appointments should take place in a setting where you feel able to discuss sensitive information that may affect you (such as domestic violence, sexual abuse, mental illness, recreational drug use or relationship status). If you cannot keep an antenatal appointment, please let the clinic or midwife know and make another appointment.What should happen at the appointments The aim is to check on you and your baby's progress and to provide clear information and explanations about your care. At each appointment you should have the chance to ask questions and discuss any concerns or issues with your midwife or doctor. Each appointment should have a specific purpose. You will need longer appointments early in pregnancy to allow plenty of time for your midwife or doctor to assess you, discuss your care and give you information. Wherever possible, the appointments should include any routine tests. First booking appointments usually take up to two hours so it's best if you do not take other children as they will get restless or bored. Remember to take a large bag for your green maternity hand-held records (MHHR) as it is easily recognisable by others (see page 68). Do not leave it in the car or anywhere other people could read it without permission. Antenatal Care Core PathwayAs part of the implementation of the Northern Ireland Strategy for Maternity Care, an Antenatal Care Core Pathway has been developed which will identify the care all women should receive at their antenatal appointments throughout their pregnancy. This will be incorporated into the MHHR which you will carry throughout your pregnancy. Please discuss with your midwife or doctor if you do not feel that all aspects of this care is being provided. Group-based care and educationThe Getting Ready For Baby programme way of providing antenatal care and education is available in Northern Ireland (if you are having your first baby and have no complications) where you will be able to have your antenatal care and preparation for parenting at the same time in a group session for you and other mothers due at the same time as you. This will help you to build relationships with your midwife and other mothers and ensure you are prepared for the arrival of your new baby. Please ask your midwife for details of this. 6 Antenatal care56Antenatal appointments schedule This is the appointment when you tell your midwife or doctor that you are pregnant. They should give you information about: folic acid and vitamin D supplements, nutrition, diet and food hygiene; lif estyle factors, such as smoking, drinking and recreational drug use; antenatal screening tests; flu and whooping cough vaccines to protect you and your baby .It is important to tell your midwife or doctor if: if you smoke, take drugs or alcohol; you are being treated for a long-term condition suc h as diabetes, high blood pressure, epilepsy or mental health problems; you or anyone in your family has previously had a baby with an abnormality , for example spina bifida; you are a victim of se xual abuse or domestic violence; there were any complications or inf ections in a previous pregnancy or delivery, such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, premature birth, postnatal depression or Group B streptococcus; there is a family history of an inherited disease, for e xample sickle cell, cystic fibrosis or MCADD; you have other c hildren in care. At your first booking appointment you should have a scan to check when your baby is due (in some areas the scan may be slightly after you have your booking visit). You will be asked lots of questions about your medical history, your family history and details of any previous pregnancies you may have had. You will also be asked about your current pregnancy and given lots of information about your pregnancy. This appointment may last for up to two hours. Your midwife or doctor should give you information about: how the baby develops during pregnancy; nutrition and diet; e xercise and your lab our; your options for where to have your baby . Blood tests are normally offered and recommended at your first antenatal visit. These tests look for possible health problems that could affect your health and the health of your baby. Having the tests will help you make decisions about care, both before and after birth, to protect the health of you and your baby. Only one sampling of blood is needed to do all six tests. Before a blood sample is taken, you will be asked if you consent to the tests. You can decline consent to any of them. If a test is declined, it is standard practice to offer it again later in your pregnancy. You will be weighed at the booking appointment, but you probably will not be weighed regularly during your pregnancy. Your height will be measured along with your weight so that your midwife can calculate your BMI (body mass index). Most women put on between 10 and 12.5kg (22-28lbs) in pregnancy, most of it after the 20th week. Much of the extra weight is due to the baby growing, but your body will also be storing fat ready to make breastmilk after the birth. Eating sensibly and taking regular exercise can help. See chapter 5 for what you should eat and for advice about exercise. Your height, weight and BMI are used to produce a personalised growth chart for your baby's development. You will receive a risk assessment for thromboembolism and diabetes. At the end of your booking appointment, you should understand the plan of care for your pregnancy and have your hand-held notes to carry with you at all times. Your booking appointment is an opportunity to tell your midwife or doctor if you are in a vulnerable situation or if you need extra support. This could be because of domestic violence, sexual abuse or female genital mutilation.First contact with your midwife or doctor. Take a fresh urine sample to all your appointments Booking57Ultrasound scan to estimate when your baby is due, check the physical development of your baby and screen for possible abnormalities.8-12 weeks (dating scan) Your midwife or doctor should: review , discuss and record the results of any screening tests; measure your blood pressure and test your urine for protein; consider an iron supplement if you are anaemic; give you information ab out the ultrasound scan you will be offered at 18 to 20 weeks and help with any concerns or questions you have; give you your M HHR if you have not already received it.16 weeks Ultrasound scan to check the physical development of your baby. (Remember, the main purpose of this scan is to check that there are no structural abnormalities.)18-20 weeks (anomaly scan) Your midwife or doctor should: use a tape to measure the size of your uterus; and plot on your individual growth c hart; measure your blood pressure and test your urine or protein; discuss whooping cough and flu vaccines.25 weeks* Whooping cough If you are pregnant you should get vaccinated to protect your babyWhen is the best time to be vaccinated for flu?The flu vaccine becomes available around early October. If you are pregnant you should get vaccinated soon so that you and your baby are protected. If you become pregnant later in the winter you should get the vaccine as soon as you know that you are pregnant. I received a flu vaccine in the past, do I still need this vaccine?Y es. If you received a flu vaccine in the past, you still need to get the flu vaccine. Flu protection only lasts for one flu season, so it is important to get vaccinated every flu season. The vaccine available from this autumn protects against different strains of flu, so even if you were vaccinated as late as March 2018 you still need the new vaccine. How do I get the vaccine? Simply contact your GP surgery and the receptionist will be able to tell you the arrangements for flu vaccination in your practice. Summary The flu vaccine will help protect you and your baby from the effects of flu. Flu can have serious complications for pregnant women and their babies. The vaccine has been shown to be very safe for use in pregnant women. The flu vaccine will not give you the flu.Flu is more serious than you think Get the flu vaccine to protect yourself and your baby 06/18If you wish to discuss any of these questions in more details please speak to a member of staff at the antenatal clinic or your GP.

You may be offered a visit at the hospital for an initial assessment and perhaps for an ultrasound scan or for special tests. Sometimes your midwife may visit you at home. If you are going to have your baby in hospital Antenatal care varies around the country. In some areas, the booking appointment is at the hospital, then all or most of the remaining appointments are with a midwife or GP. However, if there are complications, all appointments will be at the hospital. In other areas, all care is given by a midwife or GP unless there are complications, which mean a referral to the hospital antenatal clinic. Regular checks at every antenatal appointment Your urine and blood pressure will be checked at every antenatal appointment. You can also ask questions or talk about anything that is worrying you. You should be given information about: your plan of birth; how to prepare for lab our and birth; how to tell if you are in active lab our; induction of lab our if your baby is late; 'baby blues' and postnatal depression; screening tests for newb orn babies; looking after yourself and your new baby .Urine Your urine is checked for a number of things, including protein or 'albumin'. If this is in your urine, it may mean that you have an infection that needs to be treated. It may also be a sign of pre-eclampsia (see 'High blood pressure and pre-eclampsia' on page 84). Blood pressure A rise in blood pressure later in pregnancy could be a sign of pre-eclampsia (see page 84). It is very common for your blood pressure to be lower in the middle of your pregnancy than at other times. This is not a problem, but may make you feel light-headed if you get up quickly. Talk to your midwife if you are concerned. Checking your baby's development and wellbeing At each antenatal appointment from 25 weeks, your midwife or 6 Antenatal care 61doctor should check your baby's growth. To do this, they will measure the distance from the top of your uterus to your pubic bone. The measurement will be recorded in your notes. If your baby's movements become different or less frequent, slow down or stop, contact your maternity unit immediately. You will be offered an ultrasound scan if your midwife or doctor has any concerns about your baby's growth. See page 65 for more on fetal movement or visit www.rcog.org.uk A risk assessment will be carried out to determine whether your baby's growth can be measured with a tape measure or whether you need to have an ultrasound scan every three weeks to monitor your baby's growth. Blood tests As part of your antenatal care, you will be offered a number of blood tests. Some are offered to all women and some are only offered if it is thought that you are at risk of a particular infection or inherited condition. All of the tests are done to help make your pregnancy safer or to check that your baby is healthy. Talk to your midwife or doctor so that you understand why the blood tests are being offered and so that you can make an informed choice about whether or not you want them. Your midwife or doctor should also give you information about the tests. Below is an outline of all the tests that can be offered. Your blood group and rhesus factor Your blood will be tested to check your blood group and to see whether you are rhesus negative or positive. Some women are rhesus negative. This is usually not a worry for a first pregnancy but it may affect the next child. People who are rhesus positive have a substance known as D antigen on the surface of their red blood cells. Rhesus negative people do not.A woman who is rhesus negative can carry a baby who is rhesus positive if the baby's father is rhesus positive. During pregnancy or birth, small amounts of the baby's blood can enter the mother's bloodstream. This can cause the mother to produce antibodies. This usually doesn't affect the existing pregnancy, but the woman becomes 'sensitised'. This means that if she gets pregnant with another rhesus positive baby, the immune response will be quicker and much greater. The antibodies produced by the mother can cross the placenta and attach to the D antigen on her baby's red blood cells. This can be harmful to the baby as it may result in a condition called haemolytic disease of the newborn, which can lead to anaemia and jaundice. Prevention of rhesus disease Anti-D injections prevent rhesus negative women producing antibodies against the baby and reduce the risk of a rhesus negative woman becoming sensitised. Rhesus negative mothers who are not sensitised are offered an anti-D injection at around 31 weeks as well as after the birth of their baby. This is safe for both the mother and her baby. 62Anaemia Anaemia makes you tired and less able to cope with any loss of blood when you give birth. If tests show you are anaemic, you will probably be given iron and folic acid. Immunity to rubella (German measles) If you get rubella in early pregnancy, it can seriously damage your unborn baby. Your midwife or doctor will talk to you about what happens if your test results show low or no immunity. You will be offered measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) immunisation after your baby is born. For more information about rubella, visit pha.site/immunisation-and-vaccinationsSyphilis You will be tested for this sexually transmitted infection because if left untreated, it can lead to miscarriage and stillbirth. Hepatitis B This is a virus that can cause serious liver disease. If you have the virus or are infected during pregnancy, it may infect your baby (see page 49). Your baby will not usually be ill but has a high chance of developing long-term infection and serious liver disease later in life. Your baby can start a course of immunisation at birth to help prevent infection. If you have hepatitis B, you will be referred to a specialist and may be offered treatment during pregnancy to reduce the risk of passing on the infection to your baby. Hepatitis C This virus can cause serious liver disease and there is a small risk that it may be passed to your baby if you are infected. This cannot be prevented at present. Tests for hepatitis C are not usually offered routinely as part of antenatal care. If you think you may be at risk (see page 49), talk to your midwife or GP. They can arrange a test. If you are infected, your baby can be tested within a few days of birth. If you have hepatitis C, you will be referred to a specialist. If you are HIV positive If you are HIV positive, your doctor will need to discuss the management of your pregnancy and delivery with you. There is a one in four chance of your baby being infected if you and your baby don't have treatment. Treatment can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting HIV from you to your baby. 20% of HIV-infected babies develop AIDS or die within the first year of life, so it's important to reduce the risk of transmission. Your labour will be managed to reduce the risk of infection to your baby. This may include an elective caesarean delivery (see page 113). Your baby will be tested for HIV at birth and at intervals for up to two years. If your baby is found to be infected with HIV, paediatricians will be able to anticipate certain illnesses that occur in infected babies, and treat them early. All babies born to HIV positive mothers will appear to be HIV positive at birth, because they have antibodies from their mother's infection. If the baby is not affected, the test will later become negative because the antibodies will disappear. You will be advised not to breastfeed because HIV can be transmitted to your baby in this way. If you think that you are at risk of getting HIV or know you are HIV positive, talk to your midwife or doctor about HIV testing and counselling. You can also get free confidential advice from the National AIDS Helpline on 0800 567 123. 6 Antenatal care 63HIV This is the virus that causes AIDS. If you are infected you can pass the infection to your baby during pregnancy, at delivery, or after birth by breastfeeding. As part of your routine antenatal care, you will be offered a confidential test for HIV infection. If you are HIV positive, both you and your baby can have treatment and care that reduce the risk of your baby becoming infected. If your test result is negative, the fact that you had the test as part of your antenatal care will not affect your ability to get insurance. Cervical cancer Cervical smears detect early changes in the cervix (the neck of the uterus), which could later lead to cancer if left untreated. Routine smears are only offered to women over 25. If you are due to have a cervical smear (if you have not had one in the last three years), you will probably be told to wait until three months after your baby is born unless you have a history of abnormal smears. This is based on guidance by the HSC cervical screening programme. For more information, go to www.cancerscreening.hscni.net Herpes If you, or your partner, have ever had genital herpes, or you get your first attack of genital blisters or ulcers during your pregnancy, let your midwife or doctor know. Herpes can be dangerous for your newborn baby and it may need treatment. Other infections There are other infections that are not routinely tested for - ask your GP or midwife about tests if you are concerned. Breast lumps If you note any unusual breast lumps or have been treated for breast cancer in the past ask your doctor to examine you. Lumps which are not harmful often appear in pregnancy but it is best to have them checked by a doctor. Ultrasound scans Most hospitals will offer women at least two ultrasound scans during their pregnancy. The first is usually around eight to 12 weeks and is sometimes called the dating scan because it can help to determine when the baby is due. The second scan usually takes place between 18 and 20 weeks and is called the anomaly scan because it checks for structural abnormalities. Ultrasound scans use sound waves to build up a picture of your baby in your uterus. They are completely painless, have no known serious side effects on mothers or their babies, and may be carried out for medical 64need at any stage of pregnancy. If you have any concerns about having a scan, talk it over with your midwife, GP or obstetrician.For women with a normal healthy uncomplicated pregnancy ultrasound scans are not recommended after 24 weeks (NICE, 2008). If you are carrying more than one baby, you will need more ultrasound scans. What do scans tell us? Chec k your baby's measurements. This gives a better idea of when your baby was conceived and when it is likely to be born. This can be useful if you are unsure about the date of your last period or if your menstrual cycle is long, short or irregular. Your due date may be adjusted depending on the ultrasound measurements. Confirm if you are carrying more than one baby . Detect some abnormalities, particularly in your baby's head or spine. Show the position of your baby and your placenta. S ometimes a caesarean section is recommended - for example if your placenta is low lying in late pregnancy. Chec k that your baby is growing and developing as expected (this is particularly important if you are carrying twins or more).At the scan You may be asked to drink a lot of fluid before you have the scan. A full bladder pushes your uterus up and this gives a better picture. You then lie on your back and some jelly is put on your abdomen. An instrument is passed backwards and forwards over your skin and high-frequency sound is beamed through your abdomen to the uterus and pelvis. The sound is reflected back and creates a picture that is shown on a screen. It can be very exciting to see a picture of your own baby moving about inside you. Ask for the picture to be explained to you if you cannot 6 Antenatal care 65make it out. It should be possible for your partner to come with you and see the scan. Although scans are medical procedures, many couples feel that they help to make the baby real for them both. Ask if it's possible to have a copy of the picture. There may be a small charge for this. Fetal movement You will usually start feeling some movements between 16 and 22 weeks. Later in pregnancy your baby will develop its own pattern of movements - which you will soon get to know.These movements will range from kicks and jerks to rolls and ripples and you should feel them every day. At each antenatal appointment, your midwife will talk to you about the pattern of movements. A change, especially a reduction in movements, may be a warning sign that your baby needs further tests. Try to become familiar with your baby's typical daily pattern and contact your maternity unit immediately if you feel that the movements have changed. Tests to detect abnormalities You may be offered tests that can detect structural abnormalities like spina bifida, which is a defect in the development of the spine, or some chromosomal disorders like Down's syndrome, which is caused by an abnormal number of chromosomes. Discuss the tests and what they mean with your midwife. Screening tests can: reassure you that your baby has no detected structural abnormalities; provide you with an opportunity to see your baby during the scan; give you time to prepare for the arrival of a baby with special needs.Tests can also provide valuable information for your care during the pregnancy. However, no test can guarantee that your baby will be born without an abnormality. No test is 100% accurate and some abnormalities may remain undetected. If you do have a screening test and it suggests an increased chance of a chromosomal abnormality, you will be offered diagnostic tests, which will give a more definite diagnosis. These diagnostic tests carry a small risk of miscarriage, so you may decide not to have them. Discussing the issues with your partner, midwife, doctor and friends may help you in deciding what is right for you. You will also be offered tests for: sic kle cell; thalassemia; glucose tolerance test. Haemophilia and muscular dystrophy Some disorders, such as haemophilia and muscular dystrophy, are only found in boys (although girls may carry the disorder in their chromosomes and pass it on to their sons). Tell your midwife or doctor if these or other genetic disorders run in your family, as it may then be important to know your baby's sex. 66Testing for Down's syndrome and other genetic disorders These tests may be offered to pregnant women. Blood testing is a blood sample that tests for Down's syndrome, usually at about 11-13 weeks into your pregnancy. It measures three or four pregnancy-associated blood chemicals to give your individual statistical chance of having a baby with Down's syndrome. Blood testing on its own is not recommended for twin and other multiple pregnancies. Test results Some maternity services give the result as 'lower risk/screen negative' or 'higher risk/screen positive'. If the test shows the risk of the baby having Down's syndrome is lower than the recommended national cut-off, this is known as having a 'low-risk' result. A low-risk result means that you are at a lower risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome, but it does not mean there is no risk. If the result shows the risk of the baby having Down's syndrome is greater than the recommended national cut-off, this is known as an 'increased risk' or 'higher risk' result. An increased risk means you will be offered diagnostic test but it does not mean that your baby definitely has the condition. The diagnostic procedure you will be offered is amniocentesis to give you a definite answer about Down's syndrome. Your midwife or doctor will explain the result to you and help you decide whether you want to have further tests.Pre-conception Commence folic +6Physical examination by 8 72 hours Newborn hearing screenNewborn blood spotGive pre-screening information as soon as possible NewbornBIRTH1 0 2 36 35 34 33 32 31 3029 28 2726 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 1716 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3Blood for syphilis, hepatitis B, HIV and rubella susceptibility as early as possible, or as soon as a woman arrives for care, including labourBlood for haemoglobin, group, rhesus and antibodies as early as possible, or as soon as a woman arrives for care, including labourAntenatal Repeat haemoglobin and antibodies Give and discuss newborn screening informationDetailed ultrasound anomaly scanDating scan Screening for infectious diseases in pregnancy Newborn physical examinations Newborn hearing Newborn blood spotScreening timetable - optimum times for testing Women and families should understand the purpose of all tests before they are taken Amniocentesis Amniocentesis can be offered from 15 weeks of pregnancy if: you have a positive or higher risk Down's syndrome screening result; an ultrasound scan detects an abnormality that is associated with a genetic disorder; your past history or family history suggests that there may be a risk of your baby having a genetic or c hromosomal disorder such as Down's syndrome, sickle cell disorder or thalassaemia. What happens Using ultrasound as a guide, a fine needle is passed through the wall of the abdomen into the amniotic fluid that surrounds your baby. Within the fluid are cells that contain the same chromosomes as your baby. A small sample of this fluid is drawn off and sent to a laboratory for testing. Most women feel only mild discomfort. Usually, the fluid will be tested for Down's syndrome and other serious syndromes. The results should be available within three working days. If all the chromosomes have to be looked at, it can take up to three weeks. This test will reveal your baby's sex, so tell your midwife or doctor whether, at this stage, you want to know if your baby is a boy or a girl. The risks Amniocentesis has a 0.5-1% risk of miscarriage. At most, one test in 100 will result in pregnancy loss. When deciding whether or not to go ahead with this test, try to balance the risk of miscarriage against the value of the result to you. Diagnostic tests for Down's syndrome and other genetic disorders These tests will give you a definite diagnosis of Down's syndrome and sometimes other abnormalities. Your midwife or doctor will explain what is involved and you will usually be offered counselling. If a test detects an abnormality It is always difficult when you are told there is something wrong with your baby. Your midwife or doctor will make sure you see the appropriate health professionals to help you get all the information and support you need so you can make the choices that are right for you and your family.Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC) help parents with all issues associated with antenatal testing and its implications. They can give you more information or put you in touch with parents with a pregnancy in which an abnormality had been detected. Go to www.arc-uk.org for more information. 67 6 Antenatal care68Making the most of antenatal care Having regular antenatal care is important for your health and the health of your baby. Most antenatal services are now provided in easily accessible community settings. Waiting times in clinics can vary, and this can be particularly difficult if you have young children with you. Try to plan ahead to make your visits easier. Here are some suggestions: In some clinics you can buy refreshments. If not, take a snac k with you if you are likely to get hungry. W rite a list of questions you want to ask and take it with you to remind you. Make sure you get answers to your questions or the opportunity to discuss any worries. If your partner is free, they may be able to go with you. T his can help them feel more involved in the pregnancy. Maternity hand-held record (MHHR) At your first antenatal visit, your midwife will enter your details in a record book and add to them at each visit. You should be asked to keep your maternity hand-held record at home with you and to bring them along to all your antenatal appointments. The chart below gives a sample of the information your notes may contain, but each clinic has its own system. Always ask your midwife or doctor to explain anything they write on your chart. Date Gestation Blood Urine P ressure (B P) 15/6/18 13 1 10/60 Nil 20/7/18 1 26+ Nil 28/10/18 3 0 27/11/18 3 4 1 15/75 Nil3 1 2 4Date. This is the date of your antenatal visit. Gestation. This refers to the length of your pregnancy in weeks from the date of your last menstrual period. Blood pressure (B P). This should stay at about the same level throughout your pregnancy. If it goes up a lot in the last half of your pregnancy, it may be a sign of pre- eclampsia (see page 84). Urine. These are the results of your urine tests for protein and sugar. '+' or 'Tr' means a quantity (or trace) has been found. 'glu' stands for 'glucose',. 'Nil' or a tick or 'NAD' all mean the same: nothing abnormal has been discovered. 'Ketones' may be found if you have not eaten recently or have been vomiting. Mssu stands for \"mid stream sample of urine\" which will be sent away for testing if any protein is found in case an infection is present.1 2 3 46 69Presentation. This refers to which way up your baby is. Up to about 30 weeks, your baby moves about a lot. Then they usually settle into a head- downward position, ready to be born head first. This is recorded as 'Vx' (vertex) or 'C' or 'ceph' (cephalic). Both words mean the top of the head. If your baby stays with its bottom downwards, this is a breech ('Br') presentation. 'PP' means presenting part, which is the part (head or bottom) of your baby that is coming first. 'Tr' (transverse) means your baby is lying across your abdomen. Position. The way the baby is lying in the womb. * ROA: Right occipito anterior LOP: Left occipito posteriorFetal or just 'H' means 'fetal heart heard'. Fetal movement. Most women are first aware of their baby moving when they are 16-22 weeks pregnant. However, if this is your first pregnancy, you may not become aware of movements until you are more than 20 weeks pregnant. If you have been pregnant before, you may feel movements as early as 16 weeks. Pregnant women feel their unborn baby's movements as a kick, flutter, swish or roll. As your baby develops, both the number and type of movements will change with your baby's activity pattern. Usually, afternoon and evening periods are times of peak activity for your baby. During both day and night, your baby has sleep periods that mostly last between 20 and 40 minutes, and are rarely longer than 90 minutes. Your baby will usually not move during these sleep periods. The number of movements tends to increase until 32 weeks of pregnancy and then stay about the same, although the type of movement may change as you get nearer to your due date. Often, if you are busy, you may not notice all of these movements. Importantly, you should continue to feel your baby move right up to the time you go into labour. Your baby should move during labour too. If you are unsure whether or not your baby's movements are reduced, you should lie down on your left side and focus on your baby's movements for the next two hours. If you do not feel ten or more separate movements during these two hours, you should seek professional help immediately. 'FMF' means 'fetal movement felt'.5 6 38 weeks 24 weeks 12 weeks Presentation P osition FH F etal Next Sign.

They want to make you feel happy with all aspects of the care you receive, both while you are pregnant and when you have your baby. Many mothers would like to be able to get to know the people who care for them during pregnancy and the birth of their baby. The HSC is working to achieve this but you may still find that you see a number of different carers. The professionals you see should introduce themselves and explain who they are, but if they forget, don't hesitate to ask. It may help to make a note of who you have seen and what they have said in case you need to discuss any point later on. The people you are most likely to meet are listed below. A midwife is specially trained to care for mothers and babies throughout pregnancy and labour and after the birth. Midwives provide care for the majority of women at home or in hospital. A midwife will look after you during labour and, if everything is straightforward, will deliver your baby. If any complications develop during your pregnancy or delivery, you will also see a doctor. You may also meet student midwives and student doctors. After the birth, you and your baby will be cared for by midwives and maternity support workers. An obstetrician is a doctor specialising in the care of women during pregnancy and labour and after the birth. Your midwife or GP will refer you for an appointment with an obstetrician if they have a particular concern, such as previous complications in pregnancy or chronic illness. An anaesthetist is a doctor who specialises in providing 6 Antenatal care 71pain relief and anaesthesia (lack of sensation). If you decide to have an epidural, it will be set up by an anaesthetist. If you require a caesarean section or an instrumental delivery (using forceps or vacuum extractor), an anaesthetist will provide the appropriate anaesthesia. In many hospitals your midwife can arrange for you to talk to an anaesthetist about analgesia or anaesthesia if you have medical or obstetric problems. Before or during labour you will be able to speak to your anaesthetist. A paediatrician is a doctor specialising in the care of babies and children. A paediatrician may check your baby after the birth to make sure all is well and will be present when your baby is born if you have had a difficult labour. If your baby has any problems, you will be able to talk this over with the paediatrician. If your baby is born at home or your stay in hospital is short, you may not see a paediatrician at all. Your midwife or GP will check that all is well with you and your baby. A sonographer is specially trained to carry out ultrasound scans. A sonographer will perform your anomaly scan. Some women are scanned at other points in their pregnancy. An obstetric physiotherapist is specially trained to help you cope with physical changes during pregnancy, childbirth and afterwards. Some provide antenatal education and teach antenatal exercises, relaxation and breathing, active positions and other ways you can keep yourself fit and healthy during pregnancy and labour. After the birth, they advise on postnatal exercises to tone up your muscles. Your midwife can help you with these exercises. Health visitors are specially trained nurses who offer help and support with the health of the whole family. You may meet your health visitor before the birth of your baby and you will be visited by a member of the team in the first few weeks after your baby is born. You may continue to see your health visitor or a member of the health visiting team at home or at your child health clinic, health centre or GP's surgery.Dietitians may be available to advise you about healthy eating or special diets, for example if you develop gestational diabetes or have a high BMI at start of pregnancy. Research You may be asked to participate in a research project during your antenatal care or labour or after you have given birth. This may be to test a new treatment or to find out your opinions on an aspect of your care. Such projects are vital if professionals are to improve maternity care. The project should be fully explained to you and you are free to say no. Students Some of the health professionals you see will have students with them. The students will be at various stages of their training but will always be supervised. You can say no, but if you let a student be present it will help their education and may even add to your experience of pregnancy and labour.72Antenatal education/ parentcraft Antenatal education (sometimes called antenatal classes) can help to prepare you for your baby's birth as well as for looking after and feeding your baby. It can help you to keep yourself fit and well during pregnancy and give you confidence as well as information. You can find out about arrangements for labour and birth and the sorts of choices available to you. You may also meet some of the people who will look after you during labour. You will be able to talk over any worries and discuss your plans, not just with professionals but with other women and their partners as well. Classes are also a really good way to make friends with other parents expecting babies at around the same time as you. These friendships often help you through the first few months with a baby. Classes are usually informal and fun. Choosing an antenatal class Think about what you hope to gain from antenatal classes so that you can find the sort of class that suits you best. You need to start making enquiries early in pregnancy so that you can be sure of getting a place in the class you choose. You can go to more than one class. Ask your midwife, health visitor or GP about what is available in your area. Speak to your community midwife if you cannot go to classes. The midwife may have DVDs to lend you, or you may be able to hire or buy one. The classes During pregnancy, you may be able to go to some introductory classes on babycare. Most start about 8 to 10 weeks before your baby is due. Classes are normally held once a week, either during the day or in the evening, for about two hours. Some classes are for pregnant women only. Others will welcome partners or friends, either to all the sessions or to some of them. 6 Antenatal care 73In some areas there are classes for women whose first language is not English, classes for single mothers and classes for teenagers. The kinds of topics covered in antenatal education are: health in pregnancy; e xercises to keep you fit during pregnancy and help you in labour; what happens during lab our and birth; coping with lab our and information about different types of pain relief; how to help yourself during lab our and birth; relaxation tec hniques; how to give birth without any intervention; information on diff erent kinds of birth and intervention; caring for your baby , including feeding; your health after the birth; 'refresher classes' for those who have already had a baby; emotions during pregnancy , birth and the early postnatal period. Some classes will try to cover all of these topics. Others will concentrate on certain aspects, such as exercises and relaxation or caring for your baby. The number of different antenatal classes available varies from place to place. If you have a multiple pregnancy, try to start your classes at around 24 weeks, because your babies are more likely to be born earlier. Some hospitals have special classes for parents who are expecting multiple babies. Parents expecting multiple babies may also be shown around the neonatal unit because twins and triplets are more likely to need neonatal care after they are born. For more information see chapter 15. The NCT The NCT (also known as the National Childbirth Trust) runs a range of classes. The groups tend to be smaller and may go into more depth, often allowing time for discussion and for practising physical skills. For details of antenatal courses, along with information on local support groups, visit www.nct.org.uk 74Sure Start Sure Start is a government programme funded by the Department of Education which provides a range of support services for parents and children under the age of four. There are 38 Sure Start projects in Northern Ireland, covering at least the top 20% most disadvantaged wards. Sure Start projects deliver a wide variety of programmes to parents and children, which are designed to support preschool children's learning, health and wellbeing, and social and emotional development. The aims of Sure Start are to complement the work of existing local services and provide families with advice on where to go and who to speak to if they have more specialised needs or difficulties. Sure Start projects do this by: improving the ability to learn by encouraging stimulating play , improving language skills and the early identification and support of children with learning difficulties; improving health by supporting parents in caring for c hildren and promoting children's health and development; improving social development by supporting the development of early relationships between parents and c hildren, good parenting skills, family functioning and early identification and support of children with emotional, learning or behavioural difficulties. The core elements which must feature in any Sure Start programme are: outreac h and home visiting services, to make contact as early as possible in the child's life and draw families into using other services; family support, including befriending, social support and parenting information, b oth group and home-based; good quality play , learning and childcare experiences for children, both group and home-based; primary and community healthcare and advice; speec h, language and communication support; support for all c hildren in the community, recognising their differing needs.

Conditions and problems in pregnancy7Conditions and problems in pregnancy 75 7 Problems in early pregnancy Most women feel well in early pregnancy but can feel uncomfortable. Some women describe a pain low down in the abdomen similar to a period pain. This does not necessarily mean that something is wrong, but if the pain is more than discomfort or if there is any bleeding, your midwife or GP should refer you for a scan in the early pregnancy assessment unit. This scan will show whether the pregnancy is growing in the uterus. Sometimes you need a second scan to check that all is well. Common minor problems Backache As your baby grows, the hollow in your lower back may become more pronounced, and this can also cause backache. During pregnancy, your ligaments become softer and stretch to prepare you for labour. This can put a strain on the joints of your lower back and pelvis, which can cause backache.How to avoid backache A void lifting heavy objects. Bend your knees and keep your bac k straight when lifting or picking something up from the floor.Your body goes through a lot of changes during pregnancy. Sometimes these changes can cause you discomfort or irritation, and you may be worried about what is happening to you. There is usually nothing to worry about, but you should mention anything that concerns you to your midwife or doctor. If you have concerns or questions in between appointments write them down in the \"what matters to me\" section of your maternity hand-held record (MHHR) and discuss with your midwife or doctor at your next appointment. If you think that something may be seriously wrong, trust your own judgement and get in touch with your midwife or doctor straight away. This chapter describes some of the minor and more serious health problems and gives advice on how to deal with them and when you should get help.76 Move your f eet when turning round to avoid twisting your spine. W ear flat shoes that allow your weight to be evenly distributed. W ork at a surface that is high enough so that you don't stoop. T ry to balance the weight between two bags when carrying shopping. Sit with your bac k straight and well supported. Make sure you get enough rest - particularly later in pregnancy . When to get helpIf your backache is very painful, ask your doctor to refer you to a maternity physiotherapist at your hospital. They will be able to give you some advice and may suggest some helpful exercises. Constipation You may become constipated very early in pregnancy because of the hormonal changes taking place in your body.How to avoid constipation Eat foods that are high in fibre, like wholemeal breads, wholegrain cereals, fruit and vegetables, and pulses suc h as beans and lentils. Exercise regularly to keep your muscles toned. Drink plenty of water . A void iron supplements. Ask your doctor whether you can manage without them or change to a different type. Cramp Cramp is a sudden, sharp pain, usually in your calf muscles or feet. It is most common at night, but nobody really knows what causes it. How to avoid cramp Regular, gentle exercise in pregnancy, particularly ankle and leg movements, will improve your circulation and may help to prevent cramp occurring.Feeling faint You may often feel faint when you are pregnant. This is because of hormonal changes taking place in your body and happens if your brain is not getting enough blood and therefore enough oxygen. If your oxygen level gets too low, you may actually faint. You are most likely to feel faint if you stand still for too long or get up too quickly from a chair or out of a hot bath. It can also happen when you are lying on your back. How to avoid feeling faint T ry to get up slowly after sitting or lying down. If you f eel faint when standing still, find a seat quickly and the feeling should pass. If it doesn't, lie down on your side. If you f eel faint while lying on your back, turn on your side. It is advisable not to lie flat on your back at any time in later pregnancy or during labour. Ask your doctor or midwif e to check your haemoglobin (Hb) level as you may need iron supplements. Feeling hot During pregnancy you are likely to feel warmer than normal. This is due to hormonal changes and to an increase in the blood supply to your skin. You are also likely to sweat more. Conditions and problems in pregnancy7How to avoid feeling hot W ear loose clothing made of natural fibres, as these are more absorbent and 'breathe' more than synthetic fibres. K eep your room cool. You could use an electric fan to cool it down. W ash frequently to help you to feel fresh. Headaches Some pregnant women find they get a lot of headaches. How to ease headaches T ry and get more regular rest and relaxation. P aracetamol in the recommended dose is generally considered safe for pregnant women but there are some painkillers that you should avoid. Speak to your pharmacist, nurse, midwife, health visitor or GP about how much paracetamol you can take and for how long. When to get helpIf the headache is severe or is associated with swelling, blurred vision or heartburn type pain contact your doctor or midwife immediately. Incontinence Incontinence is a common problem. It can affect you during and after pregnancy.Sometimes pregnant women are unable to prevent a sudden spurt of urine or a small leak when they cough, sneeze or laugh, or when moving suddenly or just getting up from a sitting position. This may be temporary, because the pelvic floor muscles relax slightly to prepare for the baby's delivery. Some women have more severe incontinence and find that they cannot help wetting themselves. When to get help In many cases incontinence is curable, so if you have a problem talk to your midwife, doctor or health visitor. You can also get help and support from the confidential Bladder and Bowel Foundation helpline on 0845 345 0165 (9.30am to 1.00pm Mon to Fri) or visit www.bladderandbowelfoundation.org Indigestion and heartburn Indigestion is partly caused by hormonal changes and in later pregnancy by your growing uterus pressing on your stomach. Heartburn is more than just indigestion. It is a strong, burning pain in the chest caused by stomach acid passing from your stomach into the tube leading to your stomach. This is because the valve between your stomach and this tube relaxes during pregnancy. How to avoid indigestion T ry eating smaller meals more often. Sit up straight when you are eating, as this takes the pressure off your stomac h. A void the foods which affect you, like fried or highly spiced food, but make sure you are still eating well (see pages 31 for information on healthy eating). 7778How to avoid heartburn Heartburn is often brought on by lying flat. Sleep well propped up with plenty of pillows. A void eating and drinking for a few hours before you go to bed. Y our GP may prescribe an antacid if the problem is persistent. How to ease heartburn Drink a glass of milk. Have one by your bed in case you wake with heartburn in the night. Note that you should not take antacid tablets before c hecking with your midwife, doctor or pharmacist that they are safe for you to take during pregnancy. Leaking nipples Leaking nipples are normal and usually nothing to worry about. The leaking milk is colostrum, which is the first milk your breasts make to feed your baby. When to get help See your midwife or doctor if the milk becomes bloodstained, or if you notice unusual lumps on your breasts. Anaemia Anaemia (a low blood count) in pregnancy is common with as many as 1 in 4 women being anaemic before pregnancy and 1 in 3 after delivering their baby. You might not be aware that you are anaemic but if you experience tiredness, paleness,shortness of breath or dizziness these could all be warning signs. Women with anaemia in pregnancy have been shown to have a higher risk of low birth weight babies and of needing a blood transfusion. There will be huge demands on you after birth and being anaemic will make the caring for you and your baby much more difficult. You will be offered a blood test to check for anaemia at your booking appointment. For most women the cause is a lack of iron. Good sources of easily absorbed iron include red meat, chicken and fish. If you are vegetarian ensure you are getting enough iron from other foods such as tofu, beans, lentils, peas and dried fruits. Your doctor may also give you a prescription for iron tablets. If they do it is important that you begin taking them once a day to ensure that you and your baby have enough iron reserves for a health pregnancy. There is no benefit in taking more than one iron tablet a day as your body can only absorb a certain amount each day and it will make side effects more likely. The best improvement in your blood count is seen if you take one tablet daily consistently. Taking your tablets on an empty stomach with vitamin C rich foods (such as fruit and vegetables) will ensure your body can absorb as much iron as possible. Tea, coffee, dairy products and antacids can all reduce the amount of iron you absorb so avoid these for about two hours before taking your iron tablets. Some people find that iron tablets can make them constipated but this is a common problem in pregnancy and can be avoided by drinking plenty of Conditions and problems in pregnancy7 79fluids and including lots of fibre in your diet. It is important to know that Pregnacare does not contain enough iron to fix your anaemia. Nausea and morning sickness Nausea is very common in the early weeks of pregnancy. Some women feel sick, and some are sick. It can happen at any time of day - or even all day long. Hormonal changes in the first three months are probably one cause. Nausea usually disappears around the 12th to 14th week. This can be one of the most trying problems in early pregnancy. It comes at a time when you may be feeling tired and emotional, and when many people around you may not realise that you are pregnant. How to avoid nausea and morning sickness If you f eel sick first thing in the morning, give yourself time to get up slowly. If possible, eat something like dry toast or a plain biscuit before you get up. Get plenty of rest and sleep whenever you can. F eeling tired can make the sickness worse. Eat small amounts of food often rather than several large meals, but don't stop eating. Drink plenty of fluids. Ask those close to you for e xtra help and support. Distract yourself as muc h as you can. Often the nausea gets worse the more you think about it. A void foods and smells that make you feel worse. It helps if someone else can cook. Eat bland, non-greasy foods, such as baked potatoes, pasta and milk puddings, which are simple to prepare. W ear comfortable clothes. Tight waistbands can make you feel worse. When to get helpIf you are being sick all the time and cannot keep anything down, tell your midwife or doctor. Some pregnant women experience severe nausea and vomiting. This condition is known as hyperemesis gravidarum and needs specialist treatment. Nose bleeds Nose bleeds are quite common in pregnancy because of hormonal changes. They don't usually last long but can be quite heavy. As long as you don't lose a lot of blood, there is nothing to worry about. You may also find that your nose gets more blocked up than usual. How to stop nose bleeds Sit with your head forward. P ress the sides of your nose together between your thumb and forefinger, just below the bony part, for 10 minutes and try not to swallow the blood. Repeat for a further 10 minutes if this is unsuccessful. If the bleeding continues, seek medical advice. P assing urine often Needing to pass urine often may start in early pregnancy. Sometimes it continues right through pregnancy. In later pregnancy it's the result of the baby's head pressing on the bladder. How to reduce the need to pass urine If you find that you have to get up in the night try cutting out drinks in the late evening, but make sure you keep drinking plenty during the day . Later in pregnancy , some women find it helps to rock backwards and forwards while they are on the toilet. This lessens the pressure of the uterus on the bladder so that you can empty it properly. Then you may not need to pass water again quite so soon. When to get helpIf you have any pain while passing water or you pass any blood, you may have a urine infection, which will need treatment. Drink plenty of water to dilute your urine and reduce pain. You should contact your GP within 24 hours. The growing baby will increase pressure on your bladder. If you find this a problem, you can improve the situation by doing exercises to tone up your pelvic floor muscles (see page 45). Ask a midwife or maternity physiotherapist for advice.Pelvic joint pain If during or after your pregnancy you have pain in your pelvic joints when walking, climbing stairs or turning in bed, you could have pelvic girdle pain (PGP) or symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD). This is a slight misalignment or stiffness of your pelvic joints, at either the back or front. It affects up to one in four pregnant women to a lesser or greater extent. Some women have minor discomfort, others may have much greater immobility.When to get helpGetting diagnosed as early as possible can help to minimise the pain and avoid long-term discomfort. Treatment usually involves gently pressing on or moving the affected joint so that it works normally again. Ask a member of your maternity team for a referral to a manual physiotherapist, osteopath or chiropractor who is experienced in treating pelvic joint problems. They tend not to get better completely without treatment from an experienced practitioner. Visit the Pelvic Partnership for support and information at www.pelvicpartnership.org.uk Piles Piles, also known as haemorrhoids, are swollen veins around your anus (back passage) which may itch, ache or feel sore. You can usually feel the lumpiness of the piles around your anus. Piles may also bleed a little and they 80Conditions and problems in pregnancy7can make going to the toilet uncomfortable or even painful. They occur in pregnancy because certain hormones make your veins relax. Piles usually resolve within weeks after birth. How to ease piles Eat plenty of food that is high in fibre, like wholemeal bread, fruit and vegetables, and drink plenty of water . This will prevent constipation, which can make piles worse. A void standing for long periods. T ake regular exercise to improve your circulation. Y ou may find it helpful to use a cloth wrung out in ice water. P ush any piles that stick out gently back inside using a lubricating jelly. Ask your midwif e, doctor or pharmacist if they can suggest a suitable ointment.Skin and hair changes Hormonal changes taking place in pregnancy will make your nipples and the area around them go darker. Your skin colour may also darken a little, either in patches or all over. Birthmarks, moles and freckles may also darken. Some women develop a dark line from their belly buttons down to the top of their pubic hair. These changes will gradually fade after the baby has been born, although your nipples may remain a little darker. If you sunbathe while you are pregnant, you may find that you tan more easily. Protect your skin with a good, high-factor sunscreen. Don't stay in the sun for very long. Hair growth is also likely to increase in pregnancy. Your hair may also be greasier. After the baby is born, it may seem as if you are losing a lot of hair. In fact, you are simply losing the extra hair that you grew during pregnancy. Sleep Late in pregnancy it can be very difficult to get a good night's sleep. It can be uncomfortable lying down or, just when you get comfortable, you find that you have to get up to go to the toilet. Some women have strange dreams or nightmares about the baby and about the birth. Talking about them can help you. It might be more comfortable to lie on one side with a pillow under your tummy and another between your knees. Stretch marks These are pink or purplish lines which usually occur on your abdomen or sometimes on your upper thighs or breasts. Some women get them, some don't. It depends on your skin type.Some people's skin is more elastic. You are more likely to get stretch marks if your weight 81 82gain is more than average. It is very doubtful whether oils or creams help to prevent stretch marks. After your baby is born, the marks should gradually pale and become less noticeable. Swollen ankles, feet and fingers Ankles, feet and fingers often swell a little in pregnancy because your body is holding more water than usual. Towards the end of the day, especially if the weather is hot or if you have been standing a lot, the extra water tends to gather in the lowest parts of your body. Suggestions for swollen ankles, feet and fingers A void standing for long periods. W ear comfortable shoes. P ut your feet up as much as you can. Try to rest for an hour a day with your feet higher than your heart. Do foot e xercises (see page 46). If the swelling does not reduce ask your doctor or midwif e to check your blood pressure. Teeth and gums Always tell your dentist that you are pregnant as this may affect your treatment. Bleeding gums are caused by a build-up of plaque (bacteria) on your teeth. During pregnancy, hormonal changes in your body can cause plaque to make your gums more inflamed. They may become swollen and bleed more easily. When your baby is born your gums should return to normal. How to keep teeth and gums healthy Clean your teeth and gums carefully . Ask your dentist to show you a good brushing method to remove all the plaque. A void having sugary drinks and foods too often. Try to eat them at mealtimes only. Go to the dentist for a c heck-up. HSC dental treatment is free while you are pregnant and for a year after your baby's birth. Ask your dentist if any new or replacement fillings should be delayed until after your baby is b orn. Conditions and problems in pregnancy7Tiredness In the early months of pregnancy you may feel tired or even desperately exhausted. The only answer is to try to rest as much as possible. Make time to sit with your feet up during the day and accept any offers of help from colleagues and family. Towards the end of pregnancy you may feel tired because of the extra weight you are carrying. Make sure that you get plenty of rest. Vaginal discharge Almost all women have more vaginal discharge in pregnancy. It should be clear and white and should not smell unpleasant. If the discharge is coloured or smells strange, or if you feel itchy or sore, you may have a vaginal infection. The most common infection is thrush, which your doctor can treat easily. You can help to prevent thrush by wearing loose cotton underwear. When to get help Tell your midwife or doctor if the discharge is coloured, smells strange, or if you feel itchy or sore. Tell your midwife or doctor if vaginal discharge, of any colour, increases a lot in later pregnancy. Varicose veins Varicose veins are veins which have become swollen. The veins in the legs are most commonly affected. You can also get varicose veins in the vulva (vaginal opening). They usually get better after delivery. Tell your doctor or midwife if you have varicose veins or if a close relative has ever had a clot or blood clotting disorder as you will need assessments as pregnancy progresses. If you have varicose veins: T ry to avoid standing for long periods of time. T ry not to sit with your legs crossed. T ry not to put on too much weight, as this increases the pressure. Sit with your legs up as often as you can to ease the discomfort. T ry support tights, which may also help to support the muscles of your legs. T ry sleeping with your legs higher than the rest of your body - use pillows under your ankles or put books under the foot of your bed. Do foot e xercises (see page 46) and other antenatal exercises such as walking and swimming, which will help your circulation. 83More serious problems High blood pressure and pre-eclampsia During pregnancy your blood pressure will be checked at every antenatal appointment. This is because a rise in blood pressure can be the first sign of a condition known as pre-eclampsia - also called pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) or pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET). It can run in families and affects 10% of pregnancies. Your urine is checked for protein at every visit, as this is a sign of pre-eclampsia. The symptoms Some of the symptoms of pre-eclampsia are: bad headac hes; problems with vision, suc h as blurred vision or lights flashing before the eyes; bad pain just below the ribs; vomiting; sudden swelling of the face, hands or f eet. However, you can have severe pre-eclampsia without any symptoms at all. This can be a serious condition for both mother and baby. It can cause fits in the mother (called eclampsia) and affects the baby's growth. It is life-threatening if left untreated. That is why routine antenatal checks are so important. Pre-eclampsia usually happens towards the end of pregnancy, but it may happen earlier. It can also happen after the birth. It is likely to be more severe if it starts earlier in pregnancy. Treatment may start with rest at home, but some women need admission to hospital and medicines that lower high blood pressure. Pre-eclampsia can be a reason to deliver the baby early - this may be either by induction of labour or by caesarean section. When to get help If you get any of the symptoms described here, or have any reason to think that you have pre-eclampsia, contact your midwife, doctor or the hospital immediately. 84Conditions and problems in pregnancy7Placenta praevia Placenta praevia (or a low-lying placenta) is when the placenta is attached in the lower part of the uterus, near to or covering the cervix. The position of your placenta is recorded at your 18 to 21-week ultrasound scan. If it is significantly low you will be offered an extra ultrasound scan later in your pregnancy (usually at around 34 weeks) to recheck its position. For 9 out of 10 women the placenta has moved into the upper part of the uterus by this time. If the placenta is still low in the uterus, there is a higher chance that you could bleed during your pregnancy or at the time of birth. This bleeding can be very heavy and put you and your baby at risk. You may be advised to come into hospital at the end of your pregnancy so that emergency treatment can be given very quickly if you do bleed. If the placenta is near or covering the cervix, the baby cannot get past it to be born vaginally and a caesarean section will be necessary. Itching Mild itching is common in pregnancy because of the increased blood supply to the skin. In late pregnancy the skin of the abdomen is stretched and this may also cause itchiness. How to avoid itching W earing loose clothing may help. Y ou may also want to avoid synthetic materials. Severe itching and obstetric cholestasis Severe itching can be a sign of a condition called obstetric cholestasis. This is a potentially dangerous liver disorder that seems to run in families, although it can occur even if there is no family history. The main symptom is severe generalised itching without a rash, most commonly in the last four months of pregnancy. Obstetric cholestasis can lead to premature birth, stillbirth or serious health problems for your baby. It can also increase the risk of maternal haemorrhage after the delivery. When to get help You should see your doctor if: the itc hing becomes severe - particularly if it affects your hands and feet; you develop jaundice (yellowing of the whites of the eyes and skin); you get itc hing and a severe rash. 85 86Small babies Many of the tests in pregnancy check that your baby is growing. If you have previously had a very small baby, or if you smoke, the midwives and doctors will already be monitoring your pregnancy closely. Blood pressure checks may also pick up signs that there are complications. If there is concern about your baby's health, further tests might be carried out and your baby will be monitored more frequently. What should I do if I feel my baby's movements are reduced or changed? Always seek professional help immediately. Never go to sleep ignoring a change in your baby's movements. Do not rely on any home kits you may have for listening to your baby's heartbeat. You must contact your local maternity unit immediately. You must not wait until the next day to seek help. You will be asked about your baby's movements. You will have a full antenatal check-up, including checking your baby's heartbeat. Your baby's heart rate will be monitored, usually for at least 20 minutes. This should give you reassurance about your baby's wellbeing. You should be able to see your baby's heart rate increase as he or she moves. You will usually be able to go home once you are reassured. An ultrasound scan to check on the growth of your baby, as well as the amount of amniotic fluid around your baby, may be arranged if: 1. your uterus measures smaller than e xpected; 2. your pregnancy has risk factors associated with stillbirth; 3. the heart-rate monitoring is normal but you still f eel that your baby's movements are less than usual. The scan is normally performed Conditions and problems in pregnancy7 87within 24 hours of being requested. These investigations usually provide reassurance that all is well but if there are any concerns about your baby, your doctor and midwife will discuss this with you. Follow-up scans may be arranged. In some circumstances, you may be advised that it would be safer for your baby to be born as soon as possible. Seek medical helpYou should contact your GP if you have a sudden 'acute' illness like diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, high fever or severe itch. Vaginal bleeding Bleeding from the vagina at any time in pregnancy can be a dangerous sign. Some causes of vaginal bleeding are more serious than others, so it's important to find the cause straight away. Bleeding after sex The cells on the surface of the cervix often change in pregnancy and make it more likely to bleed - particularly after sex. This is called a cervical erosion. Vaginal infections can also cause a small amount of vaginal bleeding. Ectopic pregnancy In early pregnancy, bleeding may be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy or a miscarriage (see page 179), although many women who bleed at this time go on to have normal and successful pregnancies. Bleeding in late pregnancy The most common sort of bleeding in late pregnancy is the small amount of blood mixed with mucus that is known as a 'show'. This is a sign that the cervix is changing and becoming ready for labour to start. It may happen a few days before contractions start or during labour itself. Deep vein thrombosis Deep vein thrombosis is a serious condition where clots develop, often in the deep veins of the legs. It can be fatal if the clot travels from the legs to the lungs. The risk may increase if you are on a long-haul flight (over five hours), where you sit still for a long time. You will have an assessment carried out at booking to see if you have increased risk of developing clots and if so treatment can be given. When to get help If you develop swollen and painful legs or have breathing difficulties, go to your GP or your nearest emergency department immediately. More information For more information see the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' guideline Thrombosis and Embolism during Pregnancy and the Risk at pha.site/thrombosis-pregnancy 88Vasa praevia Vasa praevia is a rare condition (occurring in about 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 6,000 births). It occurs when the blood vessels of the umbilical cord run through the membranes covering the cervix. Normally the blood vessels would be protected within the umbilical cord. When the membranes rupture and the waters break, these vessels may be torn, causing vaginal bleeding. The baby can lose a life-threatening amount of blood and die. It is very difficult to diagnose but it may occasionally be spotted before birth by an ultrasound scan. Vasa praevia should be suspected if there is bleeding and the baby's heart rate changes suddenly after rupture of the membranes. It is linked with placenta praevia (see page 85).What are blood clots? Pregnancy increases the risk of having a blood clot during and for about six weeks after pregnancy. There are two kinds: 1. Deep-vein thromb osis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, most commonly in the leg or pelvis. Symptoms (if any): Swelling (most likely to be in the muscles of your legs) Red, purple, blue or white discolouration P ain or discomfort 2. Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when part or all of the blood clot breaks free and passes through your blood vessels and reac hes your lungs. Symptoms: Coughing (with blood-stained spit) Chest pain Breathlessness or collapse Health prof essionals use the term venous thromboembolism (VTE) to cover both types of blood clots. If you develop any of these symptoms during or after your pregnancy, please get medical advice immediately. Feelings and relationshipsFeelings and relationships 898 8 Help and support If you are feeling very tearful or anxious most of the time - for whatever reason - talk to your midwife or doctor as soon as possible.From the minute you know you are pregnant, your feelings change: feelings about yourself, about the baby and about your future. Your relationships change: with your partner, other children and also with your parents and friends. Coping with these changes is not always easy. This chapter is about some of the worries that may come up in pregnancy and suggestions on how to handle them. What is a problem for one woman may not be a problem for you, and what is helpful advice for some women may not be right for you. So take from these pages what you find useful. Pregnancy is an exciting time for you and your family. Most women feel very happy during their pregnancy as they look forward to the birth of their new baby. Feelings When you are pregnant it can sometimes seem as though you have to be happy all of the time. You may find that people expect you to look forward to the baby, to be excited and to 'bloom'. You too may think that this is the way you ought to feel. In fact, you are likely to have ups and downs, just like any other nine months in your life. Hormonal changes and tiredness Hormonal changes taking place in your body can make you feel tired, nauseous, emotional and upset - particularly in the first three months. You may find that you cry more easily, sometimes for no reason or lose your temper more often. Being tired and run down can make you feel low. Try to look after your physical health and get plenty of sleep (see chapter 5 on Your health in pregnancy).90Anxiety It is quite normal to feel anxious and worried when you are pregnant - especially if this is your first pregnancy. There are a number of things that you may feel anxious about. You may find antenatal tests stressful - because of the possibility that something may be wrong. You may be worried about practical things like money, work or where you are going to live. You may be anxious about whether you will cope as a parent, or about whether you are ready to be a parent. Some of these anxieties could be shared by your partner, friends or family. It is a good idea to talk through these feelings together. Dreams It is normal to have dreams about your baby. Sometimes your dreams may reflect your anxieties. This is often because you are thinking a lot about your pregnancy and the changes that are happening in your body. Talk to your midwife if you are worried by this. Ways of coping S ometimes it helps to share anxieties with other pregnant women. Discuss any worries, concerns or anxieties you have with someone you f eel you can talk to. This could be your midwife, your partner, your friends or family. Depression and mental health problems It's normal to have some worries while you are pregnant and to feel a bit down from time to time.But it is a cause for concern if you are feeling down most of the time. Whatever the reason for your unhappiness, or even if there doesn't seem to be any reason at all, explain how you feel to your midwife, doctor or health visitor. Make sure that they understand that you are talking about something more than just feeling low. Some women do get depressed during pregnancy and you may need treatment and support to help you deal with it. You will be asked during your pregnancy about your mood and how you are feeling, it is important to be honest with your midwife as then she can provide you with help and support. If you have had a mental health problem in the past, then you 91 8 Feelings and relationshipsmight be at risk of becoming ill with a depressive illness during pregnancy and childbirth. It is important that you tell your midwife at the start of your pregnancy about any previous illness. If your mood changes throughout the pregnancy then let someone know how you are feeling; don't suffer alone - there is help available for you. Worrying about the birth It is difficult to imagine what a contraction is like and no one can really tell you - though they may try! Exploring ways of coping with labour may help you to feel more in control. You can begin by reading the chapter on Labour and birth (page 99) with your partner or a friend or relative who will be with you for the birth. Ask your midwife or doctor for any further information. Antenatal education will also help to prepare you for labour and the birth and to know what to expect (see page 72). You will have an opportunity to discuss this in more detail with your midwife, and complete the birth preferences form within your MHHR to ensure staff are aware of your choices. Talk to your partner or someone close to you. They may be feeling anxious too - particularly if they are going to be with you during labour. Together, you can then work out ways that will help you to cope. Concerns about your baby At some time during pregnancy, most expectant parents worry that there may be something wrong with their baby. Some women find that talking openly about their fears helps them to cope. Others prefer not to think about the possibility that something could be wrong. Some women worry because they are convinced that if something does go wrong it will be their fault. You can increase your baby's chances of being born healthy by following the advice outlined in chapter 17 . But there are certain problems which cannot be prevented. This is either because the causes are not known or because they are beyond your control. Of all the babies born in the UK, 97% are healthy and 1% of babies will be born with conditions that can be partly or completely corrected, such as extra fingers or toes. About 2%, however, will suffer from more serious conditions. Regular antenatal care and careful observation during labour helps to pick up any potential problems and allow appropriate action to be taken. If you are particularly concerned - perhaps because you or someone in your family has a disability - talk to your midwife or doctor as soon as possible. They may be able to reassure you or offer you helpful information about tests which can be done during pregnancy (see chapter 6). If you have previously had a baby with a serious condition, talk to your midwife or doctor and see if you need any additional care during this pregnancy. Looking after yourself It is not uncommon to feel a bit anxious or depressed during pregnancy. If you are feeling stressed, try to take some time out for you: have a nice relaxing bath or go for a gentle walk. If you are feeling overwhelmed, talk to your GP or midwife. Your relationship with your partner may also be under pressure at this time. If you think you or your partner need further support, you can talk to your midwife in complete confidence. Couples Pregnancy will bring about big changes to your relationship, especially if this is your first baby. Some people cope with these changes easily, others find it harder. Everybody is different. It is quite common for couples to find themselves having arguments every now and then during pregnancy, however much they are looking forward to the baby. Some arguments may be nothing to do with the pregnancy, but others may be because one of you is worried about the future and how you are going to cope. It's important to realise that during pregnancy there are understandable reasons for the odd difficulty between you, as well as good reasons for feeling closer and more loving. One practical question you will need to discuss is how you will cope with labour, and whether your partner wants to be there. Many fathers do want to be present at their baby's birth. The chapter on Labour and birth (page 99) gives some suggestions for ways in which fathers can help, and what it can mean for them to share this experience.If your relationship is particularly problematic, or abusive, don't ignore the situation in the hope that it will get better. Get help. It may be that you do not have a partner in this pregnancy and you need extra support from family or friends. You may wish to talk to your midwife about services that may be available. See single parents on page 93. Sex in pregnancy It is perfectly safe to have sex during pregnancy. Your partner's penis cannot penetrate beyond your vagina, and the baby cannot tell what is going on! However, it is normal for your sex drive to change and you should not worry about this, but do talk about it with your partner. Later in pregnancy, an orgasm - or even sex itself - can set off contractions (known as Braxton Hicks contractions - see page 101). You will feel the muscles of your uterus go hard. There is no need for alarm, as this is perfectly normal. If it feels uncomfortable, try your relaxation techniques or just lie quietly till the contractions pass. Your midwife or doctor will probably advise you to avoid sex if you have any bleeding in pregnancy, since this risks infection in the baby - especially if your waters have broken. 92938 Feelings and relationshipsSome couples find having sex very enjoyable during pregnancy, while others simply feel that they don't want to have sex. You can find other ways of being intimate or of making love. The most important thing is to talk about your feelings with each other. While sex is safe for most couples in pregnancy, it may not be all that easy. You will probably need to find different positions. This can be a time to explore and experiment together. Single parents If you are pregnant and on your own, it is important that there are people who can support you. Sorting out problems, whether personal or medical, is often difficult when you are by yourself, and it's better to find someone to talk to rather than to let things get you down. You may find it encouraging to meet other mothers who have also gone through pregnancy on their own. Don't feel that, just because you don't have a partner, you have to go to antenatal visits and cope with labour on your own. You can take whoever you like - a friend, sister, or perhaps your mum. Involve your 'birth Help and support One Parent Families/Gingerbread (www.gingerbread.org.uk) One Parent Families/Gingerbread is a self-help organisation for one-parent families that has a network of local groups which can offer you information and advice. They will be able to put you in touch with other mothers in a similar situation. If money is an immediate concern, see the chapter on Rights and benefits (page 187) for information on what you can claim and your employment rights. Your local Social Security or Jobs and Benefits Office or Citizens Advice will be able to give you more advice. If you have housing problems, contact your local Citizens Advice or your local Housing Executive Office. Gingerbread Northern Ireland advice line 028 9023 4568 (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri). 94partner' in antenatal classes if you can, and let them know what you want from them. Ask your midwife if there are antenatal classes in your area that are run especially for single women.Think about the people who can help and support you. If there is no one who can give you support, it might help to discuss your situation with a social worker. Your midwife can refer you or you can contact the social services department of your local Health and Social Services Trust directly. Same sex couples Many same sex couples are choosing to start a family together. However, some couples may not feel comfortable disclosing their relationship status to a health professional. Like every other couple, you should expect that any information you share is treated confidentially. The care you receive is tailored to meet individual need, so it is important that you feel comfortable discussing your circumstances with the midwife or the doctor. For example, you may want to know if your midwife provides antenatal classes in groups or if individual classes may be available. You might want to ask if there are any restrictions on the number of people who can accompany the expectant mother to her appointments or the number of birthing partners allowed during labour. Family and friends Pregnancy is a special time for you and your partner, but there may be a lot of other people around you who will be delighted about your baby, such as your parents, sisters, brothers and friends. People can offer a great deal of help in all sorts of ways, and you will probably be very glad of their interest and support. Sometimes it can feel as if they are taking over. If so, it can help everyone if you explain gently that there are some decisions that only you and your partner can take, and some things that you would prefer to do on your own. Work If you work, and you like the people you work with, you may have mixed feelings when you go on maternity leave. Try to make the most of these few weeks to enjoy doing the things you want to do at your own pace. It is also a good opportunity to make some new friends. You may meet other mothers at 958 Feelings and relationships antenatal classes (see page 72) or you may get to know more people living close by. You may have decided that you are going to spend some time at home with your baby, or you may be planning to return to work, either full or part-time, fairly soon after the birth. If you think that you will be going back to work, you need to start thinking about who will look after your baby in advance. It is not always easy to find satisfactory childcare arrangements, and it may take you some time. You may have a relative willing to look after your child. If not, you should contact your Families Information Service for a list of registered childminders and nurseries. You may also want to think about organising care in your own home, either on your own or sharing with other parents. Care in your own home does not need to be registered, but you should make sure that your carer is experienced and trained to care for babies. However, if you are to claim financial help with the costs, either through tax credits or tax relief or help from your employer, the carer must be registered with Social Services. You can find out more at pha.site/childcare After the birth Having a baby and becoming a parent are major events for all the family. Becoming a parent usually brings changes to your home life, social life and relationships. Parents of a new baby experience a variety of emotions after the birth. You will feel happy and proud of yourself, and probably very relieved that it is all over. Whether this is your first, second or third baby, the first few weeks of parenthood are both physically and emotionally tiring. It can be difficult to find time for yourself, your partner or your family when you have the 24-hour demands of a new baby to deal with. Meeting the needs of a baby can be very rewarding. You may expect to love your baby immediately, but this can take a while and is not always instinctive, and does not mean that you are not a 'good' or 'natural' mother. Many women experience these feelings. It is likely that during the first few weeks and months of parenthood you will feel a mixture of emotions. Your health visitor will be available to talk to you, but it is important that you talk honestly to your partner, friends or family about how you feel. Being a parent means constantly experiencing new events and carrying out new tasks. You will have to learn a new set of skills to cope with these situations. Women do not automatically know how to be a mother and men do not automatically know how to be a father. It is something that you learn over time. 96Mood changes that can develop after the birth of a baby If you experience any of the following mood changes, do not feel ashamed of how you are feeling. You are not alone: asking for and accepting help is the first stage of recovery - particularly for the more serious conditions. If you think you are in any way depressed, talk to a healthcare professional assoon as you can. Your midwife, health visitor and GP are all trained to help you, and many voluntary organisations offer advice (see the list of useful organisations on page 192). The baby blues As many as 8 out of 10 women get what is commonly called 'the baby blues'. It normally begins within a few days of the baby's birth and goes away within a few weeks. How does it affect you? Common reactions are to burst into tears for no obvious reason, or to feel on top of the world one minute and miserable the next. It is not unusual to feel anxious or tense, lacking in confidence or worried. Becoming a parent for the first time can feel like an overwhelming responsibility and it is very easy to feel inadequate when other parents around you seem to be coping well. Give yourself plenty of time to adjust to your new life. Find time to rest and eat a healthy diet, as this will help you to become and stay physically and emotionally healthy. Talk to someone you can trust such as your partner, your mum, a friend, or to your midwife or health visitor, about how you are feeling. It can help a lot just to confide in someone else. Once they know how you are feeling, they will be able to give you support. If you become more unhappy or upset, or if your low mood lasts more than a week, then you are probably experiencing something other than the baby blues.Postnatal depression Postnatal depression affects 1 in 10 women following the birth of their baby. It usually begins in the first six months after childbirth, although for some women the depression begins in pregnancy. It can occur at any time within the first year of the birth of your baby. How does it affect you? If you get postnatal depression, you can feel as if you are taken over by a feeling of hopelessness. You may feel angry, but more often you will feel too exhausted to be angry or even to cope with the simplest tasks. Postnatal depression is serious, and if it is left untreated it can last for longer than a year. However, early diagnosis and treatment of postnatal depression will result in a faster recovery. Quite often a partner or close family friend will recognise that there is something wrong before you do. If you think you are depressed, contact your GP, midwife or health visitor and explain how you are feeling. Your partner or a friend could contact them for you if you want. If you have twins or triplets, you are more likely to experience postnatal and longer-term depression. This is mainly 97because of the additional stress of caring for more than one baby. Getting out of the house can be difficult and this can make you feel isolated. Tamba (www.tamba.org.uk) can help you to make contact with other mothers through local twins clubs and through their helpline, Tamba Twinline (0880 138 0509). Puerperal psychosis This is a much more rare and serious condition, which affects about 1 in 500 new mothers. Women with a family history of mental illness or who have suffered from puerperal psychosis in previous pregnancies are at a higher risk of developing this illness. Symptoms include: hallucinations; delusions; mania; loss restlessness; f eeling very confused; behaving in a way that's out of c haracter. How does it affect you? The symptoms of this illness can be very severe and sometimes very frightening for you, your partner, and your family. In fact, your partner may be the first to notice that you are unwell. It is important that your partner or someone close to you knows the symptoms to look out for. They will appear suddenly, often within the first two weeks following the birth of the baby. Seeking help quickly will ensure that you are treated as early as possible, to help you get well again. Postpartum psychosis is a serious mental illness that should be treated as a medical emergency. If not treated immediately, you can get rapidly worse and could neglect or harm your baby or yourself. Usually women with this illness will require admission to hospital. Postnatal post-traumatic stress disorder and birth trauma Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may occur on their own or with postnatal depression. The reasons women develop this are unclear, but some women describe feeling 'out of control' and very afraid during the birth. This condition can be caused by: a f ear of dying or your baby dying, or lif e-threatening situations. How does it affect you? The symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, panic attacks, numbed emotions, sleeping problems, irritable, angry and irrational behaviour. How to get help: Talk to your midwife or health visitor, about your experience and feelings. Domestic abuse One in four women experience domestic abuse at some point in their lives. This may be physical, sexual, emotional or psychological abuse. Of this, 30% starts in pregnancy, and existing abuse may get worse during pregnancy or after giving birth. Domestic abuse during pregnancy puts a pregnant woman and her unborn child in danger. It increases the risk of miscarriage, infection, premature birth, low birth rate, fetal injury and fetal death. Domestic abuse does not have to be tolerated - you have choices and help is available. You can speak in confidence to your GP, midwife, obstetrician, health visitor or social worker. Or call the 8 Feelings and relationships98confidential 24-hour National Domestic Violence Helpline number on 0808 2000 247 for information and support. The helpline is run in partnership between Refuge and Women's Aid. To find out more visit Refuge at www.refuge.org.uk or Women's Aid at www.womensaid.org.ukk If you are in immediate danger, call 999. Bereavement The death of someone you love can turn your world upside down, and is one of the most difficult experiences to deal with. This may be harder to cope with if you are pregnant or have just had a baby. Family and friends can help you by spending time with you. Grief is not just one feeling but a whole succession of feelings, which take time to get through and which cannot be hurried. If you need help or advice, contact your GP or midwife. If your partner dies If your partner dies during your pregnancy or soon after childbirth, you may feel emotionally numb. It may not be something that you get over - more something that you eventually learn to live with. Don't be afraid to lean on your family and friends. If your partner was going to be with you at the birth, you will need to think about who will be with you instead. Try to choose someone who knows you very well. Financially, you may need urgent advice and support. You can get more information from your local Social Security Office or Jobs and Benefits Office (see page 187).

Any other letters or test results.Going into labour is exciting, but you may also feel apprehensive, so it helps to be prepared well in advance. Knowing all about the stages of labour and what to expect can help you to feel more in control when the time comes. Getting ready Whether you are having your baby at home, in hospital or at a midwifery unit, you should get a few things ready at least four weeks before your due date. Packing your bag Wherever you are having your baby your midwife can help you decide what you will need to pack. You may want to include the following: 100 Transport Work out how you will get to hospital or the midwifery unit, as it could be at any time of the day or night. If you are planning to go by car, make sure that it's running well and that there is always enough petrol in the tank. If a neighbour has said that they will take you, make an alternative arrangement just in case they are not in. If you have not got a car, you could call a taxi. Try to do so in good time. Check which entrance door you should use if you arrive at night. Home births If you are planning to give birth at home, discuss your plans and what you need to prepare with your midwife.Stocking up When you come home you will not want to do much more than rest and care for your baby, so do as much planning as you can in advance: Stoc k up on basics, such as toilet paper, sanitary towels and nappies. Buy tinned and dried food like beans, pasta and rice. If you have a freezer , cook some meals in advance.Important numbers Keep a list of important numbers in your handbag or near your phone. There is space for you to write them down in your notes and at the back of this book. You need to include the following: Y our hospital and midwife's phone numbers. Y our partner and birth partner's phone numbers. Y our own hospital reference number (it will be on your card or notes). You will be asked for this when you phone in. A local taxi number , just in case you need it. The signs of labour You are unlikely to mistake the signs of labour when the time really comes, but if you are in Labour and birth9 101any doubt, don't hesitate to contact your midwife. Regular contractions During a contraction, your uterus gets tight and then relaxes. You may have had these throughout your pregnancy - particularly towards the end. Before labour, these are called Braxton Hicks contractions. When you are having regular contractions that last more than 30 seconds and begin to feel stronger, labour may have started. Your contractions will become longer, stronger and more frequent. Other signs of labour Bac kache or the aching, heavy feeling some women get with their monthly period. T he 'show'. The plug of mucus in the cervix, which has helped to seal the uterus during pregnancy, comes away and comes out of the vagina. This small amount of sticky pink mucus is called the 'show'. It usually comes away before or in early labour. There should only be a little blood mixed in with the mucus. If you are losing more blood, it may be a sign that something is wrong, so phone your hospital or midwife straight away. Y our waters break. The bag of water surrounding your baby may break before labour starts. T o prepare for this, you could keep a sanitary towel (not a tampon) handy if you are going out, and put a plastic sheet on your bed. If your waters break before lab our starts, you will notice either a slow trickle from your vagina or a sudden gush of water that you cannot control. Phone your midwife when this happens. Nausea or vomiting. Diarrhoea.P ain relief in labour For most women labour is painful, so it is important to learn about all the ways you can relieve pain. Whoever is going to be with you during labour should also know about the different options, as well as how they can support you. Ask your midwife or doctor to explain what is available so that you can decide what is best for you. Write down what you want in your birth preferences, but remember that you should keep an open mind. You may find that you want more or less pain relief than you had planned, or your doctor or midwife may suggest more effective pain relief to help the delivery. Use your birth preferences to record what you would like to happen in labour. Coping at the beginning It is best if you are moving ab out during labour. You can drink fluids and may find isotonic drinks (sports drinks) help keep your energy levels up. You can also have a light snack, although many women don't feel very hungry and some feel nauseated. As the contractions get stronger and more painful, you can try relaxation and breathing e xercises. Your birthing partner can help by doing them with you. Y our birthing partner can rub your back to relieve the pain if that helps. 102When to go to hospital or your midwifery-led unit If it is your first pregnancy, you may feel unsure about when you should go into hospital. The best thing to do is call your hospital or unit for advice. If your waters have broken, you will probably be told to go in to be c hecked. If it is your first baby and you are having contractions but your waters have not broken, you may be told to wait. Y ou will probably be told to come in when your contractions are regular, strong, are about five minutes apart and are lasting about 60 seconds. If you don't live near to your hospital, you may need to go in before you get to this stage. Second and later babies often arrive more quic kly, so you may need to contact the hospital, midwifery-led unit or your midwife sooner. Don't forget to phone the hospital or unit before leaving home, and remember your notes. Home birth You and your midwife should have agreed what you will do when labour starts. Arriving at the hospital or midwifery-led unit Hospitals and midwifery-led units vary, so the following is just a guide to what is likely to happen. Your midwife will be able to give you more information about your local hospital or unit. Take your green MHHR notes to the hospital admissions desk. You will be taken to the labour ward or your room, where you can change into a hospital gown or a nightdress of your own. Choose one that is loose and preferably made of cotton, because you will feel hot during labour and will not want something tight. Examination by the midwife The midwife will ask you about what has been happening so far Delivery rooms Delivery rooms have become more homelike in recent years. Most have easy chairs, beanbags and mats so that you can move about in labour and change position. Some have baths, showers or birthing pools. Labour and birth9 and will examine you. If you are having a home birth, then this examination will take place at home. The midwife will: T ake your pulse, temperature and blood pressure and check your urine. F eel your abdomen to check the baby's position and listen to your baby's heart. P robably do an internal examination to find out how much your cervix has opened. Tell her if a contraction is coming so that she can wait until it has passed. She will then be able to tell you how far your labour has progressed. If you would prefer not to have an internal examination you don't have to have one. However, if there are any concerns about your own or your baby's condition, vaginal examinations can help the doctor and midwife to make the most appropriate decisions about any risks and plan your care. These checks will be repeated at intervals throughout your labour. If you and your partner have birth preferences, show your midwife so that she knows what kind of labour you want and can help you to achieve it. What happens in labour There are three stages to labour. In the first stage the cervix gradually opens up (dilates). In the second stage the baby is pushed down the vagina and is born. In the third stage the placenta comes away from the wall of the uterus and is also pushed out of the vagina. The first stage of labour - dilation The dilation of the cervix The cervix needs to open to about 10cm for a baby to pass through. This is called 'fully dilated'. Contractions at the start of labour help to soften the cervix so that it gradually opens. Sometimes the process of softening can take many hours before what midwives refer to as 'established labour'. This is when your cervix has dilated to at least 4cm. If you go into hospital or your midwifery unit before labour is established, you may be asked if you would prefer to go home again for a while, rather than spending extra hours in hospital.If you go home, you should make sure that you eat and drink, as you will need energy. At night, try to get comfortable. Get some sleep if possible. A warm bath or shower may help you to relax. During the day, keep upright and remain active. This helps the baby to move down into the pelvis and helps the cervix to dilate. Once labour is established, the midwife will check from time to time to see how you are progressing. In a first labour, the time from the start of established labour to full dilation can be between 6 and 12 hours. It is often quicker in subsequent pregnancies. Your midwife should be with you all the time to support you. 103104Position and Maximises your b ody's ability to T ry not to overdo it; saving energy is also movement give birth. important.

It's hard to say how muc h of a problem this is but there have been studies showing diff erent feeding behaviours in babies b orn after low-dose epidurals were used. Option P ros Cons Fetal heart monitoring Your baby's heart will be monitored throughout labour. Your midwife will watch for any marked change in your baby's heart rate, which could be a sign that the baby is distressed. There are different ways of monitoring the baby's heartbeat. If you don't feel comfortable with one of these, tell your midwife. Y our midwife may listen to your baby's heart intermittently, for at least one minute every 15 minutes when you are in established labour, using a hand-held ultrasound monitor (often called a Sonicaid). This method allows you to be free to move around. Y our baby's heartbeat and your contractions may also be monitored electronically using a CTG machine. The monitor will be strapped to your abdomen on a belt. Alternatively , a clip can be put on your baby's head to monitor the heart rate. The clip is put on during a vaginal examination and your waters will be broken if they have not already done so. Your midwife or doctor should explain why they feel that the clip is necessary for your baby. Labour and birth9Speeding up labour Your labour may be slower than expected if your contractions are not frequent or strong enough or because your baby is in an awkward position. If this is the case, your doctor or midwife will explain why they think labour should be sped up and may recommend the following techniques. Y our waters may be broken during a vaginal examination. If this doesn't speed up lab our, you may be given a drip containing a hormone, which is fed into a vein into your arm to encourage contractions. You may want some pain relief before the drip is started. A fter the drip is attached, your contractions and your baby's heartbeat will be continuously monitored. The second stage of labour - the baby's birth This stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated, and lasts until the birth of your baby. Your midwife will help you to find a comfortable position and will guide you when you feel the urge to push. She will tell you to try not to push until your cervix is fully open and the baby's head can be seen. To help yourself get over the urge to push, try blowing out slowly and gently or, if the urge is too strong, in little puffs. Some people find this easier lying on their side, or on their knees and elbows, to reduce the pressure of the baby's head on the cervix. Find a position Find a position that you prefer. You can to help the baby's head descend: If you stand up, sit forward, kneel or squat (squatting may be difficult if you are not used to it). If you are very tired, you might be more comfortable lying on your side. T his position is better for your baby than lying on your back. Y ou may find kneeling on all fours might be helpful if you suffer from backache in labour. It can help if you have tried out these positions beforehand and explained to your birth partner how they will help you. PushingWhen your cervix is fully dilated, you can start to push when you feel you need to during contractions: T ake two deep breaths as the contractions start, and push down. T ake another breath when you need to. Give several pushes until the contraction ends. A fter each contraction, rest and get up strength for the next one. This stage is hard work, but your midwife will help and encourage you all the time. Your birth partner can also give you lots of support. This stage may take two hours or more. 107 108 The birth During the second stage, the baby's head moves down the birth canal. When the head is visible, the midwife will ask you to stop pushing, and to pant or puff blowing out through your mouth. This is so that your baby's head can be born slowly and gently, giving the skin and muscles of the perineum (the area between your vagina and back passage) time to stretch without tearing if possible. The skin of the perineum usually stretches well, but it may tear. Sometimes to avoid a tear or to speed up the delivery, the midwife or doctor will inject local anaesthetic and perform an episiotomy if needed. Once your baby's head is born, most of the hard work is over. With one more gentle push the body is usually born quite quickly and easily. You can have your baby lifted straight onto your abdomen before the cord will be cut by your midwife or birthing partner if you prefer.Your baby may be born covered with some of the white, greasy vernix, which acts as a protection while in the uterus. Skin-to-skin contact Even if you have a caesarean section or a difficult delivery, try to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby as soon as possible after the birth. This will: keep your baby warm and calm; help regulate breathing and heartbeat; release mothering hormones to help with b onding. Try the following: place the baby on your tummy with his head near your breast; gently stroke and caress your baby; allow the baby to focus on your face; ask to be left undisturbed to get to know your baby . Even if you decided before the birth not to breastfeed, this may be a really good time to give it a go and see what you think. You might change your mind! The first milk you produce in the days after the birth (called colostrum) contains antibodies that will help protect your baby from infection, so even if you decide not to continue breastfeeding, your baby will benefit from those first few feeds. The third stage of labour - the placenta After your baby is born, the womb can contract to push out the placenta. Your midwife will offer you an injection in your thigh just as the baby is born, which will speed up the delivery of the placenta. The injection contains a drug called Syntocinon, which makes Labour and birth9 109the uterus contract and helps to prevent the heavy bleeding which some women experience. After the birth Your baby will be examined by a midwife or paediatrician and then weighed (and possibly measured) and given a band with your name on it. Vitamin K You will be offered an injection of vitamin K for your baby, which is the most effective way of helping to prevent a rare bleeding disorder (haemorrhagic disease of the newborn). Your midwife should have discussed this with you beforehand. If you prefer that your baby doesn't have an injection, oral doses of vitamin K are available. If given orally further doses will be necessary. StitchesSmall tears and grazes are often left to heal without stitches because they frequently heal better this way. If you need stitches or other treatments, it should be possible to continue cuddling your baby. Your midwife will help with this as much as they can. If you have had a large tear or an episiotomy, you will probably need stitches. If you have already had an epidural, it can be topped up. If you have not, you should be offered a local anaesthetic injection. The midwife or maternity support worker will help you to wash and freshen up, before leaving the labour ward to go home or to the postnatal area. Special cases Labour that starts too early (premature labour) About 1 baby in every 13 will be born before the 37th week of pregnancy. In most cases labour starts by itself, either with contractions or with the sudden breaking of the waters or a 'show'. About one early baby in six is induced and about one early baby in five is delivered by caesarean section (see page 113). If your baby is likely to be born early, you will be admitted to a hospital with specialist facilities for premature babies. Not all hospitals have these facilities, so it may be necessary to transfer you and your baby to another unit, either before delivery or immediately afterwards. If contractions start prematurely, the doctors may be able to use drugs to stop your contractions temporarily. You will probably be given injections of steroids that will help to mature your baby's lungs so that they are better able to breathe after the birth. This treatment takes about 24 hours to work. Many multiple birth babies are born prematurely and twins and triplets may be more likely to need care in a neonatal unit. Your doctor may offer you a planned birth earlier than 38 weeks. The timing of the planned birth depends on the number of babies and whether or not your babies share a placenta. If you have any reason to think that your labour may be starting early, get in touch with your hospital or midwife straight away. 110Overdue pregnancies Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, which is approximately 280 days from the first day of your last period. Most women will go into labour within a week either side of this date. If your labour does not start by 41 weeks, your midwife will offer you a 'membrane sweep'. This involves having a vaginal examination, which stimulates the neck of your uterus (known as the cervix) to produce hormones which may trigger natural labour. If your labour still doesn't start, your midwife or doctor will suggest a date to have your labour induced (started off) usually 10-14 days after your due date. If you don't want labour to be induced and your pregnancy continues to 42 weeks or beyond, you and your baby will be monitored. Your midwife or doctor will check that both you and your baby are healthy by giving you ultrasound scans and checking your baby's movement and heartbeat. If your baby is showing signs of distress, your doctor and midwife will again suggest that labour is induced. Induction Labour can be induced if your baby is overdue or there is any sort of risk to you or your baby's health - for example, if you have high blood pressure or if your baby is failing to grow and thrive.Induction is always planned in advance, so you will be able to talk over the benefits and disadvantages with your doctor and midwife and find out why they recommend your labour is induced. Contractions are usually started by inserting a hormone into the vagina, and sometimes both are used. Induction of labour may take a while, particularly if the neck of the uterus (the cervix) needs to be softened with pessaries or gels. Sometimes a hormone drip is needed to speed up the labour. Once labour starts it should proceed normally, but it can sometimes take 24-48 hours to get you into labour. An information leaflet is available. Labour and birth9 111Assisted vaginal delivery What is an assisted vaginal delivery? An assisted vaginal delivery involves using a ventouse (vacuum cup) or forceps (like large tongs) to guide your baby as you push with your contractions. Your doctor may recommend that you have an assisted vaginal delivery if your baby needs to be delivered quickly. This document will give you information about the benefits and risks to help you to make an informed decision. If you have any questions that this document does not answer, ask your obstetrician or the healthcare team. Why may I need an assisted vaginal delivery?The following are the more common reasons why an assisted vaginal delivery may be recommended. Y ou have been pushing for too long. Y ou may have run out of energy to deliver your baby safely. Y our baby's heart rate may be going above or below normal levels or they may not be getting enough oxygen.Sometimes, if you have high blood pressure, your obstetrician may recommend an assisted vaginal delivery if the second stage of labour goes beyond a certain time and your blood pressure goes higher. On average, 10 to 15 in 100 deliveries are assisted vaginal deliveries. You are more likely to need an assisted vaginal delivery for your first baby.Your obstetrician will discuss with you why an assisted vaginal delivery is the safest method of delivery for both you and your baby. 112Are there any alternatives to an assisted vaginal delivery? You can continue pushing and try to deliver your baby without a ventouse or forceps. Another option is to have a caesarean section (procedure to deliver a baby by a surgical operation). If you are worried or have any questions about why an assisted vaginal delivery has been recommended for you, you should discuss this carefully with your obstetrician. What does an assisted vaginal delivery involve? Before the procedure Your obstetrician will examine your abdomen to find out how large your baby is. They will perform an internal examination to check the position of your baby and how dilated your cervix is. Your obstetrician will also want to check that your pelvis is large enough for an assisted vaginal delivery. If you are already having an epidural and there is enough time, you will be given more anaesthetic through the epidural. Otherwise, local anaesthetic may be injected either into the skin at the opening of your vagina or through your vagina to block the pudendal nerve that supplies your lower vagina and perineum (the area between your vagina and back passage). You may need to have a spinal, which involves injecting anaesthetic into the subarachnoid space (an area near your spinal cord). Your legs will be put in 'stirrups' (the lithotomy position). Your obstetrician may place a catheter (tube) in your bladder to help you to pass urine. Forceps delivery Your obstetrician will place metal forceps either side of your baby's head. When the forceps are in position, your obstetrician will hold them together. If your baby's head is not facing towards your spine, your obstetrician will need to turn the head using the forceps.They will pull gently as you push with your contractions to guide your baby's head out. This can take several pulls and usually involves an episiotomy to help reduce the risk of you tearing. Ventouse delivery Your obstetrician will place the ventouse cup onto your baby's head. The cup may be attached to a special vacuum machine or to a hand-held suction pump that creates a vacuum seal between the cup and your baby's head. Your obstetrician will make sure that none of your vaginal skin is caught in the vacuum seal. Your obstetrician will guide your baby out, as you push with your contractions. This can take several pulls and you may need an episiotomy. Listen carefully to your obstetrician and midwife during the delivery so you know when to push and when to pant. Once your baby's head is delivered, your obstetrician will remove the forceps or ventouse from your baby's head and your baby will be delivered onto your abdomen, 'skin-to-skin'. Once the cord has been cut, your baby will be covered to keep them warm. Your obstetrician will close an episiotomy or any tears with dissolvable stitches. What complications can happen?The healthcare team will try to make the procedure as safe as possible but complications can happen. The possible complications of an assisted vaginal delivery are listed below. Any numbers which relate to risk are from studies of women who have had this procedure. Your Labour and birth9 113doctor may be able to tell you if the risk of a complication is higher or lower for you. P ain, once the local anaesthetic or epidural wears off. You will usually be given a painkilling suppository (tablet placed in your back passage) to keep you comfortable. You may get pain in your abdomen or, more usually, around the stitches. However, an episiotomy or any tears usually heal quickly and if any pain continues it can be controlled with simple painkillers such as paracetamol. Bleeding. On average, women lose less than half a litre of blood. Y ou may be given medication through a drip (small tube) in a vein in your arm or by an injection to help your uterus (womb) to contract. This will help to reduce any bleeding. If you bleed heavily, you may need a blood transfusion. You may need to take iron tablets. T ears (risk of a major tear: 1 in 5 for forceps delivery, 1 in 10 for ventouse delivery). Minor tears are common. Tears are closed with stitches. Damage to your bac k passage caused when a major tear or episiotomy extends to the muscle around your anus or to your anus itself (risk: less than 3 in 100 for a ventouse, less than 7 in 100 for forceps). Healing problems. S ometimes an episiotomy or tear will open slightly. However, this usually does not need any treatment and still heals well. Difficulty passing urine. Y ou may need a catheter for one to two days. Inf ection. This is easily treated with antibiotics. Marks and bruises on your baby (risk of serious damage: less than 2 in 1,000). A ventouse can leave a suction mark and the forceps can bruise your baby's face. T hese do not usually cause any problems and settle in one to two days. Sometimes a ventouse can bruise one of the bones of your baby's skull (risk 1 to 2 in 100). This does not cause any problems and gets better within a few weeks. A paediatrician (doctor who specialises in babies and children) will be present at the birth if they are needed. Shoulder dystocia, where your baby's shoulders get stuc k for a short while on the way out (risk: 1 in 50, compared to 1 in 100 for normal deliveries). Y our baby having jaundice (they eyes and skin turning yellow) (risk: 5 to 15 in 100) and having bloodshot eyes (risk: 17 to 38 in 100) after birth. This is only a small increase compared to normal deliveries and does not cause any long-term problems. Y ou should discuss these possible complications with your doctor if there is anything you do not understand. How soon will I recover? In hospital You will stay in the delivery room for one to two hours while all the routine checks on your baby are carried out. You will then be transferred to the ward. The midwives will give you advice about your postnatal care, including how to look after your stitches. The healthcare team will tell you about abdominal and pelvic-floor exercises to help you to recover. You will be able to go home when you can walk around without any help and are 114able to care for your baby. If you go home the same day, a responsible adult should take you home in a car or taxi and stay with you for at least 24 hours. Be near a telephone in case of an emergency. Do not drive, operate machinery or do any potentially dangerous activities (this includes cooking) for at least 24 hours and not until you have fully recovered feeling, movement and co-ordination. If you had a general anaesthetic or sedation, you should also not sign legal documents or drink alcohol for at least 24 hours. If you are worried about anything, in hospital or at home, contact the healthcare team. They should be able to reassure you or identify and treat any complications. Returning to normal activitiesThe healthcare team will tell you when you can return to normal activities. It is important to have plenty of help at home in the first few days so that you have time to recover and to spend with your new baby. An episiotomy or any tears should heal quickly. If you have any concerns, ask your midwife when they visit you at home, or contact your GP. The future You should make a full recovery. An assisted vaginal delivery should not affect your ability to become pregnant or deliver a baby in the future. Summary An assisted vaginal delivery is a common procedure and is usually a safe method of delivery for you and your baby. However, complications can happen. You need to know about them to help you to make an informed decision about the procedure. Knowing about them will help to detect and treat any problems early. Caesarean section There are situations where the safest option for you or your baby is to have a caesarean section. As a caesarean section involves major surgery, it will only be performed where there is a real clinical need for this type of delivery. Your baby is delivered by cutting through your abdomen and then into your uterus. The cut is made across your abdomen, just below your bikini line. The scar is usually hidden in your pubic hair. If you are expecting twins, triplets or more, it is more likely that you will be advised to have a caesarean section. This will depend on how your pregnancy progresses, the position of your babies and whether the babies share a placenta. Whenever a caesarean is suggested, your doctor will explain why it is advised and any possible side effects. Do not hesitate to ask questions. Urgent (emergency) caesareans Emergency caesarean section Your obstetrician can recommend an emergency caesarean section to deliver your baby safely. However, it is your decision to go ahead with the operation or not. They will give you information about the benefits and risks to help you to make an informed decision. Ask your obstetrician, anaesthetist or midwife if there is anything you do not understand.Labour and birth9 115What does the operation involve?A caesarean section can usually be performed under a spinal or epidural anaesthetic. You will be awake so you can see your baby and have 'skin-to-skin' contact as soon as your baby is born. Your birth partner will also be able to be with you. However, this will not be possible if you need a general anaesthetic. Your obstetrician will make a horizontal cut on your 'bikini' line. They will separate the muscles of your abdominal wall and open your uterus (womb). They will deliver your baby through the cut and repair your womb and abdomen.A midwife will be with you and a paediatrician (doctor who specialises in babies and children) may also attend to your baby when it is born. What complications can happen?A caesarean section is usually safe and your obstetrician believes it is the safest way to deliver your baby. However, complications can happen. Some of these can be serious and can even cause death. Complications of anaesthesia Your anaesthetist will be able to discuss with you the possible complications of having an anaesthetic. What complications can happen? P ain. The healthcare team will make sure you are given enough pain relief. Bleeding during or after the operation. If you bleed heavily (risk: less than 8 in 100), you may need a blood transfusion. Blood clots in your legs (deep-vein thromb osis - DVT) (risk: 7 in 1,000) or, more rarely, in your lungs (pulmonary embolism). The healthcare team will take measures to reduce this risk. Inf ection of the surgical site (wound) or in your womb (endometritis), which usually settles with antibiotics. Developing a hernia in the scar caused by the deep muscle layers failing to heal. Bladder damage. T he risk is higher if you have had previous caesarean sections. Small scratc h on your baby's skin, when your obstetrician makes the cut on your womb. Sometimes the scratch can be on your baby's face (risk: 2 in 100). This usually does not need any treatment. Breathing difficulties for your baby, where your baby takes longer than normal to clear the fluid from their lungs (risk: 6 in 1,000). 116How soon will I recover? You should be able to go home after one to three days. However, your doctor may recommend that you stay a little longer. If you are worried about anything, in hospital or at home, contact the healthcare team. They should be able to reassure you or identify and treat any complications. It is important to have plenty of help at home in the first few days so that you have time to recover and to spend with your new baby. For the first two weeks do little other than care for your baby. You can then gradually increase the amount you do. Bleeding usually lasts for 2 to 4 weeks. Use sanitary pads rather than tampons. Do not lift anything heavy or do strenuous exercise, such as vacuuming or ironing, for 6 weeks. Do not push, pull or carry anything heavier than your baby during this time.Do not have sex until you feel comfortable. Most women take at least three months to recover. You should wait until you are physically and emotionally ready before trying for another baby. The operation In the UK, most caesarean sections are performed under epidural or spinal anaesthesia, which minimises risk and means that you are awake for the delivery of your baby. A general anaesthetic is sometimes used - particularly if the baby needs to be delivered very quickly. If you have an epidural or spinal anaesthesia, you will not feel pain - just some tugging and pulling as your baby is delivered. A screen will be put up so that you cannot see what is being done. The doctors will talk to you and let you know what is happening. Planned (elective) caesareans A caesarean is 'elective' if it is planned in advance. This usually happens because your doctor or midwife thinks that labour will be dangerous for you or your baby. It takes about 5-10 minutes to deliver the baby and the whole operation takes about 40-50 minutes. One advantage of an epidural or spinal anaesthetic is that you are awake at the moment of delivery and can see and hold your baby immediately. Your birth partner can be with you. After a caesarean section After a caesarean section, you will be uncomfortable and will be offered painkillers. You will usually be fitted with a catheter (a small tube that fits into your bladder) for up to 24 hours and you may be prescribed daily injections to prevent blood clots (thrombosis). Depending on the help you have at home, you should be ready to leave hospital within two to four days. You will be encouraged to become mobile as soon as possible, and your midwife or hospital physiotherapist will give you advice about postnatal exercises that will help you in your recovery. As soon as you can move without pain, you can drive - as long as you are able to make an emergency stop. This may be six weeks or sooner. Always check with your insurance company as they may have specific post-operative Labour and birth9 117conditions about how soon you can drive again. Once a caesarean always a caesarean? If you have your first baby by caesarean section, this does not necessarily mean that any future baby will have to be delivered in this way. Vaginal birth after a previous caesarean can and does happen. This will depend on your own particular circumstances (see page 116). Discuss your hopes and plans for any other deliveries with your doctor or midwife. Breech birth If your baby is breech, it means that it is positioned with its bottom downwards. This makes delivery more complicated. Your obstetrician and midwife will talk to you about the best and safest way for your breech baby to be born. You will be advised to have your baby in hospital. External cephalic version You will usually be offered the option of an external cephalic version (ECV). This is when pressure is put on your abdomen to try to turn the baby to a head down position. Caesarean section If an ECV doesn't work, you will probably be offered a caesarean section. This is the safest delivery method for breech babies but there is a slightly higher risk for you. If you choose a caesarean delivery and then go into labour before the operation, your obstetrician will assess whether to proceed with an emergency caesarean delivery. If the baby is close to being born, it may be safer for you to have a vaginal breech birth.Twins, triplets or more If you are expecting twins, labour may start early because of the increased size of the uterus. It is unusual for multiple pregnancies to go beyond 38 weeks. If there are no complications in your pregnancy your doctor may offer you a planned birth earlier than 38 weeks. The timing of the planned birth depends on the number of babies and whether or not your babies share a placenta. Your doctor will discuss this with you during your pregnancy. More health professionals will usually be present at the birth. For example, there may be a midwife, an obstetrician and two paediatricians (one for each baby). Your doctor will discuss with you what type of delivery may be appropriate. Although you are more likely to have a caesarean section, in some cases twins can be delivered vaginally. The process of labour is the same but the babies will be closely monitored. To do this, an electronic monitor and a scalp clip might be fitted on the first baby once the waters have broken. You will be given a drip in case it is needed later, and an epidural is usually recommended. Once the first baby has been born, the midwife or doctor will check the position of the second baby by feeling your abdomen and doing a vaginal examination. 118If the second baby is in a good position to be born, the waters surrounding the baby will be broken, and the second baby should be born very soon after the first because the cervix is already fully dilated. If contractions stop after the first birth, hormones will be added to the drip to restart them. Triplets or more are almost always delivered by elective caesarean section. What your birth partner can do Whoever your birth partner is - your partner, your baby's father, a close friend or a relative - there are quite a few practical things that he or she can do to help you. The most important thing will probably be just being with you. Beforehand you should talk about your birth plan, what you want, and what you don't want, so that they can support your decisions. There is no way of knowing what your labour is going to be like or how each of you will cope, but there are many ways in which a partner can help. They can: K eep you company and help to pass the time in the early stages. Hold your hand, wipe your face, give you sips of water , massage your back and shoulders. Help you move ab out or change position, or to get more comfortable. Encourage you as your lab our progresses and your contractions get stronger. Remind you how to use relaxation and breathing tec hniques, perhaps breathing with you if it helps. Support your decisions ab out pain relief. Help you to discuss your options with the midwif e or doctor. This can help you to feel much more in control of the situation. T ell you what is happening as your baby is being born if you cannot see what is going on for yourself. For many couples, being together during labour and welcoming their baby together is a wonderful experience that they will never forget. Many partners who have seen their baby born and who have played a part themselves say they feel much closer to the child from the very start.

It contains everything your baby needs for around the first six months of life. After that, giving your baby breastmilk along with solid food will help them continue to grow and develop. The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for two years or longer. Breastf eeding protects your baby from various infections and diseases. It also offers health benefits for mums. Every day makes a difference to your baby, as the longer you breastfeed, the longer the protection lasts. Formula milk cannot provide your baby with the same ingredients or give the same protection. Breastf eeding helps build a strong bond between mother and baby, both physically and emotionally. Breastf eeding reduces the risk of sudden infant death. 119What does breastfeeding help protect against?

Discuss your plans with your partner and family as their help is important. You might like to watch the Bump to Breastfeeding video together to see what feeding your baby might be like. The video can be seen at pha.site/bump-to-breastfeeding 120 Breastfeeding Just like any new skill, breastfeeding may take time and practice to work. In the first few days, you and your baby will be getting to know each other. Close contact and holding your baby against your skin can really help with this. The more time you spend with your baby, the quicker you will learn to understand each other's signs and signals. The next few pages will help you to understand how breastfeeding works. And remember, it's OK to ask for help. Immediately after your baby is born Every pregnant woman has milk ready for her baby at birth. This milk is called colostrum and it is sometimes quite yellow in colour. It is very concentrated, so your baby only needs a small amount at each feed. In the first few days it may seem like your baby wants to feed all the time or some babies can be sleepy and will need to be encouraged to feed. Colostrum is full of antibodies to boost your baby's ability to fight off infection. Holding your baby against your skin straight after birth will calm them, steady their breathing and keep them warm. It will also encourage them to breastfeed. Babies are often very alert in the first hour after birth and keen to feed. Your midwife can help you with this. The first few days Each time your baby feeds, they are letting your body know how much milk it needs to produce. The amount of milk you make will increase or decrease in line with your baby's needs. Most babies will want to breastfeed around 8-10 times in a day. Around the 2nd-4th days your breasts will become fuller and warmer. This is often referred to as your milk 'coming in'. To keep yourself as comfortable as possible, feed Help and support Midwives, health visitors, trained volunteers and peer supporters can all offer advice and practical help with breastfeeding. Peer supporters are mothers who have breastfed their own babies and have had special training to help them support other mothers. Talk to your midwife or health visitor about the help that is available in your area. A map of support groups can be seen at pha.site/breastfeeding-support Mother-to-mother support on social media can be extremely helpful, which is why we signpost mums to online support, such as the 'Breastfeeding in Northern Ireland' Facebook group. It should however be noted that the Public Health Agency (PHA) is not responsible for content on non-PHA social media accounts. You can learn more about breastfeeding from the Public Health Agency booklet Off to a good start ask your midwife for a copy or visit pha.site/good-start your baby as often as they want for as long as they want. Your milk supply will vary according to your baby's demands. It will look quite thin compared with colostrum, but gets creamier as the feed goes on. Let your baby decide when they have had enough. You may need to wear breast pads and to change them frequently, if you need to quickly stop your milk flowing you can apply some pressure to your nipple with the flat of your hand for a few seconds. In the beginning, your baby will need to be fed frequently. This helps to ensure you build up a good supply of milk. Gradually your baby may get into a pattern of feeding and the amount of milk you produce will adapt to the baby's needs. Your baby will be happier if you keep them near you and feed them in a responsive way, this means that you offer a breastfeed as early as possible when baby shows any signs of wanting to be fed. It also helps if you offer your breast if baby is upset and needs comforted or if your breasts feel full. This will quickly help your body to produce the amount of milk your baby needs. At night, your baby will be safest sleeping in a cot in the same room as you. This makes feeding easier and will reduce the risk of sudden infant death. Try to take each day as it comes. If your breasts are uncomfortable or sore, ask for help. First steps: starting to breastfeed You can breastfeed in a number of different positions. Find one that is comfortable for both of you. If you are lying back in a well-supported position with your baby lying on your tummy, they will often move themselves onto your breast and begin to feed. Remember at all times to keep your baby safe. You can try feeding lying on your side, in bed or in a chair, supported in an upright position. This will make it easier to hold your baby so their neck, shoulders and back are supported and they can reach your breast easily. Their head and body should be in a straight line. 'Liquid gold': the perfect food for your newborn Colostrum is sometimes called 'liquid gold'. This extra-special breastmilk is full of germ-fighting antibodies that will help protect your baby against infections that you have had in the past. The first few feeds 'coat' your baby's gut to protect them from germs and reduce the chances of them developing allergies as they get older. Later on, your breastmilk will still contain antibodies, and as you come across new infections you will produce new antibodies in your milk. This means that if you get colds or flu while you are breastfeeding, your baby will automatically get some immunity from those illnesses. Feeding your baby10 121 122Your baby's sucking causes milk stored in your breasts to be squeezed down ducts inside your breasts towards your nipples. This is called the 'let-down' reflex. Some women get a tingling feeling which can be quite strong, while others feel nothing at all. You will see your baby respond and their quick sucks change to deep rhythmic swallows as the milk begins to flow. Babies often pause after the initial quick sucks while they wait for more milk to be 'delivered'. If your baby falls asleep quickly before the deep swallowing stage, check that they are properly latched on. It might be easier to get someone else to check for you. Sometimes you will notice your milk flowing in response to your baby crying or when you have a warm bath. After your baby has finished feeding, you can hold them upright on your shoulder to see if they need to burp. Breastfed babies don't usually get as much wind as formula-fed babies.How to help baby breastfeed There are many different positions you can use to breastfeed, such as sitting up, lying down or feeding your baby in the underarm position. In the beginning, your baby will need your help in order to stay comfortable during a feed and to help him attach well to the breast. The following four words may be helpful to remember when starting off breastfeeding. Close (hold your baby in close so that he can reach your breast easily). It may be helpful if you remember the first letter of these four words as CHIN. Head free (try not to hold the back of your baby's head as he needs to be able to tilt his head back, instead support his neck and shoulders and allow his head to be free to tilt back). In-line (make sure the baby's head and body are all facing you and not twisted). Nose to nipple (start the feed with your baby's nose opposite your nipple so that when the baby attaches your nipple goes up over the baby's tongue and into the top of the baby's mouth).1 Hold your baby's whole body close with the nose level with your nipple. 2 Let your baby's head tip back a little so that their top lip can brush against your nipple. This should help your baby to make a wide open mouth. 3 When your baby's mouth opens wide, the chin is able to touch the breast first, with the head tipped back so that the tongue can reach as much breast as possible. 4 With the chin firmly touching, and with the nose clear, the mouth is wide open, and there will be much more of the darker skin visible above your baby's top lip than below their bottom lip. The cheeks will look full and rounded as your baby feeds. Feeding your baby10 123How do I know that my baby is feeding well? Y our baby has a large mouthful of breast. Y our baby's chin is firmly touching your breast. It doesn't hurt you to f eed (although the first few sucks may feel strong). If you can see the dark skin around your nipple, you should see more dark skin ab ove your baby's top lip than below their bottom lip. Y our baby's cheeks stay rounded during sucking. Y our baby rhythmically takes long sucks and swallows (it's normal for your baby to pause from time to time). Y our baby finishes the feed and comes off the breast on their own. If you have any concerns about any of these points, talk to your peer supporter, midwife, GP or health visitor, or contact the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212. Note that if your baby seems unusually sleepy and/or is slow to start feeding, they may be ill, so contact your GP as soon as possible. How do I know my baby is getting enough milk? Y our baby should be healthy and alert. In the first 4 8 hours, your baby is likely to have only two or three wet nappies. Wet nappies should then start to become more frequent, with at least six every 24 hours from day five onwards. Most babies lose weight initially . They should be weighed by a health professional some time around the 3rd-5th day. From then on, they should start to gain weight. Most babies regain their birth weight in the first two weeks. A t the beginning, your baby will pass a black tar-like stool (poo) called meconium. By the 3rd day, this should be changing to a lighter, runnier, greenish stool that is easier to clean up. From the 4th day and for the first few weeks, your baby should pass at least two yellow stools every day. These stools should be at least the size of a \u00a32 coin. It's normal for breastfed babies to pass loose stools. Y our breasts and nipples should not be sore. If they are, do ask for help. Y our baby will be content and satisfied after most feeds and will come off the breast on their own. If you are concerned about any of these points, speak to your midwife or health visitor. 124Tips for breastfeeding Make sure your baby is well attac hed to your breast (see pictures on page 122). This will help your body make the right amount of milk and stop your breasts getting sore. The more you breastfeed your baby, the more milk you will produce. When your baby comes off the first breast, offer the second. It doesn't matter if they are not interested or don't feed for long, or even if they feed for longer on the second breast. This is fine - just start with this breast next time. Sometimes your baby might seem hungrier than usual and feed for longer or more often. Your body responds automatically and makes more milk to provide the extra needed. This is why you can feed more than one baby at the same time (see page 125). T here is no need to offer formula milk in addition to breastmilk. If your baby seems more hungry, feed more often, rather than offer formula milk. Breastf eeding mums are now encouraged to practice responsive feeding. This means offering feeds before crying starts (such as when your baby is restless or sucking her fingers). It involves offering the breast for food and comfort, which helps maintain a good milk supply, as the more often your baby is fed, the more milk is produced. Breastfeeding can be a nice chance to sit down and rest; it can soothe, comfort and calm both baby and mum. By the time a newborn baby starts crying, they will normally have been hungry for a while. T ry not to give your baby any other food or drink before the age of about six months as this will reduce your milk supply. If you do decide to give formula, keep your milk supply going by breastf eeding as much as possible. T ry not to give your baby a dummy until breastfeeding is going well, as this can confuse the baby too much and also reduce your milk supply. W hen you are out and about, wear a t-shirt or a vest top and a cardigan so that you can lift your top up from the waist to feed. If you are worried about showing your tummy you can wear a belly band or a second vest.

Visit breastfed babies to see where your local members arewww.breastfedbabies.org Breastfed babies cannot be overfed so you can breastfeed to calm and soothe your baby, or as a lovely way of spending time together, or just for having a rest. Breastfeeding more than one baby Twins, triplets or more can be breastfed. Because multiple babies are more likely to be born prematurely and to have a low birth weight, breastmilk is especially important for their wellbeing. To start with, you may find it easier to feed each of your babies separately, until you feel confident about handling them at the same time and feeding is well established. This may take up a lot of your time, so it can be really helpful to accept any offers of help around the house from family and friends. Over time, you will learn what works best for you and your babies. Triplets can be breastfed either two together and then one after, or all three rotated at each feed. Alternatively, you can use a combination of breast and formula, depending on the babies and your milk supply. Tamba, the twins and multiple birth association, provides information and support on feeding. To find out more visit www.tamba.org.uk How long should I breastfeed? Exclusive breastfeeding (with no other food or drink) is recommended for around the first six months of a baby's life. After this, you can carry on giving your baby breastmilk along with other foods for as long as you and your baby want. This can be into the second year or beyond. Every day you breastfeed makes a difference to you and your baby. There is no need to decide at the beginning how long you will breastfeed. Many mothers continue to breastfeed when they return to work or college. Don't forget to ask for help if you need it!Dummies Try not to give your baby a dummy until breastfeeding is established, usually when your baby is about a month old. Using dummies has been shown to reduce the amount of breastmilk that is produced. If your baby becomes accustomed to using a dummy while sleeping, it should not be stopped suddenly in the first six months. Try to reduce using the dummy by the time your baby is 6-9 months old as it may affect the development of the baby's teeth and speech. The practicalities will depend on how old your baby is and how many feeds they need while you are apart, but it's often easier to manage than people think. Your peer supporter, midwife, health visitor, local support group or the National Breastfeeding Helpline (0300 100 0212) can explain the options and talk them through with you. If you stop breastfeeding, it can be difficult to start again. Giving formula milk to a breastfed baby can reduce your supply of breastmilk. 126 Expressing milk Expressing milk means removing milk from your breast. You may want to express milk if your breasts are feeling uncomfortably full, or if your baby is not sucking well but you still want to give them breastmilk. If you have to be away from your baby - for example, because your baby is ill or premature, or because you are going back to work - you may wish to express milk so that somebody else can feed your baby. You can express milk very effectively by hand or with a breast pump. Different pumps suit different women, so ask for information to compare them. A pump needs to be clean and sterilised each time it is used.Expressing by handIt is more effective to express milk by hand than to use a pump in the first few days. If you want to collect the milk, you will need a sterilised container. The following suggestions should help: 1. Before you start, wash your hands thoroughly then gently massage your breast to stimulate the milk to start flowing. 2. If you are going to collect the milk, use a sterilised jug or b owl to catch the milk. 3. Place your thumb on top of your breast and the rest of your fingers below ab out 2-3 centimetres from the base of your nipple, with your thumb and fingers in a sort of C-shape. 4. Release the pressure then repeat, building up a rhythm. A void sliding your fingers over the skin. At first, only drops will appear, but just keep going as it will increase. With practice, and a little time your milk will flow freely. 5. W hen no more drops are coming, move your fingers round to try a different section of your breast and repeat. 6. W hen the flow slows down, swap to the other breast. Keep changing breasts until the milk is dripping very slowly or stops altogether. 7. If the milk doesn't flow , try moving your fingers slightly towards the nipple or further away, and try giving your breast a gentle massage. STEP 3 STEP 4 STEP 1Feeding your baby10Breastfeeding and returning to work Many mothers continue to breastfeed when they return to work or college. Your employer may wish to carry out a risk assessment as detailed in the HSE leaflet New and expectant mothers who work available at pha.site/working-mothers The Public Health Agency has also produced a guide for employers, which can be downloaded from pha.site/breastfeeding-work If you are planning to continue to breastfeed after returning to work, it is important that you plan ahead as much as possible. Let your employer know in writing that you intend to continue breastfeeding and that you will need some privacy and a little extra time at breaks to express milk or, if possible, to feed your baby. Checklist for breastfeeding and returning to work: Before you return to work, write to your employer and let them know you are breastfeeding. Decide how your baby will be f ed while you are at work such as bottle or cup, breastmilk or formula. Decide if you need to e xpress milk while at work. P ractise expressing your milk using a pump or by hand. L earn about safe storage of breastmilk. Have a f ew trial runs before you go back to work. Expressing milk if your baby is premature or illIt is important to start expressing your milk within two hours of birth. To ensure that you produce plenty of milk, you will need to express at least 8 to 10 times in 24 hours, including during the night, just as your baby might be doing if they were able to feed directly. Ask the hospital staff about having skin-to-skin contact with your baby as soon as possible after the birth. This will help with bonding and keeping up your milk supply. Baby units often have breast pump machines for expressing milk, and staff will show you how to use one. If you go home from hospital before your baby you may need to use an electric breast pump for many weeks. You can borrow a breastpump from Tiny Life the premature baby charity by contacting them on 028 90815050. If you want to freeze breastmilk because your baby is premature or ill, ask the staff caring for your baby for support and information. Your midwife, health visitor or peer supporter can also give you practical help and answer any questions. You can watch a video online at pha.site/small-wonders The video is called Small Wonders and it tells you all you need to know about breastfeeding an ill or premature baby. 1 YOU AND YOUR BABY: SUPPORTING LOVE AND NURTURE ON THE NEONATAL UNIT \u00a9 Unicef UK/Mead The Baby Friend ly Initiati ve For all babiesSupporting love and nurture on the neonatal unit You and your baby 127Helpful tips Breastfeeding should feel comfortable. Your baby should be relaxed. You should hear a soft swallowing. If it doesn't feel right, start again. Slide one of your fingers into your baby's mouth, gently break the suction and try again.128 Storing breastmilk You can store breastmilk for: up to five days in the fridge at 4\u00baC or lower . This means putting the milk in the coolest part of the fridge, usually at the back (do not keep it in the door); up to two weeks in the freezer compartment of a fridge; up to six months in a domestic freezer , at -18\u00baC or lower. Breastmilk must always be stored in a sterilised container. If you use a pump, make sure you wash it thoroughly after use and sterilise it before use. Milk should be defrosted in the fridge. Once it's defrosted, you will need to use it straight away. Heat the bottle of milk in a jug of warm water. Test the temperature of the milk on your forearm before giving it to your baby. Milk that has been frozen is still good for your baby and better than formula milk. Milk should not be refrozen once thawed. Don't use a microwave oven to warm or defrost breastmilk as this can alter the proteins in your milk and there is a risk of scalding. Some common breastfeeding problems and how to solve themIt can be hard to ask for help, but tackling any problems as soon as they start will help you to enjoy these early days. In lots of cases, the solution is as simple as changing your baby's position slightly or feeding them a bit more often. Unsettled feeding If your baby is unsettled at the breast and doesn't seem satisfied by feeds, it may be that they are sucking on the nipple alone, and so are not getting enough milk. Ask for help to get your baby into a better feeding position. Sore or cracked nipples If your nipples hurt, take your baby off the breast and start again. If the pain continues or your nipples start to crack or bleed, ask for help so you get your baby latched on comfortably (see page 135 for information on how to get help). It can sometimes take a little while to sort out how to prevent the soreness, but it is important to get support as soon as possible . The following suggestions may also help: T ry squeezing out a drop or two of your milk at the end of a feed and gently rubbing it into your skin. Let your nipples dry before covering them. If you are using breast pads, they need to be c hanged at each feed (if possible, use pads without a plastic backing). Feeding your baby10 A void soap as it dries your skin out. W ear a cotton bra, so air can circulate. S ome mothers treat any cracks or bleeding with a thin smear of white soft paraffin or purified lanolin. Put the ointment on the crack (rather than the whole nipple) to help it heal and prevent a scab forming. Tender breasts, blocked ducts and mastitis Milk can build up in the ducts for a variety of reasons. The most common are wearing a too-tight bra, missing a feed, or a blow to the breast. It's important that you deal with a blocked duct as soon as possible so that it doesn't lead to mastitis (inflammation of the breast). If you have mastitis, your breasts will feel hot and tender. You may see a red patch of skin which is painful to touch. You can feel quite ill, as if you have flu, and you may have a temperature. This can happen very suddenly. It is very important to carry on breastfeeding as this will help you get better more quickly. If you think you might have mastitis (or a blocked duct), try the following: T ake extra care to make sure your baby is attached well to your breast. F eed your baby more often. L et your baby feed on the tender breast first. If your breasts still f eel full after a feed, or your baby cannot feed, massage your breasts and express your milk (see page 126 for more information on how to do this). Applying warmth to your breast, for e xample using a warm flannel before a feed, can help milk flow and make you feel more comfortable. W hile your baby is feeding, gently stroke the lumpy area with your fingertips towards your nipple. This should help the milk to flow. Get lots of rest. Go to bed and catc h up on your sleep whenever you can. T ake a painkiller such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (follow instructions on the back). Ask for help with how you get your baby latc hed on properly (see page 135 for information on where to get help).Mastitis may also be a sign of infection. If there is no improvement within 12 to 24 hours, or you start to feel worse, contact your GP or healthcare professional. If necessary, they can prescribe antibiotics that are safe to take while breastfeeding. Thrush If you suddenly get sore, bright pink nipples after you have been feeding without problems for a while, you might have an infection known as thrush. The pain may be felt right inside the breasts. Ask for help to check that your baby is latched on properly, and make an appointment with your GP. You and your baby will both need treatment. You can easily give thrush to each other, so if your baby has it in their mouth they will need oral gel you will still need some cream for your nipples to stop it spreading to you. You can also ask your pharmacist for advice. Some antifungal creams can be bought over the counter from a pharmacy but you need to 129130ensure it is suitable for continued breastfeeding. you can also obtain more information on breastfeeding and thrush from www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk Tongue-tie Some babies are born with a tight piece of skin between the underside of their tongue and the floor of their mouth. This is known as tongue-tie, and while it doesn't always affect breastfeeding, it can make feeding painful as it is harder for your baby to attach to your breast. Tongue-tie can be treated easily, so if you have any concerns talk to your midwife or health visitor or contact the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212. Staying healthy You don't need to eat anything special while you are breastfeeding, just make sure you have a varied and balanced diet. Your milk is good for your baby whatever you eat, but there are a few foods to avoid (see next page). Being a new mother is hard work though, so it's important to look after yourself and try to eat as varied and balanced a diet as you can. Aim to eat healthily as a family. A healthy range of food includes: at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables a day (including fresh, frozen, tinned, dried and juiced); starc hy foods such as wholemeal bread, pasta, rice and potatoes; plenty of fibre, found in wholegrain bread and breakfast cereals, pasta, rice, pulses (suc h as beans and lentils) and fruit and vegetables. After childbirth, some women experience bowel problems and constipation - fibre helps with both of these; protein, suc h as lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs and pulses; at least two portions of fish eac h week, including one portion of oily fish; dairy foods, suc h as milk, cheese and yogurt, which contain calcium and are a useful source of protein. It's also important to drink plenty of fluid. Aim for at least 1.2 litres (six to eight glasses) each day. It's a good idea to have a drink and a healthy snack beside you when you settle down to breastfeed. Water, milk and unsweetened fruit juices are all good choices. To find out more about healthy eating, go to pha.site/healthy-eating Healthy snack ideas The following snacks are quick and simple to make and will give you the energy and strength you need: fresh fruit; sandwic hes or pitta bread filled with salad vegetables, grated cheese; salmon or cold meat; apricots, figs or prunes; Feeding your vegetable and bean soups; fortified unsweetened breakfast cereals, muesli or other wholegrain cereals with milk; milky drinks or unsweetened fruit juice; baked beans on toast or baked potato. V itamins You should be able to get all the vitamins and minerals you need by eating a varied and balanced diet. While you are breastfeeding (just as when you were pregnant) you should take supplements containing 10 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D each day. Your skin makes vitamin D naturally when it's exposed to the sun between April and September. Ask your GP or health visitor where to get vitamin D supplements. You may be able to get free vitamin supplements without a prescription if you are eligible for Healthy Start (see page 37). Foods to avoid Eating fish is good for your health. But if you are breastfeeding don't eat shark, marlin and swordfish, and limit the amount of tuna you eat to no more than two tuna steaks a week (about 140g cooked or 170g raw each) or fourmedium-sized cans of tuna a week (about 140g when drained). These types of fish contain high levels of mercury, which can damage your baby's developing nervous system. Don't eat more than two portions of oily fish per week. Oily fish includes salmon, mackerel, sardines and trout. Fresh tuna was classified as an oily fish until recently. Recentstudies have shown the fish oil content of fresh tuna is similar to that of white fish. Small amounts of whatever you are eating and drinking can pass to your baby through your breastmilk, so it's a good idea to think about how much alcohol and caffeine you are having. These may affect your baby in the same way they affect you. If you think a food or foods that you are eating are affecting your baby, talk to your GP or health visitor, or contact the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212. Drinks containing caffeine can also affect your baby and may keep them awake, so drink them only occasionally rather than every day while your baby is young. See page 132 for more information on alcohol and breastfeeding.CaffeineCaffeine occurs naturally in lots of foods and drinks, including coffee, tea and chocolate. It's also added to some soft drinks and energy drinks and to some cold and flu remedies. In the early days, it is important that you don't have too much caffeine. Try decaffeinated tea and coffee, fruit juice or water and limit the number of energy drinks, which might be high in caffeine. Helpful tips Eat when you f eel hungry, and choose healthy snacks. Y ou will probably feel quite thirsty. Have a drink and a healthy snack beside you before you sit down to breastfeed. T ry to eat a wide variety of foods (see page 31). T ry not to restrict your diet unless you think a food is upsetting your baby. Always talk to your health visitor or doctor before cutting out foods. 131132 K eep your alcohol intake low. Alcohol in breastmilk can affect your baby's feeding or sleeping. Avoid drinking alcohol shortly before feeding your baby. A void drinking too much strong tea or coffee. Peanuts Peanuts are one of the most common causes of food allergy. Peanut allergy affects about 1% of people and can cause severe reactions. Your baby may be at higher risk of developing a peanut allergy if you, the baby's father, brothers or sisters have a food allergy or other allergic condition such as hayfever, asthma and/or eczema. What you need to know If you would like to eat peanuts or foods containing peanuts (suc h as peanut butter) while breastfeeding, you can choose to do so as part of a healthy balanced diet, unless you are allergic to them or your health professional advises you not to. Y ou may have heard that some women have, in the past, chosen not to eat peanuts while they were breastfeeding. This is because the government previously advised women that they may wish to avoid eating peanuts while they were breastfeeding if there was a history of allergy in their child's immediate family (such as asthma, eczema, hayfever, food allergy or other types of allergy), in case small amounts of peanut in their breastmilk increased the chance of the baby developing a peanut allergy. But this advice has now been changed because the latest research has shown that there is no clear evidence to say that eating or not eating peanuts while breastfeeding has any effect on your baby's chances of developing a peanut allergy. If you have a c hild under six months and are not breastfeeding (for example because you are feeding your baby on formula), then there is no reason why you should avoid consuming peanuts or foods containing peanuts. AlcoholGenerally, adult women should not regularly drink more than two to three units of alcohol per day. During pregnancy, women are advised to avoid drinking. By breastfeeding, you are giving your baby the best possible start in life. We do know that alcohol passes through to the baby in very small amounts in your breastmilk. Because of this, when you are breastfeeding it is sensible to avoid drinking alcohol. If you drink alcohol or take other drugs and breastfeed, it can affect your baby in a number of ways: your milk may smell diff erent and put your baby off feeding; the alcohol may make your baby too sleepy to f eed; your baby may have difficulties with digestion and problems with their sleeping patterns. F or more on the effects of alcohol and the units found in typical drinks, visit pha.site/alcohol-unitsmore information on units, including the units found in typical drinks.Feeding your baby10 133Smoking Smoking is bad for you, bad for your partner and bad for your baby. One of the best things you can do for your own and your baby's health is to stop smoking. Each year in the UK, more than 17 ,000 children under the age of five are admitted to hospital because of the effects of secondhand smoke. Avoid smoking in the home or car, and ask your partner, friends and family to do the same when they are around your baby. If you do smoke and you are finding it difficult to quit, breastfeeding will still protect your baby from infections and give them nutrients they cannot get through formula milk. Smoking after feeds, rather than before, will help reduce your baby's exposure to nicotine. Pregnancy and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)You are up to four times more likely to stop smoking successfully using specialist support and licensed stop smoking medication. Visit www.stopsmokingni.info for further information. You can speak to your GP or pharmacist about the stop smoking medications available to help you manage your cravings and become smokefree. For more information on NRT ask your midwife for a copy of the Pregnancy and NRT leaflet. Medicines and breastfeeding Many illnesses, including depression (see page 90), can be treated while you are breastfeeding without harming your baby. Small amounts of whatever medicines you take will pass through your breastmilk to your baby, so always tell your doctor, dentist or pharmacist that you are breastfeeding. Medicines that can be taken while breastfeeding include: most antibiotics; common painkillers (but aspirin); hayf ever medicines such as loratadine and cetirizine; cough medicines (provided they don't make you drowsy); asthma inhalers; normal doses of vitamins. Y ou can use some methods of contraception but not all, so check with your GP or pharmacist. Some cold remedies are not suitable. Non-prescribed drugs - illegal drugsIf you are breastfeeding and you take any street drugs, or any drugs that have not been prescribed for you it is really important, to get the right advice. Talk to your midwife, health visitor or doctor as the drugs may be dangerous to your baby. It's fine to have dental treatments, local anaesthetics, injections (including measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), tetanus and flu injections) and most types of operations. You can also dye, perm or straighten your hair, use fake tan and wear false nails. Illegal drugs are dangerous for your baby, so talk to your midwife, health visitor, GP or pharmacist if this is a concern. Pregnancy and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) What you need to know Medicines for minor ailments Make sure the medicine is saf e to take when breastfeeding. W atch your baby for side effects such as poor feeding, altered bowel movements, drowsiness and irritability. Stop taking the medicine if your baby gets side effects. F or further information, speak to your pharmacist. Minor ailment First choice Second choice Do not use Constipation Eat more fibre Bulk laxatives that contain ispaghula LactuloseBisacodyl Senna Cough Honey and lemon in hot water Simple linctusMedicines that contain codeine (such as co-codamol, co-dydramol) Soothing creams, ointments or suppositories Ice pack Hayfever, house dust mite and animal hair allergyAntihistamine eye drops or nasal sprays Steroid nasal spraysAntihistamines - cetirizine or loratadineOther antihistamines unless advised by your doctor Head lice Wet combing Dimeticone lotionIf ineffective, then head lice lotions that contain permethrin Indigestion Antacids (indigestion mixtures) On your doctor's recommendation: medicines that reduce acid production, such as omeprazole Nasal congestion (stuffy or runny nose)Steam inhalation Oxymetazoline or nasal sprays.

Feeding your baby10Breastfeeding help and support Don't be afraid to ask for the support and information you need to make breastfeeding work for you and your baby. No problem is too small - if something is worrying you, the chances are that other mothers will have felt the same. You can get help from a peer supporter, your midwife or health visitor. You might also want to join a local breastfeeding group. It's a great way of making new friends as well as sharing the ups and downs of looking after a new baby. Most groups usually include a mix of healthcare professionals and local trained volunteer mothers (peer supporters). These mothers have breastfed their own babies and have had some training in basic breastfeeding techniques. Some peer supporters will have had more in-depth training to help them support new mothers. A map of all breastfeeding groups for Northern Ireland can be found on www.breastfedbabies.org To find out what is available in your area, talk to your midwife or health visitor, or contact the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212 (lines are open from 9.30am to 9.30pm) or go to the website at www.nationalbreastfeeding helpline.org.uk You can also get information online from the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers (www.abm.me.uk) and the Breastfeeding Network (www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk). The Breastfeeding Network runs a Supporterline on 0300 100 0210, and also offers a helpline for speakers of Bengali/Sylheti on 0300 456 2421. Lines are open from 9.30am to 9.30pm. Breastfeeding information and support contacts are available from the Public Health Agency website www.breastfedbabies.org The booklet Off to a Good Start should have been given to you in hospital soon after or before you gave birth. You can also view this at pha.site/good-startThe following voluntary organisations can also provide information and advice: La Leche League 0845 120 2918www.laleche.org.uk NCT Breastfeeding Line 0300 330 0771www.nct.org.uk The Unicef Baby Friendly site at www.babyfriendly.org.uk provides information and links to useful resources about the benefits of breastfeeding. All these voluntary organisations provide training for peer supporters. The Bump to Breastfeeding (Best Beginnings) video is a useful source of information and will give you an insight into other mothers' experiences of breastfeeding. You can view the video at pha.site/bump-to-breastfeeding 135136 What dads should know about breastfeeding The father or partner's support is vital to helping you continue to breastfeed, as they can help by: making sure you and your baby are comfortable while f eeding; e xplaining to family and friends about the importance of breastfeeding; bringing you a drink or a healthy snac k to eat, such as a piece of fruit or a slice of toast; preparing meals and doing the housework so you can concentrate on f eeding your baby; encouraging you, particularly when you are very tired or finding things difficult; protecting you from others' opinions ab out breastfeeding which may be undermining. How fathers and partners can help After the first few weeks when breastfeeding is going well, you might decide to express some milk so someone else can help with an occasional feed. Expressing milk can be done by hand or, more usually, by using a pump to collect milk from the breast and store it in a bottle. Your health visitor or community midwife will be able to give advice on this. See alsowww.breastfedbabies.org It's important to remember: breastf eeding must be well established before a bottle is introduced as some babies can get confused or develop a preference for the bottle. This is because the sucking action required to feed from a bottle is different to that used to feed from the breast; maintaining a good milk supply depends on milk being removed regularly either by breastf eeding or expressing. Long periods between expressing or feeds may lower milk supply. Knowing what helps T here are very few women who cannot breastfeed because of medical reasons. However, many women experience difficulties if the baby is not latched onto the breast properly. T he more often your baby breastfeeds the more milk will be made - it works on supply and demand. Most babies will want to feed frequently, especially in the first weeks, so some feeds will seem very close together. Y ou and your partner may worry that your baby is not getting enough milk because you can't measure the amount he gets. But if he is having wet and dirty nappies and is gaining weight at a normal rate, that means he's getting enough. Feeding your baby10 137 In fact, as your baby gets b oth a drink and food from the breast, there is no need for anything else for the first six months. Y ou and your partner may feel self-conscious about breastfeeding in public but it can be done without anyone noticing. You can lift your top from the waist and perhaps use a blanket, scarf or shawl. It can look as if your baby is just having a cuddle. Breastf eeding is sometimes used as a method of contraception. If you definitely don't want to have another baby just yet, it is best to use other more reliable methods of contraception which are suitable while breastfeeding. K eeping mother and baby together at night is important as it makes it easier for mum to feed baby in a responsive way. Breastf eeding is handier than bottlefeeding at night and when away from home as there's no need to worry about keeping milk fresh and heating bottles, plus it's free - bottlefeeding a baby costs well over \u00a3700 a year. Mum will lose weight more quic kly after the birth if she breastfeeds.How dads and partners can get involved If your baby is breastfed it is important for mum to feed baby initially, but dads and partners can be involved in many other ways of caring for, and being close to, your baby. Here are some suggestions that might be useful to new dads: c hange your baby's nappy; settle your baby after a f eed by winding him; hold and soothe your baby; play with your baby; place your baby on your bare c hest for skin-to-skin contact; give your baby a massage; carry your baby in a sling or baby carrier; talk, read and sing to your baby; take your baby for a walk in his pram; bath your baby .Your relationship with your partner Some parents worry that breastfeeding will affect the physical side of their relationship with their partner. Some women lose interest in sex after having a baby and for most couples it is difficult to find the time and energy to make love, but it is possible for you both to enjoy an active sex life. It is a good idea for mum to feed baby first so that she is more comfortable and your baby is settled so you are less likely to be disturbed by crying. Remember that breastfeeding may make your partner's breasts feel more sensitive. Some men really like the changes in their partner's breasts during breastfeeding whereas others may be concerned that breastfeeding makes breasts less attractive, but there is no evidence that any breast changes due to breastfeeding are permanent. You and your baby The more dad gets involved with caring for your baby, the more quickly he will develop a strong bond. Try to enjoy this time - it is busy and tiring but the rewards are amazing and it won't last forever! 138Formula feeding (bottlefeeding) The following advice is based on guidance from the Department of Health and the Food Standards Agency. It may differ from what you have done before if you have older children, but to minimise any risk it is recommended that you follow this advice. Helpful tips There are a number of different brands of infant formula milk available in the shops. All should meet the legal standards for formula milk, and it's up to you to decide which one to use. In the past it was thought better to stick to one brand, but there is no evidence to suggest that changing brands does any good or any harm. Choosing a formula Infant formula milk usually comes in powder form and is based on processed, skimmed cows' milk, and is treated so babies can digest it. Vegetable oils, vitamins, minerals and fatty acids are added to make sure the milk contains the vitamins and minerals that young babies need. This information will be on the contents list on the pack. Infant formula powders are not sterile, so it is important to follow the cleaning and sterilising instructions on page 139. Formula is either 'whey dominant' or 'casein dominant', depending on the balance of proteins it contains. It may also be referred to as stage one or stage two milk. Whey-dominant milk is thought to be easier to digest than casein-dominant milk, so should always be the first formula you give your baby. There is little nutritional difference in the two forms of milk, so if whey-dominant formula milk suits your baby, they can stay on it for the first year or even longer. 'Ready-to-feed' infant formula milk in cartons is also available. This is generally more expensive than powdered milk. Once opened, the carton should be stored in the fridge with the cut corner turned down. Discard any unused milk after 24 hours. Vitamin drops If your baby is formula fed, you should give them vitamin drops from the age of six months or if they are drinking less than Types of milk to avoid Cows' milk should not be given as a main drink to a child under the age of one year. Small amounts of cows' milk can be used for cooking after six months of age. Condensed milk, evaporated milk, dried milk, sheep's milk, goats' milk, or any other type of 'milk' drink (such as rice, oat or almond drinks, often known as 'milks') should never be given to a baby under the age of one year. You should not use soya formula unless it has been prescribed by your GP. If you are giving your baby infant formula, first infant formula (whey-based) is the only formula they will need in the first year. Follow-on formula is not suitable for babies under six months. Feeding your baby10 139500ml of formula a day. You can buy suitable drops at any pharmacy. Ask your midwife or health visitor where you can get vitamin drops. You can continue giving your baby infant formula when they are older than six months. If you have any worries about the infant formula milk you are giving your baby, ask your midwife, health visitor or GP for advice. Responsive bottlefeeding Hold your baby close in a semi- upright position so that you can see his face, look into his eyes and talk to him during the feed. Encourage your baby to open his mouth by gently rubbing the teat against his top lip. Gently insert the teat into your baby's mouth and keep the bottle in a slightly tipped position not too upright so that you can stop milk from flowing too fast.Learn to notice his early feeding cues, such as getting restless and sucking his hands, which tell you he wants to be fed, try not to wait until he is really crying and upset before you offer a feed. When feeding, notice when he has had enough and don't try to force him to take more than he wants. Don't let other people feed your baby, keep feeding as a special time for you, his dad and a few family members as this will help your baby feel safe and secure and will build up a close and loving bond with your baby. Using formula milk safely Powdered infant formula milk must be prepared as carefully as possible. It is not a sterile product, and even though tins and packets of milk powder are sealed, they can contain bacteria such as Cronobacter sakazakii (formerly known as Enterobacter sakazakii) and, more rarely, salmonella.If the feed is not prepared safely, these bacteria can cause infections. Infections are very rare, but can be life-threatening. Very young babies are at most risk, and it is better to use sterile, liquid ready-to-feed products for premature or low birth weight babies. Formula must therefore be made up with water hot enough to kill the bacteria - at least 70\u00baC. In practice, this means boiling the kettle and leaving it to cool for no longer than 30 minutes. Mix the formula and water and cool quickly to feeding temperature in cold water. It's also essential to make up a fresh bottle for each feed. Throw away unused formula within two hours. Bacteria multiply rapidly at room temperature and can even survive and multiply slowly in some fridges, so storing formula milk for any length of time increases the risk. Sterilising All the equipment used for feeding your baby must be sterilised. By sterilising your feeding equipment, washing your hands and keeping the preparation area clean, you will reduce the chance of your baby getting sickness and diarrhoea. 140The following cleaning and sterilising instructions apply whether you are using expressed breastmilk or infant formula milk. 1. Clean and rinse. Clean the b ottle and teat in hot soapy water as soon as possible after a feed, using a clean bottle brush. Rinse all equipment in cold, clean running water before sterilising. 2. Cold water sterilising. F ollow the manufacturer's instructions. Change the sterilising solution every 24 hours, and leave feeding equipment in the solution for at least 30 minutes. Make sure there is no air trapped in the bottles or teats when putting them in the sterilising solution once it is sterilised. Keep all the equipment under the solution with a floating cover. If you are using a cold water steriliser, shake off any excess solution from the bottle and the teat or rinse the bottle with cooled boiled water from the kettle (not the tap). 3. Steam sterilising (electric or microwave). F ollow the manufacturer's instructions. Make sure the openings of the bottles and teats are facing down in the steriliser. Any equipment not used straight away should be re-sterilised before use.Preparing a feed Step 1: Before making up a feed, clean and disinfect the surface you are going to use. Wash your hands carefully, stand the bottle on a clean surface. Keep the teat and cap on the upturned lid of the steriliser. Don't put them on the work surface. Step 2: Use fresh tap water to fill the kettle. After it has boiled, let the water cool for no more than 30 minutes. Don't use artificially softened water or water that has already been boiled. If you have to use bottled water, you will still need to boil it. The water must still be hot, otherwise any bacteria in the milk powder might not be destroyed. Always put the partially cooled boiled water in the bottle first.Be careful - at 70\u00b0C, water is still hot enough to scald. Always check that the water level is correct. Failure to follow the manufacturer's instructions may make your baby ill. Step 3: Loosely fill the scoop with milk powder and level it off using the flat edge of a clean, dry knife or the leveller provided. Do not pat it down. Step 4: Add the milk powder to the water. Repeat, until you have added the number of scoops specified in the manufacturer's instructions. It is important to use only the scoop that is enclosed with that milk powder. Using too much powder can STEP 2 STEP 3 STEP 4Feeding your baby10 141give your baby constipation and lead to dehydration; too little could mean that your baby is not getting the nutrients they need. Don't add sugar or cereals to the feed in the bottle. Step 5: Holding the edge of the teat, put it on the bottle. Screw the retaining ring onto the bottle. Cover the teat with a cap. Shake the bottle until the powder dissolves. Make sure you make up a fresh bottle each time you feed your baby and throw away unused feed after two hours. Using stored formula milk can increase the chance of your baby becoming ill.You can download the leaflet Bottlefeeding at pha.site/bottlefeedingFeeding your babyAlways cool your baby's milk down before feeding. At 70\u00b0C, it is still hot enough to scald. To cool it, hold the bottle, with the cap covering the teat, under cold running water. Test the temperature of the feed by dropping a little onto the inside of your wrist. It should just feel warm to the touch, not hot. If the milk is too cool, and your baby doesn't like it that way, you can warm it up a little by putting the bottle upright in some hot water, keeping the teat out of the water. Never warm milk in a microwave oven. It will continue to heat up for a time after you take it out of the microwave, even though the outside of the bottle may feel cold. The milk inside may be very hot and could scald your baby's mouth. Get everything you need ready before you start feeding. Find a comfortable position to hold your baby while you are feeding. You may need to give your baby time. Some babies take some milk, pause for a nap, and then wake up for more. So you might have to be patient. Remember, feeding is an opportunity to feel close to your baby and get to know them. Even when your baby is a little older, they should never be left alone to feed with a propped-up bottle, as they may choke. You should check regularly that teats are not torn or damaged. When feeding, make sure you keep the teat full of milk, otherwise your baby will take in air and get wind. If the teat becomes flattened while you are feeding, pull gently on the corner of your baby's mouth to release the vacuum. If the teat gets blocked, replace it with another sterile teat. Bottles and teats You might find it useful to have about six bottles and teats, so you can always have at least one or two bottles clean, sterilised and ready for use. You should always buy new teats for your new baby. They come in different shapes and with different hole sizes, and you may have to try several before you find the one that suits your baby. If the hole is too small, your baby will not get enough milk. If it's too big, the milk will come too fast. It's best if you can buy new bottles too. Check regularly to make sure the bottles are in good condition. If they are badly scratched, you will not be able to sterilise them properly. If in doubt, ask your midwife or health visitor for more information. STEP 5 Bottlefeeding142Bottled water Bottled water is not a healthier choice than tap water and usually is not sterile. In fact, some natural mineral waters are not suitable for babies because of the amount of minerals they contain. If you need to use bottled water, remember that any bottled water that is labelled 'natural mineral water' might contain too much sodium for babies. If you are giving bottled water to babies under six months, you should boil and cool it just like tap water. If you need to use bottled water to make up infant formula (for babies of any age), you should boil it and allow it to cool for no more than half an hour. Make up the formula feed and cool as previously stated. At the end of the feed, sit and hold your baby upright and gently rub or pat their back for a while to bring up any wind. There is no need to overdo it - wind is not as big a problem as many people think. Talk to your baby as you rub or pat. This will help them feel closer to you and get them used to listening to your voice. Don't forget to throw away any milk that is not used within two hours. Most babies gradually settle into a pattern. Babies vary in how often they want to feed and how much milk they want to take. Feed your baby when they are hungry, just as you would if you were breastfeeding, and don't try to force your baby to finish a bottle. They may have had enough for the time being or just want a rest. Feeding away from home The safest way of feeding your baby away from home is to carry a measured amount of milk powder in a small clean and dry container, a flask of boiled hot water and an empty sterilised feeding bottle. Make up a fresh feed whenever you need it. The water must still be hot when you use it, otherwise any bacteria in the milk powder might not be destroyed. Remember to cool the bottle under cold running water before you use it. Alternatively, you could use ready-to-drink infant formula milk when you are away from home.If it's not possible to make up a fresh feed, or if you need to transport a feed - for example to a nursery or childminder - you should prepare the feed at home and cool it in the back of the fridge for at least one hour. Take it out of the fridge just before you leave, and carry it in a cool bag with an ice pack and use it within four hours. If you reach your destination within four hours, take it out of the cool bag and store it at the back of a fridge for a maximum of 24 hours. Re-warm for no more than 15 minutes. Coping with allergies If you think your baby might be allergic to formula milk, talk to your GP. They can prescribe formula feeds called extensively hydrolysed protein feeds. Some formulas are labelled as hypoallergenic, but they are not suitable for babies with a diagnosed cows' milk allergy. Talk to your GP or health visitor before using this milk. Always get their advice before using soya-based infant formulas, too. Babies who are allergic to cows' milk may also be allergic to soya. Babies sometimes grow out of allergies, and you may find that you can introduce cows' milk into your baby's diet as they get older. Always ask your GP or health visitor for advice before making any changes to your baby's diet. Feeding your baby10 Some common problems with formula feeding Crying and colic For information about crying and colic, see page 166. Sickness and vomiting Some babies bring up more milk than others during or just after a feed. This is called 'possetting', 'regurgitation' or 'gastric reflux'. It is not unusual for babies to bring up quite a lot, but it can be upsetting when it happens and you may be worried that something is wrong. As long as your baby is gaining weight, there is usually nothing to worry about. But if your baby is violently sick or appears to be in pain, or you are worried for any other reason, talk to your health visitor or GP. Cover your baby's front when feeding and have a cloth or paper towels handy to mop up any mess. Check too that the hole in your baby's teat is not too big, as giving milk too quickly can cause sickness. Sitting your baby upright in a baby chair after a feed can also help.The problem usually stops after six months when your baby is starting on solid foods and drinking less milk. If your baby brings up a lot of milk, remember that they are likely to be hungry again quite quickly. Don't force your baby to take on more milk than they want during a feed. Remember, every baby is different. Some prefer to feed little and often. Constipation Always stick to the recommended amount of infant formula milk powder. Using too much can make your baby constipated or thirsty. Breastfed babies don't usually get constipated. If your baby is under eight weeks old and has not passed a stool for a few days, talk to your health visitor or GP. Water In very hot weather, babies fed on infant formula milk can get thirsty. If this happens, you can give them cool boiled tap water if they seem unsettled between feeds. Talk to your health visitor or GP if you have any concerns. Breastfed babies do not need any water. Instead, you may notice that they have shorter, more frequent feeds if the weather is hotter. Breastfeeding is the healthiest way to feed your baby. If you use formula milk, it is very important to follow all instructions carefully. It is possible to reverse a decision not to breastfeed or to re-start breastfeeding once you have stopped. Introducing partial bottlefeeding will reduce a mother's breastmilk supply. 14314411The first days with your baby How you feel You may feel tired for the first few days, so make sure you get plenty of rest. Even just walking and moving about can seem like hard work. For a lot of mothers, the excitement and the pleasure of the new baby far outweigh any problems. But you can begin to feel low or rather depressed, as your hormones change dramatically in the first few days. Some women get the 'baby blues' and feel rather weepy around three to five days after giving birth (see page 96). This can be worse if your labour was difficult, you are very tired or you have other worries. Some women worry because they don't feel love for their baby immediately. You may just need to give yourself some time to adapt to motherhood. If you feel you are not bonding with your baby, talk to your partner or a family member. Discuss your feelings with your midwife, health visitor or GP - help is available. Postnatal care If you have your baby in hospital, you may be able to return home with your baby straight from the labour ward or you may be moved to a transfer lounge or a postnatal ward where you will be with other mothers and babies. You should discuss your postnatal care with your Having a new baby is a very exciting time for the whole family, but the first few days with your baby can be a very emotional time for you and your partner. There is a lot to learn and do even if it is not your first baby. Getting to know your baby is the priority, but you will also be tired and your body will be recovering from labour and the birth.11The first days with your baby 145midwife during pregnancy so you know what to expect, although this may change depending on your labour and birth. You are likely to need quite a lot of help and advice with your first baby. Whether you are in hospital or at home, the midwives are there to guide and support you as well as to check that you are recovering from the birth. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. A midwife will be available in your community to help you look after yourself and your baby. Stitches If you have had stitches, bathe the area often in clean warm water to help it to heal. Have a bath or shower with plain warm water. Afterwards, dry yourself carefully. In the first few days, remember to sit down gently and lie on your side rather than on your back. Pelvic floor exercises can also help you to heal (see page 45). If the stitches are sore and uncomfortable, tell your midwife as they may be able to recommend treatment. Painkillers will also help. If you are breastfeeding, check with your midwife, GP or pharmacist before you take any over the counter products like ibuprofen or paracetamol. Usually stitches just dissolve by the time the cut or tear has healed, but sometimes they have to be taken out.Going to the toilet The thought of passing urine can be a bit frightening at first if you are sore or cannot feel what you are doing. Drinking lots of water dilutes your urine, but if it is difficult to pass urine, tell your midwife. You probably will not need to open your bowels for a few days after the birth, but it's important not to let yourself become constipated. Eat fresh fruit, vegetables, salad and wholemeal bread, and drink plenty of water. Whatever it may feel like, it's very unlikely that you will break the stitches or open up the cut or tear again. Bleeding After the birth you will bleed from your vagina. This will be quite heavy at first, which is why you will need super-absorbent sanitary towels. Do not use tampons until after your postnatal check, as they can cause infections. While breastfeeding you may notice that the discharge is redder or heavier. You may also feel cramps like period pain, known as 'after pains'. These are both because feeding causes the uterus to contract.Gradually, the discharge will become a brownish colour and may continue for some weeks, getting less and less until it stops. If you find you are losing blood in large clots or notice an offensive odour, you should save your sanitary towels to show the midwife as you may need some treatment. Sex and contraception Soon after your baby is born, a midwife or doctor will talk to you about contraception. If this doesn't happen, ask. You can become pregnant straight away, even if you are breastfeeding or have not had a period. Make sure you are using a reliable form of contraception before you and your partner Rhesus negative mothers If your blood group is rhesus negative and your baby's father's is rhesus positive, blood samples will be taken after the delivery to see whether your baby is rhesus positive. You may need an injection which will help to protect your next baby from anaemia. This should be given within 72 hours of delivery (see page 61).146have sex again, unless you want to get pregnant (see page 159 for your different contraceptive options). If you are breastfeeding, you may not have another period until you stop feeding, or even for some weeks or months after that. If you are not breastfeeding, your first period might start as early as a month after the birth, or it might be much later. Your body Your body will have gone through some major changes over the past few days. Your breasts Many women experience changes in the size of their breasts during pregnancy and breastfeeding. See chapter 10 for more information about this. If you don't intend to breastfeed from the start, you need not do anything. But on the third or fourth day, your breasts may be tender as the milk is still being produced. Wearing a firm, supportive bra may help. Your breasts will reduce in size in a week or so. Speak to your midwife if you are very uncomfortable. Your abdomen Your abdominal muscles will probably be quite loose after delivery. Despite having delivered your baby plus the placenta and a lot of fluid, you will still be quite a lot bigger than you were before pregnancy. This is partly because your muscles have stretched. If you eat a balanced diet and exercise, your shape should soon return to normal. Breastfeeding helps because it makes the uterus contract. Sometimes, you may feel a quite painful twinge in your abdomen or period-type pain while you are breastfeeding.Your bladder It's quite common after having a baby to accidentally leak urine if you laugh, cough or move suddenly. Pelvic floor exercises (see page 45) will help with this. If the problem persists after three months, see your doctor, who may refer you to a physiotherapist. Your bowels Haemorrhoids, commonly known as piles (see page 80) are very common after delivery but they usually disappear within a few days. Eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, salad, brown bread and wholegrain cereals, and drink plenty of water. This should make it easier and less painful when you pass a stool (bowel movement). Try not to push or strain as this will make the piles worse. Let the midwife or GP know if you feel very uncomfortable. They will be able to give you an ointment to soothe the piles. Your baby's health When your baby is born, they will have a head to toe examination to check that there are no major problems that need urgent treatment. Within 72 hours of birth, another more detailed examination will be carried out. Your baby will also have some other routine health checks and care.11The first days with your baby 147Cord care Shortly after birth, the midwife will clamp the umbilical cord close to your baby's navel with a plastic clip. They then cut the cord, leaving a small bit of cord with the clamp attached. The cord will take about a week to dry out and drop off. Use warm water to clean the navel and dry carefully until this happens. If you notice any bleeding, smell or discharge from the navel, tell your midwife, health visitor or doctor at once. Vitamin K We all need vitamin K to make our blood clot properly so that we will not bleed too easily. Some newborn babies have too little vitamin K. Although this is rare, it can cause them to bleed dangerously into the brain. To prevent this, you will be offered one injection of vitamin K for your baby, as this is the most effective way of helping to prevent a rare bleeding disorder (haemorrhagic disease of the newborn). If you prefer that your baby doesn't have an injection, oral doses of vitamin K are available. Further oral doses will be necessary. Newborn hearing screening programme A small number of babies are born with hearing loss which may affect the development of the child's language and social skills. You will be offered a simple test to check your baby's hearing. Finding out about hearing loss early means that babies and parents can get the support they need. See pha.site/newborn-screening Newborn blood spot screening (heel prick test) When your baby is between five and eight days old, your midwife will ask to take a sample of blood from their heel. This is used to test for rare but potentially serious illnesses. All babies are tested for phenylketonuria (PKU - a metabolic disorder), cystic fibrosis, congenital hypothyroidism (CHT - low thyroid hormone), MCADD, an inherited problem with the metabolism and sickle cell disease (SCD - inherited conditions affecting red blood cells). A number of other inherited metabolic conditions may also be identified, for example homocystinuria. More information For more information on blood spot screening visitpha.site/newborn-screeningFor more information on sickle cell screening visitpha.site/sickle-cell Medium-chain acyl-coA dehydrogenast deficiency (MCADD) If a family member has MCADD tell your midwife and doctor as soon as possible. They will make a record on your notes and refer you to the genetics clinic for further advice. Tuberculosis (TB) TB is a serious infectious disease that can lead to TB meningitis (swelling of the lining of the brain) in babies. In young people and adults it usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect the glands, brain or bones. Prevention is by the BCG vaccine which helps your baby develop protection (immunity) against the disease. You will be asked the following questions during pregnancy and again after birth: Are you, your family or your baby's father or his family from a country with high rates of TB? Are you likely to be living for more than a month, or travelling frequently , in a country with high rates of TB? Does anyone in your house, or anyone else who is likely to have long term contact with your baby, have TB, or have had it in the past, or come from one of these countries? If you answer 'yes' to any of these questions then you will be offered the BCG vaccine for your baby.148Your baby's appearance Your baby's appearance will change in the first few days after birth and as you get to know your baby you will notice every detail - the colour and texture of their hair, the shape of their hands and feet, and the different expressions on their face. If you see anything that worries you, however small, ask your midwife. Your baby will be examined by a midwife, paediatrician or neonatal nurse practitioner to make sure everything is all right. The fontanelle On the top of your baby's head, near the front, is a diamond-shaped patch where the skull bones have not yet fused together. This is called the fontanelle. It will probably be a year or more before the bones close over. You may notice the fontanelle moving as your baby breathes. Don't worry about touching it gently or washing the area. There is a tough layer of membrane under the skin but be careful not to bump this area accidently. Marks and birthmarks Some newborn babies are born with a swelling and bruises on the head, and perhaps bloodshot eyes. This is just the result of the squeezing and pushing that is part of being born and will soon disappear. Once you begin to look closely at your baby, you may find some marks and spots, mainly on their head and face. Most of them will go away eventually. Ask the doctor or midwife who examines your baby if they should disappear completely. Some babies have little pink or red marks commonly known as 'stork marks'. Marks on the forehead and upper eyelids gradually fade, though it may be some months before they disappear altogether. Marks on the nape of the neck can stay for much longer. Strawberry birth marks are also quite common. They are dark red and slightly raised. They sometimes appear a few days after birth and may gradually get bigger. They take a while to go away. Spots and rashes are quite common in newborn babies and may come and go. However, you should tell your doctor or midwife immediately if you also notice a persistent rash and a change in your baby's behaviour, for example if your baby is not feeding properly, very sleepy or very irritable. 11The first days with your baby 149Your baby's skin At birth, the top layer of your baby's skin is very thin and easy to damage. Over the first month (longer in premature babies) your baby's skin matures and develops its own natural protective barrier. Vernix is the white sticky substance that covers your baby's skin in the uterus. It should always be left to absorb naturally. This is nature's own moisturiser and gives added protection against infection in the first few days. Premature babies' skin is even more delicate. Staff in a specialised neonatal area will advise you on skin care. If your baby is overdue, their skin may well be dry and appear cracked. This is to be expected, as the protective vernix has all been absorbed. Don't be tempted to use any creams or lotions as they may do more harm than good. The top layer of your baby's skin will peel off over the next few days, leaving perfect skin underneath. Wash your baby with plain water only for at least the first month. Breasts and genitals A newborn baby's breasts can be a little swollen and ooze some milk, whether the baby is a boy or a girl. Girls also sometimes bleed a little or have a white, cloudy discharge from their vagina. These are a result of hormones passing from the mother to the baby before birth and are no cause for concern. The genitals of male and female newborn babies may appear rather swollen, this will settle fairly quickly. Jaundice When they are about three days old, many babies develop mild jaundice. This will make their skin and the whites of their eyes look a bit yellow. This usually fades within 10 days or so. If you are concerned about your baby's jaundice in the first 10 days contact your community midwife. More severe jaundice may need treatment (see page 177). If jaundice develops in the first 24 hours expert medical advice is required. Rubella If you were not immune to rubella (German measles) when tested early in your pregnancy, you will usually be offered the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) immunisation. You should get the first dose before you leave hospital and the second from your GP. If it is not offered, speak to your doctor or midwife. You should ensure you do not get pregnant again for one month after the injection. For more information about rubella, visit pha.site/rubella If you have previously had two doses of MMR then you will not require further vaccination. Tests for hepatitis B and C All babies born to mothers who are infected with hepatitis B should receive a course of immunisation to prevent them getting hepatitis B. Your baby will be offered immunisation within 24 hours of birth, at one month and 12 months of age as well as having hepatitis B in the routine vaccinations at two, three and four months of age. Your baby should be tested at 12 months to check that immunisation has worked. For more information about hepatitis B immunisation, refer to page 49. If you are infected with hepatitis C when your baby is born, there is a small risk that you could pass on the infection. Your baby will be tested at an appropriate time. Personal child health record (PCHR) You will be given a PCHR for the baby (also known as the red book) within a few days of their birth. This book records important information about your child. Take it with you whenever you see anyone about your child's health or development. This is your record, so do add information yourself. This could be a note of when your child does something for the first time or advice given to you by a healthcare professional.15012What you need for your baby Nappies Cloth nappies Washable cloth nappies are cheaper than disposable nappies, even when you take into account the cost of washing them at home or getting them washed by a laundry service. They are more environmentally friendly and are easily laundered in a 60\u00baC wash. You can get shaped cloth nappies with Velcro or popper fastenings and waterproof wraps. For cloth nappies, you will need: nappy pins for nappies without V elcro or fasteners; nappy liners - either disposable or cloth, whic h you can wash and use again; a buc ket with a lid and nappy sterilising powder or liquid for sterilising nappies; ab out four pairs of plastic pants that are either tie-on or elasticated. Tie-on ones will fit small babies better. Some cloth nappies have the waterproof wraps attached. Nappy services Nappy laundry services deliver freshly laundered nappies to your home and take away the soiled ones to wash each week. They supply everything you need - wraps, liners and storage bins. Ask your health visitor or check online for local services.Disposable nappies Disposable nappies are convenient to use and are available from supermarkets and other retail outlets. Nappy changing To change nappies, you will need: white cotton wool, for washing and drying - rolls are usually c heaper than It can be easy to get confused about what you really need for your baby. You can always ask your midwife or health visitor for advice on what to buy, and you may be given a list of essentials at your antenatal classes or by your maternity service. There are some essentials that every new mother needs, as well as extras that you might want to think about. There is extensive marketing and a wide range of products available for infants and babies. It is not essential to have all of these items and remember babies grow out of things very quickly. You may be able to borrow some items, and then pass them on later to another mother or keep them for a second child.12What you need for your babyballs, or plain water wipes if preferred although these will be more expensive; a c hanging mat; container for plain water; a bag to carry all the nappy-c hanging equipment when you go out - a carrier bag will do but you can get special bags that include a changing mat. Safety The safest place to change anappy is on a mat on the floor. Ifyou use a higher surface, keepyour hand on your baby at alltimes to stop them rolling off.See page 169 for how to change your baby's nappy. Bathing It is a personal choice how frequently you bathe your baby; a wash will often be enough to keep your baby clean and ensure they are comfortable. Some babies enjoy the bath and for some a warm bath may help them to sleep.You will need: A baby bath or any large, clean b owl. T wo towels, the softer the better. Keep them only for your baby's use. There is no need for special baby towels, unless you want them. Washing your baby with just plain water is recommended for the first month. See page 172 for how to bathe your baby.Sleeping For the first few months, you will need a crib, a carry cot or a moses basket (a light, portable bassinet). Your baby needs somewhere to sleep that is flat, safe and warm and not too far away from you. If you are borrowing a crib or cot, or if you have one that has been used by another of your children, you will need a new mattress. The baby on the left is sleeping in the 'feet to foot' position (also see page 168). This means that the baby's feet are right at the end of the cot to prevent the baby wriggling under the covers and overheating. 151 152You will also need: A firm mattress that fits the cot snugly without leaving space round the edges so that your baby cannot trap their head and suffocate. Sheets to cover the mattress. Y ou need at least four because they need to be changed often. Fitted sheets make life easy but they are quite expensive. Light blankets for warmth.Specially designed sleeping bags are useful for babies who are kic king off their blankets. However if using check the weight and size of the sleeping bag is suitable for your baby. Make sure it is fitted with neck and armholes, and no hood. Reducing the risk of sudden infant death Sudden infant death that remains unexplained is very rare. An infant is at higher risk of sudden infant death during sleep. The safest place for your baby to sleep is on their back in a moses basket or cot in your room for the first six months. Never sleep with your baby on an armchair or sofa. Never allow your baby to share a bed with anyone who has been smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking drugs including prescription medication. Sleeping with your baby can be risky especially if you are not breastfeeding. Speak to your midwife, health visitor, family nurse or GP if you need more information about reducing the risk of sudden infant death, or if you feel strongly that you wish your baby to sleep with you instead of in a cot or moses basket. For more detailed information on sudden infant death see page 166. Do Put your baby to sleep in a moses basket or cot in your room for the first six months. Place your baby to sleep on their bac k in the 'feet to foot' position (feet touching the bottom of the cot). Use a light blanket firmly tuc ked no higher than the baby's shoulders. Use a clean, firm, well-fitting, waterproof mattress. If using a baby sleeping bag, make sure it is fitted with nec k and armholes, and no hood. Breastfeed if you can, and put your baby bac k to sleep in their cot after feeding. Don't Sleep with your baby on an armc hair or sofa. Allow your baby to sleep alone in an adult bed. Allow your baby to share a bed with anyone who has been smoking, drinking alcohol, t aking drugs (including prescription medication) or is feeling overly tired. Cover your baby's head. Allow anyone to smoke around your baby . Allow your baby to become overheated. Leave your baby sleeping in a car seat for long periods or when not travelling in the car . Put pillows, loose blankets, cot bumpers or sleep positioners in your baby's cot.12What you need for your baby 153Cot safety Your baby will spend many hours alone in a cot, so make sure it's safe. It is recommended that a new cot mattress is got for each baby. T he mattress must fit snugly with no space for your baby's head to get stuck. T he bars must be smooth and securely fixed, and the distance between each bar should be not less than 1 inch (25mm) and not more than 2\u00bd inches (60mm) so that your baby's head cannot become trapped. T he cot should be sturdy. T he moving parts should work smoothly so that fingers or clothing cannot get trapped. Infants should never sleep using a Bab ocush, pillows, wedges, Poddle Pods, bedding rolls, bumpers or duvets. Never leave anything with ties - for e xample, bibs or clothes - in the cot in case they get caught around your baby's neck. Do not hang toys or objects that could be hazardous on the cot or bed. If you are buying a new cot, look for the British Standard mark B S 1753. Blind cord safety Looped cords such as blind cords and chains can pose a risk to small children. Research indicates that most accidental deaths involving blind cords happen in the bedroom and occur in children between 16 months and 36 months, with the majority happening at around 23 months. Making it safe To reduce the risk posed by looped cords, including blind cords, cords should be kept out of the reach of children. Install blinds that do not have a cord, particularly in a child's bedroom.Do not place a child's cot, bed, playpen or highchair near a window.Pull cords on curtains and blinds should be kept short and out of reach of children. Tie up the cords or use one of the many cleats, cord tidies or clips that are available.Immunisation reduces the risk of sudden infant death. For more information about immunisation, visitpha.site/immunisation-and-vaccinations154Out and about Spend some time looking at what is available for getting around with your baby. Think about what will suit you best. Always choose transport that allows your baby to face you and not forward to ensure you can communicate with the baby when out. You could always ask other mothers what they have found useful. A baby sling or carrier lets you hold your baby close. Slings that use knots or rings to hold the two ends of the fabric pose a safety risk because the knots can loosen or the fabric can slip through the rings, causing your baby to fall. Choose a carrier that fits you and your baby . A sling should be tight enough to keep your baby close to your body. Y our baby's face should be easily visible. Y our baby should be close enough to kiss the top their head. Make sure there is a gap, at least one finger width between your baby's c hin and chest so your baby can breathe easily. T he baby's back should be supported in its natural position with the tummy and chest against you. Choose a carrier that comes with detailed, easy to follow instructions and follow them carefully . Be cautious when bending over while wearing the carrier . Hold onto the baby with one hand and bend at the knees. Don't cook with the baby in the carrier . Your baby could get burnt. Pushchairs are only suitable for young babies if they have fully reclining seats that let your baby lie flat. Wait until your baby can sit up before using any other type of pushchair. You should also consider the weight of the pushchair if you use public transport as you might have to lift it onto trains or buses. Prams give your baby a lot of space to sit and lie comfortably, although they take up a lot of space and are hard to use on public transport. If you have a car, look for a pram that can be dismantled easily. Buy a pram harness at the same time, as you will soon need it. Carrycot on wheels. Your baby can sleep in the carrycot for the first few months and the cot can be attached to the frame to go out. It can also be taken in a car with appropriate restraints. Three-in-one. This is a carrycot and transporter (set of wheels) that can be converted into a pushchair when your baby outgrows the carrycot. Shopping trays that fit under the pushchair or pram can be very useful when you are out. Before buying a pushchair or pram, check that: baby can face you at all times; the brakes are in good working order; the handles are at the right height for pushing, and; the frame is strong enough. In the car If you have a car, you must have a car seat. This is also called a safety restraint. Your baby must 12What you need for your baby 155always go in their seat, including when you bring them home from the hospital. It's very dangerous - and illegal - to carry your baby in your arms. The best way for your baby to travel is in a rear-facing infant car seat, on either the front or back seat. This is held in place by the adult safety belt. If you have a car with air bags in the front, your baby should not travel in the front seat, even if they are facing backwards, because of the danger of suffocation if the bag inflates. To keep your baby as safe as possible: Make sure the car seat is fitted correctly . Do not place a rear-facing infant car seat in the front passenger seat if your car is fitted with an air bag. Don't buy a second-hand car seat as it may have been damaged in an accident. L ook for United Nations ECE Regulation number R44.03, or a later version of this standard, when you buy a car seat. This is the standard for new seats. However, if you have car seats that conform to a British Standard or to an earlier version of R44, you can continue to use them. Feeding If you are going to breastfeed, you will probably want: Nursing bras that open at the front and have adjustable straps. Cotton is best because it allows air to circulate. If you try on bras at ab out 36-38 weeks, they should fit when you need them. Breast pads. Y ou put these into your bra to prevent milk from leaking onto your clothes. If you are going to formula feed, you will need: Six b ottles with teats and caps. Sterilising equipment. A b ottle brush. Infant formula milk. A void buying this too far in advance, as infant formula milk has a 'use by date' printed on the package. See chapter 10 for how to feed your baby. Clothes There is extensive marketing and a wide range of products available for infants and babies. It is not essential to have all of these items and remember babies grow out of things very quickly. All you need for the first few weeks are enough clothes to make sure that your baby will be warm and clean. You will probably need: Six stretc h suits for both day and night. T wo cardigans. They should be wool or cotton rather than nylon, and light rather than heavy. Several light layers of clothing are best for keeping your baby warm. Six vests. A shawl or blanket to wrap your baby in. A woollen or cotton hat, mittens and soc ks or bootees for going out if the weather is cold. It's better to choose close-knitted patterns for safety. A sun hat for going out if the weather is hot or the sun is bright. W ashing baby clothes If you use a washing machine, don't use washing powders with enzymes (bio powders) or fabric conditioner, as they may irritate your baby's skin. Always rinse clothes very thoroughly. 15613The early weeks: you Help and support You will probably need a lot of practical help, as well as emotional support. You are bound to feel up and down and to get tired easily in the first few weeks. Many women want to have their partner around so that you get to know the baby together and have help with the work. Being together at this time helps you to start to adjust to the changes in your life. If you are on your own, or your partner cannot be with you, ask your mother or a close friend to be there. Even with help, you will probably feel tired. Here are some things you could try: Get help with the housework. K eep meals simple but healthy. You need to eat well but this need not involve a great deal of preparation and cooking. T ry to space visitors out and say no to visitors if you feel too tired or need some time with your baby. T oo many visitors in a short time can be very tiring. If visitors do come, don't feel you have to tidy up or lay on a meal. Let them do things for you, like the washing up, making a meal or bringing some groceries. Your first few weeks at home can be an exciting but anxious time for parents as you get used to caring for your new baby. If you have been in hospital or a midwifery unit, you may feel apprehensive about being on your own without staff on call to help you. The more you handle your baby, the more your confidence will increase. Your community midwife, health visitor and GP are there to support you if you have any worries or problems. Ask your midwife or health visitor for a copy of the book Birth to five , which has advice on looking after your child up to the age of five.15713The early weeks: you If you need e xtra help, ask. Friends or neighbours will probably be very willing to help you by doing things like shopping. Looking after yourself Although you may feel like your every waking hour is spent caring for your baby, it's important to look after yourself as well. Rest While you are feeding your baby at night and your body is recovering from childbirth, it is essential to get as much rest as possible. It's tempting to use your baby's sleep times to catch up on chores, but try to have a sleep or a proper rest, preferably in bed, at least once during the day. Exercise Continue with any postnatal exercises you have been shown by your midwife. You can also do this deep stomach exercise when you feel well enough.1. Lie on your side with your knees slightly bent. 2. L et your tummy relax and breathe in gently. 3. As you breathe out, gently draw in the lower part of your stomac h like a corset, narrowing your waistline. 4. Squeeze your pelvic floor . 5. Hold for a count of 10 then gently release. 6. Repeat 10 times. You should not move your back at any time. After six weeks, progress to the box position (see page 45). Besides these exercises, try to fit in a walk with your baby every day. This can help you lose weight and feel better. Eating properly It's very important to eat properly (see chapter 5). If you want to lose weight, don't rush it. A varied diet without too many fatty foods will help you lose weight gradually. Try to make time to sit down, relax and enjoy your food so that you digest it properly. It doesn't have to be complicated. Try food like baked potatoes with baked beans and cheese, salads, pasta, French bread pizza, scrambled eggs or sardines on toast, followed by fruit mixed with yogurt or fromage frais. A healthy diet is especially important if you are breastfeeding. Breastfeeding can help mothers to lose weight. Some of the fat you put on in pregnancy will be used to help produce milk, but the rest of the nutrients will come from your diet. This means that you may be hungrier than usual. If you do need a snack, try having beans on toast, sandwiches, bowls of cereal or fruit (see page 31). Sure Start Centres give advice about healthy eating plans for mothers, as well as support for breastfeeding. You can find out more about the services offered in your area by visiting pha.site/sure-start 158Your relationships After you have had a baby, the relationships around you can change. Many women find that they turn to their own mother for help and support. But your mother may not be sure about how much to get involved. You may find that she is trying to take over or that she is so anxious not to interfere that she doesn't help at all. Try to let her and others know what help and support you want from them. Your relationship with your partner will also change. It is very easy in those exhausting early weeks just to leave things to sort themselves out. You may wake up six months later to find that you have not spent an hour alone together and have lost the knack of easily talking your problems through. You both need time alone, without the baby, to recharge your own batteries. You also need time together, without the baby, to keep in touch with each other. Your relationship with your baby may not be easy either, particularly if you are not getting much sleep. Don't feel guilty if you sometimes feel resentful at the demands your baby makes, or if your feelings are not what you expected them to be. Talk to your midwife or health visitor if you are upset or worried. If you are on your own and don't have family to support you, ask a friend to help you in the early weeks. Sex and contraception There are no rules about when to start having sex again. Don't rush into it - if it hurts, it will not be pleasurable. You may want to use lubricating jelly the first time Partners As the mother's partner, you can get involved in caring for your baby from day one. In the first weeks, you can: help your partner to breastf eed by: - spending time with her while the baby is f eeding; - bringing your baby to your partner when they need f eeding in the night; - helping to wind your baby; c hange your baby's nappies; bathe and dress your baby; cuddle and play with your baby; getting specialist help and information on breastf eeding if your partner has any concerns; provide emotional support and encouragement; make nutritious meals and snac ks for your baby's mother; clean the house, go shopping and do other household chores. You may feel quite nervous about handling the baby at first but you will get more confident. Don't be embarrassed to ask for help or advice. 13The early weeks: youbecause hormone changes may make your vagina feel drier than usual. It might be some time before you want to have sex. Until then, you both may feel happier finding other ways of being loving and close. If you or your partner have any worries, discuss them with your GP or health visitor. It is possible to get pregnant even if you have not started your periods again or if you are breastfeeding. It is therefore important to use contraceptives as soon as you start having sex again. Your midwife or doctor should talk to you about contraception before you leave hospital and again when you go for your six-week postnatal check. Alternatively, you could talk to your midwife or health visitor when they visit at home or go to your GP or family planning clinic. The Family Planning Association publishes free leaflets about all methods of contraception, visit www.fpa.org.uk to find out more. Short-acting contraceptive methods Short-acting contraceptive methods rely on you taking them every day or when you have sex. T he condom. This may be the easiest choice for the early weeks after childbirth. Condoms offer the best protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you think you or your partner may have been exposed to an STI you should use a condom in addition to your other choice of contraception. Ask your GP to investigate and provide treatment. T he combined pill. If you are not breastfeeding, you can start taking this pill 21 days after you give birth. If you start it later than the 21st day, it will not be reliable for the first seven days. So for this time you will have to use another contraceptive (like a condom) as well. Don't take this pill if you are breastfeeding as it reduces milk flow. T he progestogen-only pill. If you are breastfeeding, you can take a progestogen-only pill, which will not affect your milk supply. This can also be started 21 days after you give birth. It has to be taken at the same time every day. If you start it later than the 21st day, it will not be reliable for two days. So for this time you will have to use some other form of contraception (like a condom) as well. There is no evidence to suggest that this pill affects your baby in any way. Even so, some women prefer not to take it while they are breastfeeding and use another form of contraception instead. T he cap or diaphragm. These can be used six weeks after you give birth. If you had a cap before, it probably will not be the right size any longer. You can have a new one fitted at your family planning clinic (FPC), see sexualhealthni.info/contraception for more information. Long-acting contraceptive methods Long-acting contraceptive methods last between three months and ten years. They may 159160be suitable if you think you will forget to take or use a short-acting contraceptive. T he IUD (intra-uterine device) or IUS (intra-uterine system). These can be fitted from the fourth week after you give birth. They can be fitted at your postnatal check-up or FPC when your uterus is back to its normal size. T he contraceptive injection. It is recommended that you wait until six weeks after you give birth before you are given this. It can be given earlier in some circumstances. The contraceptive injection will not affect your milk supply if you are breastfeeding. T he contraceptive implant. This contains a long-lasting progestogen and is effective for three years. It can be fitted 21 days after you give birth or earlier in some circumstances. If it's fitted after 21 days, you will have to use another contraceptive for seven days. The contraceptive implant will not affect your milk supply if you are breastfeeding. The 'baby blues' and postnatal depression As many as 8 out of 10 mothers get the 'baby blues', most often about three to five days after the birth. You might feel upset, mildly depressed, or just keep bursting into tears for no apparent reason. It usually only lasts for a few days. Around 1 in 10 mothers become depressed. This is usually mild but sometimes can be quite severe. You must get help if you are feeling sadness and hopelessness, irritable and anxious, or have difficulty sleeping and coping with even the smallest task. See page 90 for more information. Mood Matters Mood Matters Parent and Baby is a mental health awareness programme from Aware which can give you knowledge and skills to help you look after the mental health of you and your baby. It is delivered using a range of methods including group activities, discussions, video clips, and animation, music and fun activities. Mood Matters Parent and Baby lasts one-and-a-half to two hours and is available in a range of settings. Content is tailored to meet the needs of each group and the programme is available to expectant parents and parents with young children.For further information visit www.aware-ni.org Help and support If you think you are depressed, contact your G P or health visitor and explain how you are feeling. Your partner or a friend could contact them for you if you want. If you have twins or triplets, you are more likely to experience postnatal and longer-term depression. This is mainly because of the additional stress of caring for more than one baby. Just getting out of the house can be difficult when you have more than one baby, and this can make you feel isolated. Tamba (www.tamba.org.uk) can help you make contact with other mothers of multiples via local twins clubs and through their helpline - Tamba Twinline on 0880 138 0509 - where you can talk to other mothers of multiples. 13The early weeks: youYour postnatal check You should have your postnatal check about six weeks after your baby's birth to make sure that you are recovering from the birth. You may be offered an appointment to go back to the hospital or midwifery unit where you gave birth, but otherwise you should see your GP. It's a good opportunity to ask any questions and sort out any problems that are troubling you. You may like to make a list of questions to take along with you so that you don't forget what you want to ask. What usually happens Y ou will be weighed and can get weight loss advice if you need it. Y ou should be asked about how you are feeling. Y our urine will be tested to make sure your kidneys are working properly and that there is no infection. Y our blood pressure will be checked. Y ou may be offered an examination to see if: - your stitc hes (if you had any) have healed - your uterus is bac k to its normal size; - all the muscles used during lab our and delivery are returning to normal. T ell the doctor if the examination is uncomfortable. Y our breasts are unlikely to be examined unless you have a particular concern. A cervical smear test may be discussed if you have not had one in the past three years (see page 63). T his is usually delayed until three months after delivery. If you are not immune to rubella (German measles) and received your first immunisation before you left hospital, you will be off ered your second one now. If you received no immunisation in hospital you will need two doses. You should ensure you do not become pregnant for one month after this immunisation. Y ou will be asked if you still have any vaginal discharge and whether you have had a period yet. T ell your doctor if: - you are having trouble holding in urine or wind, or you are soiling yourself - intercourse is painful - you are f eeling very tired, have a low mood or depressed, or - you are worried ab out anything. Y ou can also ask your doctor ab out contraception. You may wish to c hoose a diff erent method to the one you had previously used (especially if your pregnancy was not planned). T he doctor or nurse can help you decide whic h method is right for you now. Your baby's check You will need to arrange separately for your baby's six-week check. Remember to take the PCHR (Red book). 16116214The early weeks: your baby Getting to know your baby Keeping your baby warm, fed and safe will be your first priority in the first weeks. Every second that your baby is awake, they are learning from you. Learning about what it feels like to be touched gently, the sound of your voice and your very special smell. They are learning about what the world is like and, above all, what it feels like to love and be loved. Talking to your baby It is very important to talk to your baby. You can talk to them about anything and everything. Talking to young children, even very young babies helps them become good communicators later in life. It will also help your baby build their early bond with you. If you or your family speak another language, use it to speak to your baby. It is quite amazing how babies and small children pick up and respond to two different languages. See chapter 4 for more on Getting to know your baby. Registering the birth Your baby's birth must be registered within six weeks from when they were born. This will take place at the registration office in the district where they were born. You can find details online at pha.site/register-baby If you live in a different district from the one where your baby was born, you can go to your nearest registration office. The registrar will take details from you and then send them to the district where your baby was born. You will then be sent the birth certificate. You cannot In the first few weeks, you will be learning how to look after your baby. You will start to understand them and will learn what is normal and what may be a sign that something is wrong. But the most important thing to do in the first few weeks is to enjoy your baby. Spending time with them is the best way to help them feel safe and loved.14The early weeks: your baby 163 claim benefits, such as Child Benefit, until you have a birth certificate. Many parents choose to purchase a 'long' birth certificate as this may be necessary in the future, such as for passport applications. Who can register a birth Opposite-sex couples Married parents Either parent can register the birth on their own. They can include both parents' details if they were married when the baby was born or conceived. Unmarried parents The details of both parents can be included on the birth certificate if one of the following happens: they sign the birth register together; one parent completes a statutory declaration of parentage form and the other takes the signed form to register the birth; one parent goes to register the birth with a document from the court (for e xample a court order) giving the father parental responsibility. The mother can choose to register the birth on her own if she isn't married to the child's father. The father's details won't be included on the birth certificate. It might be possible to add the father's details at a later date by completing an application for the re-registration of a child's birth. Same-sex female couples Female couples can include both their names on their child's birth certificate when registering the birth. Married or civil-partner parents Either parent can register the birth on her own if all of the following are true: the mother has a c hild by donor insemination or fertility treatment; she was married or in a civil partnership at the time of the treatment. Unmarried, non-civil-partner parentsW hen a mother isn't married or in a civil partnership, her partner can be seen as the child's second parent if both women: are treated together in the UK by a licensed clinic; have made a 'parenthood agreement' . However, for both parents' details to be recorded on the birth certificate, they must do one of the following: register the birth jointly; complete a 'Statutory declaration of ac knowledgement of parentage' form and one parent takes the signed form when she registers the birth; get a document from the court (for e xample a court order) giving the second female parent parental responsibility and one parent shows the document when she registers the birth. Same-sex male couples Male couples must get a parental order from the court before they can be registered as parents. 164Other people who can register a birth If the parents can't register the birth (for example for medical reasons), certain other people can do it: someone who was present at the birth; someone who is responsible for the c hild; a member of the administrative staff at the hospital where the c hild was born. Crying All babies cry. It's their way of communicating. Most often you will be able to find the reason for your baby's crying and deal with it. If it's not obvious why your baby is crying, think of possible reasons. Are they: Hungry? Hot, cold or uncomfortable? F eeling tired and unable to sleep? L onely and wanting company? Bored and wanting to play? Do they have: A wet or dirty nappy? W ind? Colic? (see page 16 6)When crying gets too much Some babies do cry more than others and it's not really clear why. Don't blame yourself, your partner or your baby if they cry a lot. It can be very exhausting so try to get rest when you can. Share soothing your baby with your partner. You could ask a friend or relative to take over for an hour from time to time, just to give you a break. If there is no one to turn to and you feel your patience is running out, leave your baby in the cot and go into another room for a few minutes. Put on some soothing music, take some deep breaths, make yourself a cup of tea. If you are very angry or upset, telephone someone who will be able to help. Never shake a baby! It doesn't matter how upset, stressed, tired or angry you feel. You must never, ever grab or shake the baby. This will not stop the crying. It can cause severe injury or even death. Play gently with your baby. You should avoid: T ossing your baby into the air. Jogging with your baby on your bac k or shoulders. Bouncing your baby roughly . 14The early weeks: your baby 165 Swing your baby on your leg. Swinging your baby around by the ankles. Spinning your baby around. Getting help If you f eel you are having difficulties coping with your baby's crying, talk to your midwife or health visitor. Or contact Cry-sis on 08451 228669 - they will put you in touch with other parents who have been in the same situation. If you have twins or more, the crying can seem relentless - Twinline, Tamba's helpline 0800 138 0509, can offer support. If your baby's crying sounds different or unusual, it may be the first sign of illness, particularly if they are not feeding well or will not be comforted. If you think your baby is ill or in pain, contact your doctor immediately. If you cannot contact your doctor and it's an emergency, take your baby to the nearest hospital emergency department. Comforting your baby Holding your baby close and talking in a soothing voice or singing softly will reassure them. Movement often helps to calm down crying. Gently sway or rock your baby or take them for a walk or for a ride in a car. Sucking can also be comforting. You can put your baby to your breast or give them a dummy, as long as breastfeeding is well established. Make sure the dummy is sterilised and don't dip it in honey or sugar to make your baby suck. They will suck anyway. Using sugar will only encourage a craving for sweet things, which are bad for their teeth.Importance of a warm home A warm home is important for a child's health and comfort. The World Health Organization recommends a minimum household temperature of 18 oC for adults and minimum of 20oC for children. Living in cold, damp homes can be damaging to the health and development of children in various ways. Baby weight gain can be affected as a baby will need to burn more calories to keep warm. Researc h shows infants living in a cold home are more likely to be admitted to hospital. Children in cold homes are more likely to suff er from a variety of respiratory problems, such as asthma and bronchitis. Children in cold homes have more severe colds and flus. High levels of insulation will ensure your home stays warm. Colic If your baby has repeated episodes of excessive and inconsolable crying but they otherwise appear to be thriving and healthy, they may have colic. The Period of PURPLE Crying begins at about 2 weeks of age and continues until about 3-4 months of age. There are other common characteristics of this phase, or period, which are better described by the acronym PURPLE. All babies go through this period. It is during this time that some babies can cry a lot and some far less, but they all go through it.For more information Households in Northern Ireland may be eligible for financial support towards the cost of energy saving measures. You can find out moreat pha.site/energy-wise166 If you are breastfeeding keep a food diary to see if anything in particular that you are eating is upsetting your baby. Although it may appear that your baby is in distress, colic is not harmful. Your baby will continue to feed and gain weight normally. There is no evidence that colic has any long-term effects. Colic can be very upsetting for parents. You may feel like you are letting your baby down or that you are doing something wrong. Although colic can be distressing at the time, it is a common phase that should last only a few weeks at the most. It may help to remind yourself that you are not causing the crying and it is not under your control. If you are concerned, talk to your health visitor or GP. Sleep The amount that babies sleep, even when they are very small, varies a lot. During the early weeks some babies sleep for most of the time between feeds. Others will be wide awake.As they grow older, they begin to develop a pattern of waking and sleeping. Some babies need more sleep than others and at different times. Try not to compare what your baby does with other people's babies. All babies are different, and their routines will change as they grow. Routines Babies respond well to routines. Just before or after the last feed try bathing your baby before bedtime. Dim the lights, put on some soft music, read to your baby or sing a lullaby. Put the baby to bed at the same time each night. Try putting the baby to bed before they are asleep so that they get used to being awake in their cot. You will gradually begin to recognise when your baby is ready for sleep and is likely to settle. Some babies settle better after a warm bath. Most sleep after a good feed. A baby who wants to sleep is not likely to be disturbed by ordinary household noises, so there is no need to keep your whole home quiet while your baby sleeps. It will help you if your baby gets used to sleeping through a certain amount of noise. Twins, triplets or more can have specific sleeping issues and it may be difficult for you to get them into a routine. They can sleep in the same cot - there is information from Tamba (www.tamba.org.uk) on how you can do this safely. Reducing the risk of sudden infant death Sadly, we don't know why some babies die suddenly and for no apparent reason. We do know that placing a baby to sleep on their back reduces the risk, and that exposing a baby to cigarette smoke or overheating a baby increases the risk. Sharing a bed with your baby can be risky, especially if you have been smoking, drinking or taking drugs, including prescription medication. You should never sleep with your baby on a sofa or armchair. The risks of co-sleeping The safest place for your baby to sleep for the first six months is on their back in a moses basket or cot in your room. 14The early weeks: your babyCo-sleeping with your baby is associated with a higher risk of sudden infant death. If you bring your baby into bed to feed, put them back to sleep in their cot after feeding. Speak to your midwife, health visitor, family nurse or GP for advice if you feel strongly that you wish your baby to sleep with you instead of in a cot or moses basket. They can help you understand the increased risks. If you decide to take a baby into your bed, make sure you or your partner have not taken any medicine, drugs or alcohol that may make you sleep more heavily than usual. You should never sleep with your baby on an armchair or sofa. If you are feeling tired or sleepy put the baby back in their cot in case you fall asleep. Do: always place your baby on their bac k to sleep; place your baby in the \"f eet to foot\" position (with their feet touching the end of the cot, moses basket, or pram); keep your baby's head uncovered - use a light blanket firmly tuc ked no higher than the baby's shoulders; put your baby to sleep in a cot or moses basket in the same room as you for the first six months; make sure, if using a baby sleeping bag, it is fitted with nec k and armholes, and no hood; use a mattress that's firm, flat, waterproof and in good condition; breastf eed your baby (if you can) and put your baby back to sleep in their cot after feeding.Do not: smoke during pregnancy or let anyone smoke in the same room as your baby (b oth before and after birth); sleep on a sofa or armc hair with your baby; allow your baby to sleep alone in an adult bed; allow your baby to share a bed with anyone who has been smoking, drinking alcohol, taking drugs or is f eeling overly tired; let your baby get overheated, light bedding or a lightweight baby sleeping bag, will provide a comfortable sleeping environment for your baby; leave your baby sleeping in a car seat for long periods or when not travelling in the car; put pillows, loose blankets, cot bumpers or sleep positioners in your baby's cot. 167To reduce the risk of sudden infant death:168Place your baby on their back to sleep Place your baby on their back to sleep from the very beginning for both day and night sleeps. This will reduce the risk of sudden infant death. Side sleeping is not as safe as sleeping on the back. Healthy babies placed on their backs are not more likely to choke. When your baby is old enough to roll over, they should not be prevented from doing so. Babies may get flattening of the part of the head they lie on (plagiocephaly). This will become rounder again as they grow, particularly if they are encouraged to lie on their tummies to play when they are awake and being supervised. Experiencing a range of different positions and a variety of movement while awake is also good for a baby's development. Don't let your baby get too hot (or too cold) Overheating can be dangerous. Babies can overheat because of too much bedding or clothing, or because the room is too hot. Remember, a folded blanket counts as two blankets. When you check your baby, make sure they are not too hot. If your baby is sweating or their tummy feels hot to the touch, take off some of the bedding. Don't worry if your baby's hands or feet feel cool - this is normal. It is easier to adjust the temperature with c hanges of lightweight blankets. A folded blanket counts as two blankets. Babies do not need hot rooms; all-night heating is rarely necessary . Keep the room at a temperature that is comfortable for you at night. About 18\u00b0C (65\u00b0F) is comfortable. If it is very warm, your baby may not need any bedclothes other than a sheet. Even in winter , most babies who are unwell or feverish do not need extra clothes. Babies should never sleep with a hot-water b ottle or electric blanket, next to a radiator, heater or fire, or in direct sunshine. Babies lose e xcess heat from their heads, so make sure their heads cannot be covered by bedclothes during sleep periods.Don't let your baby's head become covered Babies whose heads are covered with bedding are at an increased risk of suffocation.. To prevent your baby wriggling down under the covers, place your baby on their back, feet to foot in the crib, cot or pram. Make the covers up so that they reach no higher than the shoulders. Covers should be securely tucked in so they cannot slip over your baby's head. Use one or more layers of lightweight blankets. Sleep your baby on a mattress that is firm, flat, well-fitting and clean. The outside of the mattress should be waterproof. Cover the mattress with a single sheet.More information Buy a simple room thermometer for your baby to help you monitor the room temperature. For more information on reducing the risk of sudden infant death, visit the Lullaby Trust at www.lullabytrust.org.uk 14The early weeks: your baby 169Remember, do not use duvets, quilts, baby nests, wedges, bedding rolls or pillows. Don't let your baby overheat. Remove hats and extra clothing as soon as you come indoors or enter a warm car, bus or train, even if it means waking your baby. Feeding Breastfeeding your baby reduces the risk of sudden infant death. See chapter 10 for everything you need to know about breastfeeding. It is possible that using a dummy at the start of any sleep period reduces the risk of sudden infant death. Do not begin to give a dummy until breastfeeding is well established, usually when your baby is around one month old. Stop giving the dummy when your baby is between six and12 months old. If possible remove the dummy when the baby falls asleep. Continuous sucking on a dummy for long periods may effect tooth development or speech later on. Monitors Normal healthy babies do not need a breathing monitor. Some parents find that using a breathing monitor reassures them. However, there is no evidence that monitors prevent sudden infant death. If you have any worries about your baby, ask your doctor about the best steps to take. If your baby is unwell, seek medical advice promptly Babies often have minor illnesses that you do not need to worry about. Make sure your baby drinks plenty of fluids and is not too hot. If your baby sleeps a lot, wake them regularly for a drink. It can be difficult to judge whether an illness is more serious and requires prompt medical attention. See the section on illnesses on page 173 for guidance on when you should get help. Changing your baby Babies need their nappies changed fairly often, otherwise they become sore. Unless your baby is sleeping peacefully, always change a wet or dirty nappy and change your baby before or after each feed. Organise the place where you change your baby so that everything you need is handy (see page 150). The best place to change a nappy is on a changing mat or towel on the floor, particularly if you have more than one baby. That way, if you take your eye off your baby for a moment to look after another child, your baby cannot fall and hurt themselves. Try to sit down, so you don't hurt your back. If you are using a changing table, keep an eye on your baby at all times. How to change a nappy You need to clean your baby's bottom carefully each time you change a nappy to help prevent soreness and nappy rash. Step 1 T ake off the nappy. If it's dirty, wipe away the mess from your baby's bottom with white cotton wool. Immunisation reduces the risk of sudden infant death. For more information about immunisation, visit pha.site/immunisation-and-vaccinations 170 W ash your baby's bottom and genitals with cotton wool and warm water and dry thoroughly. For girls, wipe the bottom from front to back, away from the vagina, so that germs will not infect the vagina or bladder. For boys, gently clean the foreskin of the penis (it can be pulled back very gently). Clean under the penis and the scrotum. If the baby's skin is intact you do not need to use any cream. If their b ottom is red use a cream, such as zinc and castor oil cream which can help by forming a waterproof coating to protect the skin. Cream may prevent the nappy from absorbing urine as well, so use it sparingly. Don't use baby powder as it can cause choking. If you are using a cloth nappy , place it in a waterproof cover (if needed) and put a nappy liner inside. Lay your baby carefully on the nappy, bring the centre of the nappy between your baby's legs and then fasten the poppers or Velcro. Check that it fits snugly around the waist and legs. Step 2 If you are using a disposable nappy , put the side with the sticky tapes under your baby's bottom. Step 3 F asten the tapes at the front. Be very careful not to get cream on the tabs or they will not stick. W ash your hands before and after nappy changes. Nappy hygiene Disposable nappies If the nappy is dirty, flush the contents down the toilet. Roll up the nappy and re-tape it securely. Put it into a plastic bag. Don't put anything but nappies in this bag. Fasten the bag and put it outside in your bin each day. Cloth nappies If the nappy is dirty , flush the contents down the toilet. Biodegradable, flushable nappy liners are available to make it easy. Have a lidded buc ket ready to store the dirty nappies. You can soak them in a nappy cleanser (follow the instructions on the packet) or just store them here until you have a load ready for washing. W ash nappies as soon as possible. Follow the care instructions on your nappies, but a 60\u00baC wash is usually OK. If you did not soak the nappies before, add an antibacterial nappy cleanser to your normal washing detergent (follow the instructions on the packet). Don't use enzyme (bio) washing powders or fabric 14The early weeks: your baby 171conditioner as these may irritate your baby's skin - and the conditioner may make the nappy less absorbent. Make sure you use the correct amount of detergent and rinse thoroughly. Always keep nappy sacks, other plastic bags and wrapping away from babies and buy in a roll if possible. Nappy rash Most babies get a sore bottom or have nappy rash at some time, but some have extra-sensitive skin. Nappy rashes are caused by contact between sensitive skin and soiled nappies. If you notice redness or spots, clean your baby very carefully and change their nappies more frequently. Better still, give your baby time without a nappy and let the air get to their skin. Keep a spare nappy handy to mop up any accidents. You will soon see the rash start to get better. If your baby does have a rash, ask your midwife or health visitor about it. They may advise you to use a protective cream. If the rash seems to be painful and will not go away, see your health visitor or GP. Babies' poo (stools) Immediately after birth and for the first few days, your baby is likely to pass a sticky, greenish-black substance. This is called meconium and it is the waste that has collected in your baby's bowels while they were in your womb. As your baby begins to digest milk, the stools will change. They will become more yellow or orange and can be quite bright in colour. Breastfed babies have quite runny stools. Formula-fed babies' stools are firmer and smell more. Babies vary a lot in how often they pass stools. Some have a bowel movement at or around each feed; some can go for several days without having a movement. Either can be normal, but most breastfed babies produce at least one stool a day for the first six weeks. When to get help Most small babies strain and go red in the face, or even cry, when passing a stool. This is normal and doesn't mean they are constipated as long as the stools are soft. If you are worried that your baby may be constipated, mention this to your midwife or health visitor. What you find in your baby's nappies will probably vary from day to day, and usually there is no need to worry. Ask your doctor, midwife or health visitor if you notice any big changes, such as stools: becoming very frequent and watery; being very smelly; c hanging colour to become green, white or creamy or if you notice any blood. See 'Babies with jaundice after two weeks' on page 177 .Putting on a disposable nappy172 Washing and bathing Washing You don't need to bath your baby every day, but you should wash their face, neck, hands and bottom carefully each day. You can do this on a changing mat. Choose a time when your baby is awake and contented, and make sure the room is warm. You will need a bowl of warm water, some cotton wool, a towel and a fresh nappy. You do not need to use soap on a new baby. 1. T ake off your baby's clothes except for the vest and nappy. Wrap your baby in a towel. 2. Gently wipe round eac h eye, from the nose side outwards. Use a fresh piece of cotton wool for each eye, so you don't transfer any stickiness or infection. 3. Using fresh, moist cotton wool, wipe out eac h ear - but don't clean inside their ears. Never use cotton buds inside the ear canal.4. W ash the rest of your baby's face and neck with moist cotton wool and dry gently. Wash and dry your baby's hands in the same way. 5. T ake off the nappy and wash your baby's bottom and genitals with fresh cotton wool and warm water. Dry your baby very carefully, including in skin folds, and put on a clean nappy. See page 147 on keeping your baby's umbilical cord clean and dry. Bathing Bath your baby two or three times a week, or more often if they enjoy it. Don't bath them straight after a feed or when they are hungry or sleepy. Make sure the room is warm and that you have everything you need ready in advance. 1. Chec k that the water is not too hot. Test it with your wrist or elbow. It should be just comfortably warm.2. Undress your baby e xcept for their nappy, and wrap them snugly in a towel. Wash your baby's face with cotton wool and water as described above. There is no need to use any soap. 3. W ash your baby's hair with mild unscented baby shampoo, supporting their head over the baby bath or basin. Rinse carefully. You don't need to use shampoo every time. 4. T ake the nappy off at the last minute. 5. P ut your baby gently into the water. Using one hand for support, gently swish the water to wash your baby without splashing their face. You should never leave your baby alone in the water even 14The early weeks: your babyfor a few seconds. For boys, gently clean the top of the foreskin of the penis. The foreskin can be pulled back very gently to clean. 6. Lift your baby out and pat them dry with a warm towel. Dry carefully in all the creases. If your baby's skin is dry , gently massage in some baby oil or cream (not aqueous cream). Your baby will probably enjoy this. 7. Never leave the baby unattended on a c hanging station as they could roll over and fall off it. If your baby seems frightened of the bath and cries, it will help to talk in a low voice. Illness It's sometimes difficult to tell at first when a baby is ill, but you may have a funny feeling that things are not quite right. If you are at all worried, ask for help. You are not fussing. It's far better to be on the safe side, particularly with a very small baby. Trust your own judgement. You know your baby best. Very urgent problems Sometimes there are obvious signs that your baby is not well. Seek urgent medical attention if your baby: turns blue or very pale; has quic k, difficult or grunting breathing, or unusual periods of breathing, for example breathing with pauses of over 20 seconds between breaths; is very hard to wake, unusually drowsy or doesn't seem to know you; develops a rash of red spots that do not fade and lose colour (blanc h) when they are pressed (see the 'glass test' on the next page). This may be the rash of meningococcal disease and meningitis, which causes infection in the blood. There may not be any other symptoms. Your baby may need treatment very quickly. Dial 999 for an ambulance or take your baby to the nearest hospital emergency department. Problems that could be serious T ake your baby to your GP if your baby has a hoarse cough with noisy breathing, is wheezing, or cannot breathe through the nose. If your baby is unusually hot, cold or floppy . If your baby cries in an unusual way or for an unusually long time or seems to be in pain. If you notice any bleeding from the stump of the umbilical cord or from the nose, or any bruising. If your baby keeps refusing f eeds. If your baby keeps vomiting a substantial part of f eeds or has frequent watery offensive/smelly diarrhoea. Vomiting and diarrhoea together may mean your baby is losing too much fluid, and this may need prompt treatment. If your baby develops jaundice (looks yellow) when they are over a week old, or has jaundice that continues for over two weeks after birth (see page 17 7). If jaundice develops in the first 24 hours after birth urgent medical treatment is required. 173174If you are worried about your baby: Phone your midwif e or health visitor for advice. Keep their phone numbers where they can be reached easily. Phone your G P who may be able to advise you over the phone or may suggest that you bring your baby along to the surgery. Most GPs will try to see a young baby without an appointment, although it may mean a wait in the surgery. If you are really worried ab out your baby, you should always phone your GP for help immediately, whatever the time of day or night. There will always be a doctor on duty, even if it is not your own GP. If you have already seen yourGP and your baby is not gettingbetter or seems to be gettingworse, contact your GP again.If you become very worried andcannot get hold of your GP, dial999 for an ambulance or takeyour baby to the nearest hospital emergency department. Minor injuries units are not suitable for assessing and treating sick babies.The 'glass test' The 'glass test' can help you to tell if a rash is a symptom of meningitis. Press the side or bottom of a glass tumbler firmly against the rash. You will be able to see if the rash fades and loses colour under the pressure (see photo). If it doesn't change colour, contact your GP, phone 999 or take your baby to the emergency department immediately. Group B streptococcal infection Group B streptococcal infection is a life-threatening infection in babies. Most babies who are infected show symptoms within 12 hours of birth, but there are some who get it later. The symptoms include: being floppy and unresponsive; not f eeding well; grunting; high or low temperature; fast or slow heart rate; fast or slow breathing rate; irritability . These symptoms may be indicative of Group B streptococcal infection or other conditions. If your baby shows any of these symptoms contact your GP immediately. If you cannot get hold of your GP or midwife at once, dial 999 for an ambulance or take your baby to the nearest hospital emergency department. For more information, see www.gbss.org.uk 14The early weeks: your baby 175Getting support Everyone needs advice or reassurance at some time when they are caring for a young baby, even if it's just to make sure that they are doing the right thing. Some problems just need talking over with someone. It's always better to ask for help than to worry on your own. Do talk to your midwife or health visitor. As you grow more confident, you will begin to trust your own judgement more. You will be able to decide which action to take to keep your baby safe and well. You will also want to talk to friends, relations or other mothers in a similar situation. You will meet other mothers when you start taking your baby to the child health clinic or Sure Start. Your health visitor will explain where these are and when you should go. Your health visitor can tell you about any mother and baby groups in the area. 17615Babies who need additional care Why babies need additional care Babies may need to be admitted to neonatal services for a number of reasons, including: T hey are born early. One in 10 of all babies are born prematurely. Babies born earlier than 34 weeks may need extra help with breathing, feeding and keeping warm. T hey are very small and have a low birth weight. T hey have an infection. T heir mother is diabetic or has another long-term condition. T he delivery was very difficult and they need to be kept under close observation for a time. T hey have very marked jaundice (see page 177). T hey are awaiting or recovering from complex surgery. T hey are suffering from drug or alcohol withdrawal, if their mother has been misusing drugs or alcohol during the pregnancy.Contact with your baby Your baby will really benefit from physical contact with you, even though the environment of the neonatal unit may seem strange and confusing. Your baby may be in an incubator and on a breathing machine. There may also be tubes and wires attached to their face and body. Ask the nurse to explain what everything is for and to show you how you can be involved with your baby's care. Once your baby is stable, you will be able to hold them. The nurses will show you how to do this. About one in eight of all babies will need extra care in hospital, on the ordinary postnatal ward and also in a specialist neonatal area. Having a baby in neonatal care is naturally worrying for parents and every effort should be made to ensure that you receive the information, communication and support you need. Not all hospitals provide neonatal services, so it may be necessary to transfer your baby to another hospital for specialist care.15Babies who need additional careFeeding All babies benefit from receiving their mother's breastmilk. It is more important for sick or premature babies to get breastmilk. To begin with, your baby may be too small or sick to take their feeds themselves. You may be asked to express some of your breastmilk, which can be given to your baby through a fine tube passed through their nose or mouth into their stomach. This will not hurt them. Breastmilk has particular benefits, and especially for sick or premature babies, as it is specially enriched with fats and minerals. If your baby is unable to have your breastmilk to begin with, it can be frozen and given to them when they are ready. When you go home, you can express milk for the nurses to give while you are away. There is no need to worry about the quantity or quality of your milk. Some mothers find that providing breastmilk makes them feel that they are doing something very positive for their baby. See chapter 10 for information on expressing and storing milk.Incubators Babies who are very small are nursed in incubators rather than cots to keep them warm. However, you can still have a lot of contact with your baby. Some incubators have open tops. If not, you can put your hands through the holes in the side of the incubator and touch your baby. When your baby is stable, the nurses will be able to help you take your baby out of the incubator and show you how to have skin-to-skin contact. You should carefully wash and thoroughly dry your hands before touching your baby. You can talk to your baby as well - this can help both of you. Newborn babies with jaundice Jaundice in newborn babies is common at around 3-5 days because their livers are immature. For most babies who are getting adequate milk, the jaundice usually goes away by the first week without any special treatments. However jaundiced babies are usually quite sleepy so keep a record of their feeds and consult your midwife. You may need to lift and awaken the baby for the feeds every 3-4 hours. Severely jaundiced babies may be treated with phototherapy. Babies are undressed and put under a very bright light, usually with a soft mask over their eyes. The special light helps to break down the chemical that causes jaundice. It may be possible for your baby to have phototherapy by your bed so that you don't have to be separated. This treatment may continue for several days, with breaks for feeds, before the jaundice clears up. If the jaundice gets worse, an exchange transfusion of blood may be needed. This is not common. Some babies have jaundice because of liver disease and need a different treatment. Your baby will be given a blood test before phototherapy is started to check for this. Babies with jaundice after two weeks Many babies are jaundiced for up to two weeks following birth. This can be as long as three weeks in premature babies. This is common in breastfed babies and usually it is normal and does 177178no harm. It is not a reason to stop breastfeeding. But it's important to see your doctor if your baby is still jaundiced after two weeks. You should see them within a day or two. This is particularly important if your baby's poo (stools) is chalky white. A blood test will show whether your baby has 'breastmilk' jaundice, which will go away by itself, or jaundice that may need urgent treatment. If jaundice develops in the first 24 hours after birth urgent medical treatment is required. Babies with additional needs If your baby has additional needs, you will be coping with a lot of different feelings. You will also need to cope with the feelings of others - your partner, relations and friends - as they come to terms with the fact that your baby has additional needs. More than anything else at this time, you will need to talk to people about how you feel as well as about your baby's health and future. Your own GP, a neonatologist or paediatrician at your hospital, or your health visitor can all help you. You can also contact your social services department for information about local organisations that may be able to help. Help and support TinyLife is a Northern Ireland premature and vulnerable baby charity, visit www.tinylife.org.uk Bliss, the neonatal charity, supplies all neonatal services with a free Parent Information Guide, which you should be given on admission. For more information contact Bliss Family Support Helpline on freephone 0808 801 0322 or visit the website www.bliss.org.ukGetting information Hospital staff should explain what kind of treatment your baby is being given and why. If they don't, make sure you ask. It is important that you understand what is happening so that you can work together to make sure that your baby gets the best possible care. Some treatments will need your consent and the doctors will discuss this with you. It is natural to feel anxious if your baby requires additional care. Talk over any fears or worries with the hospital staff. Hospitals often have their own counselling or support services, and a number of charities run support and advice services. The consultant neonatologist or paediatrician should arrange to see you, but you can also ask for an appointment at any time if you wish. The hospital social worker may be able to help with practical problems such as travel costs or help with looking after other children.The loss of your babyThe loss of your baby 16 17916 Help and support If your baby dies during pregnancy, you will need both information and support. Talk to the people close to you about how you feel, and to your midwife, doctor or health visitor about what has happened and why. Sometimes it is easier to talk to someone who is not a family member or friend, for example your doctor, midwife or health visitor. There are also a number of voluntary organisations that offer support and information. These are often run by bereaved parents. It can be very helpful to talk to another parent who has been through a similar experience. The following organisations may help: The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust (www.ectopic.org.uk) offers support and information for parents who have had an ectopic pregnancy. They have a helpline on 020 7733 2653 and can put you in touch with other people who have had an ectopic pregnancy. The Miscarriage Association (www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk) can give you information and put you in touch with other parents who have experienced a miscarriage. Sands can put you in touch with other parents who have had a late miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. They also have an internet forum at www.sandsforum.org and a parents' telephone helpline on 020 7436 5881. Some women may have to cope with miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth or neonatal death (death shortly after birth). This chapter explains why some of these things may happen.180Ectopic pregnancy After fertilisation, the egg should move down into the uterus to develop. Sometimes it gets stuck in the fallopian tube and begins to grow there. This is called an ectopic or tubal pregnancy. Rarely, the egg can become stuck elsewhere, such as the ovary or the cervix. The fertilised egg cannot develop properly and your health may be at serious risk if the pregnancy continues. The egg has to be removed. This can be done through an operation or with medicines. Ectopic pregnancy can be caused by damage in the fallopian tube, possibly as a result of an infection. Previous abdominal surgery and previous ectopic pregnancy can also increase the risk. The warning signs start soon after a missed period. These are: severe pain on one side, low down in the abdomen; vaginal bleeding or a brown watery disc harge; pain in your shoulders; f eeling dizzy or faint; pain when you have a b owel movement. If you have any of these symptoms and you might be pregnant - even if you have not had a positive pregnancy test - you should see your doctor immediately. Some women have no obvious signs or symptoms at all and an ectopic pregnancy may sometimes be mistaken for irritable bowel syndrome, food poisoning or even appendicitis. Afterwards You almost certainly will feel a strong sense of loss and it is important to give yourself time to grieve. An ectopic pregnancy involves abdominal surgery or treatment with powerful medicines. It may affect your chances of becoming pregnant again. It may be helpful to talk to your doctor to discuss the possible causes and whether your chances of conceiving a baby have been affected. Miscarriage If a pregnancy ends before the 24th week, it is known as a miscarriage. Miscarriages are quite common in the first three months of pregnancy. At least one in six confirmed pregnancies end this way. Many early miscarriages (before 14 weeks) happen because there is something wrong with the development of the baby. There can be other causes, such as hormone or blood-clotting problems. A later miscarriage may be due to an infection, problems in the placenta, or the cervix being weak and opening too early in the pregnancy. A miscarriage in the first few weeks may start like a period, with spotting or bleeding and mild cramps or backache. The pain and bleeding may get worse and there can be heavy bleeding, blood clots and quite severe cramping pains. With a later miscarriage, you may go through an early labour. If you bleed The loss of your baby16 181or begin to have pains at any stage of pregnancy, you should contact your GP or midwife. You could also contact your local early pregnancy unit. If you are more than six or seven weeks pregnant, you may be referred for an ultrasound scan to see if your baby has a heartbeat and is developing normally. Sometimes the bleeding stops by itself and your pregnancy will carry on quite normally. Some women find out that their baby has died only when they have a routine scan. If they have had no pain or bleeding, this can come as a terrible shock, especially if the scan shows that the baby died days or weeks before. This is sometimes called a missed or silent miscarriage. Treatment for miscarriage Sometimes it is preferable to wait and let the miscarriage happen naturally, but there are three ways of actively managing a miscarriage: Medicine. You may be offered tablets or pessaries to start the process of miscarriage. Operation. If you have been pregnant for less than 14 weeks, your doctor may advise an operation called an ERPC (evacuation of retained products of conception). It is done under anaesthetic. The cervix is gently widened and the contents of your uterus are removed by suction. Induced labour . If your baby dies after about 14 weeks, you may go into labour. If this doesn't happen, you will be offered tablets that start labour. Although some women would prefer not to go through labour, this is safer for you than an operation to remove the baby. You will be cared for and supported throughout the labour and the birth of your baby. Afterwards One early miscarriage is unlikely to affect your chances of having a baby in the future. If you have three or more early miscarriages in a row, you should be referred to a specialist for further investigations. However, sometimes no clear cause can be found. Both women and men find it difficult to come to terms with a miscarriage at any stage. You will almost certainly feel a sense of loss. You will need time to grieve over the lost baby just as you would over the death of anyone close to you, especially if the miscarriage has happened later in your pregnancy. You may feel shocked, distressed, angry, or just numb. You may feel guilty, wondering whether your miscarriage was caused by anything you did or did not do. It is important to know that, whatever the cause, miscarriage is never anyone's fault. If a miscarriage is going to happen, there is very little that anyone can do to stop it. Some people find having something to remember their baby by helps. In an early loss, this may be a copy of a scan picture. If you have a late miscarriage, you may be able to see and hold your baby if you wish. You might also be able to take photographs, footprints and handprints as a keepsake. Some hospitals offer parents a certificate to commemorate their baby. This is done because there is no formal registration of a baby who dies before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Try to talk about your feelings with your partner and those close to you. You might also want to contact the Miscarriage Association or Sands (see page 179). Stillbirth and neonatal death In the UK about 4,000 babies are stillborn every year. This means that the pregnancy has lasted for 24 weeks or more and the baby is dead when it is born. About the same number of babies die soon after birth. Often the causes of these deaths are not known. Sometimes a baby dies in the uterus (an intra-uterine death or IUD) but labour does not start spontaneously. If this happens, you will be given medicines to induce the labour. This is the safest way of delivering the baby. It also means that you and your partner can see and hold the baby at birth if you want to. It is shocking to lose a baby like this. You and your partner are likely to experience a range of emotions that come and go unpredictably. These can include disbelief, anger, guilt and grief. Some women think they can hear their baby crying, and it is not uncommon for mothers to think that they can still feel their baby kicking inside. The grief is usually most intense in the early months after the loss. Some parents find helpful to create memories of their baby, for example they may see and hold their baby and give their baby a name. You may want to have a photograph of your baby and to keep some mementos, such as a lock of hair, hand and footprints or the baby's shawl. All this can help you and your family to remember your baby as a real person and may, in time, help you to live with your loss. You may also find it helpful to talk to your GP, community midwife or health visitor or to other parents who have lost a baby. Sands can put you in touch with other parents who can offer support and information (see page 179). Following a stillbirth or in the event of a baby dying in the first year of life, a form called a perinatal death notification (PDN) is completed by a health professional. The form, which contains no information that could identify individuals, is sent to a national surveillance programme which is run by a consortium called MBRRACE- UK. The aim of MBRRACE is to identify what went wrong and why, so that national recommendations about care across the UK can be improved for all mothers and babies. MBRRACE is funded by the Health Departments of England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. The Northern Ireland arm of MBRRACE is coordinated by Northern Ireland Maternal and Child Health (NIMACH), part of the Public Health Agency. Information gathered on the PDN document forms part of an annual report produced by MBRRACE-UK. This report allows the authors to look at existing practices and suggest recommendations for changes to practice and improvements in care in order to help avoid complications and tragedies in the future. The report will not contain any information that could lead to the identification of any mother or baby whose records were used in creating the report. Further information on the work of MBRRACE/NIMACH can be obtained by contacting the NIMACH office on 028 9536 3481 or at pha.site/mbrrace-uk 182 Post-mortems One of the first questions you are likely to ask is why your baby died. Sometimes a post-mortem examination can help to provide some answers, although often no clear cause is found. A post-mortem may, however, provide other information that could be helpful for future pregnancies and may rule out certain causes. If it is thought that a post-mortem could be helpful, a senior doctor or midwife will discuss this with you and explain the possible benefits. If you decide to have a full or partial post-mortem, you will be asked to sign a consent form. When the post-mortem report is available, you will be offered an appointment with a consultant who can explain the results to you and also what these might mean for a future pregnancy. Multiple births The loss of one baby from a multiple pregnancy is very difficult for any parent. Grieving for the baby who has died while caring for and celebrating the life of the surviving baby brings very mixed and complex emotions. Often the surviving baby is premature and in a neonatal unit, causing additional concern. For further information and support, contact Tamba (www.tamba.org.uk).The loss of your baby16 Saying goodbye to your baby A funeral or some other way of saying goodbye can be a very important part of coping with your loss, however early it happens. If your baby dies before 24 weeks, the hospital may offer to arrange for a cremation, possibly together with other babies who have died in pregnancy. If you prefer to take your baby home or to make your own arrangements, you can do that. You may need some form of certification from the hospital and they should provide helpful information and contacts. The Miscarriage Association and Sands (see page 179) can provide further support and information.If your baby dies after 24 weeks, you will need to register your baby's birth (even if they were stillborn) with the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The hospital will offer to arrange a funeral, burial or cremation free of charge, or you may choose to organise this yourself. The hospital chaplain will be able to help you. Alternatively, you may prefer to contact someone from your own religious community, the Miscarriage Association or Sands about the kind of funeral you want. You do not have to attend the funeral if you don't want to. Many hospitals arrange a regular service of remembrance for all babies who die in pregnancy, at birth or in infancy. Again, you can choose to attend if you wish. Many parents are surprised at how much and how long they grieve after losing a baby. Friends and acquaintances often don't know what to say or how to offer support, and they may expect you to get back to 'normal' long before that is possible. You may find it helpful to contact Sands or the Miscarriage Association so that you can talk to people who have been through similar experiences and who can offer you support and information. You should be entitled to maternity leave if your baby is stillborn or dies after 24 weeks. 18318417Thinking about the next baby? It takes two You will increase your chances of getting pregnant if you are in good health - and that applies to men too. A bad diet, smoking, drinking and unhealthy working conditions can affect the quality of sperm and stop you getting pregnant. You should both try to make your lifestyle as healthy as possible before you try to conceive. Chapter 5 has advice about diet, smoking, alcohol and exercise, which can help you to conceive. Folic acid Women should take 400 micrograms of folic acid from the time they start trying to conceive right up until they are 12 weeks pregnant. You can get these tablets from a supermarket or pharmacist. Eat foods that contain this important vitamin as well. These include green, leafy vegetables, and breakfast cereals and breads with added folic acid.You will need a bigger dose of folic acid that requires a prescription if: you already have a baby with spina bifida; you have coeliac disease; you have diabetes; Finding it hard to get pregnant? It can take several months or more to get pregnant, even if it happened really quickly the first time. Chapter 1 (page 10) explains when is the best time of the month to have sex if you want to get pregnant. If you are still not pregnant after a few months, talk to your doctor or family planning clinic. Holding your new baby in your arms, it may be impossible to imagine that you will ever have the energy to go through it all again! But sooner or later, you may decide that you want another child. This chapter explains how you and your partner can create the best possible circumstances for your next pregnancy.Thinking about the next baby?17 you are obese; you take anti-epileptic medicines. Ask your G P for advice as well. Things to consider Rubella (German measles) Rubella in early pregnancy can damage your developing baby. If you were not immune during your last pregnancy, you should have been offered a two-dose measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation after your baby was born. Before trying for another baby, it is important to check if you are immune by having a blood test. The blood test will measure if you have enough protection (antibodies) against rubella. Women with low or uncertain levels of antibodies can be immunised again. If you have evidence you have had two MMR vaccines in the past you will not need to have further doses even if your test says you are non-immune. Your weight Maintaining a healthy weight can improve your chances of getting pregnant. You may have put on weight during your last pregnancy and want to go back to your normal size. This is particularly important if you weigh more than 100kg. The best way to lose weight is by following a balanced low-fat diet and taking exercise. It might help to join a slimming class with a friend or your partner to encourage and support you. Speak to your doctor if you need help or advice. Long-term conditions, medicines and drugs Some medicines can harm a baby in pregnancy but others are safe. If either you or your partner has a long-term illness or disability and has to take long-term medication, talk to your doctor about any possible effects on fertility or pregnancy. Check with your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you take any over the counter drugs.Illegal drugs will affect your ability to conceive and can damage your baby's health.
