Today we are diving into what homeopathy is, how it works, and how it can help you in your life! This is a practice that is not well understood but yields some AMAZING results. What is Homeopathy? In short: It is a form of alternative medicine that works through subtle energies to kick-start your body's natural healing mechanisms. It removes blocks so your body can heal itself. A little bit more expanded: Homeopathy is a form of energy healing that introduces healing energies to our body through highly dilute medicines called homeopathic remedies. These remedies remove blocks from our energy fields, allowing our bodies to heal themselves. Our seemingly solid bodies are comprised of subtle energy fields. When we are healthy, and our body is working to maintain homeostasis our energy is flowing freely and responding to the environment. When something happens to disturb our energy fields, (be it through stress, a traumatic event, accident, injury or a viral or bacterial infection), a block in energy can be created. Symptoms are often the cause of a deeper disturbance or block in our vital force, and if that is not healed, the symptoms will persist, and if the symptoms are suppressed, the disturbance may take the form of different symptoms or \"disease\". Homeopathy helps the vital force regain its equilibrium, so the body can heal. How does Homeopathy Work? The medicines used in homeopathy are called \"homeopathic remedies\" and they are prepared from highly dilute animal, plant and mineral sources. As the remedies are diluted and succused, their energetic imprint is amplified. No toxicity remains from the original substance, but the energy is still present. Homeopathy works through the law of \"like cures like\", which means that that a substance that produces symptoms when taken in large doses, can be used in minute doses to address similar symptoms. For example, if you drink too much coffee, you may feel restless, have rushing thoughts and feel sleepless. There is a homeopathic preparation of coffee named Coffea Cruda. This is one of the remedies used for insomnia due to rushing thoughts and restlessness (the same symptoms you would feel if you drank too much coffee!) Then, we have \"the homeopathic theory of disease\" which states that a weaker similar disease cannot exist in the presence of a stronger similar disease. For example, if you have a common cold, you can get bronchitis, because it is a stronger disease that affects the same area of the body in a similar way. However, if you had bronchitis, you would not get a common cold on top of that, you wouldn't even notice it, your body is too busy dealing with something bigger. Homeopathy works in a similar way. The goal of homeopathy, is to match the symptoms that are present but at a slightly higher energetic level, so that your body things that something bigger is going on, and its able to let go of the present concern. It \"resets\" your energy in a way. What can homeopathy help with? The beautiful thing about homeopathy, is that the remedies work holistically. They work on the physical, mental and emotional level. The same homeopathic remedy that helps with your joint pain, can also help you release your anxiety. Homeopathy can help you with a variety of complaints including but not limited to: \u00b7 Fatigue \u00b7 Regulating Menstrual cycle \u00b7 Anxiety \u00b7 PMS \u00b7 Fears \u00b7 Menopausal symptoms \u00b7 Depression \u00b7 Pregnancy and Childbirth \u00b7 Sleep disorders \u00b7 Headaches/ migraines \u00b7 Digestive disorders \u00b7 Asthma \u00b7 Chronic pain \u00b7 Injuries \u00b7 Skin conditions \u00b7 Acute conditions such as cough, colds and ear infections \u00b7 Support for side-effects of medication Our homeopath, Raluca, has a special interest in working with empaths and energy-sensitive people and helping with anxiety, overwhelm, fatigue, fears, strange physical symptoms and sleep concerns. She helps people release blocked and stagnant energy presenting as symptoms and teaches how to center and protect their energy on their own. What does a visit look like? During the initial 2 hour visit, you have a safe space to talk about your main concerns and symptoms. Raluca does a comprehensive intake and asks questions about your health history, sleep, lifestyle, worries and goals. The visit ends with a half hour energy healing session selected based on your needs at the time of the appointment. During the energy healing session you get to lie down and get cozy while you receive energy meant to relax, balance and help you release what no longer serves you so that you are more open to healing. After your visit, Raluca sends recommendations for homeopathic remedies, lifestyle, tools and homework and supplement recommendations to help you feel your best. Follow-ups are approximately 1 hour long consisting of a 30 minute check in on your main concerns or current presenting concerns, followed by an energy healing session selected for you that day. Follow-ups are recommended every 3-4 weeks but you may feel the need to come in more often at certain times, or less often as your symptoms improve. Listen to your intuition!
