Integrative Medicine combines the leading edge of conventional and alternative medicine to inspire you and give you the tools to care for yourself and be well.This book is dedicated to sharing our ideas about the power of integrative medicine in our lives!Looking forward to meeting you,Georgia Tetlow, MDBoard Certied in Integrative Medicine, American Board of Physician SpecialtiesClinical Assistant Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University What is Integrative Medicine?What is Integrative MedicineThe ofcial denition from Dr. Andrew Weil, MD, who is broadly described as the \"father\" of integrative medicine, is :Integrative Medicine is a healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person (mind, body and spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle. It emphasizes the therapeutic relationship between practitioner and patient, is informed by evidence and makes use of all appropriate therapies.
