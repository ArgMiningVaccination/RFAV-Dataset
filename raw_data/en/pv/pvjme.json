It alsoaddressed the fear associated with the MHA1983/2007 in patients' minds. The reviewpanel reported in 2018, but COVID-19delayed the Government's response, nowpublished as a white paper, 3a public consultation on which closed in April.4 The government is ready to accept most of the recommendations of the IndependentReview. In particular, to utilise the frameworkof four proposed principles, namely Choiceand Autonomy, Least Restriction, TherapeuticBenefit and the Person as an Individual.Most of the proposed changes will be in thedirection of stricter criteria for detention, moreright to appeal against involuntary treatment,more control for detained patients over whocan act on their behalf and more support forall patients with mental illness in the form ofspecialist advocacy services (for voluntary aswell as detained patients). There is a markedemphasis on the non-discriminatory appli-cation of the legislation, given the evidencethat the impact of MHA 1983/2007 has fallendisproportionally on people of Black, Asian, orethnic minority backgrounds. The new criteriafor imposing detention or communitytreatment orders will require evidence of a higher level of risk to self or others. Theduration of detention will be more tightlycontrolled. Learning disability or autism alonewill no longer be justification for detention. Until now, each detained patient's 'nearest relative' (as defined in the MHA 1983/2007)had certain rights to object to or appealagainst detention, as well as a right to bekept informed. This role will be replaced bya Nominated Person (NP), who the patientcan choose. Many patients whose familymembers are not their closest confidanteshave welcomed this change. Under the new Act, neither a police cell nora prison can be classified as a 'Place ofSafety' for a person detained under theMHA. Imprisonment happened all too oftento the detriment of the patients concerned. More controversial will be the proposals for Advance Choice documents, whichwould give patients opportunities to specifytheir preferences for future management.These would be somewhat similar toAdvance Directives, but it is unclear why a different system is needed. We need to pray for the Government to make the right decisions as they draft this newMental Health Act, which affects some of ourmost unfortunate and marginalised citizens. 1.

Reforming the Mental Health Act (consultation now closed) gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-mental-health-actBMA neutralised: on assisted suicide and euthanasiaReview by Mark Pickering CMF Chief Executive Reforming the Mental Health Act giving a more personalised approachReview by Ruth Butlin, a retired medical missionary & member of the Triple Helix committee'Doctors Drop Opposition to Assisted Dying!' were the predictable headlineswhen the British Medical Association (BMA) narrowly voted to movefrom 'opposition' to 'neutrality' on 'assisteddying, including physician-assisted dying'(PAD), at its online Annual Representatives'Meeting (ARM) on 14 September. 1 The vote was incredibly close, with just four votes (one per cent) in it; 302 voted,with 149 for, 145 against with eight absten-tions. This represents just over one per centof those voting in the BMA's 2020 memberpoll on PAD, where almost 29,000responded. The poll itself showed markeddiversity, with support for assisted dyingmost popular (40 per cent), ahead ofopposition (33 per cent). However, thatheadline is misleading. 2Students and retired doctors (who do not care forpatients) were most in favour of PAD,whilst those in palliative care, oncology,geriatrics, and general practice (whoroutinely discuss end of life care withpatients) were most opposed. The closerpeople get to 'assisted dying', the more they tend to recoil. Strikingly, due to a loosely worded motion, the BMA is now not only neutral on assisted suicide (which had significantsupport in the members' poll), but alsoneutral on euthanasia (which did not). Thevague catch-all campaign phrase 'assisteddying' covers both. This slim margin is predictably being trumpeted as a major victory bycampaigners. Excellent speeches against the motion, including some by CMFmembers, made the point that the onlything this really achieves is to hand asimple, seductive soundbite to campaignersas they press on to Parliament, whereBaroness Meacher's Bill is due for debate on 22 October. Much better would have been to focus Parliament's attention on the details of theBMA's poll, with nuanced data on wheresupport for assisted dying actually lies (anddoes not lie) within the medical profession.The idea that the BMA must be 'neutral' inorder to represent diversity is patently false- delegates also spent a whole hour inclosed session, debating how the BMA canrepresent members' diverse views,irrespective of their overall position on PAD. There is much to do. But there were some clear encouragements from this year's ARM.CMF members were able to pass policy onClinically Assisted Nutrition and Hydration,on conscience and moral injury, and onreducing sexual abuse of children. It wasincredibly heartening to see members andallies working together to be salt and lightin this challenging environment. 1. BMA to adopt neutral position on assisted dying.

Data about almost every Britishresident's medical history, demographics,and healthcare interactions. This informationis estimated to be worth nearly \u00a310 billion,according to Ernst & Young. 1 In May, the Health Secretary issued a legal direction to every GP in England to uploadtheir patient records to a central database. 2 The plan was for this data to be madeavailable to private companies and researchbodies, albeit 'pseudo-anonymised'. But thecampaign group openDemocracy, fearingthis would breach GDPR, issued a legalchallenge in June. 3 Only at this point did most of us become aware of what some called the 'NHS patientdata grab', 4or more officially, the General Practice Data for Planning and Researchscheme (GPDPR). 5The subsequent outrage from patient groups, Royal Colleges, andothers caused the implementation date to be pushed back from 1 July to 1 September.That date has now been postponed indefi-nitely, as over a million people living inEngland have opted out. The government isnow about to go into an extended consul-tation process with all those involved. 6 Data mining of patient records is nothing new - in fact, it goes on all the time. It isinvaluable in medical research and healthservice planning. 7Even then, it remains controversial, despite access being restrictedand anonymised. 8, 9GPDPR would have centralised data in a way that is useful butwould have arguably weakened the linkbetween patient and GP. The principle of confidentiality is central to all healthcare. Patients share the mostintimate details of their lives with healthprofessionals, especially GPs. And we do soon the understanding that it will only beused for the purposes of our care andtreatment. This widely shared value is alsoprofoundly biblical. As the Scriptures remindus, we are not to 'betray another's confi-dence'. (Proverbs 25:9-10)The marketability of our personal data drives commerce, social media and most of the Internet. We should be wise in howwe approach utilising this data. Trust isessential, and the lack of consultation, trans-parency, and public awareness of the imple-mentation of GPDPR has dented that trust.This is another area where we will need tomaintain vigilance in the coming years. 1.

Covid vaccine controversies rage onReview by Jennie Pollock CMF Head of Public Policy NHS data grab betraying confidence?Review by Steven Fouch CMF Head of CommunicationsAt the time of writing,Westminster has justdropped its 'vaccinationpassport' plans for crowded venues in England, 1but has rolled out a voluntary vaccination programme fortwelve to 15-year-olds. 2Meanwhile, vaccine passports will be introduced in Scotlandfrom 1 October, 3and Westminster's ruling that all care home workers must be fullyvaccinated by 11 November is still in place.Workers who are not exempt needed tohave their first dose by 16 September to befully protected in time. 4 In addition to these statutory plans, some universities, airlines and businesses arestarting to make vaccination a condition foreducation, employment and social interaction. 5 While many of those at greatest risk from the coronavirus remain, understandably,anxious about restrictions easing even ashospital admissions continue to rise, 6others are urging governments to help us move toa phase of learning to live with the virusresponsibly. In a culture that sets a high value on personal autonomy, it was heartening to seehow readily we obeyed the 'Stay home'mandate in March 2020. However, there is agrowing sense that the Government is nowoverstepping the boundaries of what isreasonable and necessary for the protectionof the public. Concerning the vaccine rolloutfor children, for example, the risk vs rewarddata remains unclear, 7and many are concerned that we are putting our childrenat risk for the sake of adults. 8The fact that children deemed 'Gillick competent' canoverrule their parents' decision on thevaccine 9has also raised concerns.10 Fear, mistrust and an overload of complex information make it very hard for anyone tosee the intricacies of the vaccine debateclearly, and the harder the Governmentpushes, the more entrenched resistance islikely to become. Meanwhile, across theworld, millions are still waiting for access tothe vaccine, while the UK and US arethrowing away hundreds of thousands ofexpired doses. 11With the autumn boosterjab programme already starting,12Covid vaccines look set to be a contentious issuefor quite some time. 1.
