BOOKING .COM B.V., RESPONDENT . ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT BRIEF FOR THE RESPON DENT STATEMENT Under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et seq. , the consumer is king: trademark protection turns on whether a mark permits consumers to distinguish one brand of products from another. The Act thus denies protection to generic names for categories of goods or services. Section 1064(3) states that a mark's \"primary significance ... to the relevant public ... shall be the test for determining whether the registered mark has become the generic name of goods or services.\" The Act nowhere suggests that different rules govern compound phrases (like 2 \"Booking Company\") or domain -name trademarks, in- cluding a generic root word coupled with \".com.\" Under the primary -significance test, whether a mark is generic depends on whether relevant consumers believe that the ma rk as a whole is the generic name for the class of goods or services. Because that test requires assessing what consumers think, courts and the Patent & Trade- mark Office (\"PTO\") have long evaluated facts relevant to consumer perceptions \u2014especially survey evidence\u2014to resolve genericness case by case. The Fourth Circuit thus properly asked whether consumers consider B OOK- ING.COM, as a whole, to signify the generic name for online hotel -reservation services. The court credited the district court's factual finding that the answer was no, citing (among other evidence) a survey showing that 74.8% of relevant consumers consider B OOKING .COM a brand, not a generic name, and the weakness of the PTO's contrary ev- idence. That analysis should end this case.1 The gover nment instead urges a per se rule that a ge- neric term like \"cotton,\" \"grain,\" or \"reservation\" coupled with a suffix like \"Company,\" \"Inc.,\" \".com,\" or \"Store\" is always generic for those goods or services\u2014 even if over- whelming evidence shows that consumer s believe the mark as a whole is not generic. The government would apparently extend this rule to any suffix denoting the type of enterprise involved, like \"Association,\" \"Shop,\" \"House,\" \"Journal,\" etc. The government's theory rests entirely on Goodyear' s Rubber Manufacturing Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co., 128 1 The PTO registered all marks in small caps in this brief except BOOKING .COM . Mark registrations can be found on PTO's database, https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks -application -process/search - trademark -database. 3 U.S. 598 (1888), a decision the Lanham Act repudiated. Goodyear embodied the common -law principle that no one could trademark any name that could equally describe a competitor's products, no matter ho w much consumers associated such names with a brand. Goodyear thus held that names like \"The Goodyear Company\" could not be trademarked. Any number of producers could claim the name \"Goodyear\" (which described the process for vul- canizing rubber). The La nham Act discarded that rule by adopting the primary -significance test for genericness and by mandating registration of any mark consumers consider distinctive, including G OODYEAR itself. Turning back the clock to 1888 would confuse over 300 million Americ an consumers, who rely on hundreds of PTO -registered marks that defy the government's per se rule. The national grocery chain F OODS CO is indeed a company selling foods, just as T HE WIG COMPANY is a company selling wigs and T HE FLAGPOLE COMPANY is a compa ny selling flagpoles. L AWYERS ALLIANCE is an al- liance of lawyers, I RRIGATION ASSOCIATION is an associa- tion for the irrigation industry, and C AR WASH ENTER- PRISES is an enterprise that washes cars. Meanwhile, the national chain THE CONTAINER STORE is a st ore for containers. T HE MATTRESS SHOPPE and THE MEDICINE SHOPPE sell exactly what their names suggest. WAFFLE HOUSE is America's top waffle pur- veyor. Self -explanatory depots (like O FFICE DEPOT and THE HOME DEPOT ) abound. Aptly named marts ( e.g., BEAUTY MART) and warehouses ( e.g., S PRINKLER WARE- HOUSE ) have flourished. TV GUIDE and CONSUMER RE- PORTS have been fixtures for generations. COFFEE RE- VIEW reviews coffee; W ATCH JOURNAL chronicles watches. Innumerable PTO- registered nonprofit marks flunk the government's test: A LZHEIMER 'S FOUNDATION , 4 COALITION , CHRISTIAN COA- , CARING INSTITUTE , OUTDOOR ALLIANCE , WA- TER.ORG. The list goes on. Appx. A. The government's position would also decimate count- less PTO -registered Generic.com m arks, which pervade every aspect of our lives. Seeking a date? Try D A- TING .COM.

Compa- nies and nonprofits use these registered marks a nd others to identify themselves to millions of Americans on web- sites, in mobile applications, and offline. The PTO even registered COOKING .COM\u2014but the government now in- sists BOOKING .COM is a bridge too far. This is nonsense. A. Statutory Framework Sinc e antiquity, makers of various goods have placed marks on their products to distinguish them from compet- itors '. Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744, 1751 (2017). During the nineteenth century, federal courts developed a federal common law of trademarks. That body of law and its 5 state- law counterparts protected only technical trade- marks, i.e., marks that inherently identified the provider of a good or service. Elgin Nat'l Watch Co. v. Ill. Watch Case Co. , 179 U.S. 665, 673 (1901), abrogated on other grounds by Hurn v. Oursler , 289 U.S. 238 (1933); 1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Un- fair Competition \u00a7 4:3 (5th ed. 2018). Trademark law thus excluded from protection marks that described a prod- uct's attributes rather than its maker. Norman F. Hes- seltine, A Digest of the Law of Trade -Marks and Unfair Trade 31 (1906). Unprotected trade names received pro- tection only under unfair -competition law, typically if competitors fraudulently deceived consumers by trying to seize the goodwill oth ers had built behind their names. Elgin , 179 U.S. at 674; Hesseltine, supra , at 209- 10. The 1946 Lanham Act transformed the law by creat- ing a federal regime that \"describes th[e] universe\" of po- tential trademarks \"in the broadest terms.\" Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co. , 514 U.S. 159, 162 (1995). Un- der the Act, a \"trademark\" includes \"any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof\" that a per- son uses \"to identify and distinguish his or her goods ... from those manufactured or sold by others.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127; accord id. \u00a7 1052. The Act recognizes the follow- ing spectrum of trademarks: Fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive marks: At one end are inherently distinctive marks \"fanciful,\" \"arbi- trary,\" include made- up names like A CCENTURE or EXXON , arbitrary names like A PPLE COMPUTER COM- PANY for electronics, and suggestive names like CHEWY .COM that indirectly connote pet- supply products. \"[T]heir intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular 6 source\" of goods or services. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Ca- bana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992). Pre -Lanham Act common law only protected these \"technical\" trademarks. McCarthy, supra , \u00a7 4:3. Descriptive marks : In the middle of the spectrum are marks that \"describe[] the qualities or characteristics of a good or service.\" Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 194 (1985). The common law refused to protect those marks. But under the Act, descriptive mark s can be registered in two ways. First, the PTO must register marks on the principal register if they have ac- quired distinctiveness (or \"secondary meaning\"), i.e., they \"ha[ve] become distinctive of the applicant's goods in com- merce\" and connote a specific brand to a significant pro- portion of consumers. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f); see McCarthy, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 4:14, 15:1. If the marks have not yet acquired such distinctiveness but are still \"capable of distinguish- ing [an] applicant's goods or services\" in some fashion, the marks are \"merely descriptive,\" and the PTO must regis- ter them on the supplemental register. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1091(a); McCarthy, supra, \u00a7 19:32. Generic terms : At the far end of the spectrum are un- protected \"generic\" terms, i.e., \"the generic name for the goods or services\" as a class. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1064(3) (subjecting \"generic\" marks to cancellation), 1065 can be contested), 1127 (marks are \"aban- doned\" if owner causes them to be \"generic\"). Generic terms do not distinguish one producer's goods or services from another's. If consumers understand \"or- anges\" as the name for all spherical citrus fruits of that color, an orchard cannot register \"Oranges\" as the name for its particular specimens. Generic marks thus are not registrable. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1052, 1091(a). And marks are sub- ject to cancellation if \"[t]he primary significance of the 7 registered mark to the relevant public ... [is that] the [mark] has become the generic name of goods or services on or in connection with which it has been used.\" Id. \u00a7 1064(3). B. The Trademark Registration and Review Process 1. Federal trademark registration conveys \"valuable benefits.\" Iancu v. Brunetti , 139 S. Ct. 2294, 2297 (2019). Registration on the principal register confers evidentiary advantages in court and the ability to stop imports of in- fringing articles. Tam , 137 S. Ct. at 1753. Registration on the supplemental register, in turn, lets mark holders pursue Lanham Act remedies against infringement if they prove their mark has secondary meaning in infringement litigation, or in subsequent registration applications. E.g. , Cal. Cooler, Inc. v. Loretto Winery, Ltd., 774 F.2d 1451, 1454 (9th Cir. 1985). Even unregistered trademarks that satisfy the definition of a trademark can receive protec- tion against infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) and the Anticybersquatting Consumer id. \u00a7 1125(d). Tam, 137 S. Ct. at 1752- 53. The processes trademark registration applica- tions. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051(a)(1). PTO examiners apply the PTO's Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (Oct. 2018) (\"Examiner's Manual\") to identify generic marks. The PTO bears the burden of proving genericness. Ex- aminer's Manual \u00a7 1209.01(c)(i). The PTO deems a mark generic if the \"primary signif- icance to the relevant public is the class or category of goods or services.\" Id. The primary -significance test in- volves determining (1) \"the genus of goods or services at issue,\" and (2) whether \"the relevant public understand[s] the [trademark] designation primarily to refer to that ge- nus of goods or services.\" Id . \"The test for g enericness is 8 the same whether the mark is a compound term or a phrase,\" and requires assessing \"the mark as a whole.\" Id. If the evidence reveals that consumers primarily view the mark as a whole as the generic name for the goods or services on offer (for example, if consumers believe \"Or- anges,\" \"Oranges Inc.,\" or \"Oranges Etc.\" refer to or- anges generally), examiners refuse registration. The PTO applies the same primary -significance test to Internet domain -name marks, asking \"whether the rele- vant public would understand the mark as a whole to have generic significance.\" Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1209.01(c)(i), 1215.05.2 [domain name] to refer to\" the generic category of goods or ser- vices can the examiner deem the domain name generic. Id. \u00a7 1209.01(c)(i). The manual disclaims any \"per se rule that the addition of a [suffix, like \".com\"] to an otherwise generic term can never under any circumstances operate to create a registrable mark.\" Id. \u00a7 1215.05. As noted, supra p. 6, the PTO places on the supple- mental register merely descriptive marks, i.e., marks that are non -generic because they are capable of distinguish- ing an applicant's products but are not yet associated with a single source. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1091(a). The PTO registered many marks in Appendix A on the supplemental register, meaning the PTO found them not generic. 2 Domain names are strings of unique charac ters used to identify In- ternet websites; they commonly include a word or phrase followed by a suffix such as \".com,\" \".gov,\" or \".edu.\" Those suffixes are called the \"top level domains\" (\"TLD\"). Over 1,500 such suffixes exist. While only certain entitie s can register some suffixes (like \".gov\"), \".com,\" \".net,\" and \".org\" al ., Intellec- tual Property Strategies for the 21st Century Corporation 88 (2016). 9 If the mark is descriptive and has attained secondary meaning, i.e., consumers identify the mark with a single brand, the PTO registers the mark on the principal regis- ter. Examiner's Manual \u00a7\u00a7 1209.02, Primary meaning are analytically dis- tinct; a mark may clear the primary -significance test and avoid rejection on genericness grounds, but must also have secondar y meaning to be on the principal register. 2. Applicants may appeal adverse decisions to the Trademark Trial & Appeal Board (\"TTAB\"), which re- views the same record and assesses the deci- may challenge adverse TTAB decisions in the Federal Circuit or federal district court. Before the Federal Circuit, applicants proceed \"on the record before the [PTO].\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a)(4). The Federal Circuit \"give[s] plenary review to th e TTAB's le- gal conclusions,\" but \"review[s] its the TTAB's genericness ... mark to the relevant public\" is a factual question. Id. Proceeding to district court lets applicants introduce new evidence and provides de novo review of law and facts. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b)(1); Swatch AG v. Beehive Wholesale, LLC , 739 F.3d 150, 155 (4th Cir. 2014). The losing party may appeal to the regional circuits, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, which review district court factfinding \"for , 739 F.3d at 154- 55. 10 C. Factual a nd Procedural Background 1. Respondent Booking.com began in 1996 as a Dutch company with a corresponding website called Book- ings.nl. As its success grew, its scope expanded; to reflect its global reach, the company in 2005 changed its name to Booking.com , purchased the domain name \"Book- ing.com,\" and consolidated operations within that brand. As part of that consolidation, respondent purchased the BOOKINGS .COM trademark, which the PTO registered in 2004 on the supplemental register for online advertising services (including advertising of booking services).

Respondent's efforts have fostered strong brand recognition, prom pting 85 foreign jurisdictions to register 11 BOOKING .COM as a trademark. JA140 -42. Those jurisdic- tions include the European Community, the United King- dom, Australia, and New Zealand \u2014which, like the United States, refuse to register marks that consumers do not consider distinctive. 2017 O.J.

In 2011 and 2012, respondent filed four registra- tion a pplications for BOOKING .COM and stylized versions of the mark in connection with hotel -reservation and other services. Pet.App.4a. The examiner refused registration on the principal register, finding the marks merely de- scriptive. Pet.App.50a. Responden t produced evidence that BOOKING .COM \"had acquired distinctiveness\" as a brand. The examiner then deemed B OOKING .COM generic and refused registration. Pet.App.50a. The TTAB affirmed, reasoning that BOOKING .COM was generic because consumers would understa nd its \"primary significance\" as \"an lodgings\" generally. JA312; JA347. The TTAB relied on dictionary definitions of \"booking\" as a noun meaning \"a reservation for a room in a hotel\" or \"the service of ar- ranging reservation s for hotel rooms.\" JA331. The TTAB also relied on dictionary definitions of \".com\" as a com- mercial website, JA336; respondent's website describing \"booking\" services; other websites and news articles; and domain names containing \"booking\" and \".com\" to sell reservations ( e.g., hotelbooking.com). JA319 -26. Respondent sought review of the TTAB's decision in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and introduced additional evidence that consumers un- derstand BOOKING .COM as a brand name, not a generic term. 12 First, respondent introduced the report of statistician Hal Poret, whom the TTAB, the Federal Trade Commis- sion, and courts have accepted as an expert in survey re- search. JA35; JA41. Poret designed an industry -stand- ard \"Teflon survey\" to determine whether consumers per- ceive BOOKING .COM as a generic term or brand. The sur- vey presented various marks to \"consumers who search for or make hotel or travel arrangements online\" and asked them whether each mark is a generic term or brand. JA43. Poret controlled for \"concerns that survey re- spondents might answer that any DOT -COM name is a brand\" by including Washingmachine.com, which has no associated brand, as a control. JA43. While 30% of re- spondents identified Washingmachine.com as a bran d, \"74.8% ... identified B OOKING to be JA53. Poret concluded: \"[T]hese results strongly estab- lish that BOOKING .COM is not perceived by consumers to be a generic term.\" JA54. Second, respondent introduced the report of Dr. Sa- rah-Jane Les lie, a Princeton professor with expertise in linguistics. Leslie explained that under basic linguistics principles, even if \"booking\" and \".com\" were generic terms in isolation, consumers would not necessarily un- derstand BOOKING .COM to refer to all hotel -reservation services. JA138 -39. And just because \"booking.com\" ap- pears within terms like \"dubai- travelbooking.com\" does not show that consumers consider BOOKING .COM to mean all hotel -reservation services. JA139. Finally, respondent introduced evidence of its reputa- tion, marketing, and commercial success to demonstrate that consumers do not view B OOKING .COM as a generic name for hotel -reservation services but rather identify it with respondent's brand. E.g. , JA17 -18. 13 3. The district court held that B OOK ING.COM is not generic for hotel -reservation services, and further held that BOOKING .COM is entitled to registration on the prin- cipal register because consumers associate it with re- spondent specifically.3 The court first determined that B OOKING .COM is not generic. Like the TTAB, the court looked to whether \"the primary significance of the mark to the relevant public is to identify the class of product or the service to which the mark relates.\" Pet.App.60a. Like the TTAB, the court defined the relevant public as \"consumers who use travel, tour, and hotel reservation services offered via the inter- net or in person.\" Pet.App.63a. The court agreed that \"by itself, the word 'booking' is generic,\" Pet.App.67a, but adding \".com\" made a difference because a unique domain name \"is generally a descriptive mark.\" Pet.App.74a. Rather than relying on a presumption that domain names are descriptive, the court examined the evidence and concluded that consumers would not primarily under- stand BOOKING .COM to signify al l hotel -reservation ser- vices. The court emphasized \"the absence of evidence that consumers or producers use the term 'booking.com' to de- scribe\" booking services generically. Pet.App.85a. The court found respondent's survey \"persuasive evidence that the consuming public understands B OOKING .COM to be a specific brand, not a generic name for online booking services.\" Pet.App.88a. Because the court determined that B OOKING .COM is descriptive, the court next considered whether consumers associate the BOOK ING.COM mark with respondent, such that the mark is sufficiently distinctive to register, i.e., has 3 The court rejected registration of B OOKING .COM for general travel services. That ruling is not before the Court. 14 secondary meaning. Pet.App.96a. The court found re- spondent's evidence \"more than sufficient\" on this score. Pet.App.116a. 4. The Fourth Circuit affirmed in a divided opinion. The government \"concede[d] that if B OOKING .COM may properly be deemed descriptive, the district court's find- ing that it has acquired secondary meaning was war- ranted.\" Pet.App.8a. The question on appeal was thus \"whether the distric t court erred in finding that B OOK- ING.COM is not generic,\" Pet.A pp.8a, \"a question of fact ... to which the district court ... is accorded great deference.\" Pet.App.13a. The Fourth Circuit resolved that question using the primary -significance test. The court applied that test by (1) \"identify[ing] the class of product or service to which the use of the mark is relevant,\" (2) \"identify[ing] the rel- evant consuming public,\" and (3) determining whether the \"primary significance of the mark to the relevant public\" is the general class of product or service. Pet.App.9a -10a & n.6. Only the third question \u2014\"the public's understand- ing of what the term BOOKING .COM primarily refers to\" \u2014 was disputed. Pet.App.11a. The Fourth Circuit held that the district court did not clearly err \"in finding that the PTO failed to satisfy its burden of proving that the relevant public understood BOOKING .COM, taken as a whole , to refer to general online hotel reservation services rather than Booking.com the company.\" Pet.App.12a. The court declined to adopt the district court's conclusion that a unique domain name \"generally has source -identifying significance.\" Pet.App.20a & n.9. Instead, the court relied on \"the PTO's lack of evidence demonstrating that the public uses 'booking.com ' generically.\" Pet.App.13a. Further, the PTO no longer \"contest[ed] the validity\" of respondent's 15 Teflon survey showing that consumers do not understand BOOKING .COM as a generic term for hotel -reservation ser- vices. Pet.App.16a. The court stressed the \"dearth of ev- idence\" that B OOKING .COM was in common use or com- monly understood as generic before respondent took the name as its brand. Pet.App.17a. The Fourth Circuit rejected the government's argu- ment that, under Goodyear , a generic term plus \"'.com' is analytically indistinct from 'company,'\" and can never be a trademark. Pet.App.18a -19a. The court noted that Goodyear pre-dated the Lanham Act and \"crucially, did not apply the primary significance test.\" Pet.App.19a. The court observed that every ot her circuit has rejected the PTO's per se rule against trademarking generic terms coupled with \".com.\" Pet.App.19a, 22a. Judge Wynn concurred in part and dissented in part. He \"agree[d] with much of the analysis in the majority opinion,\" including its rejection of the government's \" per se rule against protecting\" Generic.com names. Pet.App.29a & n.2. He dissented because he believed the district court's statement that a domain name \"generally has source -identifying significance\" improperly colored its factfinding. Pet.App.32a. 5. The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. Pet. App.225a -26a. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT I.A. The 1946 Lanham Act prescribes one test only for whether a mark is generic: whether its \"primary signifi- cance ... to the relevant public \" is the category of goods or services to which the mark applies. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(3). This test asks whether relevant consumers understand the mark as a whole as the name of a class of goods or services, based on empirical evidence. While the primary -16 significance test appears in the Act's cancellation section, that test governs initial registration, too. Since 1946, courts and the PTO have interpreted the Act as mandating the primary -significance test for regis- trations and cancellations alike, and for all types of marks \u2014whether they are single words, combined terms like WAFFLE HOUSE , or domain names like WEATHER .COM. Congress codified the primary -signifi- cance test in 1984 to preserve that established meaning and to overrule a single, aberrant Ninth Circuit decision. B. By making consumer perceptions the key to gener- icness, the primary -significance test vindicates the Act's objectives. The test helps consumers navigate the mar- ketplace by ruling out marks that do not distinguish be- tween competitors w hile protecting those that do. The test likewise encourages mark owners to build goodwill behind particular brands. Conferring trademark protec- tion on domain -name marks is particularly important; merely owning a domain name provides little protection against the rampant diversion, confusion, and fraud that the Internet makes possible. C. Because the primary -significance test looks to how consumers perceive a mark as a whole, courts and the PTO have long considered survey evidence the best evi- dence of co nsumers' beliefs. The government's objections to survey evidence are nonsensical and would upend courts' and the PTO's longstanding approach to generic- ness. D. The Fourth Circuit followed the primary -signifi- cance test to a T and deemed B OOKING .COM non-generic. The court properly credited the district court's factual de- termination that respondent's survey evidence\u2014which showed that consumers overwhelmingly do not consider 17 BOOKING .COM the generic name for hotel -reservation ser- vices \u2014was more persuasive than the PTO's evidence. II. The Lanham Act forecloses the government's per se rule that a generic term coupled with \"Company,\" \"Inc.,\" \".com,\" or similar suffixes can never be trade- marked. A. The government's position rests on this Court's 1888 Goodyear decision, which grouped \"Goodyear's Rub- and \"Lackawanna coal\" and held that none of these terms could be trademarks. None of those terms, Goodyear reasoned, would pinpoint the exact maker of those goods. Any competitor could claim to produce those same products with equal truth. Adding \"Company\" made no difference because any competitor could conceiv- ably claim that corporate designation, too. The Lan ham Act rejected every premise underpin- ning the government's per se rule. The Act repudiated the common -law rule protecting only technical trademarks that only one maker could truthfully claim, and instead extended trademark protection to descriptive term s. The Act tethered trademark protection to consumers' percep- tions of particular marks. The Act did that by mandating the fact- specific primary -significance test for genericness, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(3), and by tying registration to whether consumers could or do associate a mark with a particular brand, id. \u00a7\u00a7 1052, 1091(a). Further, the Act mandated consideration of how con- sumers view the mark as a whole, thus rejecting any per se assumption that adding suffixes like \"Company,\" \"Inc.,\" or \".com\" to a generi c term can never add distinc- tiveness. This Court has recognized that the Act overrode 18 related per se common -law rules. Nothing suggests that Goodyear alone survived. B. The government's per se rule would threaten with cancellation hundreds of Generic C ompany and Ge- neric.com marks that the PTO has registered for decades. See Appx. A. And the government's rule has no logical stopping point. If synonyms for corporate structure never add significance to a generic term, every \"generic\" Association, Partne rship, Society, Alliance, Group, or Foundation mark could be cancelled anytime. If \".com\" adds nothing, neither do \".org,\" \".net,\" \".biz,\" and similar suffixes. The government has grouped \"Store\" alongside \"Company\" and \".com,\" block. Such cancellations would squander billions of dollars that some of the country's most famous brands have in- vested in cultivating consumer goodwill. Suc h cancella- tions would also risk massive consumer confusion by elim- inating trademark protection for marks consumers de- pend on to differentiate among competing products, and would open the floodgates to schemes to defraud and de- ceive consumers. This Court should reject the govern- ment's per se rule, which has never been the law under the Lanham Act. ARGUMENT I. THE LANHAM ACT DOES NOT BAR GE- NERIC .COM TRADEMARKS The Lanham Act mandates that the primary -signifi- cance test governs whether a phrase is generic and can not serve as a trademark. That test requires ascertaining, based on evidence, whether relevant consumers primarily understand the mark as a whole as the name of a category 19 of goods or services. Sometimes the evidence will estab- lish that a Generic.com mar k is generic; sometimes not. Applying the primary -significance test makes this a straightforward case. The petition presented solely the question whether the government's per se rule applies; the government never argued that B OOKING .COM is ge- neric under the primary -significance test. And, as the Fourth Circuit held, the district court did not clearly err in crediting ample record evidence that consumers do not perceive BOOKING .COM as a generic term for all online ho- tel-reservation services. A. The Act Mandates the Primary- Significance Test T o Assess the Genericness of All Marks, Including Do- main Names Section 1064(3) states that \"the primary significance\" of the mark \"to the relevant public ... shall be the test\" for genericness. This fact- based test applies both to initial registration determinations and to cancellation, and to all types of marks. Nothing in the Act permits a different rule for domain names. 1. Statutory interpretation \"begins with the statutory text,\" Nat'l Ass'n of o f Def. , 138 S. Ct. 617, 631 (2018), and the text resolves this case. Section 1064(3) provides: \"The primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public rather than purchaser moti- vation shall be the test for determining whether the reg- ister ed mark has become the generic name of goods or services on or in connection with which it has been used.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(3). Section 1064(3) appears in the provision governing cancellation, but the same test for genericness necessarily controls initial registration determinations regarding whether a mark is generic in the first place. Section 20 1064(3) authorizes cancellation of generic marks any time after registration if the mark \"has become the generic name\" for a class of products, including if the mark was generic at the time of initial registration. It would make no sense for the Act to embrace a different, unstated test prohibiting initial registration of generic names, yet to provide for immediate cancellation of generic marks that fail the primary -significance test. Indeed, while the gov- ernment (at 37 -38) suggests the tests might differ, it con- cludes (at 43) that the primary -significance test governs the \"usual\" genericness inquiry for initial registration, without attempting to reconcile this discrepancy. \"[T]here is no reason not to apply [section 1064(3)'s test for genericness] with equal force to the initial attempt to register an allegedly generic term.\" McCarthy, supra , \u00a7 12:57. We know of no case suggesting that the test for initial registration and cancellation could differ. Courts and the PTO consistently interpret section 1064(3) as mandating application of the primary -significance test in the registration context. E.g., BellSouth Corp. v. DataNational Corp., 60 111 U.S.P.Q.2d 1581, 1600 (T.T.A.B. 2014). More broadly, every circuit to consider the issue has con- cluded that \"there is only one legal standard for generic- ness ... whether the public understands the mark, as a whole , to refer to\" the \"genus of goods or services at is- sue.\" Princeton Vanguard, LLC v. Frito-Lay N. Am., Inc., 786 F.3d 960, 966 (Fed. Cir. 2015).4 4 in determining genericness\" \"what does the public think the word connotes \u2014the generic name of the product or a mark indicating merely one source of that product?\"). 21 Finally, in determining \"[t]he primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public,\" the Act re- quires consideration of the mark as a whole. A \"mark\" includes \"any tradem ark,\" e.g., \"any word ... of words that \"identify and one maker's products from others'. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127. Because combined words can mean something different from each word in isolation, the Act mandates assessing the mark in its entirety. Dissecting the mark into its constituent sub- parts is the test for genericness \"[t]he primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public,\" the Lanham Act in 1984 codified the primary -significance test that courts had applied since the Act's inception to determine genericness. See Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 404 (2010) (courts \"look to the doctrine devel- oped\" prio r to the amendment \"to ascertain the meaning of the phrase\" in question); accord Comm'r v. Keystone Consol. Indus., 508 U.S. 152, 159 (1993). Until 1982, courts and the PTO consistently inter- preted the test for genericness under the Act as whether consumers primarily perceived the mark as a whole as the name of the class of goods or services. E.g. , S. Rep. 98 - 627, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1984) (primary -significance test has \"generally been the controlling test used by the courts to determine genericism\"). If consumers instead primarily believed that the mark could serve as a means of distinguishing between brands, the mark was descrip- tive. Courts and the PTO applied this same test to both initial registrations and cancellation.5 5 E.g., Maremont Corp. v. Air Lift Co., 463 F.2d 1114, 1118 (C.C.P.A. 22 That approach makes sense in light of the Act's funda- mental changes to the common law. Recall that descrip- tive terms were unprotected under trademark common law, but received some protection under unfair -competi- tion law. Supra p. 5. The seminal pre- Lanham Act case of Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111 (1938), articulated the primary -significance test in the unfair - competition context to explain when unfair -competition law protected descriptive terms. Id. at 116. In Kellogg , Nabisco had argued that Kellogg's use of the term \"Shredded Wheat\" unfairly seized the goodwill Nabisco had built behind its similarly named product. Id. at 120. In rejecting Na bisco's claim, the Court explained that Nabisco had failed to \"show that the primary significance of the term [Shredded Wheat] in the minds of the consum- ing public is not the product but the producer.\" Id. at 118 (emphasis added). Accordingly, when the L anham Act ex- tended trademark protection to descriptive terms but not generic terms, courts and the PTO relied on Kellogg 's pri- mary -significance test to distinguish between those two categories.6 1972) (initial registration); Telechron, Inc. v. Telicon Corp. , 198 F.2d 903, 907 (3d Cir. 1952) (trademark infringement); Q -Tips, Inc. v.

Dental Surgeries, Co. , 601 F.2d 1011, 1016 (9th Cir. v. for \"whether a term is a generic name or is a mark\"). Some courts looked 23 Congress in 1984 codified the primary -significance test for g enericness because, in 1982, the Ninth Circuit departed from the primary -significance test to cancel Parker Brothers' registration of MONOPOLY . See Anti - Monopoly, Inc. v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp. , 684 F.2d legislatively over- ruled that decision, mandating the primary -significance for genericness and rejecting \"the purchaser -motiva- tion had applied. U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1064(3), 1127; see S. Rep. 98 -627 at 1 (amendment \"con- firms that the established test for genericism is whether the primary significance of the mark to consumers ... is to identify a product or service which emanates from a par- ticular source ... or whether the mark merely functions as a common descriptive name\"). The 1984 amendment thus \"restore[d] the traditional test of genericness\" that courts had long applied. McCarthy, supra , \u00a7 5:8.7 3. Section 1064(3) makes the primary -significance test the test for genericness in all contexts and for all marks, further back to Judge Learned Ha nd's decision in Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co. , 272 F. 505 (S.D.N.Y. 1921), which similarly stated that \"[t]he single question\" in determining whether generic and de- scriptive names receive protection against unfair competition is \"What do the buyers underst and by the word for whose use the par- ties are contending?\" Id. at 509; see McCarthy, supra , \u00a7 12:4. 7 Neither Genesee Brewing Co., 124 F.3d 137, 144-45 (2d 808 F.2d 291 (3d Cir. 1986) , challenges the applicability of the primary -signifi- cance test in all contexts. Contra U.S. Br. 38. Genesee calls the pri- mary -significance test \"the law 299- 300 (similar). Those cases refine the primary -significance test in the inapposite situation involving how to define the class of goods and services at issue. 24 and car ves out no domain -name exception. When Con- gress enacts a clear, categorical rule, courts do not pro- vide \"[a]textual judicial supplementation.\" Rotkiske v. Klemm , 140 360- 61 (2019). Thus, under the pri- mary -significance test, whether a domain name composed of a purportedly generic term (\"booking\") and a suffix (\".com\") is generic depends on whether relevant consum- ers consider the mark as a whole the name of a class of goods or services. Pet.App.9a -10, 12a, 22a; see Adver- tise.com, Inc. v. AOL A dvert., Inc., 616 F.3d 974, 977- 78, 982 (9th Applying the Primary- Significance Test to All Types of Marks Furthers the Act's Aims 1. The primary -significan ce test advances the Lan- ham Act's objectives of protecting consumers and reward- ing trademark owners for building goodwill behind their brands. E.g. , Park 'N Fly, 469 U.S. at 198. Tying the question of whether a mark is generic to whether consum- ers perceive it as the name for the category of goods or services prevents enterprises from claiming a name that effectively occupies the field of their product ( e.g., \"or- ange\" for the eponymous fruit). The primary -significance test also fosters competition and rew ards investments in building brand recognition by encouraging enterprises to use marks that consumers consider meaningful in differ- entiating among brands. By definition, the primary -significance test produces different outcomes for similar names. B EDAND BREAK- FAST .COM met the test, but Hotels.com failed. In re Ho- tels.com, 573 F.3d at 1303- 06. The PTO found that LAW.COM, 1800 LAWYERS .COM, LAWYERSHOP , and L AW FACTORY satisfied the test, but not Lawyers.com. In re Reed Elsevier Props., Inc., 77 U.S.P.Q.2d 1649 (T.T.A.B. 25 2005). Different sets of consumers perceive different words in different ways, and different litigants marshal different evidence. Unsurprisingly, different factual rec- ords produce different results. Determining case by case whether relevan t consum- ers consider a mark as the generic name for a class of goods or services winnows out marks that lack any source - identifying function without indiscriminately rejecting marks that help consumers navigate the marketplace. And, far from opening the floodgates to improper trade- marks, the primary -significance test is just the first hur- dle for marks to clear to receive the full panoply of Lan- ham Act protections. A mark can pass the primary -sig- nificance test and avoid rejection on genericness grounds, but the applicant must still show secondary meaning \u2014 that consumers associate the mark with a single source \u2014 to obtain registration on the principal register. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f); supra p. 6. The primary -significance test makes particular sense for domain na mes, where the price of denying trademark protection is steep. While only one entity can hold a do- main name at a time, the Internet has created new ave- nues for confusion, diversion, dilution, and fraud. Con- gress recognized trademarks' particular vulnerability to infringing domain names by amending the Lanham Act with the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d). Section 1125(d) protects trademarks by imposing civil liability aga inst anyone who \"in bad faith ... registers, traffics in , or uses a domain name ... confus- ingly similar to that mark,\" and authorizes forfeiture, can- cellation, or transfer of the infringing domain name. Domain -name trademarks are readily susceptible to Internet- based fraud and confusion. Merely purchasing the exclusive right to use a domain name does not prevent 26 \"spoofing,\" i.e., \"[t]he creation of a website that has ... a similar URL, in order to mislead visitors about who cre- ated the website.\" Spoofing , Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). Nor does domain -name ownership protect against typosquatting, i.e., registering \"domain names that are close misspellings of a frequently used domain name in order to catch and exploit traffic intended for the other website.\" Typosquatting, Black's Law Dictionary, supra . \u2014\"B0oking.com\" \u2014to fool \"Bookng.com,\" and respond- ent's control of Booking.com would be no help. Only if re- spondent held a trademark in B OOKING .COM woul d the Lanham Act afford injunctive and monetary relief against such deceptive schemes. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d). Trademark protection is also essential to prevent brick -and-mortar entities from trading on a domain -name mark holder's goodwill. Respondent needs those protec- tions to prevent competitors from opening storefront Booking.com travel agencies, or from diluting its brand by selling Booking.com -themed travel products in airport shops. The government (at 30) is thus wrong that the only point of pro tecting domain -name trademarks is to \"im- pede rivals from using similar terms.\" 2. The government (at 32 -33) suggests that domain - name trademarks deserve second -class status because do- main names function as unique addresses and an entity's exclusive righ t to those addresses already confers \"sub- stantial competitive advantage[s].\" That argument would undercut trademark protection for all 10,000 registered domain -name marks, not just Generic.com names. And the Act forbids the government from injecting policy ar-27 guments into registration decisions: Congress com- manded that \"[n]o trademark ... shall be refused registra- tion\" it is distinctive. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052. The government's argument would also extend to 1 - 800 and 1- 888 marks. Like domain names, consume rs type in phone- number marks to connect to the relevant business. Like domain names, only one entity can hold rights to a phone number at a time. Yet the government has registered 1 -800-FLOWERS , 1800C -16a.8 Moreov er, the advantages of domain names as ad- dresses are diminishing. Domain -name marks continue to identify brands, but consumers no longer just type in those names to the Internet to access goods or services. Consumers increasingly depend on apps or search results. Lindsay Gellman, How Search Engines Are Killing Clever URLs , The Atlantic (Dec. 15, 2016), https://ti- nyurl.com/uqhkcne; see JA144. Nor does protecting Generic Company, Generic Inc., or Generic.com trademarks stymie competitors' market- ing and sa les of competing versions of the same products. Contra U.S. Br. 26 -27. TRAVEL .COM (registered for mak- ing hotel and flight reservations) has not thwarted TRAVE- LOCITY .COM or TRAVELO .COM, let alone D IRECT TRAVEL , 8 Amicus Electronic Frontier Foundation (at 13 -16) contends that because consumers can use \".com\" marks as addresses to enter a website, they violate the doctrine that trademark law does n ot protect functional features. But that doctrine focuses on prohibiting the use of trademark law to protect functional elements of product design and other trade dress. E.g., TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Mktg. Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23, 29 (2001). EFF's argument would stretch the function- ality doctrine past its breaking point and invalidate all domain -name marks, as well as all 1 -800 m arks (which consumers can dial to buy goods or services) or street address marks. 28 TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT , TRAVEL EDGE, or FLIGHT CEN- TRE, or online competitors like O RBITZ .COM, FLIGHTS .COM, and EXPEDIA .COM. Consumers pick among these brands without defaulting to the many Ge- neric.com names in the travel arena. Meanwhile, C ANINE REVIEW and CANINE JOURNAL compete for dog -loving subsc ribers, and A LZHEIMER 'S 'S SOCIETY , and A LZHEIMER 'S ASSOCIATION all fight the same disease. Protecting Generic.com marks also does not deter competitors from using similar domain names, lest they face infringement suits. Contra U.S. Br. 27- 30. WEATHER .COM and ACCUWEATHER .COM coexist, while TENNIS .COM and PLAYTENNIS .COM share the same turf. LAW.COM, LAWLINE .COM, LAWPATHS .COM, LAW- CASH .COM, and SCHOOLLAW .COM offer legal news and in- formation. R ENT.COM has not crowded out 123R ENT.COM, RENTUSA NOW .COM, or FORRENT.COM. TICKETZOOM .COM, or TICKETENTERTAINMENT .COM from offering similar services. Competitors realize the difficul- ties that holders of descriptive marks face in prevailing in infringement suits, Pet.App.24a, or are confident that their registrations would survive. Either way, competi- tors have registered variants on purportedly generic marks in droves, apparently without incident. Respond- ent's reference to EBOOKING .COM as a \"potentially\" in- fringing mark before the PTO examiner, JA192, is con- sistent with this point. Contrary to the government's con- tention (at 28), respondent has no objection to E BOOK- ING.COM as a mark, or to its registration. The statement before the examiner signified only that, if consumers con- fused BOOKING .COM and EBOOKING .COM, EBOOK- ING.COM\u2014as the mark that came into existence later \u201429 could infringe BOOKING .COM, not the other way around. Accordingly, EBOOKING .COM was not persuasive evidence that \" BOOKING .COM\" was in common usage. JA192.9 If the consequences of protecting purportedly generic marks were so dire, one would expect the PT O to stop reg- istering such marks after the government petitioned for certiorari on July 5, 2019. B ut see, e.g. , CEREALS & GRAINS ASSOCIATION ; PARKINSON 'S FOUNDATION ; READ- ERS.COM; RENTALS .COM; TAILOR HOUSE ; THE DRIVEWAY COMPANY ; THE LASH FIRM; THE PREGNANC Y COM- PANY . Or after this Court granted certiorari on Novem- ber 8, 2019. B ut see , e.g., AUTO BOUTIQUE ; CARPET EX- CHANGE ; CONCERT .COM; MILITARY PARTS EXCHANGE ; OPERA NEWS; ROOMMATES .COM; WEDDING DIGEST . Or at least after the government filed its opening brief on January 6, 2020. But see , e.g., CANINE REVIEW ; COOK'S EMPORIUM ; FRAGRANCE OUTLET . And if Generic.com marks stifled competition, one would anticipate some out- cry (or evidence) from the 85 jurisdictions, including the European Union and United Kingdom, that registered BOOKING .COM. JA140 -42. The government points to nothing of the sort. 9 The government (at 26 -27) cites the statement in Advertise.com that protecting a Generic.com mark \"would potentially reach almost any use of the generic term in a domai n name.\" 616 F.3d at 981. But the court still concluded that Generic.com names could be marks. Id. And the PTO's registration of many overlapping domain names sug- gests the absence of any chilling effect. Retail Services, Inc. v. Free- bies Publishing (U.S. Br. 27) merely cited numerous domain names incorporating \"freebies\" to show that consumers perceive \"freebies\" to mean giveaways in general. 364 F.3d 535, 545- 46 (4th Cir. 2004). 30 C. The Primary- Significance Inquiry Properly Considers Survey Evidence 1. Because the primary -significance test looks to whether consumers believe a mark as a whole signifies the name of a class of goods or services, the test demands that courts assess wh at consumers actually think. Courts and the PTO agree that whether any mark \u2014domain name or not\u2014is generic is a & n.1; Examiner's Manual \u00a7 1209.01(c)(i). And, be- cause the point is to figure out what impression a given mark makes on consumers of the goods or services, courts and the PTO rely on a variety of probative evidence. Such evidence includes how the applicant uses the mark; how competitors use it; dictionary definitions of terms com- prising the mark; media usage; and testimony from those in the industry. McCarthy, supra , \u00a7 12:13; Am. Univ. v. Am. Univ. of , Cancellation No. 92049706, slip op. at 31 (T.T.A.B. Jan. 30, 2020). Above all, survey evidence often plays a starring evi- dentiary role. \"Consu mers surveys have become almost de rigueur in litigation over genericness.\" McCarthy, su- pra, \u00a7 12:14; Princeton Vanguard, 786 F.3d at 965 (\"[C]onsumer surveys may be a preferred method of prov- ing genericness.\"); Berner Int'l Corp. v. Mars Sales Co., 987 F. 2d 975, 982 -83 (3d Cir. 1993) (\"consumer surveys [are] ... preferable to indirect forms of evidence\"). The \"most judicially accepted format for testing for generic- ness\" is the Teflon survey, which teaches survey respond- ents the difference between generic terms and brands, then asks respondents to identify terms as generic or as likely brands. McCarthy, supra , \u00a7 12:16. Courts and the PTO thus recognize that consumer surveys \u2014especially Teflon surveys \u2014may tip the scales when determining genericness. The Nin th Circuit held 31 that, although Advertising.com seemed generic on the limited record before it, further evidence could change the outcome: \"[C]onsumer surveys or other evidence might ultimately demonstrate that [the domain mark] is valid and protectable.\" Advertise.com, 616 F.3d at 982. Simi- larly, the PTO examiner twice refused to register W AF- FLE HOUSE on genericness grounds, relying largely on dictionary definitions of \"waffle\" and \"house.\" But the PTO reversed course after reviewing additional evidence, including a Teflon survey showing 92% brand recognition, and registered W AFFLE HOUSE on the principal register. (Reg. No. 2,965,520). Respondent's Teflon survey is thus exactly the type of evidence courts and the PTO have re- lied on when applying the pr imary -significance test. 2. The government (at 40 -41) contends that courts should never consider \"evidence of consumer understand- ing\"\u2014especially survey evidence\u2014when assessing gener- icness. That contention largely rests on the government's mistaken per se rule classifying all Generic.com names as inherently generic, no matter how consumers perceive the mark. Infra pp. 35 -36. The government (at 36, 41) also cites Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4 (2d Cir. 1976), for the pro position that no amount of evidence of consumer perceptions can make generic terms non -ge- neric. But the Abercrombie line of cases involves whether a mark that has already become generic can be resur- rected with evidence of secondary meaning, i.e. , a second- ary association with a brand in consumers' eyes. Aber- crombie said no, reasoning that no producer should be 32 able to remove a generic term from the linguistic com- mons once the public primarily understands it as the com- mon name for a whole class of goods or services. Id. at 9.10 Abercrombie assumes away the dispute here, which is whether a Generic.com name is generic in the first place. Whether a generic term can move back to descriptive sta- tus is irrelevant in this case. The Fourth Circuit agreed: \"Once a term is deemed generic, it cannot subsequently become non -generic.\" Pet.App.10a. But no judicial deci- sion previously deemed B OOKING .COM generic. Nor, as the district court found, was B OOKING .COM commonly used or understood as a generic term before res pondent 10 Most of the government's cases (at 41 -43) similarly hold that con- sumer perceptions cannot salvage phrases that were generic before specific enterprises used them. See Hunt Masters, Inc. v. Landry's Seafood Rest., Inc., 240 F.3d 251, 254- 55 & n.1 (4th Cir. 2001) (\"crab house\" was generic because term \"was commonly used prior to its as- sociation\" with plaintiff's restaurant); Schwan 's IP, LLC v. Kraft Pizza Co., 460 F.3d 971, 976 (8th Cir. 2006) (\"brick -oven\" was in com- mon use before applicant's Inc. v. (2d Cir. 1999) (\"hog\" was common slang for motorcycle before applicant used term); In re Analog De- vices , 10 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1879, 1879 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (similar for \"analog Northland Aluminum Prods. , 777 F.2d 1556, 1559- 60 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (similar for \"bundt\"); Miller Brewing Co. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 655 F.2d 5, 7- 8 & n.2 (1st Cir. 1981) (prior holding that plaintiff' s \"LITE \" beer trademark was generic made ev- idence of consumer perceptions irrelevant); Miller Brewing Co. v. Jo- seph Schlitz Brewing Co., 605 F.2d 990, 995 (7th Cir. 1979) (similar for \"LITE\" beer); Weiss Noodle Co. v. Golden Cracknel & Specialty Co., 290 F.2d 845, 848 (C.C.P.A. 1961) (same for \"egg noodles\"). Oth- ers simply observe that evidence of secondary meaning does not ren- der a generic term protectable. Royal Crown Co. v. The Coca -Cola Co., 892 F.3d 1358, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Tech. Publ'g -17a. The govern- ment (at 44) disagrees, citing longer domain names con- taining \"booking.com.\" But the district court's factfinding deserves deference, and the government's factbound ar- gument departs from the question presented. The government (at 40) argues that consumers may inherently consider \".com\" names more distinctive, skew- ing survey results. That objection is another broadside against all domain -name marks. Regardless, the govern- ment abandoned all objections to the validity of respond- ent's survey, Pet.App.16a, and its speculation is ground- less. As the district court found, respondent's Teflon sur- vey showed that consumers differentiate among domain names by testing B OOKING .COM against Washingma- chine.com. JA54. Whereas 74.8% of survey respondents identified BOOKING .COM as a brand, Washingma- chine.com connoted a brand to just 30%. JA53. The concessions about how \"useful\" sur- vey evidence is \"in a variety of contexts\" underscore the incongruity of its position. The government (at 42 -43) agrees that Teflon surveys can show whether a descrip- tive term has acquired secondary meaning. The govern- ment (at 43) concurs that Teflon surveys can show whether fanciful \"coined\" marks (like \"Teflon\" itself) have \"become generic through widespread use.\" The govern- ment then concedes (at 43) that courts usually assess ge- nericness by looking to \"whether consumers understand\" a mark \"as the common name of a class of products or ser- vices.\" Given the government's acknowledgments of the importance consumer perceptions play in resolving virtu- ally every other trademark -eligibility question, evidence of consumer perceptions (including surveys) should play an equally prominent role in determining genericness. 34 D. BOOKING .COM Is Descriptive, Not Generic, Under the Primary- Significance Test Whether the courts below correctly applied the pri- mary -significance test is not before this Court. The peti- tion presented only the question whether the govern- ment's proposed per se rule renders B OOKING .COM ge- neric. The government (at 43 -44) obliquely ass erts that consumers would understand B OOKING .COM to refer only to a class of services, but offers no reason why. Regardless, the Fourth Circuit correctly followed the Lanham Act's primary -significance test for genericness. The court explained that wheth er BOOKING .COM is ge- neric depends on whether relevant consumers primarily consider the mark as a whole as the name of a class of goods or services. Pet.App.9a -12a & n.6; id. 22a. Here, the PTO did not meet its burden to show genericness. The Fourth Circ uit properly deferred to the district court's finding that respondent's Teflon survey showing that 74.8% of consumers do not perceive B OOKING .COM as ge- neric was more compelling competing ev- hat \"majority usage controls,\" so the survey establishes that BOOKING .COM is descriptive. McCarthy, supra, \u00a7 12:6. The PTO has waived any objection to the survey's validity or methodology. Pet.App.16a. And the PTO conceded that if BOOKING .COM is not ge neric, it is entitled to regis- tration as a descriptive term that has acquired distinctive- ness (or secondary meaning). Pet.App.12a. II. GOODYEAR DOES NOT COMPEL A CONTRARY RESULT The government contends that, under this Court's 1888 Goodyear decision, a gene ric term coupled with a corporate designation like \"Company,\" or by extension 35 \".com,\" can never create a trademark. Adding such a suf- fix, or synonyms like \"Inc.,\" \"Store,\" \"House,\" etc., pur- goods or serv ices from competitors'. But the Lanham Act re- jected the government's premises, and mandates the pri- mary -significance test for genericness across the board. The government (at 22) is wrong that respondent \"has never suggested that the core holding of Good year no longer applies,\" nor has respondent conceded that \"Book- ing Company\" or \"Booking Inc.\" cannot be trademarks. See Br. in Opp. 11 -13; Resp. CA4 Br. 31 -32. Adopting the government's se rule would unleash a trade- mark apocalypse, stripping hundreds of registered marks of protection and creating massive consumer confusion. A. The Lanham Act Repudiated the Government's Per Se Rule 1. Goodyear is a classic exemplar of the pre- Lanham Act common law of trademarks, where trademark protec- tion was narrow and judges distinguished between pro- tected and unprotected names without regard to con- sumer perceptions. In Goodyear , the Goodyear Rubber Company s ought to prevent Goodyear's India Rubber Glove Manufacturing Company and others from using \"Goodyear's Rubber Manufacturing Company,\" \"Good- year Rubber Company,\" \"The Goodyear's Company,\" or similar names. 128 U.S. at 600- 01. The Court concluded that neither party could claim a trademark: \"[T]he name of 'Goodyear Rubber Company' is not one capable of exclusive appropriation\" because \"'Goodyear Rubber' are terms descriptive of well- known classes of goods produced by the process known as 'Good- year's Invent ion'\" (the common method for vulcanizing rubber). Id. at 602 (emphasis added). The common law was that \"[n]ames which are thus descriptive of a class of 36 goods cannot be exclusively appropriated by any one.\" Id. (emphasis added). Adding \"the word 'Compa ny'\" did not make the ensuing phrase \"Goodyear's Rubber Company\" a trademark, because \"'Company' ... only indicates that parties have formed an association or partnership to deal in such goods.\" Id. Goodyear 's holding that the descriptive words \"Good- s Rubber,\" \"Goodyear Rubber encapsu- lated nineteenth -century common -law rules. The law then protected only technical trademarks designating \"the manufacturer who has adopted\" the name. Francis H. Upton, A Treatise on the Law of Trade Marks 98 (1860). Significantly, Goodyear relied on the Court's de- cision in Del. & Hudson Canal Co. v. Clark , 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 311 (1871), for the dispositive legal rule: \"'[T]he trade -mark must ... point distinctively to the origin or ownership of the article to which it is applied,'\" so \"a ge- neric name, or a name merely descriptive of an article of trade, of its qualities, ingredients, or characteristics, [can- not] be employed as a trade- mark.\" 128 U.S. at 603- 04 (quoting Canal Co. , 80 U.S. at 323). The nineteenth -cen- tury rule was thus that \"no sign or form of words can be appropriated as a valid trademark which ... others may employ with equal truth and with equal right for the same purpose.\" Elgin , 179 U.S. at 673; Hesseltine, supra , at 31 - 32. Or, as the government observes, Goodyear rests on \"the equal right of others engaged in similar business to use similar designations,\" U.S. Br. 19 (quoting Goodyear , 128 U.S. at 603); see id. at 28. Goodyear thus rejected trademark protection for any descriptive names (like \"Goodyear's Rubber\") because such names might also describe other competitors' prod-37 ucts. See 128 U.S. at 602- 03. Likewise, under this anti- quated rule, adding corporate designations like \"Com- pany\" did n othing to isolate a single producer; multiple producers might truthfully claim to be a company. See id . Goodyear accordingly analogized al names like \"Lackawanna coal\" or \"Pennsylvania wheat.\" Id. Even though some of these names might be generic and some descriptive in modern -day parlance, they were all infirm at common law. Competitors could conceivably claim any of those names to desc ribe their products with equal truth. Id. at 602- 04. Goodyear tracked similar common -law prohibitions on trademarking proper names. Harry D. Nims, The Law of Unfair Competition & Trade -Marks \u00a7 206 (2d ed. 1917). The Court's pre- Lanham Act cases expres sed skepticism about trademarking colors on the same basis. Qualitex , 514 U.S. at 170- 71 (surveying cases). That is why, like Goodyear itself, common -law treatises treated generic and descriptive terms interchangeably. E.g. , James Love Hopkins, The Law of Trademarks, Tradenames and Un- fair Competition \u00a7 46 (4th ed. 1924) (\"generic term[s]\" mean words \"too general and comprehensive in [their] meaning\" for one producer to claim, including \"geograph- ical names, proper names, and descriptive words\"); Wil- liam Henry Browne, A Treatise on the Law of Trade - Marks \u00a7 134, at 146 (2d ed. 1885). Pre-Lanham Act cases and treatises accordingly un- derstood Goodyear as barring trademark protection for all descriptive terms.11 This Court said so, repeatedly. 11 E.g., Hesseltine, supra , at 207- 08; Amasa C. Paul, The Law of Trademarks & Unfair Competition \u00a7 60 n.1 (1903). 38 The Court in 1893 cited Goodyear as one of many cases \"establish[ing] ... [t]hat if the ... mark ... for the purpose of identifying [the product's] class, grade, style, or quality, or for any purpose other than a reference to or indication of its o wnership, it cannot be sustained as a valid trade -mark.\" Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn , 150 U.S. 460, 463- 64 (1893); see Corbin v. Gould , 133 U.S. 308, 314 (1890) (Goodyear exemplifies rule protecting only technical trademarks); Lawrence Mfg. Co. v. Tenn. M fg. Co., 138 U.S. 537, 547 (1891) (same). Similarly, Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict , 198 U.S. 118 (1905), \"cit[ed] Goodyear with approval,\" U.S. Br. 19\u2014 again to illustrate that \"such descriptive names\" as \"Goodyear Rubber\" could not be trad emarks. Howe , 198 U.S. at 137. And this Court in 1920 cited Goodyear for the \"settled\" rule that \"the law would not secure to any person the exclusive use of a trade- mark consisting merely of words descriptive of the qualities, ingredients, or charac- teristics of an article of trade.\" Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm'r of Patents , 252 U.S. 538, 543- 44 (1920). In sum, Goodyear does not say that a generic name for a class of goods or services, coupled with \"Company\" or \"Inc.,\" cannot be a trademark because the combined phrase remains generic. Goodyear recites a different and more sweeping rule that descriptive terms can never be trademarked. As such, adding another descriptive word like \"Company\" or \"Inc.\" still results in a descriptive mark that cannot pinpoint a product's manufacturer or source the way the common law required. That is why the Court held that \"Goodyear Rubber Company\" \u2014a descriptive name in modern parlance \u2014could not be trademarked. The government cannot claim the mantle of a purportedly unbroken 130- year history when its position revamps Goodyear into an ahistorical rule. 39 2. The Lanham Act overrode every premise animating Goodyear . Unlike at common law, the Act allows regis- tration of descriptive terms. Supra p. 6; Qualitex , 514 U.S. at U.S. 8- 9, Qualitex , 514 U.S. 159 (No. 93-1577); Park 'N Fly, 469 U.S. at 193- 94. Whether a trademark could theoretically describe competitors' prod- ucts is no longer controlling. The touchstone now is whether the name \"distinguishe[s ]\" the applicant's \"from the goods of others.\" U.S.C. \u00a7 1052 (defining trademarks eligible for principal register); see id. \u00a7 1091(a) (marks must be \"capable of appli- or services\" for supplemental registration); Qualite x, 514 U.S. at 171. Likewise, the Act makes con- sumer perceptions dispositive to the primary U.S.C. 1064(3); supra pp. 19 -24. The Act thus repudiates Goodyear and its ilk, which treated consumer perceptions as irrelevant to whether the \"words ... in and of themselves indicate anything in the nature of origin, manufacture, or ownership.\" See El- gin, 179 U.S. at 673; U.S. Br. 38- 40. Further, the Act rejects any per se rule that adding \"Company,\" \".com,\" or other suffixe s can never add fur- ther meaning. That notion rested on the discarded com- mon -law rule that no one can trademark names that could equally describe competitors. Because adding \"Com- pany\" just \"indicates that parties ha[d] formed an associ- ation or partnership,\" Goodyear , 128 U.S. at 602, adding \"Company\" to a generic (or even descriptive) term could never produce a name that innately referred to the prod- uct's origin, manufacture, or ownership, so courts had no need to consider the mark as a whole. But the Act re- quires courts and the PTO to look at the combined effect of the \"mark,\" by defining a mark to include any \"combi- nation\" of words. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127; supra p. 21. Courts 40 can no longer look at words in isolation, deem them lin- guistic filler, and disregar d whether relevant consumers might perceive the mark as a whole differently. The primary -significance test is incompatible with Goodyear . The proof is in the pudding: if Goodyear sur- vived the Lanham Act, presumably its core holding \u2014that terms like \"Goo dyear\" could not be trademarked\u2014en- dured. In the government's view (at 41), once this Court deemed \"Goodyear\" variants generic, no amount of ensu- ing consumer recognition should have created a valid trademark. Yet the PTO has registered multiple G OOD- YEAR trademarks for decades. If Goodyear categorically bars \"Cotton Company,\" why register C OTTON EMPO- RIUM and COTTON COLLECTION ? If Goodyear forever tanked \"Wine Company,\" why not MARGARITA COMPANY ? And the government's portrayal (at 4) of Crab House as generic as a matter of law, despite its previous registra- tion of T HE CRAB PLACE , is fishy in every respect. 3. The government (at 21) suggests that the Lanham Act preserved Goodyear because its \"purpose ... was to codify and unify the common law of unfair competition and trademark protection\" (quoting Inwood Labs. v. Ives Labs. , 456 U.S. 844, 861 n.2 (1982) (White, J., concurring in the result)). But the Act achieved that synthesis by re- jecting m ajor premises of the common law of trademarks to create a more protective body of federal trademark law. Qualitex , 514 U.S. at 171; Park 'N Fly, 469 U.S. at 193. The government (at 21) states that this Court \"has nei- ther overruled Goodyear nor suggested that it has been superseded by later statutory enactments.\" But this Court has recognized that the Lanham Act superseded re- lated per se rules. Qualitex thus rejected the common -law rule against trademarking colors, notwithstanding \"many older cases \u2014incl uding Supreme Court cases \u2014in support 41 of\" that rule. 514 U.S. at 170. The Court explained that those cases \"interpreted trademark law as it existed be- fore 1946\" and did not reflect the Act's dramatic expansion of trademark protection beyond common -law tec hnical trademarks. Id. ; see Br. for U.S. at 21 -22, Qualitex , 514 U.S. 159 (No. 93- 1577) (\"[T]he Act superseded prior com- mon law doctrines,\" including this Court's precedent \"predat[ing] the Lanham Act by 40 years.\"). Likewise, no one thinks that the comm on-law prohibition on trade- marking proper names survived Act\u2014hence YO-YO MA, ADELE , and M ADONNA are marks. It is hard to fathom how Goodyear alone survived this sea change. The government's citations hardly substantiate a sup- posedly entrenched 130 -year -old rule. The government invokes one Eleventh Circuit decision, a treatise, and a TTAB decision purportedly \"appl[ying] Goodyear .\" U.S. Br. 21 -22. This Court in Qualitex dismissed similar mod- ern precedents, explaining that \"the Lanham Act's changes left the courts free to reevaluate the preexisting legal precedent,\" including pre- Lanham Act Supreme Court opinions. 514 U.S. at 173. The government's au- thorities are weak regardless. Welding Services, Inc. v. Forman, 509 F.3d 1351 (11th Cir. 2007 ), never mentions Goodyear . That case relied on a TTAB decision and trea- tise for the footnoted assertion that adding \"Inc.\" to a name \"does not make generic words protectable.\" Id. at 1359 n.4. The government cites Professor McCarthy, who states that a dding \"Company,\" \"Inc.,\" or \"Partners\" to \"a generic name\" cannot create a trademark but grounds that rule in modern TTAB decisions. McCarthy \u00a7 12:39. McCarthy characterizes Goodyear as holding that \"add- ing designations such as 'Company,' 'Corp.,' or 'In c.' does not add any trademark significance to a designation which 42 does not otherwise qualify as a trademark.\" Id. That comports with his observation that Goodyear is \"not clear\" whether \"Goodyear Rubber\" is generic or descrip- tive modern parlance, id. \u00a7 12:32; he adds that Good- year may rest on the obsolete common -law rule against protecting descriptive terms, id. Regardless, McCarthy concludes that the primary -significance test is the test for genericness, and does not explain how Goodyear could squar e with that conclusion. Id. \u00a7 12:4. Finally, the government cites In re Wm. B. Coleman Co., 93 U.S.P.Q.2d 2019, 2025 (T.T.A.B. 2010). There, the TTAB relied on Goodyear for the proposition that \"Com- pany\" does not add source -identifying significance to th e words \"Electric Candle.\" Id. But the TTAB ultimately rested on consumer perceptions to deem \"Electric Candle Company\" generic, reasoning that \"the relevant public would nonetheless understand ELECTRIC CANDLE COMPANY to refer to a company that sells electric can- dles, and public understanding is critical.\" Id. at 2021. The government's position is also incoherent as to when the Lanham Act's primary -significance test applies and when (and how) its Goodyear rule takes over. The government seemingly agrees that the primary -signifi- cance test governs whether a root word (like \"grain\") is generic. U.S. Br. 7 -8, 15. And, as noted, the government concedes (at 43) that the primary -significance test is the \"usual\" test for genericness. Yet the government refuses to apply the primary -significance test to certain com- pound phrases, insisting (at 44) that Grain Inc., Grain Company, and Grain.com are all generic under Goodyear , \"even though consumers could understand [them] to refer to a specific company.\" That reas oning presupposes that the government's supplants the Lanham Act's 43 primary -significance test. But the government never ex- plains how to achieve this atextual feat through conven- tional methods of statutory interpretation. 4. Even if a Goodyear -based per se rule against \"Ge- neric Company\" or \"Generic Inc.\" survived the Lanham Act, sound basis exists for equating a \"Company\" or \"Inc.\" suffix with \".com\" and extending the rule to domain names. And if the Court went that far, that rule would necessarily sweep in \".org,\" \".biz,\" \".net\" and other do- main -name suffixes. Further, domain names differ from corporate designations in significant ways \u2014not least be- cause their purpose is to facilitate online activities, and be- cause each domain name is uniqu e. Supra p. 25; AIPLA Br. 14. Expanding a Goodyear -based per se rule beyond the \"Company\" or \"Inc.\" contexts would break new ground, with no stopping point in sight. The government (at 22) contends that TTAB and ap- pellate decisions establish that \"a 'g eneric.com' domain name generally is not eligible\" for trademark registration. Saying that a rule is \"generally\" true but sometimes not is a roundabout admission that there is no per se rule. See U.S. Br. 25 n.6. And the government's position is even weaker than that: every circuit to consider the question has rejected a per se rule against Generic.com trade- marks. Pet.App.18a; e.g. F.3d se rule); Advertise.com, Inc. , 616 F.3d at 982 (same). The govern- ment (at 25 n.6) dismisses courts' endorsements of Ge- neric.com marks \"in the 'rare' case where the combined term carries additional meaning,\" saying the Court need not resolve \"the propriety or scope of such an exception.\" But that is the question presented: \"Whether the addi- tion ... of ['.com'] to an otherwise generic term can create a protectable trademark.\" U.S. Br. i. 44 The government's authorities (at 22 -25) also belie its position. Start with the PTO's own manual, which never cites Goodyear in provisions discussing when domain names are generic. Examiner's Manual \u00a7\u00a7 1209.03(m), 1215.05, 1215.08(a). Nor does the part of the manual dis- cussing Goodyear mention domain names. Id. \u00a7 1209.03(d) (citing Goodyear for proposition that \" [t]he addition of an entity designator (e.g., Corporation, Corp., Co., Inc., Ltd., etc.) to a descriptive term does not alter the term's descriptive significance\"). And the govern- ment omits that the manual states that \"there is no per se rule\" that adding \".com\" to \"an otherwise generic term\" is grounds for refusing registration. Id. \u00a7 1215.05; see AIPLA Br. 11 -12. PTO examiners have faithfully fol- lowed the PTO's instructions, registering COOKING .COM, FRUITS .COM, ART.COM, and scores of similar marks whil e rejecting others. Appx. A. The government cites In re Martin Container, Inc., 65 U.S.P.Q.2d 1058 (T.T.A.B. 2002), but the Federal Cir- cuit repudiated the TTAB's reasoning for wrongly inter- preting rule out is no per se rule against register- ing Generic.com names. E.g. , In re Vacationfutures, 2016 WL 4775500, at *8 (T.T.A.B. 2016). The government (at 23 -24) invokes the Federal Cir- cuit's Oppedahl decision, involving \"patents.com.\" That decision cites Goodyear and analogizes the effect of add- ing \".com\" to an \"otherwise descriptive or generic term\" to adding \"Corp.\" or such terms. 373 F.3d at 1173, 1175. Oppedahl then states tha t it would be \"legal error\" to adopt a per se rule that adding \".com\" to a term never adds additional meaning. Id. at 1175. Such a cate-45 gorical rule would flout the cardinal principle that regis- trability depends on how consumers perceive the mark as a who le. Id. at 1174. The court held: \"[T]he per se rule in Goodyear that 'Corp.', etc. never possess source -indicat- ing significance does not operate as a per se rule, but more as a general rule, with respect to [.com].\" Id. at 1175. Oppedahl thus rejected reliance on a \" Goodyear analy- sis,\" instead relying on evidence of consumer perceptions to \"conclud[e] that the combination of 'patents' and '.com' does not render the mark as a whole distinctive.\" Id. at 1176. The Federal Circuit similarly affirmed regis tration denials for mattress.com, lawyers.com, and hotels.com only because evidence showed that consumers primarily perceive those marks as generic.12 The Ninth Circuit also rejects the government's per se rule. Advertise.com cited Goodyear to show that adding \".com\" to \"a generic term ... does not suffice to establish that the component is distinctive.\" 616 F.3d at 982. But respondent's position is not that appending \".com\" auto- matically transforms a generic term into a distinctive one. Rather, respondent's position is that there is \"no per se rule against the use of domain names, even ones formed by combining generic terms with [.com].\" Id. As the Ninth Circuit concluded, courts must \"look to the mark as a whole and ... the combination of generic terms may, in some instances, result in a distinctive mark,\" depending on the evidence. Id. at 978. 12 In re 1800Mattress.com IP LLC , 586 F.3d 1304, re Reed Props., 482 F.3d at 1381. 46 B. The Government's Per Se Rule Would Strip Count- less Marks of Trademark Protection and Confer No Competitive Benefits Adopting the government's per se rule wo uld usher in a mass extinction event for registered trademarks. The PTO has spent decades registering marks that violate the government's rule that a generic root term, coupled with \"Company\" or \".com,\" can never be a trademark. T HE WIG COMPANY , THE CAP COMPANY , THE SASH COMPANY , THE FLAGPOLE COMPANY , and T HE RAG COMPANY would all face cancellation if the government's position became law. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(3) (authorizing cancellation on genericness grounds at any time). Applying the govern- ment's per se rule to domain names would jeopardize scores of \".com\" marks, too. Appx. A, 1a -11a. The government's onslaught against PTO -registered marks would not end there. If synonyms for corporate structure never add distinctiveness, then coupling generic term s with \"Association,\" to A LZHEIMER 'S ASSOCIATION , ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION , CHRISTIAN COALITION , AU- TISM SOCIETY , EPILEPSY FOUNDATION , THE HEART FOUNDATI ON, etc. If \".com\" is an empty suffix, so are \".biz,\" \".net,\" and \".org.\" And, just as \".com\" can refer to a virtual place for commerce, so can 1 -800 refer to a tele- phone hotline for purchases se rule would apparently pro- hibit combining a generic term with \"Store,\" see Pet. 4; Gov't CA4 Br. 6 \u2014ending THE CONTAINER STORE 's 38 - year -old trademark. If \"Store\" is out, generic terms paired with any \"Store\" synonyms presumably would not survive\u2014so no more OFFICE DEPOT , PAPER SOURCE , 47 THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY , FISH MART, FRAGRANCE- MARKET , WATCH WAREHOUSE , or SKIRT OUTLET . If Crab House fails the government's test, see U.S. Br. 4, then WAFFLE HOUSE is toast. Absent some elusive distinction between houses and more humble abodes, S UNGLASS HUT, RADIO SHACK , and SHAKE SHACK are doomed. The government (at 25 n.7) also suggests that publications consisting of generic terms plus \"News,\" \"Journal,\" or \"Guide\" can never be marks \u2014so goodbye TV GUIDE , CLERGY JOURNAL , and OPERA NEWS, and presumably SKI MAGAZINE , GOLF DIGEST , and BICYCLING . All told, the government's per se rule threatens hun- dreds of registered marks that respondent has identified, including m any of the country's most famous brands. See Appx. A. The PTO registered C ONSUMER REPORTS in the 1950s; PIZZA HUT in the 1960s; 1-800-FLOWERS in the 1970s; THE CONTAINER STORE in the 1980s; and J EW- ISH.COM in the 1990s. The PTO even registered B OOK- INGS .COM in the 2000s. Yet the government suggests that protecting these marks was ultra vires all along. U.S. Br. 18 -20. The gov- ernment (at 33) blames companies and nonprofits for pro- ceeding at their peril and not picking names that satisfy the government's new per se rule. But it is hard to fault mark holders for taking the Lanham Act at its word. The PTO signed off on these registrations for decades, and the government cannot credibly claim hundreds of accidents. These registrations are the product of ex aminers follow- ing the PTO's manual, including by reversing initial ge- nericness determinations after applicants produced sur- vey evidence rebutting those conclusions. Supra pp. 24 - 25; see Brunetti, 139 S. Ct. at 2301 (declining to interpret 48 statute based on government's assertion that registra- tions exhibiting viewpoint bias were \"PTO examiners' mistakes\"). Not to worry, the government (at 34 -35) says: anyone denied trademark protection could invoke unfair -compe- tition law to prevent \"third parties from passin g off their goods or services.\" But the availability of unfair -competi- tion \"[p]rotection ... does not justify artificially constrict- ing the scope of protection under the Act's trademark pro- visions.\" Br. for U.S. at 21- 22, Qualitex, 514 U.S. 159 (No. 93-1577). Unfair -competition laws are no substitute for the rights the Lanham Act extends to mark -holders, id., which \"should not be denied based on a per se rule that prohibits registration based on the nature of the mark, where neither the statute nor compell ing policy reasons support such a denial,\" id. Further, as the government's citations show, state unfair -competition claims typically bar relief absent actual fraud, making relief unlikely in most cases. E.g., Genesee Brewing Co. v. Stroh Brewing Co., 124 F.3d 137, 149 (2d Cir. 1997); Murphy Door Bed Co. v. Interior Sleep Sys., Inc. , 874 F.2d 95, 102 (2d Cir. 1989). The government's suggestion (at 35) that appli- cants could register \"stylized elements\" of their brands as design marks is less helpful s till. Unless applicants can register domain -name marks, they lack key protections against Internet- based deception and infringement. The government's per se rule would also cost consum- ers dearly. The PTO registered all the marks the govern- ment now co nsiders trademark -ineligible because the ev- idence showed that consumers believe these marks could or do identify specific producers. Without trademark pro- tections, countless easily remembered marks that avoid consumer confusion would be far harder to protect against infringement, both in cyberspace and the physical 49 world. Given the difficulties of pursuing unfair -competi- tion claims, bad actors might decide that the rewards of pirating famous brands are worth the risk \u2014and that pi- racy is even easier to acco mplish online. Little would stop copycats from launching knockoff Container Stores, Of- fice Depots, and Pizza Huts in the same shopping malls, or from falsely claiming affiliation with C ARE.COM, CHRIS- TIAN COALITION , or F LIGHTS .COM. Further, if the government's per se rule governs trademark protection going forward, enterprises would never invest in fostering recognition of brand names that others could seize with near -impunity. Instead of easily - remembered marks that avoid consumer confusion, the governmen t would incentivize a return to the bygone days of elaborate technical trademarks like B OKER 'S STOMACH BITTERS , COE'S SUPERPHOSPHATE OF LIME, and DR. DRAKE 'S GERMAN CROUP REMEDY . That would eviscer- ate the Lanham Act's central premise that trademark law should reward enterprises that develop recognizable brands, rather than superimposing artificial, judge- made rules on the market. Park 'N Fly, 469 U.S. at 198. At bottom, the government sees unfairness in allowing one enterprise to claim to a name that \"'others may em- ploy with equal truth.'\" U.S. Br. 28 (quoting, e.g. , Law- rence Mfg. , 138 U.S. at 547). That is another way of saying that the government prefers to protect only technical trademarks, not descriptive terms. For 70 years, how- ever, trademark law has proceeded from the premise that the best way to avoid granting monopolies on the common name for a product is to avoid trademarking the words that consumer s actually consider the common name for the product. If the government wants to undo that choice, its recourse lies with Congress, not this Court. 50 CONCLUSION The judgment of the Fourth Circuit should be af- firmed. Respectfully submitted, DAVID H.
