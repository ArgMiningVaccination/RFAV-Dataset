We pride ourselves in having a breadth of experience in treating a wide variety of cases using the culmination and collaboration of several different styles of acupuncture to get quick, effective, and long-lasting results. About Traditional Chinese Medicine Chinese medicine encompasses an unparalleled ability to take a unique look at you as an individual, not your disease or diagnosis. Our medicine works with aspects of the mind, body, and spirit to help you gain and maintain an optimal state of health and wellbeing. Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine takes a truly holistic approach to getting to the bottom of what may be causing your discomfort, whether it be headaches, allergies, painful periods, the common cold, or heartburn. Our medicine is incredibly individualized, effective, and most importantly all-natural. We use a variety of different treatment therapies based on your individualized needs. Some of these include: Acupuncture: A medicine that has been used for over 3,000 years to help the body heal itself by creating microscopic, micro-traumas using tiny sterile, hair-fine needles placed in specific points in the body to stimulate the body's internal self-healing abilities. Electroacupuncture or E-Stim: We add a very light electrical current to the ends of acupuncture needles to increase the effectiveness of the acupuncture treatment as well as decrease pain. Moxibustion: The burning of a medicinal herb that has been used for centuries for its healing properties to warm the skin and promote circulation. Infrared heat therapy: We use infrared heat lamps to keep our patients warm and comfortable as well as for their healing properties. Far infrared heat, as opposed to traditional and direct heating methods, penetrates deeper into your body without skin discomfort. There are many known benefits of infrared heat therapy including increased circulation, relaxation of body tissue, and decreases in pain. Cupping: The method of creating a vacuum in a glass jar that is placed on the skin to increase blood flow, decrease muscle tension and pain, and help nourish the body tissues. Gua Sha: An adjunctive therapy that uses a gentle scraping tool on the skin to help with circulation and alleviate pain. Chinese Food Therapy: Acupuncturists understand the healing properties of different varieties of foods and may suggest certain foods for their innate ability to balance the body's condition. Some categories of foods we look at include warming foods, cooling foods, foods that are astringent, and foods that help with circulation or expel and leach dampness. Food therapy can be very beneficial for digestive complaints and many other internal medicine maladies. Chinese Herbal Medicine: Chinese herbs can be used both internally and topically to enhance the body's own healing abilities and balance body systems. We use synergistic blends of Chinese Herbs that have been used for centuries for anything from eczema, urinary tract infections, acne, stress and emotional disturbances, menstrual irregularities, the enhancement of fertility, and much much more. Manual Therapies: Our practitioners may incorporate various hands-on techniques into your treatment including, Tui Na (Chinese Medical Massage), Zen Shiatsu Massage, Soft Tissue Release, and stretching.
