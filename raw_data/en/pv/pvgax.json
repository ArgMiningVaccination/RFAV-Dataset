I 6' PREFACE The first volume of the Research Issues Series was published in November 1974. Since that time, 29 volumes have been published in this series by the Division of Research, National Institute on Drug AbusE\". The primary objective of the Research Issues Series is to provide both lay and professional read\u00ad ers comprehensive, yet succinct, information on topics of central interest to the drug abuse field. The approach frequently iJsed has been to r:-rovlde abstracts of the relevant literature on a par\u00ad ticular topic. In other cases materials have been developed and written especially for the series. This volume falls in the latter category and addresses the need for a reference guide to the ter\u00ad minology of the drug abuse field. It is based upon a draft compiled by Gregory Austin of the Southern California Research Institute and reviewed by an editorial board of drug experts whose names and affiliations are listed balow. The board members have not reviewed this extensively revised final edit.ion, and the editors, while gratefully acknowledging the seminal contribution of the board members, take major responsibility for any imprecision or errors that may\" occur.

Chief, Psychology Service Veterans Administration Medical Center New Orleans, Louisiana INTRODUCTION The drug abuse field consists of an amalgam of medical i social, and psychological disciplines. This, in turn, reflects upon its terminology, which ranges from colorful slan'g to advanced bio\u00ad medical nomenclature. The breadth of drug abuse terms is thus vast and varied--from 4-letter slang to 10-syllable chemicals and from conceptualizations based on street-wise hip to those taken from advanced molecular biomedicine. For example, a SOCiologist in the drug-field may be found observing a street dude who is taking care of business hussling bags of China White so he can cop some real good snow; an epidemiologist may be concerned about the balloon effect likely to occur with implementation of a supply reduction strategy; a doctor may prescribe nepenthes, soporifics, or ergogenics to help patients cope; and a biochemist may \"be interested in studying ,the dose-response relationship of cholinergic agents on the parasympathetic nervous system. A vast array of drug users, dealers, clinicians, researchers, teachers, U.<:orists, politicians, and others related to the drug abuse field have produced a large lexicon of terms that vary from the simple, but often clever, to the ultracomplex. Many drug terms are ambiguous, especially slang, and their meanings may vary over time (e.g., blues, black beauties, white stuff, kif, narcotic). Other terms may be deadly concise but are often confUSing to lay readers and professionals alike (e.g., endorphin/enkephalin, agonist/antag-. onist, analgesic/anesthetic, congenerlligand). There frequently are slang and scientific terms for the same concept (e.g., to insufflate/to blow, to inject/to shoot up, diacetylmorphine hydro\u00ad chloride/horse, smack, or junk). Some terms have exotic sounding names (e.g., sinsemilla, khat, etonitazene), and others though widely used are grossly imprecise (e.g., high, addiction, toler\u00ad ance, drug abuse, treatment). Explosive discoveries in the field are producing new and rapidly evolving terms, many of which are not currently defined in dictionaries or other standard reference works. These terms are defined only in the research literature where they are being discussed and debated. Examples of this type. include the constantly expanding list of newly identified endogenous agonists, the newer urinalysis screening techniques, and the newer approaches to treatment. This Guide to Drug Abuse Research Terminology attempts to bring a major segment of the myriad assortment of terms found in the drug abuse field under one cover and to present in glossary form definitions of many of the drug abuse terms that have to date been described only in the research literature. It has been designed and written to serve as a convenient guide for those requiring brief, nontechnical explanations of drug abuse terms. It can, however, also be used as a sourcebook for those interested in exploring drug abuse concepts in further depth through the numerous reference citations included and the cross-references to N I DA 's Research Issues Series. In selecting terms for inclusion, a careful analysis of the field's terminology was undertaken. A primary source was the abstracts and the ind~xes of the NIDA Research Issues Series. Now covering over ',000 documents and 26 volumes, the series deals with almost every aspect of human drug research. In the final selection process, four principal criteria were used: (1) the frequency with which a term appeared in the literature, (2) the importance of the term to the field, (3) the extent to which a term might be unfamiliar to individuals outside certain disciplines; and (4) the extent to which confusion or ambiguity surrounded a term's definition or usage. The definitions provided are intended to reflect preferred or common use at present. They were developed either from the professional drug research literature, particularly that covered by the Research Issues Series, or from specialized dictionaries in the field and in related disciplines. Whenever possible. definitions were drawn direct.ly from the research literature. In these instances, since it was not possible to cite all the materials pertaining to a particular term, topic, or concept, at least one source is cited for the interested reader. l 2 USE OF THE GUIDE The guide consists of the main body of definitions and appendixes containing a general drug classification scheme, a comprehensive collection of slang terms for selected drugs, and a list of the acronyms and abbreviations frequently encountered in the drug abuse field and described in the main body of this volume. Terms are I isted in alphabetical order. Drugs are defined under their generic names. Brand names (as listed in the 1981 Physician's Desk Reference) are presented in the body of the drug definitions. Users starting out with brand names only are referred to appendix A, where both brand and generic names for all of the drugs contained in this volume ap -'ear. Drug definitions also indicate the drug's classification and common slang names. A complete clas\u00ad sification scheme for the drugs contained in this guide is presented in appendix A. Only the most common and currently used drug slang terms are included in the body of the definition. If the drug is one of those for which a comprehensive list of slang ter:ms is presented in appen\u00ad dix B, the reader is referred there. The inclusion of nondrug slang terms in this volume was done sparingly for the reasons that (1) there are numerous, well-done drug slang dictionaries currently in existence, and (2) the primary emphasis of the guide is on research-literature-based terminology. Only those slang terms are included that are frequently encountered in the literature and/or are conceptually important in understanding drug abuse issues (e.g., rush, booting, chipping). Readers inter\u00ad ested in defining drug slang terms are referred to the bibliography in appendix B. Terms that appear in the body of definitions with all letters capitalized are defined elsewhere in the guide. Terms appearing in the guide that may be useful to the reader of a particular defi\u00ad nition are noted at the end by \"See: ... \" or \"See also ... \" Research Issues Series Volume 27, Guide to the Orug Research Literature, is a cumulative index to the first 26 volumes in the series. If the term being defined is indexed in Research Issues Series Volume 27, the term or related term, the page number, and the number of literature ref\u00ad erence entries to be found there are listed in parentheses at the end of the definition. Terms in the guide that are listed in volume 27 are indicated at the end of individual entries in the following ma'mer: (RI S 27: 300--33 entries) This entry, for example, refers to Research Issues Series No. 27:page 300--33 entries listed. A reference may also be included for a term that is different from but related to the term being defined. For example: term: anesthetics reference: (anesthetic uses, RIS 27:304--8 entries) The format components for the definitions are explained and demonstrated graphically in figure 1 on the following page.

Winick (1974) has nroposed several basic reasons for tempo~ary or permanent abstinence from illicit drug use: 1. External circumstances--drug not avail\u00ad able, lack of money, court pressure, leave community, job, response to threat. 2. Relationships jeopardized by continued d~ug use--Ioss of a significant relation\u00ad ship, friends, family difficulties. 3.

The methodology is more in the tradition of insurance\u00b7 research and population surveys than of psychology or sociology, in which one develops actuarial tables in order to predict such attributes as probability of a tobacco smoker's death ~t ,a given age. In psychological testing, It IS used to predict a diagnostic classi-fication from a series of test scores (Sines 1976) acute Of short duration and usually of great sharpness or intensity. Contrast with chronic. addict A nebulous term that generally refers to one who habitually uses drugs, especially morphine or heroin, to the extent that cessation causes severe physical or psy\u00ad chological trauma or both (Encyclopedia of Sociology 1981). Rittenhouse (1977: 243) suggests reserving this term to medical diagnosis describing a physical or psychic dependence (as judged by the diagnosti\u00ad cian). See also addiction. addiction From the Latin verb uaddicere,1I to give or bind a person to one thing or another. Generally used in the drug field to refer to chronic, compulsive. or uncontrollable drug use, to the extent that a person (referred to as an \"addict\") cannot or will not stop the use of some drug. Beyond this, the term is ambiguously used with a wide variety of often arbitrary meanings and connotations; sometimes interchange\u00ad ably with, sometimes in contrast to, two other ill-defined terms, HABITUATION and (DRUG) DEPENDENCE, the former imprecisely referring to some lesser form of chronic drug use, the latter capable of being either of psychological or physical origin, often in varying combinations depending on the drug. I t usually implies a strong (PSYCHOLOGICAL) DEPENDENCE and (PHYSICAL) DEPENDENCE resulting in a WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME when use of the drug is stopp'ed. Many definitions place primary stress on psychological fac\u00ad tors, such as loss of self-control and over\u00ad powering desires; Le., addiction is any state in which one craves the use of a drug and uses it frequently. Others use the term as a synonym for physiological dependence; still others see it as a com\u00ad bination. The primary popular stereotype, what has been called the IIclassical definition of addiction,\" is that it is an extraordinarily debilitating vice ordisease--even an evil and sinful state--rooted in the invariable pharmacological effects of a drug on the. human body, an irrevocable process that involves the presence of tolerance and results in a withdrawal syndrome that can be avoided only by total abstinence (Peele 1977) . The classical definition of addiction further links this phenomenon particularly 5 to the\u00b7 OPIATE NARCOTICS. Like the popular concept of narcotics, this classical definition emerged in the 19205 out of a blending of popular and scientific terminol\u00ad ogy laden with emotional and imprecise meanings. The term lIaddictll began to be increasingly stigmatized and used by both the scientific and lay communities to express that the compulsive use of opiates was not just a bad habit but was worse both to the individual and society than other forms of habituation, such as to tobacco and alcohol, and resulted in debil\u00ad ity, insanity, crime, and death. Recent historical and research data have shown, however, that the two fundamental components of this classical definition--that addiction is purely physiological and that opiate narcotics are the sole source of addiction--are not valid ani in fact the stereotype of the addict is often fictional (Peele 1977; Johnson 1978). Many heroin users remain chippers (see CHIPPING) or controlled occasional users for years (Powell 1973; Jacobsen and Zinberg 1975); many users voluntarily give up heroin relatively easily under changing circum\u00b7\" stances (Robins 1973; Winick 1962), and opium has been used for centuries in India without a serious addiction problem devel\u00ad oping. Furthermore, it has been shown that some heroin users have believed them- 'selves to be nhysiologically addicted ev:en though the amounts they consume are much too small to have any such effects and that opiate withdrawal syndromes can be a conditioned response occurring with very low levels of consumption and even total absence of opiate use (Fazey 1977: 1 0) . Many emphasize that addiction cannot be used solely in regard to the opiates nor can it be used solely as a synonym for physiological dependence: \"Addiction can\u00ad not be used interchangeably with physical dependence. It is possible to be physically dependent on a drug \\yithout being addicted. It is possible to be addicted without being physically dependentll (Jaffe 1975: 285) . From the 1920s and to the early 1960s an attempt was made to differentiate between ADDICTION and HABITUATION. In the mid 1960s the World Health Organization recommended that both terms be abandoned in favor of drug dependence (Eddy et al. 1965) Since then, many authorities have recommended that, like the term lIabuse,lI the term lIaddictionll has been applied so arbitrarily and illogically that its use should be entirely abandoned. Neverthe\u00ad less, lIaddictionll and \"addict\" are still widely used, particularly in regard to the opiate narcotics. As Bean (1974) observes, this may be due to the popularity of the term as well as the fact that it is simply easier to refer to an \"addict\" than a \"drug dependent person\" and that the substitu\u00ad tions so far recommended, such as \"drug dependence,1I ha'o';. only marginally affected the underlying dd'initional problems sur\u00ad rounding this word. Others increasingly emphasize that the solution to this defini\u00ad tional problem is not to avoid all use of \"addiction\" but to cultivate an understand\u00ad ing that addiction is not a purely pharma\u00ad cological process linked to the opiates or any other drug. It is not drugs who addict people but people who become addicted to drugs, just as they can and do become addicted to any compelling experience (Laurie 1971; Peele 1976, 1977, 1978). (addiction careers, RIS 27:301--10 entries; addiction models, RIS 27:301--16 entries) addiction-prone personal ity A theory of ADDICTION that states that only certain kinds of individuals with spe\u00ad cific psychological affinities that are satis\u00ad fied by opiate narcotics will take favorably to these drugs and will continue to use thelT, in the face of severe social opposition. More recently the addiction-pre\"'.2 theory has been discounted by many researchers who argue that addicts do not make up a homogeneous group but, rather, reflect divergent personality configurations (Gendreau and Gendreau 1970).

See also dilution; misrepresentation, drug. (adulterants, RIS 27:301--9 entries) adverse drug reaction A negative somatic or psychological reaction to drug taking. A major problem in drug research has been the lack of agreement concerning what actually constitutes an adverse reaction; many studies do not dis\u00ad tinguish between types of adverse reac\u00ad tions, or they use subjective or poorly defined definitions. Naditch (1974) empha\u00ad sizes the need to distinguish between acute and chronic adverse rear.:tions. Acute adverse reactions include feelings of losing control, disintegration, fears of insanity or death, despair, suicidal thoughts, and strong negative affect. Naditch excludes from the definition of this term counter\u00ad normative behavior (i. e., reactions to the drug experience that do not precipitate an acute anxiety state) and chronic or long-term reactions. Greenblatt and Shader (1975) state that, \"Many clinicians feel that individuals who are emotionally stable and well-adjusted benefit most or are harmed least by drugs of abuse, v.'hile those who are labile of affect and who have difficulty coping with ambiguity, uncertainty, dysphoric sensations, or dis\u00ad torted perceptions are more likely to experience adverse drug reactions. II Although cases of psychological drug reac\u00ad tions, or so-called \"bad trips, II are usually associated in the mind of the public with the use of hallucinogens, they may also be caused by the use of AMPHETAMINES, anticholinergics, ANTIHISTAMINES, and SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS.

Brown and Ashery (1979:165) define aftercare as IIthose community interventions designed to permit the client's effective irtegration/ reintegration into society. . .. Aftercare activities can be viewed as a first line of defense against return to drug use.\" A ftercare activities would include involve\u00ad ment in activities such as self-help groups, supported work programs, and staff fol\u00ad lowup contacts and inteventions. agitation Ext.:essive restlessness suggestive of severe internal tension; manifested by pacing, hand wringing, fidgeting, and other forms of constant motor activity. One of the major symptoms of nonfatal drug overdose. agonist The original Greek meaning of this term denotes something involved in a struggle for victory. Its pharmacological meaning implies a substance that can bind at the molecular level with a receptor site to pro\u00ad duce a pharmacological action. The inter\u00ad action of the agonist at the receptor site can be displaced by its ANTAGONIST, which ha::. the effect of completely or par\u00ad tially nullifying the pharmacological action of the agonist depending upon the purity of the antagonist. HEROIN, for exaMple, is an agonist; NAL TREXONE is a pure antagonist to heroin; CYCLAZOCINE is a mixed antagonist to heroin having some slight agonist properties of its own. See (narcotic) antagonist; receptors. alcohol Commonly, any beverage that contains ethyl the pro\u00ad duced naturally by FERMENTATION of fruits, vegetables, or grains, alcohol is the oldest and the most widely used social drug in the world. A eNS depressant, depending on the concentration consumed, alcohol acts as an analgesic, tranquilizer, sedative-hypnotic, soporific, intoxicant, anesthetic, or narcotic. At low <\":oses, it can act as a stimulant. At high doses it can create stupor. J se with other depres\u00ad sants, or with antihistamines or solvents, can be extremely dangerous. Alcoholic beverages are usually classified into the fermented drinks BEER and WI NE and DISTILLED SPIRITS. Fermented drinks 7 <-ontain about 2 percent to 17 percent alco-. hoi; distilled spirits can contain over 90 percent alcohol (e.g., grain alcohol). Classification: sedative/hypnotics. See also absolute alcohol; liquor. Slang names: booze, juice. (RIS 27:198--118 entries) A Icohol and Drug Education Service A Canadian organization involved in drug abuse prevention.

An alkali and an ACID neutralize each other to form a salt. alkaloids A diverse group of some 5,000 bitter com\u00ad pounds of plant origin containing nitrogen as well as carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, that are usually physiologically or phar\u00ad macologically active (e.g., produce mind\u00ad altering or toxic effects). Most medicinal and toxic plants, as well as hallucinogenic plants owe their biological activity to alka\u00ad loids. Examples include caffeine, mor\u00ad phine, and nicotine. (THC, the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, is an exception.) The term is also applied to synthetic (i.e., made by a chemical process) alka~l)ids, which have structures similar to plant alkaloids. Often a synonym for ACTIVE INGREDIENT.

The underlying assumption is that illicit drug use becomes a less attractive outlet for individuals who are involved with constructive activities of their own choosing. The key element in the alternatives concept is process rather than product. The specific activities and outlets are secondary. Of primary impor\u00ad tance is the process that takes place within the individual of exploring and searching for ways to satisfy inner needs. In the words of Allan Cohen (1975), who has written extensively on alternatives: ilLog\u00ad ically, alternatives to drugs should corre\u00ad spond to .J-\"e motives impelling persons toward e'r.crimentation or continued abuse.

West (196B) and David Smith (1968) to describe a condition associ\u00ad ated with regular marijuana use by youths in which the individual adopts an attitude and behavior that is asocial, nondirectional and cops out on established values. The amotivational syndrome is characterized by apathy; loss of effectiveness; and a dimin\u00ad ished capacity to carry out complex, long-term plans, endure frustrations, con\u00ad centrate for long periods, follow routines, or successfully master new material. There is a considerable controversy over whether the amotivational syndrome does or does not exist, but Dr. Sidney Cohen (in press) notes, \"A number of health care profes\u00ad sionals .. have .. provided similar reports on adolescents and young adults. Apathy and loss of goals are mentioned in connection with consistent marijuana use. It appears that almost every provider of health care to young people has seen one or a series of such poorly motivated young men and women who have dropped out, or who have had to drop out, of their school\u00ad ing or job because of an inability to keep Up.1I (RIS 27:304--5 entries) 9 amphetamine relatives Also c::.llp.d lIamphetamine ANALOGUES\" or \"amphetamine CO N GEN ERS.

Classi;'ication: stimulants--primary. (amphetamines, RIS 27:199--136 entries) amphetamine sulfate The least potent of the amphetamines, manufactured as Benzedrine. Synthesized in 1927, it was first used in 1932 as an inhaler decongestant and in the treatment of NARCOLEPSY. During World War II it was used on troops to counteract fatigue. Classification: stimulants--primary. 13 entries) amphetamines A given to a class of syn\u00ad thetic sympathomimetic amines that are similar in some ways to the body's own adrenaline (epinephrine) and that act with a pronounced stimulant effect on the cen\u00ad tral nervous system (Grinspoon and Hedblom 1975). Chemically there are three similar types: racemic amphetamine or AMPHETAMINE amphetamine sulfate being the least potent and methamphetamine the most, and dex\u00ad troamphetamine having the fewest side effects. Varying only in the degree of control over peripheral effects and potency, the amphetamines have been used medically as an aid in dieting by depressing appetite, as an energizer and euphoriant, as an antidepressant, to combat narcolepsy (involuntary sleep), hyperkinesis, and to promote alertness, retention, and wakeful- ness. Widespread use and abuse of amphetamines occurred following World War II when war-time stockpiles became avail\u00ad able and were marketed on a nonprescrip\u00ad tion, over-the-counter basis, with use reaching epidemic proportions in Japan and Sweden (Ellinwood 1974). Now gener\u00ad ally under Government control, in the United States amphetamines were first regu\u00ad lated with the DRUG ABUSE CONTROL AMENDMENTS OF 1965. Classification: stimulants--primary.

Effects take place within 30 seconds and last only 2 to 3 minutes. Unlike other inhalants, amyl nitrite is a stimulant rather than a depressant, and may be dangerous for people with low blood pressure, glaucoma, or anemia. Among illicit users, the drug is prized for its alleged sexual stimulation or prolongation of orgasm effects. Usually sold in small glass vials.

Analgesics may be divided into three basic categories: (1) the OPIATE NARCOTICS-\u00ad e.g., contemporary Western cul\u00ad ture, the analgesics have been the major objects for drug addiction and there has been a continuing, as yet unsuccessful, effort to <produce a \"nonaddictive analgesic\" (Peele 1978). (RIS 27:201--5 entries) analog A thing or part that is similar or compa\u00ad rable in certain respects with something else; in biology, similar in function but not origin and structure. The OPIOIDS are often referred to as \"opiate analogues. II See also congener. anesthetics A class of inhalant drugs that abolish the sensation of pain; used medically during surgical procedures. Local anesthetics produce loss of sensation only at the area of drug injection and are not used recrea-10 tionally. General anesthetics affect the entire body and may produce loss of con- sciousness. While a number of drugs (e.g., barbiturates, cocaine) have anes\u00ad thetic properties, the principal anesthetics are the vaporous CHLOROFORM and ETHER, and the inhalants. See analgesics. anomie As initially developed by Emile Durkheim, the concept referred to a state of society characterized by a condition of relative normlessness, a general breakdown or absence of norms governing individual and group behavior, which developed out of instability and change and w~ich was char\u00ad acterized by elements of anxiety, isolation, and purposelessness. As the utility of the concept for understanding diverse forms of deviant behavior became evident, it was extended to refer to a condition of individuals rather than their environment. As conceptualized by Riesman (1950) and others, the psychological conception of anomie signifies a state of mind (not a state of society) of an individual who no longer has any moral roots or standards, no sense of continuity, folk, or obligation; the personal disorganization characterized by an individual's feeling of detachment from society and its norms. In this usage, the term is often used synonymously with ALIENATION. As conceived by Merton (1957:162-163), the sociological concept of anomie refers to \"a breakdown in the cul\u00ad tu ral structu re, occurring particularly when there is an acute disjunction between the cultural norms and go<\"ls and the socially structured capacities of members of the group to act in accord with them. II Merton argues that a situation such as this leads to a higher rate of deviant behavior. (RIS 27:304--6 entries) anorectic A drug that decreases appetite; used to treat overweight people.

Generally divided into the tri\u00ad cyclic compounds AMITRIPTYLINE HYDRO\u00ad CHLORIDE CElavi!) and IMIPRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (Tofranil). and the MAO IN H I B I TO RS, the antidepressants are rarely used for nonmedical purposes since they have little immediate pleasurable effect on normal mood states (LeDain et al 1973). This varied group of drugs seems to have a stimulant effect in cases of pathologic depression but appears to have little effect in normal states. Chronic usage, however, has been shown to have dearly defined stimulatory action (Shulgin 1975). While some of the STIMULANTS have been medi\u00ad cally used as antidepressants, their block the effects of the substance histamine on effector cells in the nerves and that are used in the treatment of allergies and the mitigation of symptoms such as sneez\u00ad ing, itching, and runny nose. Usually they are abused with codeine or alcohol because they act synergistically to magnify the sedative effects of both.

This state occurs with heavy users of central nervous system DEPRESSANTS and it has been suggested that it accounts for some deaths from BARBITURAT: over\u00ad dosage. According tQ this theory, the drug creates a confused state and the user does not recall taking the dose; while in this condition the individual takes another capsule; this process often continues until a lethal overdose has been ingested. Mal\u00ad colm (1971 :151) considers this theory entirely speculative and unproven: \"If a person takes an overdose of barbiturates he intends either to die or to indicate to certain significant people that his environ\u00ad ment must change. If his intention is the latter and he dies, it is accidental, but this accident is not due to automatism.\" aversion therapy In BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION, the reduc\u00ad tion of a behavior through a conditioning procedure in which the behavior is associ\u00ad ated with real or imagined noxious stimuli (for example, an electric shock), which would be avoided if possible (Chaplin 1975) . A tr'eCltment that suppresses unde\u00ad sirable behavior by associating a painful or unpleasant reaction with the behavior (A Psychiatric Glossary 1975). Aversion therapy is frequently used in smoking ces\u00ad sation programs. 12 bad trip See pan ic reaction. bag Slang. A quantity of leafy or powdered illicit drug (e.g., marijuana, heroin) that comes in a paper or glassine envelope or plastic bag. Local convention and prevail\u00ad ing illicit drug prices determine the quan\u00ad tities of drugs sold by the \"bag.\" The terms \"nickel\" ($5) and \"dime\" ($10) bags have long been used as standard street retail units for the packaging of small quantities of drugs, but they have been made nearly extinct by inflation over the years. balloon effect Refers to the phenomenon of drug users substituting the use of one type of drug for another when authorities clamp down on their original drug of choice; like a balloon, when drug use is squeezed in one direction it often expands in another, often with adverse results. For example, heroin use increased in Southern California after Operation Intercept's blockade of Mexican marijuana (Bryant et al. 1973). bam Slang. Street name for PHENMETRAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (Preludin). barbital One of the long-acting BARBITURATES. Manufactured in 1883, barbital was one of the first barbiturates used in medicine. Manufactured as Veronal. Classification: sedative/hypnotics. barbiturates The largest and most common group of the synthetic sedative/hypnotics. In small doses they are effective in sedation and in relieving tension and anxiety, and, like TRANQUILIZERS, they do not cause much drowsiness. In larger doses they are used as hypnotics (sleep inducers). Certain barbiturates are used for epilepsy and intravenous anesthesia. When large dos\u00ad ages are not followed by sleep, signs of mental confusion, euphoria, and even stim\u00ad ulation may occur, similar to that produced by ALCOHOL, another sedative/hypnotic. Hence barbiturates are often used recrea\u00ad tionally by people seeking similar effects to those produced by alcohol, often com\u00ad bining the two. As alcohol potentiates (see POTENTIATION) barbiturate effects, this practice is extremely hazardous. Bar\u00ad biturates are also used in combination with, or as a substitute for other depressants, such as heroin, and are often taken alter\u00ad nately with AMPHETAMINES, as they tend to enhance the euphoric effects of ampheta\u00ad mines while calming the overwrought nerv\u00ad ous states they produce. In large dosages they can cause severe porsoning, deep comas, respIratory and kidney failure, and death. Thus barbiturates playa lead\u00ad ing role in fatal poisonings and suicides in the United States. (DRUG) AUTOMA\u00ad TISM has been identified as a potential cause of deaths due to excessive barbitur\u00ad ate use. Since first used in 1903, over 2,500 bar\u00ad biturates have been produced, but only 50 commercial brands are now available and only 12 are widely used. In 1970, barbiturates and barbiturate substitutes accounted for 28.6 percent of all prescrip\u00ad tions for psychoactive drugs in America (National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse 1973:43). Although still con\u00ad sidered indispensible in medicine, their medical applications .have declined primarily due to the availability of other drugs with similar effects such as the antianxiety tranquil izers and other nonbarbiturate sedative-hypnotics. The barbiturates are usually divided into three categories according to the rate of speed with which they are eliminated from the body: (1) and (3) ultra-short-acting (under 3 hours)--THIOPENTAL SODIUM (Pentothal). The most widelv abused and dangerous are the short-to-i\"ntermediate\u00ad acting barbiturates. Primarily prescribed to treat sleep disturbances, they are the ones most likely to be used to produce intoxication, to be found on the illicit market, and to be used in suicide attempts.

British system Most generally, refers to the medically oriented treatment of opiate users in Great Britain, which has allowed users to obtain and use opiates legally. This medical, noncriminal approach has been credited with limiting heroin use, preventing the development of a black market, reducing drug-related crime, and enabling addicts 15 to lead more useful lives,. and has been recommended as a model for implementation in the United States. It has been widely praised by advocates of heroin maintenance. (See MAINTENANCE TREATMENT.) How\u00ad ever, several problems surround the use of this concept. First, British pol icy has undergone significant changes in the course of the 20th century. Before 1968 the Ilsystemll was not a government\u00ad sponsored pt'ogram but rather a policy that allowed private physicians to treat opiate users and prescribe maintenance doses. However, in the 1960s when heroin use among young \u00b7males began to increase, this approach was altered and a new government-sponsored program was estab\u00ad lished that imposed stricter controls on the manufacture, sale, and possession of opiate drugs, and instituted a program of addict notification and treatment through clinics. Addicts could still get maintenance doses of low-cost heroin, but only from government-authorized treatment centers or from licensed physicians. Second, the very nature and effectiveness of British policy before the 1967 act and afterward, and its applicability or comparability to the American situation (particularly the concept of heroin maintenance) are still controversial. Wh ile some observers view the clinics as a maintenance system, others maintain they are presently abstinence ori\u00ad ented; others observe that the clinics are in fact moving from using heroin to using methadone (Austin 1978: 165) bromides Nonbarbiturate sedative drugs that were first introduced into medicine in 1857 for the treatment of epilepsy. U nl ike most DEPRESSANTS, bromides do not effectively induce sleep in large, single doses. They were wIdely employed, usually administered chronically for their cumulative sedative effects. Overdosage of bromides can cause serious mental disturbances similar to ALCOHOLISM and a disturbance of sleep. Replaced since 1900 by the BARBITURATES and other more effective, less toxic drugs, bromides are still employed as headache remedies and nonprescription \"sleeping pi lis.

Treasury Department headed by the Com\u00ad missioner of Narcotics which was respon\u00ad sible for administering and enforcing those sections of the I nternal Revenue Code tax\u00ad ing NARCOTICS and marijuana, the Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942, and the N A R\u00ad COTIC DRUGS IMPORT AND EXPORT ACT OF 1922. Its goal was to investigate, detect, and prevent violations of laws pro\u00ad hibiting unauthorized possession, sale, or transfer of opium, opium derivatives, syn\u00ad thetic opiates, cocaine, and marijuana. (See HARRISON NARCOTICS ACT.) In 1968, the agency was transferred to the Department of Justice and was merged with the BUREAU OF DRUG ABUSE CONTROL to create the BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS. burnout Term used to describe a condition experi\u00ad enced by chronic users who use a drug or drugs (mostly nonnarcotic) to the extent that their thought processes become impaired, and they take on a SPACED OUT or \"vegged out\" appearance and manner. Also, the saturation point reached by chronic drug users, particularly addicts, when the maladaptive ness of the lifestyle becomes so salient that the \"hassle\" becomes more important than the satisfac\u00ad tion and the dependent person stops tak\u00ad ing drugs (Winic,k 1978:233).

(RIS 27:202--6 entries; coffee, RIS 27:204--2 entries) caffeinism The excessive ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, usually in coffee or tea, for prolonged periods. This practice is a common lifestyle element among certain Canadian Indian yroups (excessive strong tea consumption) (Farkas 1979) and certain types of white collar workers. I ngestion of 200 mg of caffeine daily (an average cup of tea contains about 65 mg of caffeine) can cause physiological prob\u00ad lems and dosages in the 370 to 650 mg per day range are considered to be indicative of physiological and psychological depend\u00ad ence (Gilbert 1976; Grenden 1974). Toxic reactions to excessive caffeine con\u00ad sumption are manifold and include (Farkas 1979): dizziness tremu lousness apprehension insomnia diarrhea headache lightheadedness breath lessness hard breathing reflex hyperexcitability muscle twitching excessive sensibility ringing in ears visual flashes of light heart palpitations rapidity of heart action nervousness irritability agitation absence of heart rhythm flushing hypotension Canada, the drug problem in See Addiction Research Foundation; Alco\u00ad hol and Drug Education Service; Commis\u00ad sion of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use (Le Dain Commission). cannabidiol (CBD) A nonpsychoactive cannabinoid found in MARIJUANA. It is currently under study for use as an anticonvulsive agent. cannabinoids Chemical derivatives unique to the CAN\u00ad NABIS plant, such as THC and CBD. cannabis A major classification of drugs derived from the botanical plant class of the\u00b7 same name (\"cannabis\" is the Latin word for hemp). Both cannabis and marijuana are often used interchangeably as general terms to refer to all of the various associ\u00ad ated preparations that are consumed for their intoxicating properties. Botanists have been at odds since the 16th century over whether cannabis consists of only one species (Cannabis sativa) or more than one species. That there are different strains of cannabis has not been in ques\u00ad tion; whether these strains possess qual\u00ad ities of a true species or lesser taxonomic designations, such as races, ecotypes, cultivars, chemovars, and so on, has been at issue (Schultes and Hofmann 1980). 17 Current research indicates the classification consists of more than one species. Bota\u00ad nists such as Richard E. Schultes at Harvard University and Loran C. Anderson at Florida State University conclude suffi\u00ad cient scip.ntific evidence exists to support three sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderarrs:-\u00ad C. sativa grows to a height of 18 feet, is loosely branched, and thrives in cool, damp cl imates. C. indica grows from 3i to 4 feet, is conical in shape, and thrives i!1 hot, dry climates. C. ruderalis grows from 1 to 2t feet, is dense and never branches, and is found primarily in Russia. There are other distinguishing features as well, related to cell and leaf structures. There are gelatinous fibers in the wood and vessels that exist singly or in small groups in C. sativa. C. indka has libri\u00ad form fibers in~wood and its vessels occur in large groups. C. ruderalis is mostly intermediary in these characteristics. Alth'.:Jugh the number of leaflets may vary within a species, C. sativa normally has seven leaflets, C. indica has nine, and C. ruderalis has three:--The leaflet of C. sativa is narrow, or lanceolate. The C. indica leaflet is broad, or oblanceolate. And the C. ruderalis leaflet is oval, or eliptic, being broadest at the mid-length cf the leaf (Anderson 1974, 1980). All three species contain THC; C. indica produces the most and C. ruderalis the least. Cannabis has been cultivated for thousands of years for its intoxicating flowering tops and leaves, its fibrous stems and branches, and its nutritious seeds. A strain that is high in one of these three qualities tends to be low in the other two. C. indica, for example, is very low in fiber content but generates the most potent marijuana. C. sativa produces the hemp fibers that have been used for centuries for making rope and coarse woven products, but races of C. sativa high in this quality contain very littleTHC (less than 0.5 percent). The seeds of C. sativa can also be harvested for use as animal feed and for producing oil that is used in cooking and in making paint. The psychoactive effects from ingesting cannabis vary considerably depending on such factors as potency, the SET (mood and expectations) of the user, and the environment in which the drug is consumed. Effects similar to the depressants, stimu\u00ad lants, and hallucinogens have all been observed. Cannabis is, therefore, classi\u00ad fied in this volume as a category of its own. See also marijuana, sinsemilla. (RIS 27:203--21 entries; entries) carbon tetrachloride A highly tOXic, chlorinated hydrocarbon liquid, at one time widely used as a SOLVENT in cleaning fluids, which when inhaled produces INTOXICATION.

See also neuro\u00ad transmission. causal Two phenomena are said to have a causal relationship if the one affects and is inci\u00ad dental to the occurrence of the other, rather than frequently appearing with but coincidental to the occurrence of the other. For example, prolonged injection of heroin has a causal relationship to heroin addic\u00ad tion. Heroin addiction is highly associated with liver disease, but there is no causal relationship as in the case of alcohol and liver disease. The liver disease associated with heroin use has a causal relationship with unsanitary injection procedures and not either the heroin or the addiction per se. See corollary.

Its main offices are located in Atlanta. The Center administers national programs for the prevention and control of commu\u00ad nicable and vector-borne diseases and other preventable conditions, including the con\u00ad trol of chilqhood lead-based paint poisoning and urban rat control. The Center di rects and enforces foreign quarantine activities and regulations; provides consultation and assistance in upgradi ng the performance of clinical laboratories, and evaluates and licenses clinical laboratories engaged in interc;tate commerce; and administers a nationwide program of research, informa\u00ad tion, and education in the field of smoking and health.

A new technique that has been under study as a substitute for the method of observed urination is based upon the measurement of urine temperature immedi\u00ad ately after the specimen is SUbmitted. Judson et al. (1979:198) in their research found that 99 percent of urine measure\u00ad ments fell in the range between 32.5 and 36.7 degrees centigrade using the following procedures: \"In our clinic the lavatory adjoins the dispensary, with a shuttered window in the wall between the two rooms, through which the patient passes the specimen immediately after urination. There is no hot water and no electric out\u00ad let. Only one patient at a time is allowed in the lavatory. The patient is given a 60-ml screw-cap polypropylene urine bottle (4 cm diameter, 5.5 cm to neck, Riekus Container Co., Emeryville, California) and a Styrofoam insu lating cube measu ring 12 cm on a side. The cube has a hole in the center just big enough to hold the urine bottle. Men are instructed to uri\u00ad nate di rectly into the urine bottle, making sure to fill it; women urinate into a paper cup, then pour the urine into the bottle. The bottle is then placed in the cube and passed through the window into the dis\u00ad pensary. Immediately, the nurse places a laboratory-type centigrade thermometer (-1 to 51\u00b0C, with 1/10\u00b0 gradations) in the (jottle. Exactly 30 seconds later (when the thermometer reading has stabilized) the temperatu re is read.

(situational drug use, RI S 27: 384-- 10 entries) Civil Addict Prugram, California The California CIVI L COMMITMENT pro\u00ad gram established in 1964. The program was enacted in 1961 to provide IInonpuni\u00ad tive treatmentll and to control the addict \"for the prevention of contamination of others and protection of the publicll (McGlothlin 1976; Kramer 1970). The pro\u00ad gram calls for mandatory periods of con\u00ad finement for treatment, followed by release to close parole supervision with chemical antinarcotic testing. Commitment may take place in three ways: (1) 7-year commit\u00ad ment following conviction for a felony or misdemeanor; (2) 7-year commitment for being an addict or lIin imminent danger of becoming an acjdict\"; (3) voluntary, self\u00ad commitment for n years. Those most suc\u00ad cessfu\u0001 may earn early discharges. McGlothlin (1976) notes that the term llcivil commitment\" is essentially a misnomer as the system is really an alternative sentenc\u00ad ing disposition. The main inpatient facility is the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) at Corona. civil commitment A compulsory procedure whereby a drug addict is involuntarily confined for a speci\u00ad fied period in a special treatment facility (sometimes only a modified prison) for detoxification and rehaf\">ilitation. Civil commitment is not a treatment mechanism per se but rather a vehicle for retaining individuals while they participate in a given course of treatment. It is this forced and prolonged supervision that distinguishes. it from voluntary programs (Brown 1973:132) . 20 The concept of civil commitment developed out of the procedures established in the middle of the 19th century in which the State committed the mentally ill to public asylums where they often remained until \"cured.\" By the turn of the century the procedure had been adopted for the cure of \"inebriates,\" meaning chronic users of alcohol or any other' drug. I n the 1920s' the responsibility for dealing with the users of prohibited substances was surren\u00ad dered to the criminal process, but the \"noncriminal\" commitment process attracted revived interest in the early 1960s. Civil commitment programs were instituted in California (the CIVIL ADDICT PROGRAM), New York (the NARCOTIC ADDICTION CONTROL COMMISSION), Massachusetts, and other States, and by the Federal Government (the N ARA program), following the 1962 landmark Supreme Court decision that held that narcotic addiction itself con\u00ad stituted an illness rather than a crime and could not be punished as a criminal offense. (See ROBINSON v. CALIFORNIA). Although various programs exist employing different therapeutic techniques, what uniquely characterizes all civil commitment programs is the involuntary manner in which addicts are recruited into the pro\u00ad gram through the CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYS\u00ad TEM. An addict who has been arrested for a crime can choose to stand trial or enter a rehabilitation program lasting about 3 years. I f the addict does not choose to enter the program and is found guilty While standing trial, authorities can still send the addict to the rehabilitation center. Most programs incorporate provisions for the courts to dismiss criminal charges upon successful completion. Civil commit\u00ad ment programs are not limited just to addicts charged or convicted of crimes. .....rograms generally also include noncrimi\u00ad nals (committed on the basis of suspected future criminal activity) and volunteers. IICommitment\" is sometimes referred to as IIcertification\" (Waldorf 1973 ~ 1 03) Supporters argue that in order for treat\u00ad ment to be successful, compulsory con\u00ad finement in a drug-free surrounding is essential and that it is the duty of the State to safeguard and treat those who are unable or unwilling to do so voluntarily. Critics argue that: (1) the program is not really nonpunitive or different from imprisonment; (2) it has caused court con\u00ad gestion; (3) it is an infringement on the right of noncriminal addicts to be free, an inherent contradiction to the notion of individual liberty; (4) it has not been suc\u00ad cessful in treatment; (5) commitment for treatment that has not been proven effec-tive is cruel and unusual punishment; and (6) the whole program is a subterfuge around the protection afforded to a person accused of a crime but not afforded to those suffering from an illness (Wicks and Platt 1977; McGlothlin 1976; Kramer 1970; Abromsky and McCarthy 1977; Beckett Thomas 1976).

Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP) A reporting system that is required to be used by all federally supported drug abuse treatment facilities. CODAP was originally designed and implemented under the direc\u00ad tion of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAODAP) in order to replace a variety of incompatible Federal reports and to provide the single source of comparable information needed for policy management at the national level. The CODAP system is essentially composed of two reports: (1) an Admission Report, which deals with the type of treatment assigned to the patient, demographic data, prior treatment experience, and drug usage patterns, and (2) the Discharge Report, which provides information on reason for discharge, time in treatment, demographic data, and drug use status at time of discharge. Items from the reports are included in NIDA Research Issues Series volume 12: Drug Abuse Instrument Handbook. clinical A method or approach toward the diagno\u00ad sis and prognosis of adjustmental disorders and the prescribing of treatment centered on the investigation of background factors, family relationships, tests, etc. Clinical psychology is that branch of psychology that deals with the psychological knowledge and practices employed in helping a client who has some behavior or emotional dis\u00ad order. It includes training and actual practice in diagnosis, treatment, and pre\u00ad vention, as well as research (Chaplin 1975; English and English 1958). clonidine Originally developed as an antihypertensive medicine, clonidine has been found to be an effective nonopiate drug for controlling withdrawal from op:\"ltes and opioids. Sub-21 jects experience only mild discomfort detox\u00ad ifying with clonidine, and its use has been proposed as a transition drug to bridge the gap in moving addicts from methadone treatmlmt to antagonist (e.g., naltrexone) treatment (Gold et al. 1980, 1978). clortermine hydrochloride A SYMPATHOMIMETIC AMINE used as Voranil. Classification: CNS See .:entral nervous system. coca A bush (Erythroxylon coca) that is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America and whose leaves contain the ALKALOID cocaine. Not to be con\u00ad fused with the cacao plant, which produces cocoa, Coca leaves have been chewed for centuries by the mountain Indians of Peru and Bolivia for a wide variety of medicinal, social, and religious purposes. Its stimu\u00ad lant and appetite-depressant effects were sought to counteract fatigue and hunger and cold. Among the Incas, before the Spanish invasion, coca played a prominent role in religious customs and ceremonies and was considered a divine plant. In the later part of the 19th century, coca elixirs, lozenges, and teas were commonly taken in the United States and Europe; most popular was Angelo Mariani's Yin Mariani, an infusion of coca leaf and wine. In the 1850s, cocaine, the principal active ingredient of coca, was isolated and was hailed by many as a wonder drug. Beside cocaine, coca contains a number of other alkaloids and provides a rich supply of vitamins, prompting some researchers to argue that the properties of coca lie in altogether different directions from those of .;ocaine (Aldrich and Barker 1976:6). Classification: stimulants--prima ry. cocaine An alkaloid refined from the coca plant that is a short-acting but powerful stimu\u00ad lant pharmacologically similar to the AMPHETAMINES. Isolated in the 1850s, it was hai~d by many as a wonder drug. Freud recommended its use for the treat\u00ad ment of morphine and alcohol dependence, asthma, digestive disorders, depression, and fatigue. It was also widely valued and used as a local ANESTHETIC and nerve-blocking agent. Now stronger anes\u00ad thetics with fewer stimulant side effects have virtually eliminated its medical useful\u00ad ness, including such synthetic cocainel ike compounds as procaine (Novocain). By the late 19th centu ry cocaine had also achieved considerable popularity in the United States as a general tonic and addic\u00ad tion cure; its exhiiaratiJI~' properties made it a favorite ingredient of medicine, soda pop (including Coca-Cola), and wine (VI N MARIANI). In 1914 its use was controlled by the Harrison Narcotics Act, where it was incorrectly classified as a narcotic. Effects incl ude eup horia, restlessness, excitement, and a feeling of well-being. Users view it as a social drug that facili\u00ad tates interaction (Petersen 1977:9), and an ideal drug in terms of convenience of use, bulk, effects, safety, minimal side effects, and no aftereffects (Siegel 1977). As with the amphetamines, cocaine users often go on RU NS and chronic heavy use can lead to a \"paranoid syndrome\" in which the user is highly suspicious or nervous.

(RI S 27:203--78 entries; anesthetic uses, RIS 27:304--8 entries) cocaine freebase 22 The manufacturing process of converting street cocaine or cocaine hydrochloride into its \"freebase,\" more purified form. This process involves heating ether, lighter fluid, or similar flammable solvents and can be extremely hazardous. Since cocaine in its normal street form is not effective when smoked, an elaborate do-it-yourself chemical process converts it to a much stronger substance called \"free\u00ad base. II This pu rified cocaine base is smoked in a water pipe or sprinkled on a tobacco or marijuana cigarette for a 2- minute, sudden and intense high. The substance is rapidly absorbed by the lungs and carried to the brain in a few seconds. However, the euphoria quickly subsides into a feeling of restless irritability. The freebase posthigh is so uncomfortable that cocaine smokers--in order to maintain the high--often continue smoking until they are exhausted or run out of cocaine. The smoking of cocaine originated in Peru during the early 1970s. The custom quickly spread to several other South American countries, eventually traveling to the United States. The South American practice involves smoking coca paste, an extract produced during the manufacture of cocaine from coca leaves. Slang names: freebase, white tornado, baseball, snowflake.

See also drug use; social-recreational drug compulsive gambling Kusyszyn (1978) has identified four ele\u00ad ments that may be used to distinguish be\u00ad tween different types of gamblers: money, time, other people, and the gambler. According to Kusyszyn (1918: 1 096), \"The four factors are depicted as relatively inde\u00ad pendent: a lot of money is either won or It is lost; a lot of time or only a little time is spent on gambling, other people are either interfered with or are not interfered with, and the gambler perceives himself as healthy or he perceives himself as sick. .

In classical conditioning I a stimulus precedes and elicits a response. A stimulus that normally evokes a particular response is repeatedly paired with another stimulus that does not normally evoke the response. For example, a subject may be conditioned to salivate at the sound of a bell rung repeatedly before food is presented. In instrumental or operant conditioning, the subject first responds to a situation; this response then is reinforced, either posi\u00ad tively or n(.lgatively, by a stimulus. Behav\u00ad iorism has elaborated these forms of con\u00ad ditioning into an encompassing account of human behavior, which is seen as being largely the production of conditioning pro\u00ad cesses (Chaplin 1975).

In the contingency contract concept, the con\u00ad tinuation of specified rewards and privileges becomes contingent upon continuation of a set of agreed-upon behaviors, and vice versa. It has the combined effect of mak\u00ad ing the participant practice PROSOCI AL BEHAVIOR while also subjecting the indi\u00ad vidual to a certain amount of behavioral conditioning to reinforce the practice. Contingency contracting is frequently used in residential drug abuse treatment settings. These programs often use several nonnego\u00ad tiable expected behaviors, as well as indi\u00ad vidually agreed-upon items, in their contingency contracts. One residential drug abuse treatment program, for example, uses nine basel ine contingency contract elements (Beatty 1978): 1. To refrain from all contact with nonpre\u00ad scribed drugs. 2. To contact staff when the urge to use drugs occurs, or at least to inform the staff that drug use has occurred. 3. To record in a pocket log major events of the day, especially changes in emo\u00ad tional state and drug urges. 4. To make a weekly list of long-and short-term goals. 5. To come on time to all meetings and scheduled appointments. 6. To record movement off and on the ward on the Sign-In Sheet. 7. To keep a daily record of requests made of the staff. 8. To seek employment or to work and/or to seek admission to school or attend _lasses. 9. To abide by daily pass hour limits. Beatty (1978) points out three necessary requirements for a contingency contract with an outpatient heroin addict: lilt should substantially contribute to (1) main\u00ad taining the continued participation of the client, (2) demonstrating control over drug-taking and drug-related behavior, and (3) adding to the client's learning of appropriate and adaptive behavior patterns to enable him/her to eventually function drug-free. 11 In either a residential or out\u00ad patient situation, Beatty notes that to achieve success it is essential that both the contingent rewa rds and punishments be meaningful to the person making the contract. control group A group of subjects similar to the EXPERI\u00ad MENTAL GROUP in every respect -except for the independent variables with which the experimental group is being tested. controlled drug use The maintenance of regular, noncompulsive drug use which does not interfere with ordinary functioning; also methods for use which minimize untoward drug effects (Harding and Zinberg 1977:111). See chip\u00ad ping. controlled illicit drug use The persistent use over a period of time of illicit drugs without allowing them to bring abusive effects to the user. Prac\u00ad titioners such as Norman Zinberg and Wayne Harding point out that valuable insights can be drawn by distinguishing between various degrees of drug use. Their studies (Zinberg et al. 1977) profile controlled users as individuals who maintain regular ties to social institutions, maintain ordinary social relationships with nondrug users, wait for \"good\" circumstances to use drugs, adopt group rituals and social sanctions that reinforce but limit drug use. They found that most of their subjects were deviant only by virtue of their illicit drug use. There is also growing recognition that many addicted persons who complete a treatment regimen and are \"rehabilitatedll later return to the controlled use of the same or some other addicting drug. Whether return to functional, controlled use after treatment should be accepted as a realistic goal or discouraged outright is currently a controversial issue (American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse 1978). controlled substances Most commonly, all PSYCHOACTIVE SUB\u00ad STANCES covered by laws regulating their sale and possession. The CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT OF 1970 defines the term as including a\\l substances subject to the act. The term was developed to replace the previous opiate-depressant\u00ad stimulant terminology (Sonnen reich et al. 1973: 197) and is sometimes used to refer only to nonnarcotic drugs such as halluci\u00ad nogens, amphetamines, and barbiturates, which were first brought under regulatory control with the DRUG ABUSE CONTROL AMENDMENTS OF 1965. Controlled Substances Act of 1970 The act establishes five IIschedulesll or classifications of controlled substances according to their potential for abuse, physical and psychological dependence liability, and currently accepted medical use. Schedule I, the most strictly controlled category, includes heroin, mari\u00ad juana, and LSD, and other drugs consid\u00ad ered to have high abuse potential and not recognized for medical use in the United States; they can be obtained only for limited research purposes under special registration requirements. Schedule II drugs (morphine, methadone, and ampheta\u00ad mines) are primarily different from Sched\u00ad ule I drugs in that they have some currently accepted medical uses. The manufacture and distribution of these drugs are controlled by production quotas, strict security regulations, import and export controls, and nonrefillable prescrip\u00ad tion requirements. Illicit sale of Schedule I or II narcotic drugs carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine; for nonnarcC'tic drugs the penalty is 5 years and $15,000. Schedule III, IV, and V drugs are considered in descending order to have less abuse poten\u00ad tial and dependence liability. There is very little difference in the controls that are imposed on these three schedules, except Schedule V drugs, which are gen\u00ad erally sold over the counter and not subject to any refill limitations on prescrip\u00ad tions. Title II of the DRUG ABUSE ACT OF 1970 requires registration of all per\u00ad sons involved in the legitimate distribution of controlled drugs and detailed record\u00ad keeping. Illicit sale of SChedule V drugs carries a maximum of 1 year imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. Illicit possession of 25 any of these substances is a misdemeanor on first offense, punishable by 1 year imprisonment and a $5,000 fine (Falco 1975:1-2) controls, drug Any organized effort to influence the ways drugs are consumed, distributed, and gen\u00ad erally dealt with in a society. According to Bruun et al. (1975:4), it refers to lIall those factors which bear on the legal, eco\u00ad nomic, and physical (the 'reaJl) availability of d rugs to the individual embracing all efforts whether penal, preventative, educa\u00ad tional, or therapeutic. II While some classify DRUG EDUCATION as a control technique, most limit the term to matters of formal controls by institutions and the law. See also controls, socia\\. controls, social Also called \"social sanctions. II The proc\u00ad ess by Which society I or any subg\"oup within society, secures conformity toexpec\u00ad tation on the part of its constituent units, individuals or groups. Social controls may be coercive formal controls and/or persua\u00ad sive informal controls. Coercive control is handled by government and agencies of law, and is accomplished by force or by threat of force, usually in regard to crime deterrence. Persuasive control operates through va!\"ious informal mechanisms that induce the individual to respond to the standards, wishes, and imperatives of t!:te larger social group. The formal and informal aspects of social controls are not always consonant (Harding and Zinberg 1977:112). Drug taking is said to be socially conti'olled when it is permitted under various legal restraints and routin\u00ad ized, ritualized, and structured so as to reduce to a minimum any drug-taking behavior that the surrounding culture con\u00ad siders inadvisabie (Rubin and Comitas 1976:173). coping Action that enables one to adjust to envi\u00ad ronmental circumstances and forestall, reduce, or contain the experience of stress. The use of psychoactive drugs has been seen as one alternative among many for coping with the subjective needs, desires, and problems of life. (RI S 27: 313--6 entries) copping Slang. The acquisition of heroin or other drugs; a series of events in which goods or money are exchanged for heroin. \"COp\u00ad ping areas\" are drug distribution sites (Hughes et al. 1971). (RIS 27:313--5 entries) corollary Associated with an event but not necessar\u00ad ily caused by it. Prior use of marijuana, for example, is a corollary of heroin addic\u00ad tion, but prior marijuana use 'has not been proven to have a causative relationship with heroin addiction. See also causal. countercultu re A term coined in the 1960s that described 26 a specific form of culture whose members rejected key norms and values of the larger society. craving A term implying both physiological and psychological dependence; the user's \"desire\" or \"need\" to continue using a drug. This term is often associated with withdrawal and is considered by some to be a main defining characteristic of addic\u00ad tion (Grinspoon and Hedbiom 1975:164-70). criminal commitment A compuisory treatment program for the detoxification and rehabilitation of addicts who have been arrested and convicted of misdemeanors or felonies. Addicts are confined for a specified period in special treatment facilities, which usually are basically modified prisons. See also civil commitment. criminal justice system The machinery, procedures, and personnel having to do with the content of the crimi\u00ad nal law and with the arrest, trial, convic\u00ad tion, and disposition of offenders. It includes the penal code, the police, the prosecutor's office, courts, penal institu\u00ad tions, probation, parole, and the officials charged with administering their defined duties (Fairchild 1976). (RIS 27:317--7 entries) criminogenesis A term coined by sociologists to explain the processes by which powerful policymak\u00ad ing groups in a society create the struc\u00ad tural conditions that cause other people to commit crimes. Some believe that American social policy tc,ward narcotics is crimino\u00ad genic to the extent that it stimulates the organization of illegal industry and markets in commodities that had been heretofore lawfully produced and consumed (Helmer 1977:407-8). crisis intervention, drug The process of diagnosing a drug criSIs situation such as a PAN IC REACTION or a drug OVERDOSE and applying procedures to arrest the condition. Typical Signs indicative of immediate drug crisis medical intervention outlined by Lehrman et al. (1980:9-10) include unconsciousness, very low breathing rate (8 or fewer breaths per minute), breathing difficulty, respira\u00ad tory arrest. high fever, extreme high or low pulse rate (140 or more per minute or below 60 per minute)', vomiting in semicon\u00ad scious or unconscious state, and pro\u00ad nounced muscle rigidity.

See also cross-tolerance. cross-tolerance A condition in which TOLERANCE to one drug often results in a tolerance to ,a chemically similar drug; e.g., a person who is used to taking large doses of heroin wi II perceive no effects from small doses of methadone. See also cross-dependence; tolerance, reverse. cult A small, highly exclusive group organized around the teachings of a charismatic leader; often the memb~rs of a, cult set themselves apart from the rest of the com\u00ad munity in various ways in order to better practice their unique creed (Zadrozny 1959; Encyclopedia of Sociology 1981). cutting DILUTION or ADULTERATION of a drug (e.g., the process of diluting heroin with milk suga'r or quinine). cyclazocine On~ of the first of the opiate narcotic antagonists to be employed in clinical treat\u00ad ment. It is a mixed antagonist, having slight agonist effects. Although long act\u00ad ing and effective orally, its effectiveness has been limited because it, has to be administered daily, and many patients com\u00ad plain of unpleasant side effects. Recently NAL TREXONE has been advocated as a substitute. Classification: narcotic antago\u00ad nists.

See also trafficking, drug. (drug dealers, RIS 27:281--2 entries) deaths, drug-related Deaths that result either directly or indi\u00ad rectly from drug use. Broadly, refers to anything from an overdose suicide to the presence of some unspecified drug in a pedestrian hit by a truck (Rittenhouse 1977:243). In direct deaths, the drug is a sufficient and necessary condition or cause of death. In indirect deaths, the drug alone is not sufficient cause for death, but is a necessary contributor to the death in conjunction with some other drug, con\u00ad dition, or agent (Lettieri and Backenheimer 1974). In the DRUG ABUSE WARNING NETWORK (DAWN) system, a drug-involved death is defined as (1) any death involving a drug overdose in which a toxic level is found or suspected; and/or (2) any death in which drug usage is a contributory fac\u00ad tor although not necessarily the sole cause (e.g., accidents, diseased state, with\u00ad drawal symptoms) (Gottschalk et al. 1977). See also overdose. (RIS 27:318--56 entries) 387-396 0 -82 - 3 QL 3 27 decriminal ization The legal process of revIsing drug laws by replacing the criminal penalties (usually imprisonment or the threat of imprisonment) with civil penalties (most often a fine) for possession of smc:11 amounts of the drug for personal use. Most people feel that marijuana use should be discouraged, but many also feel that imprisonment for use is too harsh a penalty. Eleven States have changed thei r laws to inco rporate civil fines and, sometimes, mandatory drug edu- cation programs for offenders. First offenders usually avoid a criminal record under these new laws. See also legaliza\u00ad tion; National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse. delinquency In many States, any act that would be a crime if committed by an adult, and there\u00ad fore a softer synonym for crime. Most jurisdictions also include a wide variety of acts which are not illegal if committed by adults (Encyclopedia of Sociology 1981). Any undesirable conduct on the part of a juvenile that is serious enough to come to the attention of the authorities, including truancy. school misconduct, petty offenses, and sometimes serious crimes (Zadrozny 1959). (RIS 27:320--27 entries) deliriants Substances capable of producing DELIRIUM, often used to refer to the VOLATILE INHALANTS. delirium Mental disturbance usually of short dura\u00ad tion characterized HALLUCINATION. delirium tremens (DTs) An acute mental and physical disorder occurring in alcoholics while drinking or as an alcohol-withdrawal syndrome. The onset is marked by tremulousne'ss, nausea, vomiting, weakness, hallucinations, or col\u00ad lapse due to malnutrition from a prolonged diet of liquor (Keller and McCormick 1968). delusion A belief that exists in spite of contrary reason or evidence that would normally be considered sufficient to change it (LeDain et al. 1973:431). A firm, fixed idea not amenable to rational explanation (A Psy\u00ad chiatric Glossary 1975). See also illusion; hallucination. - Delysid Brand name for LSD-25 marketed by the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Sandoz. demand reduction strategy Federal drug abuse policy goals are geared toward reducing both the demand and sup\u00ad ply of illicit drugs. The \"demand reduc\u00ad tion strategyll outlines the Government's plan for reducing the demand for illicit drugs. The main components of the strat\u00ad egy consist of providing support for treatment and rehabilitation programs, pre\u00ad vention projects, and research and devel\u00ad opment activities in cooperation with State, local, and privatEi agencies and organ iza\u00ad tions. See also supply reduction strategy; Federal drug abuse policy. dependence, drug A broad term that came into general use in the mid-1960s as a replacement for ADDICTION and HABITUATION to help eliminate the confusions and difficulties inherent in those terms. As defined by the WHO Expert Committee, \"a state of psychic or physical dependence or both, on a drug, arising in a person following administration of that drug on a periodic or continuous basis,\" with the charactel\"is\u00ad tic of dependence varying with the drug involved (i.e., dependence of the morphine type, barbiturate type, amphetamine type, etc.). In this theoretical scheme psychic or (PSYCHOLOGICAL) DEPENDENCE--lI a feeling of satisfaction and a psychic drive that requires periodic or continuous admin\u00ad istration of the drug to produce pleasure 28 or avoid discomfort\"--was given the domi\u00ad nant place as the effect drugs produce that causes people to use them compulsively, with (PHYSICAL) DEPENDENCE a powerful reinforcing influence (Eddy et al. 1965: 722- 723). dependence, field See field dependence. dependence, physical A physiological state of adaptation to a drug no rmally following the development of TOLERANCE, and resulting in a char\u00ad acteristic WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME pecu\u00ad liar to the drug following abstinence (LeDain et al. 1973:44;432). The extent to which physical dependence occurs in the use of certain drugs and its causes are still a matter of considerable contro\u00ad versy. Physical dependence is generally most closely associated with opiate narcot\u00ad ics, which are believed to produce the most pronounced tolerance and physical dependence of all drugs. However, many researchers now emphasize that dependence does occur among users of other drugs (e.g., barbiturates), it does not always occur the same among all opiate users, and that it is often impossible to differen-tiate clea rly between physical and psycho\u00ad logical dependence. (See discussion under ADDICTION.) Most theorists now empha\u00ad size the predominance of psychological factors in development of dependency on any drug. Often used as a synonym for addiction. dependence, psychological In regard to drugs, an ill-defined, broad term generally referring to a craving for or compulsion to continue the use of a drug that gives satisfaction or a feeling of well\u00ad being. Psychological dependence may vary in intensity from a mild preference to a strong craving or compulsion to use the drug. In severe cases, unpleasant psy\u00ad chological symptoms may develop if contin\u00ad ued administration of the drug is stopped (LeDain et al. 1973:433). The World Health Organization defines psychic dependence as \"a feeling of satisfaction and a psychic drive that requires periodic or continuous administration of the drug to produce a desired effect or to avoid discomfort\" (Eddy 1965). In most instances, psychological factors are considered more important than any physical factors in maintaining chronic drug use (LeDain et al. 1973:45). Also often called behavioral, psychic, or emo\u00ad tional dependence. Frequently a synonym for HA~ITUATION. depot preparation Any of a number of methods that provide the slow release of a drug within the body over an extended time (e. g., a month to a year), usually involving 'either an implanted capsule or some type of unique formulation of the drug itself. depressant Any drug that depresses the central nerv\u00ad ous system resulting in sedation and a decrease in bodily activity. Not to be confused with the psychological state of DEPRESSION, these drugs can in fact be mood elevators by lowering inhibitions. Depressants are the largest and most com\u00ad monly used of all drug types, including the alcohol, barbitur\u00ad ates, proprietary sedative-hypnotics, tranquilizers, and inhalants. All these depressant drugs affect the CNS similarly in a progression depending on dosage from anxiety reduction to sedation, hypnosis (sleep), anesthesia, coma, and even death. Given this similarity in effect, they are classified usually accordin!:f to the specific purposes for which they are most suitable. Depressants are also additive in their effects; when used together they compound the effects of each and greatly increase the risk of death. In this volume we have divided the depressant drugs into the major categories of NARCOTIC ANALGESIC AGO\u00ad (RIS 27:204--5 entries) depression When used to describe mood in the normal individual, a state of despondency charac\u00ad terized by feelings such as inadequacy, lowered activity, and pessimism about the future. In PATHOLOGICAL cases, an extreme state of unresponsiveness to stim\u00ad uli, together with self-depreciation, delu\u00ad sions of inadequacy, and hopelessness (Chaplin 1975). As defined by Robins (1974), chronic sadness of several weeks' duration, plus three or more of the follow\u00ad ing symptoms: (1) trouble sleeping over a period of several weeks; (2) anorexia leading to a weight loss of 8 pounds or more; (3) several weeks of feeling tired for no reason or not able to \"get going\"; (4) thoughts of dying, or harming oneself; (5) worry about losing one's mind; and (6) crying spells.

In drug treatment programs, the most frequent method of detection is urinalysis. Blood samples are also often used to detect the presence of d rugs in the system; screening is accomplished by such methods as Kozel ka-H ine spectropho\u00ad tometry and gas chromatography. Other methods such as the NARCAN TEST are also used. See also urinalysis. (screen\u00ad ing and detection, RIS 27: 379--39 entries) deterrence theory The penological theory that the use or threat of legal sanctions or punishment, the knowledge of which is widely dissemi\u00ad nated, is\u00b7 the most important method of preventing crime or socially undesirable acts that might otherwise be committed (Meier and Johnson 1977: 293-4). Classical deterrence theory maintains that the likeli\u00ad hood of someone engaging in lawbreaking activity is determined negatively by the certainty, severity, and swiftness of pun\u00ad ishment. The more certain, severe, and 29 swift the penalties are, the greater their deterrent effect (Erickson 1976). This has been ca!led the primary and essential postulate of almost all criminal law systems (Zimring and Hawkins 1973). Recent research has also emphasized the role in deterrence of the potential lawbreaker~s subjective perceptions regarding the pos\u00ad sibility of punishment, whether or not these perceptions are accurate. (RIS 27: 322--3 entries) detoxification Ridding the organism of drugs through withdrawal and promoting recovery from its effects (Keller 1960). While in itself not considered a very successful treatment method, it is an option that permits the dependent drug user to be seen by somt: type of center (usually a hospital), to receive medical attention, and to reduce the dependence cycle. Detoxffication often leads to other forms of treatment by refer\u00ad ral {Deitch 1973:161}. The most common procedure to relieve the distress ,caused by heroin WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS during detoxification is that developed at the PUB\u00ad LIC HEALTH SERVICE HOSPITAL at Lex\u00ad ington, Kentucky. Typically, the patient is started on a dose of METHADONE. con\u00ad sistent with his or her own heroin habit (usually 20 mg methadone twice daily or 40 mg once a day), and the dose is reduced thereafter by 20 percent per day. Discomfort is thereby held down to roughly that experienced in the course of a mild bout of influenza, A Ithou gh hospital ization was once considered essential for the treat\u00ad ment of withdrawal symptoms, OUTPATIENT detoxification is now used successfully (Brown 1973:133). (RIS 27:322--9 entries; drug-free seconda ry A distinction first drawn by Lemert (1951) to show how societal reactions to DEVIANT BEHAVIOR encourage the individual to develop a deviant CAREER, and concomi\u00ad tant self-concept. The situation arises when a person publicly labeled as a devi\u00ad ant for some initial behavior or primary deviance, begins to use other deviant behavior or a ROLE based on it as a means of defense or adjustment to the overt and covert problems created by the societal reactions to his or her initial behavior. Other propollents of the secondary deviance approach irfc'!ude Alfred Lindesmith and Edwin Schur (Williams 1976; McAuliffe 1975). See also labeling theory. deviant behavior Generally, behavior that varies markedly from the average or norm, usually PATH\u00ad OLOGICAL in nature, or which elicits con\u00ad demnation in the social setting in which it takes place. \u00b7In its widest sense, it is a generic term referring to activities that connote a departure by individuals from accepted standards of conduct or social norms of the dominant group. As defined by Jessor et al. (1968: 44), deviant behav\u00ad ior \"must depart substantially from norma\u00ad tive standards; the departure must be of sufficient magnitude to mobilize social con\u00ad trol responses. II Merton early developed the implications of a general sociological theory of deviance from Durkheim1s concept of ANOMIE, arguing that when the legiti\u00ad mate means to attain accepted success goals or aspiration of society, defined in eco\u00ad nomic terms, are blocked, frustrated mem\u00ad bers of the lower classes may reject the culturally prescribed means and use other means to achieve success (Merton 1957). In LABEll NG THEORY, deviance is not a quality of an act a person commits, but is defined in terms of a \"Iabelingll phenomenon created by the social group that specifies those infractions constituting \"deviance\" (Becker 1963:9). The term lIantisocial behaviorll is preferred by some (Ki nkade 1974). See deviance, secondary. 322--6 entries) dextroamphetamine sulfate A central nervous system stimulant of the amphetamil)e type considered twice as potent as other amphetamines but with fewer side effects.

Classification: stimulants-\u00ad primary. differential association The distribution of a person1s associations in a manner different from those of other persons (Fairchild 1976). The fundamental principle of a general theory of criminal behavior constructed by Edwin Sutherland, which holds that criminal behavior is learned and that a person becomes delin\u00ad quent because of an excess of definitions favorable to law violations over defi nitions unfavorable to law violations. Generally stated, persons who develop criminal behav\u00ad ior diffclr from those who do not develop crimi nOli behavior in the quantity and qual\u00ad ity of their associations with criminal pat\u00ad terns and their relative isolation from anti-criminal patterns. The learning of delinquent roles is due to the availability of delinquent role :odels in a peer group (Sutherland and Cressey 1960). Volkman and Cressey (1964) tested this theory in regard to opiate users. In methodology, the idea that the amount of correlation between variables is a function of the popu\u00ad lation studied. dilution The ADULTERATION of a drug by the addition of an inactive substance.

Its primary effect is a relentless rush of energy that causes users to trem\u00ad ble. Some hallucinogen users praise STP; others siOly it carries more risk of psychotic reactions than any other hallucinogen. Users negatively report a long IIcome down\" period of 2 to 3 days on STP, and thus they prefer to use the PSILOCIN. Parsley or some other plant is usually soaked in it, dried, and smoked.

Also, a loss of self-control while under the influence of drugs (Chaplin 1975). disorientation State of mental confusion regarding time, place, or identity. distilled spirits Alcoholic liquor obtained by the process of DISTILLATION. Distilled spirits from wines and other brews usually contain at least 25 percent alcohol (50 proof) but may be as high as 50 percent or more. Examples include whisky, brandy, rum, gin, and vodka. The discovery of distil\u00b7\u00b7 lation has been attributed to either of two Arabs, the alchemist Gerber (c. 800) or the physician Rhazes (c. 900). Regard\u00ad less, the discovery itself marked the major turning point in the history of alcohol use, as it made possible the production of bev\u00ad erages containing several times the alco\u00ad holic content of the strongest wines and provided a new, convenient, and concen\u00ad trated source of inebriation, thus greatly augmenting the problems related to the use of beverage alcohol. Distillation increased the alcoholic power of a given drink by 400-500 percent. Although the first distilled spirits were principally made from wines (such as brandy) and were used almost exclusively as medicines, in the mid-16th centu ry technological advances in the di~tillation of grains made possible the plentiful production of cheap spirits. The 18th-centu roy London gin epidemic was one of the major social issues of the day (Austin 1978). Classification: sedative! hypnotics. distribution-of-consumption model An epidemiological approach first suggested by Ledermann (1956) in regard to alcohol 31 use. The model is based on studies of alcohol consumption patterns in large popu\u00ad lations in Canada. Findings suggest no clear difference in consumption between social drinkers, heavy drinkers, and alco\u00ad holics. All categories gradually shade into one another and cannot be clearly distin\u00ad guished. The distribution approach sug\u00ad gests that: (a) the distribution of alcohol consumption is similar in character from place to place; (b) alcohol consumption relates to liver cirrhosis; and (c) it may be necessary to reduce per capita consump\u00ad tion to reduce alcohol-related problems. It has been suggested that this theory may be applicable to all drugs (Smart 1974:34-35) . Ditran A psychedelic HALLUCINOGEN, chemically called piperidyl benzilate. Its effects include changes in the user's perception of time, space, hearing, and color, but it does not precipitate any real hallucinations. diuretic A drug that increases urine output thereby reducing the body fluid level. diversion A criminal justice system reform concept of identifying some criminal defenders in the earliest stages of the criminal justice system and diverting them into programs that may not involve incarceration. As operationally defined by the American Bar Foundation, it is lithe disposition of a com\u00ad plaint without a conviction, the noncriminal di sposition being conditioned on either the performance of specified obligations by the defendant, or his participation in counsel\u00ad ing or treatment\" (Nimmer 1974:5). As a major nonpunitive alternative to CIVI L COMMITMENT, the basis for drug offender diversion is to remove from the criminal justice system those for whom its processes are thought to be inappropriate or counter- productive. Offenders are generally diverted after arrest but before court dis\u00ad position; those who are cons ide red eligible for diversion are offered the opportunity to \"volunteer\" to a treatment program. While the offender is in the diversion pro\u00ad gram, the pending prosecution is suspended or deferred. Upon successful completion of treatment, the original charges are gen\u00ad erally dismissed. As most drug diversion programs deal with opiate users, it is also referred to as addict diversion (Perlman and Jaszi 1976). The term diversion also refers to the redirection of licit, prescription drugs from the normal pharmaceutical marketing system into the illicit street market (especially amphetamine and barbiturate drugs).

The term \"effective dosage\" is sometimes used to refer to that dosage which produces a cer\u00ad tain effect in 50 percent of the individuals tested, whereas 25 percent felt the same effect at a lesser dosage and 25 percent required a higher dosage (Margolis 1978).

(RI S 27: 323--34 entries) dose-effect relationship Consideration of the quantity or dose of the drug involved must be taken into r,ccount before specific statements about drug effects may be made. One of the basic principles of pharmacology. With all drugs, the response differs both in the intensity and the character of the reaction according to the amount of the drug admin\u00ad istered (LeDain et al. 1973). Also called the DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP. See also effects, drug. dose-response curve See dose-response relationship. dose-response relationship A major area of study in behavioral phar\u00ad macology in which observations are made over time between the dosage of a drug administered and some measurable behav\u00ad ioral activity of the subject. The observed relationships are frequently plotted graph\u00ad ically with the dosage level on one axis and the particular behavior activity level on the other. The line drawn to connect the observations is called the dose\u00ad response curve. The inability to fit a curve indicates a poor relationship. 32 The curve may take many shapes. Upward sloping and level curves indicate a direct relationship. Downward sloping curves indicate an indirect relationship. Curves that slope up and then down, or vice versa, are called biphasic dose-response relationships. Alcohol, for example, at low dosage levels may have a disinhibiting, enervating effect, but as the dosage increases these effects may be reversed into an inhibiting, stuporous effect. This type of dose-response relationship is, thus, biphasic. double-blind study An experimental design in which neither the subject nor the researcher knows which of two or more drugs (one of which is often a PLACEBO) is being given at the time of the study.

I n general use, there is little consistency in popular conceptions of what a drug is; a multitude of often arbitrary, conflicting definitions of the term \"drug\" have helped to contribute significantly to the controversies and confusions surround.,. ing drug use. Many equate \"drugs\" only with those illicit substances used recrea\u00ad tionally, viewing them as fundamentally different and more harmful than the licit substances used recreationally, such as tea, alcohol, and tobacco, or the so-called \"medical drugs,\" such as tranquilizers, amphetamines, and barbiturates. The fusion is so' great, in fact, that Goode (1972: 8) proposed that \"a drug is some\u00ad thing that has been arbitrarily defined by certain segments of society as a drug .\" As a result of this confusion, it has become increasingly common to refer to all drugs as \"psychoactive substances\" in the hope that use of this new term will help to pro\u00ad mote a greater recognition of the similar\u00ad ities among all chemical agents that have mood altering effects and dispel the long\u00ad standing misconception that there is' some\u00ad thing fundamentally different between alcohol, coffee, and tobacco, on the one hand, and \"drugs\" on the other; or that street drugs act according to entirely dif\u00ad ferent principles from medical drugs (National Commission on Marihuana :md Drug Abuse 1973: 1 0-11). drug abuse An unstandardized, value-laden, and highly relative term used with a great deal of imprecision and confusion, generally imply\u00ad ing drug use that is excessive, dangerous, or undesirable to the individual or commu\u00ad nity and that ought to be modified. (See also DRUG.) For example, \"the tendency of some people to use certain drugs in ways which are detrimental to their health, or to the community in which they live, or.both\" (Archibald 1970:238); drug use that liposes a serious threat to health or tq social or psychological functioningll (Wei! 1972:37-38). Others, such as Mormons or Christian Scientists, would consider even the use of alcohol and coffee as abusive. Few agree on what defines what is exces\u00ad sive or dangerous. Generally, the public and the law have defined the recreational use of any illicit PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCE as \"abuse\"-\u00ad without any demonstration of individual harm or social consequence necessary. Most definitions involve some component of nonmedical and/or illicit use, with the clear implication that drug use that is legitimated by the m.Jdical or legal authorities is better than that which is not. For example: the \"use, sale, or possession of those sub\u00ad stances which are prohibited by the laws of the statell (New Jersey State 1971: 2); use of a drug in amounts hazardous to individual health or the safety of the com\u00ad munity, or when it is illiCit, or when taken on one's own initiative rather than on the basis of professional advice (Rappolt 1972: 126); \"the self-administration of. . drugs without medical supervision and par\u00ad ticularly in large doses that may lead to psychological dependency, tolerance and abnormal behavior\" (American Medical Association ,1966); \"persistent and sporadic excessive drug use inconsistent or unre\u00ad lated to acceptable medical practice\" (Eddy 1965:722); use outside accepted medical practice (LeDain et al. 1973); \"use of a 33 drug beyond medically prescribed necessityll (Rublowsky 1 971l: 1 9); and \"use of a drug for other than therapeutic purposes\" (Winek 1971 :2-3). Jaffe (1976:7) has defined it as \"the use, usually by self\u00ad administration, of any drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical or social patterns within a culture.1I The fundamental problem with the term is that \"abusb\" cannot be precisely detined in reference to an actual phenomenon. What one person or group 'may deem as harmful or excessive to the individual per\u00ad sonally or to society in general may not be perceived as problematic by others or by the drug consumer. Implicitly, the term \"abusell has come to be the current equivalent of \"badness, II or of any use of which one does not approve; this is the most common component of all definitions (National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse 1973:11-13). As such, the use of this term often depends as much, if not more, on political a\"nd moral judgments than on considerations of the actual phar\u00ad macological action of a drug on an individ\u00ad ual's health and the impact of drug-using actions on social welfare (Blum 1971: 91l) . In fact, some have defined the concept of abuse totally in terms of social disapproval: \"Drug abuse is behavior, as designated by professional and other community repre\u00ad sentatives, describing the use of particular drugs in particular ways that are contrary to the agreed-upon rituals in a given com\u00ad mU'1ity at a given point in time\" (Einstei l1 and Garitano 1972). Similarly, Wikler (1958) defined it as lithe use of chemiGai agents for purposes considered undesirable by an observer. II These definitions do not purport to be a description of an actual drug-using pattern but shift the focus to the response to that pattern, and make it clear that \"abuse\" is a relative perception. Indeed, for all of its lack of clarity as a descriptor of an actual phe\u00ad nomenon, because lIabuse\" has developed such a clear connotation of a personal judgment of llbad\" or lIdeviant\" or \"exces\u00ad sive,\" it remains an apt word to use i!1 r'eference to an attitudinal response to drug use that incorporates these judgments. Many authorities suggest that the term should be avoided entirely as too polemical and value laden, and too inclusive to be scientifically useful in trying to under\u00ad stand various degrees of drug use (National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse 1973:13-11l; Johnson 1973:2). Smart (1971l:32) emphasizes that only the term \"drug use\" should be employed, a change which may further draw attention to the need to know mo re about d rug use and how it relates to specific problems of use. Johnson (1973:3) suggests that the terms \"nonmedical use\" (i.e., used for nonmedical pu rposes) and lIi11icit drug use\" (i.e., defined as illegal by Federal or State laws) would better suggest what is \"wrong\" with certain kinds of drug use. Other suggestions inel ude distinguishing betwebll socially acceptable use and unac\u00ad ceptable use (Josephson 1974:xx) or con\u00ad ventional or unconventional use. As abuse is a term more appropriately applied to peop'le than drugs, the term \"drug mis\u00ad usell is also often used as a substitute (Kaufman 1977). See also substance abuse. Drug Abuse Act of 1970 Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, the first major Federal drug legislation since the HARRISON NAR\u00ad COTICS ACT of 1914. All the regulations advanced since the Harrison Act were repealed and replaced by this new statute. Possession penalties were generally reduced, but the act established strict import and export limitations, extended penalties for trafficking, and imposed new controls on previously unregulated psycho\u00ad active drugs. The act was designed to create for the first time a comprehensive framework for the regulation of narcotic and nonnarcotic drugs. Title II of this act is known as the CONTROLLED SUB\u00ad STANCES ACT and requires registration of every person in the legitimate chain of drug distribution and detailed recordkeep\u00ad ing. See statewide services contract. Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 Also called Harris-Dodd Act, an amendment 'to U.S. food, drug, and cosmetic legisla\u00ad tion that as \"dangerous drugsll and brought them under Federal control, shifting the constitutional basis for drug control from taxing pow~r to interstate and commerce powers. Penalties are con\u00ad siderably more let;lient than those of the NARCOTIC DRUG CONTROL ACT OF 1956. The act is intended to crack down on the trade in amphetamine and barbiturate drugs (and several tranquilizers and nonbarbitur\u00ad ate hypnotics and sedatives), whether these drugs have been legitimately manu\u00ad factured and diverted into the illicit traffic or illegitimately manufactured. It is also aimed at stopping the underground traffic in hallucinogens, which are mostly manu\u00ad factured in clandestine laboratories or smuggled in from abroad. Under the act, no person may possess any of the pro-34 scribed drugs except for personal or family use or for veterinary purposes (Running Press Dictionary of Law 1976). Only authorized manufacturers, suppliers, hos\u00ad pitals, agencies, physicians, or research\u00ad ers can sell, deliver, or otherwise dispose of the proscribed drugs; persons who man\u00ad ufacture, process, sell, deliver, or other\u00ad wise dispose of these drugs must keep records of all drugs so handled; prescrip\u00ad tions for these drugs are limited to five refills, and none may be refilled after 6 months.

Drug Abuse Reporting Program (DARP) A national, computerized reporting system that was established in 1968 at Texas Christian University consisting of a research file of data on the admission and progress of drug abuse patients receiving treatment at federally funded programs. Its major purposes are to provide standard\u00ad ized program statistics and evaluative studies of treatment outcomes by various modalities and for different groups of patients. The Admission Record provides demographic data for patient classification, developmental background information, and baseline data at admission on the major behavioral outcome criteria of drug and alcohol use, employment, criminality, and family relations. The Status Evaluation Record provides during-treatment informa\u00ad tion on these same variables at 2-month intervals. This form also records bimonthly information on participation in treatment components and on termination and read\u00ad mission to the same program.

Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) Started in 1972 by the BUREAU OF NAR\u00ad COTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS, DAWN provides information on medical and psycho\u00ad logical problems associated with the effects of drug use; data are received from facil\u00ad ities in 23 cities that are likely to have contact with drug users with these prob\u00ad lems, such as general hospital emergency rooms, medical examiners/coroners, and crisis intervention centers. Whereas CODAP (CLIENT ORIENTED DATA ACQUI\u00ad SITION PROCESS) describes patients com\u00ad ing into treatment, DAWN describes people experiencing emergencies with drugs, whether or not they are in treatment. -rhe aim of the system is to identify drugs that bring people to the attention of emer\u00ad gency facilities and to identify the patterns of drug use and trends in these patterns with the idea of doing something about it if the problem becomes severe.

In the United States, State statutes employ various legal criteria for determining drunkenness. Lafler v. Fischer (1964) declared that \"When it is apparent that a person is under the influ\u00ad ence of liquor, or when his manner is unusual or abnormal and his inebriate con\u00ad dition is reflected in his walk or conversa\u00ad tion, when his ordinary judgment and common sense are disturbed, or his usual will power is temporarily suspended, when these symptoms result from the use of liquor, and are manifest, then, within the meaning of the statute, the person is intoxicated, and anyone who makes a sale of liquor to such a person violates the law of the state, It is not necessary that the person would be called 'dead drunk' or hopelessly intoxicated; it is enough that his senses are obviously -destroyed or dis\u00ad tracted by the use of intoxicating Iiquorll (Keller and McCormick 1968). dysfunctional\u00b7 drug use As defined by Retka (1977:1), drug use that results' in physical, psychok)gical, economic, legal, and/or social harm to the individual drug user or to others affected by the drug user's behavior. Retka emphasizes that while not all drug use can be clearly identified as functional or dys\u00ad functional, the effort to Ii nk the function\u00ad ality of drug use to the effects of that use is helpful in that many such effects can be quantified and an estimate of their associated costs generated. It is in rela\u00ad tion to such costs that the benefits deriv\u00ad ing from effective prevention efforts can be determined.

Although frequently used interchangeably with the term EPIDEMIOLOGY, the latter differs in being concerned with the study of the incidence and prevalence of a disease in a circumscribed community set\u00ad ting, or a carefully defined population group (Schmidt 1965; Richman 1977). effects, drug Any physiological or psychological reac\u00ad tion a user experiences after taking a drug. Generally, drugs do not produce the same effect in different individuals, nor do they produce the same effect in the same individual at different times under' different circumstances. In fact, one of the characteristics of some drugs is pre\u00ad cisely the variability of their effects. Thus, one of the fundamental problems in assessing ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS is 36 establishing a clear cause-and-effect rela\u00ad tionship between a specific drug and a clinical event (Karch and Lasagna 1976: 204) There are no direct, simple, dependable cause-and-effect ralationships between any drug and any behavior. What we loosely talk about as a drug effect is a combination of at least th ree ma in factors: (1) the pharmacological properties of the drug; (2) the social setting or environmental con\u00ad text in which the drug is taken (see SET\u00ad TI NG); and (3) the personality or character structure, attitudes, and expectations of the individual user (see SET). However, under specific conditions drugs do have certain identifiable, probable effects on most individuals. See also dose-response relationship.

The process of knowing objects and objective events by means of the senses. Refers to relatively complex receptor and neural processes that underlie our awareness of ourselves and our world based on discrimination, differentiation, and observation. Perception is commonly treated as an intervening variable depend\u00ad ent upon stimulus factors, learning, set, moods, and emotional and motivational fac\u00ad tors. Thus, the meaning of an object or objective event is determined both by stimulus conditions and by organism factors (Chaplin 1975).

It has been called the executive agency of the personality, and its many functions enable us to modify our instinctual impulses (the id), make compromises with demands of the superego (conscience, ideals), and in general deal rationally and effectively with reality. It operates largely but not entirely on a con\u00ad scious level, and in a mature person is guided less often by the pleasure principle than by the reality principle--that is, the practical demands of life. It may, how\u00ad ever, be torn between these two opposing forces. liThe ego, unlike the id, is not ready-made at birth. It develops slowly as the child learns to master his impulses, know what behavior the world requires, and use intel\u00ad ligence in meeting difficulties. A person who develops a IIstrong egoll successfully integrates the demands of the id, superego, and reality. He therefore does not have to resort to rigid defenses or escape mech\u00ad anisms in handling the stresses of life. An individual with a IIweak egoll is domi\u00ad nated by unconscious impulses and may disintegrate under strain, with the result that mental symptoms or character defects are likely to developll (Goldenson 1970). (ego functioning, RIS 27:337--9 entries) ego strength IlA term used by psychoanalysts and others for the ability of the ego, or conscious self to maintain an effective balance between inner impulses and the demands of outer reality. In Freudian phraseology, it is the capacity of the ego to mediate between the id, and superego and reality-\u00ad that is, between instinctual impulses, con\u00ad science, and the situations of life. \"A person with a strong ego has high frus\u00ad tration tolerance and is able to control his impulses and modify his selfish desires and 'primitive urges' to conform to socially acceptable patterns. He shows flexibility in handling the stresses of life and does not resort to rigid defenses or inflexible behavior. A person with a weak ego . is dominated by unconscious feelings and impulses and has poor tolerance for frus\u00ad tration, disappointment, and other forms of stress. When confronted with psycho\u00ad logical problems he suffers from conflicts 37 and anxieties, makes excessive use of defense mechanisms, and may develop char\u00ad acter defects or psych iatric symptoms. \"Ego strength is an important concept not only in asseSSing personality health and growth, but in the therapeutrc process. One important goal of psychotherapy and social work is to find ways of increasing ego strength\" (Goldenson 1970).

Developed out of the sensi\u00ad tivity-training groups of the 1960s, partici\u00ad pants are encouraged by group leaders to become sensitive to the feelings of others and to express their feelings and reactions to other people openly and honestly, with no restrictions on what is verbalized. See illso group therapy. endorphins Endogenous OPIOID biochemical compounds (peptides) . Substances produced by the body that resemble the opiates in their abilities to produce ANALGESIA and a sense of well-being. The term lIendorphinll is used generically to refer to all of the endogenous opioid compounds and implies a pharmacological activity (analogous. to the activity of the corticosteroid category of biochemicals) as opposed to a specific chemical formulation. Endorphins have so far been found to be present only in ver\u00ad tebrate animals. Some of the various endorphins that have been identified are methionine-enkephalin I leucine-enkephal in, N\u00ad type compounds; methionine-enkephalin and leucine-enkephalin. epidemic In regard to diseases, a sudden outbreak that spreads rapidly through a population and affects a large number at once. By extension, refers to the rapid spread of any social phenomenon, such as a dancing mania or fad (Chaplin 1975). Contrast with endemic. epidemiology The study of rates of health-relatea prob\u00ad lems within given groups, and the occur\u00ad rence, distribution, and course of health and disease. The study is usually defined by a geographic area, frequently a city. A prevalence study considers all known cases at a gi\"en time, regardless of when they developed. An 'incidence study is restricted to new cases developing in a gi\\-en time period (Encyclopedia of Sociol- \u00a39Y 1981). Historically, epidemiology emerged as part of the effort to combat infectious diseases and became extended to a number of behavioral problems that affect individual and community health, sLlch as accidents, mental disorders, smok\u00ad ing, eating, drinking, and other forms of drug use. \"Contemporary epidemiologists and social scientists concerned with iden\u00ad tifying and describing drug abuse and drug abusers have utilized a variety of data collection techniques with a variety of populations and subpopulations. In t.he pursuit of epidemiological characteris\u00ad tics, analysts have focused upon the use, misuse, and abuse of as few as a single drug or drug class to as many as all psy\u00ad choactive drugs or drug classes ... Probably the most common attempts at understanding the epidemiology of drug abuse include either surveys of at-risk populations in an attempt to secure total prevalence projections or studies of iden\u00ad tified abusers to at least understand those for whom drug use has become a problem. In the former, general population and school su rveys have been most utilized. In the latter, studies of persons in treat\u00ad ment, under arrest, or admitted to emer\u00ad gency rooms have been most utilized. Other populations, e. g., known users in the military and workers in industry, have been studied and other 'indicators' have been employed, e.g., drug seizures or hepatitis rates\" (Chambers and Hunt 1977).

I nhalation of small amounts of ether or drinking a few drops of it in water or alcohol as an occasional recreational inebriant is reported to have been an accepted practice in sophisticated social circles in the 19th century, espe\u00ad cially among students and associates of the medical profession. Starting in the second half of the 19th century and as recently as World War II, ether was some\u00ad times used as a beverage alcohol substitute by the poor in numerous areas of Europe, Great Britain, and North America. The most extensive documented epidemic of ether use occurred in Northern I reland in the late 19th centu ry manufactured as Val mid . ethnobotany The study of humans in relation to plants. See also ethnopharmacology. ethnography A subdiscipline of cultural (or social) anthropology aimed at the detailed study of the way of life of people. The main feature of ethnography is that it requires the di rect observation and participation of the social scientist in the activities of the group studied. This participation may vary in quantity and intensity, but the requisite of personal interaction remains. The ethnographic approach seeks to dis\u00ad cover and understand patterns of behavior in their natural context (Agar 1976; Weppner 1976). eth nopha rmaco logy The study of humans in relationship to drug use. focusing on the social, cultural, and historical aspects.

Classification: narcotic analgesic agonists. euphoria A sense of extreme well-being and optimism, often accompanied by heightened motor activity; may be experienced in some drug\u00ad induced states. ex-addict Defining the ex-addict, or postaddict, is a more imprecise process than the difficult job of defining the addict. On the surface an ex-addict is one who is no longer addicted. Being an ex-addict, however, implies more than just being detoxified. (Long-term addicts commonly exhibit pat\u00ad terns of sporadic voluntary abstinences from drugs.) It usually implies abstinence for some minimum length of time (e.g . 6 months, 1 year, 5 years) and a changed lifestyle away from the drug subculture. A changed lifestyle is often operationally defined by a set of measures such as employment, school enrollment, arrests, avoidance of all illicit drug use, avoidance of excessive alcohol use, the development or improvement of meaningful relationships, and continuing or completing treatment. See treatment outcome. (RIS 27:282--1 entry) expectations, drug use Refers to the physiological and psycholog\u00ad ical effects the drug user expects to ex\u00ad perience when taking drugs. See also effects, perceived; effects, subjective. experimental drug use As defined by the U. S. National Commis\u00ad sion on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, short-39 term nonpatterned trial of 1 or more drugs, either concurrently or consecutively, with a variable intensity but maximum frequency of 10 times per drug, used either singly or in combination. Experimental use is primarily motivated by curiosity or the desire to experience new feelings or mood states, or to assess anticipated drug effects. It most often occurs in the shared company of one or more drug\u00ad experimenting friends or social acquaint\u00ad ances, and is generally viewed in the context of social activity (National Commis\u00ad sion on Marihuana and Drug Abuse 1973:96). experimental group Those subjects who are exposed to an experimental or treatment variable and whose behavior or condition is considered to reflect the influence, if any. of that variable. This group is often compared to a matched CONTROL GROUP, which has not been exposed to the experimental condition. external ization The projection of personal psychological processes or states to the environment or other individuals, such as occurs in para\u00ad noid or hallucinatory states (Chaplin 1975). extinction In the fields of drug abuse and behavioral pharmacology, a behavioral concept that views illicit drug use as a conditional activity that can be extinguished if the stimulus (e.g., old drug-using friends and environments), response (e.g., drug craving and subsequent use). and reward (e.g., satisfaction of the craving) condi\u00ad tioned behClvior pattern can be broken. The hypothesis is that if drug taking is a conditioned behavior, repeated experience of the pattern with resulting denial of the reward will extinguish the automatic stimu\u00ad I us-response reaction. The development of pure, long-acting antagonists such as NAL TREXONE has pro\u00ad vided a means for effectively blocking opi\u00ad ate agonist effects without any an,algesic or euphoric effects. Extinction is proposed as a major concept associated with naltrex\u00ad one therapy by clinicians such as Wikler (1976,1973,1965). Wikler (1976:119) describes this process of IIconditioned abstinencell as permitting lithe patient to expose himself to conditional environmental stimuli which evoke Icravingl and possibly other conditioned abstinence phenomena, without the danger of their reinforcement by the pharmacological actions of opioid drugs. . Eventually, if the patient so exposes himself frequently enough, such conditioned abstinence phenomena should become extinguished through repeated non\u00ad reinforcement. \" The validity of the extinction concept has not been unequivocally borne out by nal\u00ad trexone clinical trial experience (Schecter 1980), but none of the naltrexone trial research designs have emphasized this con\u00ad cept. Wikler (1976:126), on the other hand, feels that naltrexone therapy should have an \"active extinction\" component in which lIinpatients, previously detoxified patients blocked by a narcotic antagonist be exposed to conditioned stimuli that evoke Icraving' and perhaps other condi\u00ad tioned abstinence phenomena and be per\u00ad mitted to self-inject themselves with heroin repeatedly ad libitum; hopefully, under NARCOTIC ANTAGONIST blockade, self\u00ad injection of heroin would ultimately cease.\" extrapyramidal nervous system The fundional components of the brain that deal with basic, unskilled motor move\u00ad ments, as contrasted with the pyramidal (or corticospinal) system, which controls skilled (e. g., related to speech and finger and hand) motor movement. The development and widespread use of NEUROLEPTICS has intensified scientific interest in the extrapyramidal nervous system. It has been observed that (1) r. :L:roleptics reduce the amount of the brain chemical dopamine in the extrapyra\u00ad midal regions of the brain, (2) low Parkin\u00ad son1s disease is highly associated with low brain dopamine levels, and (3) large doses of neuroleptics given to psychotic patients can induce signs of Parkinsonism. Investi\u00ad gative efforts have been centered on trying to determine what the roles of the extra\u00ad pyramidal system and dopamine are in main\u00ad taining mental stability. false positive, false negative False positive and false negative are terms used to indicate erroneous results in tests that measure the presence (positive) or absence (negative) of something. A false positive measure in screening for drugs, for example, means that the test indicates the presence of a drug when in fact none was there. A false negative means just 40 the reverse, that the test indicates a drug is not present when in fact it is. Nearly all drug-testing techniques are susceptible to false, or erroneous, test results. Some of the reasons for false results are person\u00ad nel and computer clerical errors, errors associated with the collection and transport of specimens, improperly performed tests, and the use of tests not sensitive enough to measure at its level the drug1s presence (Catlin 1973; DeAngelis 1976). While many clinicians feel that false positives are more serious errors than false negatives, practi\u00ad tioners such as DeAngelis (p. 32) view the potential of false negatives to reinforce feeling among street addicts of \"beating the system\" as equally serious. family A social unit whose members are bound together by marriage t blood, or personal pact, whose closeness or looseness is defined by the group itself, and whose size may range from two to several hun\u00ad dred people. The family plays a major role in influencing family-member behaviors such as the use/nonuse of drugs. Many have written on this subject. Ger\u00ad stein et al. (1979:20), for example, in their study of female heroin addicts made the observation about early family relation\u00ad ships and illicit drug use that \"the pat\u00ad terns and priorities of adult American life-style are .. largely formed during adolescence. Such patterns are an outcome of the numerous, often conflicting pres\u00ad sures operating during this period, in which life-style experimentation including unorthodox peer-fashioned behavior is expected to occur. Heroin use, as an example of such experimental behavior, is nonetheless quite powerfully opposed by most families of orientation, and cannot happen in them without very disruptive consequences. Therefore, such 'Jse tends to initiate among friends, to be shielded from familial discovery I and upon discovery to pose a significant 'threat to maintaining family role-relationships. Since adoles\u00ad cent friendship patterns are quite labile, they do not form a~ powerful or sustained an influence on long-term heroin use as countervailing influences from stable family relationships. However, when initiation occurs in the approving company of an actual or prospective family member, the balance of influence is s:f?ficantly shifted in a direction favorable to heroin use. Whether this influence becomes invested in continued commitment to heroin-based relationships, in exaggerated fondness for heroin's Ihigh,l or simply reduces expos\u00ad ure to and learning of alternative social beh'aviors during this formative period-\u00ad most likely a combination of all these--the long-term result is a greater disposition toward heroin use than where no intimates are involved.\" Data from the 1979 National Survey on Drug Abuse\u00b7 indicate that adolescent drug use is greatly influenced by the drug use patterns of older family members. Based on data from the survey, Miller and Cisin (1979) report that \"drug abuse behavior is more likely among those teens whose mothers smoke cigarettes and/or drink moderately than among youth whose mothers abstain. This general pattern holds for teenage use of marijuana and stronger illicit drugs as well as for youth\u00ad ful alcohol and cigarette consumption. Interestingly, tbe mother-child link is not substance specific; for example, mothers' use of cigarettes is at least as strongly correlated with teenage aicohol use as it is with teenage cigarette use. Apparently I children learn general orientations towards or away from drug use in accordance with their mothers' substance-use behavior. \"Drug use is also more likeJy among teen\u00ad agers whose older brothers or sisters use alcohol and/or illicit drugs--and is less likely among those whose older siblings abstain. Analyses of the sibling-sibling behavior link point to drug specific effects, suggesting that teens may imitate specific behaviors which are engaged in by their older siblings. liB}' contrast, the father's substance use does not appear to be related to the sons' and daughters' drug use. Among the other family-related factors which appear 41 to have I ittle or no influence on teenage drug use are: the family's socioeconomic status; the mother's current employment status; and the mother's current marital status (i.e., whether or not a father/step\u00ad father lives in the home). These facts argue aga inst a general 'fami Iy situation' interpretation of the mother-child and sibling-sibling links outlined above; instead, it appears that children learn drug use or abstention behavior from certain older mem\u00ad bers of the family.\" (family relationships, RIS 27:342--11 entries) family, nuclear The husband, wife, and their offspring. Synonymous with conjugal family. liThe prototypic drug abuser family--as described in most of the Iiterature--is one in which one parent is intensely involved with the abuser, while the other is more punitive, distant, and/or absent. Usually the over-involved, indulgent, overprotective parent is of the opposite sex of the abuser. \"Sometimes this overinvolvement even reaches the point of incest. Further, the abusing offspring may serve a function for the parents, either as a ch<'mnel for their communication I or as a disrupter whose distracting behavior keeps their own fights from crystallizing. Conversely, the abuser may seek a 'sick' state in order to position himself, childlike, as the focus of the parents' attention. Consequently. the onset of adolescence, with its threat of losing the adolescent to outsiders, her\u00ad alds parental panic. The family then becomes stuck at this developmental stage and a chronic, repetitive process sets in, centered on the individuation, growing up, and leaving of the 'identified' patient\" (Stanton 1980). family therapy \"Treatment of more than one member of a family simultaneously in the same session. The treatment may be supportive, directive, or interpreti 'e. The assumption is that a mental disorder in one member of a family may be a manifestation of disorder in other members and may affect interrelationships and functioning\" (A Psychiatric Glossary 1975 ). IIFamily treatment is a relative newcomer to the field of drug abuse. However, it has found rapid acceptance. Data from a recent survey of 2,012 drug treatment facilities indicate that the majority of our Nation's drug abuse treatment programs provide some kind of family services--in many cases family or marital therapy--as part of their therapeutic armamentarium\" (Stanton 1980). Federal See Bureau of Narcotics Bureau of NarcotiCS, Federal drug ab'lse policy (FBN) Federal. The three principal agencies responsible for setting Federal drug abuse policy are the Drug Policy Office, the NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE (NIDA), and the DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRA\u00ad TION (DEA). The federally recognized mechanisms for establishing drug abuse policies at the State level are the SINGLE STATE AGENCIES. Both NIDA and the DEA play key policy\u00ad making roles, but they also have primary functional responsibilities for carrying out national policy. The Drug Policy Office is purely policy oriented, as are several other interagency drug abuse policy coor-' .. dinating, groups such as the Strategy Council on Drug Abuse, the Principals Group, and the National Narcotics Intelli\u00ad gence Consumers Committee (Drug Policy Office 1980). The Drug Policy Office exists within the White House Domestic Policy Staff. The head of the Drug Policy Office (the Asso\u00ad ciate Director for Drug Policy within the Domestic Policy Staff) is primarily respon\u00ad sible for assisting the President in formu\u00ad lating policy for, and in coordinating and overseeing. international as well as domes\u00ad tic drug abuse functions by all executive branch agencies. The Drug Policy Office advises the Office of Management and Bud\u00ad get regarding budget proposals of those departments and agencies with drug abuse program functions. The Drug Policy Office also prepares and submits to the President a comprehensive report on Federal drug abuse policies, including budget data, titled Annual Report of the Federal Drug Program. The Strategy Council on Drug Abuse was created by the Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and was revitalized in.1977. The Council, which ,is responsible for the preparation of the Federal Strategy f9r Drug Abuse Prevention and Control, is composed of the Attorney General; the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury, and Health and Human Services; the Administrator of Vet\u00ad erans Affairs; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and six mem\u00ad bers from outside the Federal Government. In 1979, the Congress amended the law to requi re that the nongoverment members include \"a representative of State Govern\u00ad ment who is responsible for dealing with drug abuse problemsll and lIa representa\u00ad tive of local government who is responsible for dealing with such problems.\" The Principals Group provides another coordinating mechanism for the executive branch. Chaired by the Associate Director for Drug Poi icy of the Domestic Policy Staff, the Group, which is composed of heads of agencies with primary drug pro\u00ad gram responsibilities, includes the Assist\u00ad ant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, the Director of the National I nstitute on Drug Abuse, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Commissioner of Cus\u00ad toms, the Special Assistant to the Secre\u00ad tary, Department of Health and Hum<;l[1 Services, the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, Department of Justice, and the Commandant of the U.S. 42 Coast Guard. The Group meets monthly, Clnd is frequently in contact between meet\u00ad ings, to discuss policy, issues, and prob\u00ad lems of mutual concern to the agencies responsible for the operational aspects of Federal drug abuse prevention and control programs. A 1978 intelligence pol icy review conducted by the Office of Drug Abuse Policy noted that no formal interagency mechanisms existed for the coordination of the narcotics intelligence effort of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment. The National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee (NNICC) was estab\u00ad lished in April 1978 to correct deficiencies in this area. and is composed of agencies with enforcement, policy, treatment, research, and intelligence responsibilities. The present membership of the N N ICC includes the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service, Drug Enforcement Admin\u00ad istration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Internal Revenue Service, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Departments of State and Treasury,. and the Domestic Policy Staff. The Committee is chaired by the Assistant Administrator for Intelligence of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The Special Assistant for Coordination of Foreign Nar\u00ad cotics I nformation of the Central I ntell i\u00ad gence Agency attends the N N ICC meetings as an observer. A counterpart committee also exists within the U.S. Foreign Intelli\u00ad gence Community. In addition to the Drug Abuse Policy Office, 23 Federal governmental units were funded with a total budget of $902 million to under\u00ad take drug abuse program responsibilities in fiscal year 1981.

These phenomena may occur for weeks or months. Although most involve the visual senses, flashbacks may occur in any of the senses, including taste, smell, feel, hearing, time sense, and sel f-image. Documented cases have indicated that flashbacks may be pleasant (B rown and Stickgold 1976; Keeler et al. 1968), or at the other extreme, they may be terrifying to the point of driving a person to commit suicide (Smart and Bateman 1967). The mechanism responsible for flashbacks is not understood, but there appears to be an inconsistent relationship between the c)mount and number of times hallucinogens are taken and the occurrence of flashbacks. fluorocarbons A large group of chlorinated or fluorinated hydrocarbons now used chiefly a~ refriger\u00ad ants. Prior to 1978 they were WIdely used as AEROSOL propellants in household prod\u00ad ucts and were .subject to abuse because of their intoxicating (anesthetic) effects when inhaled. Fluorocarbons and chlorofluoro\u00ad carbons were banned from use in household consumer products on March 16, 1978, by the U. S. En vi ronmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substance Control Act of 1976. The aerosol propellants currently used by industry are pentane, pentene, and other such hydrocarbons. Because of their flammability, they are believed to pose more of a safety than health threat to society. Classification: volatile inhal\u00ad ants.

According to Dr. Smith (1976:46, 48): \"'Free' to the free clinic movement repre\u00ad sents a philosophical concept rather than an economic term. This alternative phi\u00ad losophy of freedom from established approaches reflects itself in the treatment philosophy that health care is a right, not a privilege. Over the last ten years, the free clinic has evolved as a symbol for nonjudgmental, humanistic health care delivery to alienated populations in the United States, including hippies, commune dwellers, drug abusers, third world minor\u00ad ities, and other 'outsiders' who have been rejected by the more dominant culture. * * * * 44 \"Free clinics have made major contribu\u00ad tions in the field of drug abuse treatment. Rooted in nonjudgmental health care, they believe that drug abusers deserve to be treated like any other patients who enter into the health care delivery system. However, in 1967 the treatment of drug abusers on an outpfltient basis at the com\u00ad munity level was quite controversial. The domin\"'ting legal-political approach to drug abu5 ~ problems at that time was almost exclusively law enforcement-oriented, and most drug abuse treatment was taking place within the framework of inca!I'ceration facil\u00ad ities controlled by the criminal justice sys\u00ad tem. Further, the free clinics were using ex-addicts and street people as para\u00ad professionals in implementing their commu\u00ad nity-based approach to health care and drug abuse treatment.

Glues containing aro\u00ad matic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylene, and the like, were particularly subject to abuse because of the intoxicating properties of these solvents. While the inhalation of volatile substances continues to be a significant drug-abusing behavior, particularly among certain groups of youths L-_______________________________________ -- -~--(e.g., Native Americans), the glue sniffing fad has just about subsided. The practice has diminished for several reasons includ\u00ad ing the presence and discovery of a cornu\u00ad copia of household products from nail polish to spray paint that are just as readily available and have the same abuse poten\u00ad tial as glues, and the current practice of many glue manufacturers of using harmless additives (e.g., mustard compounds) that have obnoxious scents or the ability to produce nausea, thus discouraging their being sniffed.

Lectures and group discussion are used as therapeutic meas\u00ad ures (Zadrozny 1959). habit-forming drug A term used to refer to a drug that may produce either (PSYCHOLOGICAL) or (PHYSICAL) DEPENDENCE in certain users in certain circumstances. This term is often used by drug manufacturers to mean that prolonged use will result in physical dependence, and specifically that the medi\u00ad cine contains an opiate, opiate derivative, synthetic opiate, or barbiturate (LeDain et al. 1973). Others use the term to refer to a drug that may be used chronically but does not produce ADDICTION or dependence to the extent of other drugs. See also habituation. 45 habituation An imprecise term generally used to refer to a state of chronic or continuous attach\u00ad ment to something such as drugs, which is less severe or harmful than ADDICTION. In regard to drug use the term usually implies a state that is psychological in origin and that is characterized by a desire rather than .a compulsion to continue use, with little or no tolerance and no (PHYSI\u00ad CAL) DEPENDENCE (LeDain et al. 1973). The psychical phenomena of adaptation and mental conditioning to the repetition of an effect (Himmelsbach and Small 1937); a condition often used as a synonym for (PSYCHOLOGICAL) DEPENDENCE in which the habitue desires a drug but suffers no ill effects on its discontinuance (Tatum and Seevers 1931: 1 08) According to the WHO Expert Committee (1957), a state of periodic or chronic intoxication produced .by the repeated consumption of a drug, the main elements of which are (1) desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well\u00ad being it engenders; (2) little or no tend\u00ad ency to increase the dose; (3) some degree of psychic dependence, on the effect of the drug I but absence of physical depend\u00ad ence and hence of an abstinence syndrome; (4) detrimental effects, if any, are primary on the individual (not society). The term \"habituationll came into use begin\u00ad ning in the 1920s in order to draw' a djs\u00ad tinction between \"addiction\" to the opiates and the compulsive or chronic use of other drugs that did not appear to produce to the same degree either tolerance or physi\u00ad cal discomfort upon abstinence. In con\u00ad trast to addiction, habituation was linked to a weakness of the individual will rather than specific drug effects and was viewed as a problem of far less magnitude (National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse 1973:123). Attempts to maintain this dichotomy, however, were not success\u00ad ful, as the nature of chronic drug-using behavior involves a range of complex indi\u00ad vidual-drug interactic 1S that cannot be compartmentalized into two such mutually exclusive categories (Grinspoon and Hedblom 1975:151). As the National Com\u00ad mission observes, \"determining the point where the lesser (habituation) becomes the greater (addiction) is bound to be arbitrary, since, as is true in all biological responses, there is a wide range of varia\u00ad tion in the same individual and between individuals\" (National Commission on Mari\u00ad huana and Drug Abuse 1973:125). Many were further concerned about the concom-itant tendency to apply the term \"addic\u00ad tion\" to any misuse of drugs outside medical practice, with a connotation of serious harm to the individual and society. As a result, in the early 1960s the World Health Organization and American Medical Association, recognizing that the distinc\u00ad tion between addiction and habituation was unclear and unscientific, recommended retiring the use of both terms, with the WH 0 committee substituting the term (DRUG) DEPENDENCE to replace them both (Eddy et al. 1965). halfway house A program or facility that attempts to com\u00ad bine the advantages of RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT with those of (AMBU LA TORY) TREATMENT by solving problems through group interaction and community involve\u00ad ment. Patients live in a group but are permitted to leave the facility during the day and perhaps on weekends. Originally a term given to guidance centers for offen\u00ad ders who are \"halfway out\" of prison on probation or parole, which sought to assist in the demands of daily participation in community life. Now it applies also to facilities in which a person who recently has been discharged from a mental hospital attempts to adjust to living outside the hospital (Zad rozny 1959; Encyclopedia of Sociology 1981). They are now perceivea as a basic correctional modality that is useful in at least 5 ways: (1) a bridge between a highly structured institutional setting in which a person has little individ\u00ad ual initiative and a relatively unstructured parole setting in which the person has much greater individual initiative and responsibility; (2) a means for providing assistance to the newly released parolee who is precipitously faced with the many and varied problems of being in a commu\u00ad nity; (3) a place to which inmates who have no satisfactory residence plan may be released; (4) an opportunity for the parole agent to get a better understanding of the parolee by more frequent and inten\u00ad sive observation in the house so that the agent can more effectively provide the needed control, treatment, and assistance; and (5) an alternative to return to a cor\u00ad rectional institution (prison) for those parolees who violate the conditions of their release (Berecochea and Sing 1972).

These drugs may produce pro\u00ad found alterations in sensation, mood, and consciousness at doses that result in com\u00ad paratively light physiological activity. Although most experiences are visual, they may also involve the sense of hearing, touch, smell, or taste, sometimes simultane\u00ad ously. They are also variously J terms refer to some\u00ad what overlapping effects alleged to occur with this group of drugs, probably none of which are entirely adequate as descrip\u00ad tive terms (Schultes 1976). No term fully satisfies. Psychedelic is the preferred term of users, but hallucinogen has gained the widest support. Included in this (STP, DOM). The term has also been applied to the pseudohaliucinogens such as NUTMEG and mace. While other drugs, such as alcohol or cannabis, may produce hallucinations if a very high dose is used, they are not classified as hallu\u00ad cinogens because this is not the usual effect expected or experienced. I n low doses, the effects of hallucinogens vary widely depending on variations in drug taken and the unique sensitivity of user at the time of use.

Usually contrasted with SOFT DRUGS. Harris-Dodd Act See Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965. Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 The first Federal antinarcotics statute and the basis of all subsequent narcotics con\u00ad trols until the passage of the DRUG ABUSE ACT OF 1970. Ostensibly the act was a tax measure designed for the open control and orderly marketing of narcotics, among which were classified the opiates and cocaine. The three central parts of the act stated that (1) anyone engaged in the production or distribution of narcotics had to register with the Federal Government and keep records of all transactions with these drugs; (2) all parties handling the drugs through either purchase or sales had to pay a nomi. :al tax (1 percent per ounce); and (3) unregistered persons could purchase drugs only on prescriptions from physicians, .and such prescriptions had to be for legitimate medical use. The dispensing of narcotics by registered phy\u00ad sicians !lin the course of their professional practicel! was not prohibited. The act's avowed purpose was then primarily to bring the domestic drug traffic into observable channels. However, the pos\u00ad session of untaxed narcotics had become a crime and following the passage of the act, the Treasury Department became respon\u00ad sible for its enforcement and inaugurated a pol icy of prohibiting the prescribing of narcotics for nonmedical maintenance. In two la ndma rk decisions in 191'9 (U. S. v. Doremus v. U.S.), tri'eU:\"S. Supreme courfLiPheld fFi'e\"actls constitu\u00ad tionality and severely restricted the right of doctors to prescribe opiates, asserting that doctors who maintained narcotic users violated the law and that maintenance of a user was illegal unless it was part of an attempt to cure (detoxify) the habit. In Linder v. U.S., the Supreme Court later modified tliis stand, implying that if done in good faith a physician could prescribe narcotics to a patient. This ruling, how\u00ad ever, had little impact. Subsequent legis\u00ad lation that supplemented the Harrison Act were the NARCOTIC DRUGS IMPORT AND EXPORT ACT OF 1922, the MARIHUANA TAX ACT OF 1937, the BOGGS AMEND\u00ad MENT of 1951, the NARCOTICS DRUG CONTROL ACT OF 1956 and the DRUG ABUSE CONTROL AMENDME.NTS OF 1965. 47 These acts were repealed and replaced by the DRUG ABUSE ACT OF 1970. hash oil A highly refined oily cannabis extract that contains the highest concentration of THC of all forms of cannabis, up to 40 percent. Hash oil is thick and can be dark brown, yellow, reddish-yellow, or clear in color. It can be applied a drop at a time to mari\u00ad juana tobacco or spread on the paper used to roll JOINTS and cigarettes. It does not have the characteristic smell of marijuana when burned. Crystallized hash oil can have a potency of 60 percent THC. The THC content in hash oil deteriorates rapidly when not properly refrigerated. Classification: cannabis. hashish The dried caked resin produced from the tops and leaves of the female CANNABIS plant. Hashish contains a higher concen\u00ad tration of THe (up to 14 percent) than MARIJUANA. Hashish comes in many dif\u00ad ferent shapes but is often sold in little rectangular tablets. The tablets can be soft, crumbly, or hard and may be from light brown to black in color. It has a heavy marijuana odor when burned.

Henderson Hospita.1 The current name of the institution in Britain in which the THERA:-:'EUTIC COM\u00ad MU N ITY concept was first utilized among 48 a group of social deviants after World War II. Under the guidance of Dr. Maxwell Jones and others, a democratic system was established in which domination of the hos\u00ad pital by \"professionals\" was replaced by a democratic system of open commun ication and sharing of problemsolving and dec.ision\u00ad making. The nucleus of this process was daily meetin~s of the staff and patie:lts. The original name for this clinic, which was established in 194,1, was the Social Rehabilitation Unit'of the Belmont Hospital (Jones 1979). hepatitis Inflammation of the liver. Serum hepatitis is an acute viral illness that can be trans\u00ad mitted by parenteral exposure from contam\u00ad inated derivative isolated in 1898 in Germany by the pharmacologist Heinrich Dreser in the search for non-habit-forr.;ing ANALGESICS to take the place of morphine. It was named after the German word \"heroisch\" meaning large, big, powerful. Although heroin was considered nonaddictIve when first introduced, by 1924 the U.S. Congress had prohibited its manufacture in the United States; by 1956 all existing stocks on hand were required to be sur\u00ad rendered. Heroin is 2 to 3 times as potent analgesically as morphine, although in equi\u00ad potent doses the effects are simlla r. The preference for heroin use over morphine is yet to be thoroughly explained; whatever physical factors are involved, and the logistics of illicit traffic, heroin is most potent, least bulky and easiest to conceal, and provides greatest profit.

Himmelsbach test This test was developed and used exten\u00ad sively at the now defunct Addiction Research Center in Lexington, Kentucky, as a means for assessing the severity of a patient's opiate withdrawal syndrome. It consists of assigning points for various symptoms observed over a set time period. The points are then totaled for an overall index score. A score of 0-20 points indi\u00ad cates mild illness; 20-30 points, moderate illness; and 30-35 points, severe illness. The observed symptoms and their point system is shown in the following table.

Treffert et a!. (1976) argue that the holis\u00ad tic model is the most effective means for approaching and evaluating drug abuse treatment. They stress that drug abuse treatment should strive for total life changes, and suc~ess should be measured in the context of the facilitation of total person changes. homegrown 49 Slang. Marijuana grown in or around the home for personal use or sharing with friends, as opposed to growth for commer\u00ad cial purposes. Marijuana is easily culti\u00ad vated and can be grown undetected in small quantities on balconies, rooftops, gardens, clearings in wooded areas, and even in closets LInder artificial lights. Under the laws of most States, conviction for growing marijuana is deemed prima facie as \"manu\u00ad facturing with intent to distribute\" and carries heavy penalties. The production of homegrown marijuana received a big boost with the PARAQUAT scare that occurred in the mid-1970s. homeostasis A state of equilibrium within an individual brought about by internal regulatory proc\u00ad esses. These processes are automatic and are largely chemical in nature, affecting physiological and psychological systems. Examples include maintenance of blood sugar level, body temperature, and heart rate. Endorphins may be involved in the addiction process by playing an important role in the body's internal homeostasis.

Thorn<;like. a principal premise of this theory is that behavior followed by a 53 reward will tend to be repeated and that behavior that is not rewarded will tend to fade away (Encyclopedia of Sociology 1981). A primary example of learning theory applied to the drug field is Becker's (1963) observation that an individual will be able to use marijuana for pleasure only when the individual goes through a process of learning to conceive it as a commodity that can be used in this way. No one b~comes a user without (1) learning to smoke the drug in a way that will produce real effects, (2) learning to recognize the effects and connect them with drug lise, and (3) learning to enjoy the sensations that are perceived.

For the individual involved in a deviant subculture, the central life interest or major social role constitutes both the deviancy itself and the pursuit of the means necessary to sustain that deviance. A number of distinct lifestyles have been identified among drug-using populations; for example, Brotman and Freedman (1968) formulated a typology of four types of lifestyles that exist among heroin users: (1) conformist--highly involved in conventional life; (2) hustler-\u00ad highly involved in criminal life; (3) two-worlder--highly involved in both con\u00ad ventional and criminal life; and (4) unin\u00ad volved--not significantly involved in either area.

In the United States, because of strict interpretation and enforcement of the HARRISON NARCOTICS ACT OF 1914, until recently maintenance therapy was prohibited and doctors were prevented from giving narcotics to addicts for the relief of withdrawal symptoms. However, in the late 1960s METHADONE MAINTE\u00ad NANCE programs began to be established under clinical supervision.

Before 1968, addicts could obtain opiates, including heroin, from thei r physicians; since then, stricter controls have been placed on opiate narcotics and they may be obt9ined only through special clinics. major tranquilizers See tranquilizers, antipsychot.ic. MAO inhibitors Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antidepres\u00ad sants related chemically to the AMPHETA\u00ad MI NES and used as psychic mood elevators, particularly in the treatment of psychotic depression. Potent, unpredictable drugs, they are capable of producing a variety of dangerous side effects. Deaths have resulted from their administration in con- . junction with the following substances, whose effects they potentiate: alcohol, amphetamines, depressants, antihistamines, sedatives, anesthetic drugs, and insulin. MAO inhibitors are divided into two gories: anti\u00ad depressants. Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 The first Federal law designed to locate and control\u00b7 those individuals engaged in transactions involving marijuana by requir\u00ad Ing al I persons who handled the drug to pay a tax, register as hand lers, and record their transactions. The act pro\u00ad vided that (1) all persons using the plant .for defined industrial or medical purposes must register and pay a tax of $1.00 per ounce, (2) all those using it for purposes undefined by the act must pay a tax of $100 per ounce on unregistered transac\u00ad tions, and (3) all persons failing to comply with the above regulations were subject to penalties of tax evasion (a fine of not more than $2,000 and/or a prison sentence of not more than 5 years). While theoretically only a means of raising revenue, the act was designed to eliminate recreational use (concerns over which had recently esca\u00ad lated), by making users who made pUr\u00ad chases on the illicit market and who, therefore, did not pay the high tax liable to arrest on charges of tax evasion. The law was formulated as a tax measure because many people still argued that Fed\u00ad eral control over drug use and over the prescription practices of the medical pro\u00ad fession was unconstitutional (Austin 1978; Grinspoon 1977:21). marijuana An ambiguous term related to the varieties of CANNABIS plants cultivated for their . intoxicating properties. Marijuana may refer specifically to the fresh plant or to the dried and shredded preparation made from the flowering tops, stems, and leaves of the female. It is also used to refer generally to all of the various intoxicating cannabis preparations. For example, descriptions of lithe effects of marijuanall usually relate to all of the various prepa\u00ad rations. The phrases \"marijuana jointll or IIbag of marijuanall refer to the leafy, dried product. Marijuana is one of the world's oldest cul\u00ad tivated plants. It was grown by the Assyrians for use as incense in the 9th cpntury B.C. It has, thus, been in use for thousands of years, spreading from the Near East, Central Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe to North America. It is found today in nearly all sectors of the globe despite its near-universal contra\u00ad band status, and it is deeply ingrained in I -j the cultu res of many countries such as India, Jamaica, Morocco, and N-epal. Recent survey data suggest that marijuana use is making significant inroads in the United States. The 1979 NATIONAL SUR\u00ad VEY ON DRUG ABUSE sponsored by NIDA indicates tha\"t two-thirds (68.2 percent) of young adults age 18 to 25, three in ten (30.9 percent) of youths age 12 to 17, and one-fifth (19.6 percent) of older adults age 26 and over report having ever used marijuana. From 1977 to 1979, there was a significant increase in both preva\u00ad lence and current use rates reported among young adults and older adults, but not among youths. The experience level (tried at lea$t once) for young adults rose from 59.9 percent in 1 ~77 to 68.2 percent in 1979 while current use increased 8 percent\u00ad age points (27.~ percent to 35.~ percent). Among older adults, lifetime prevalence increased from 15.3 percent in 1977 to 19.6 percent in 1979 and current use rose from 3.3 percent to 6.0 percent. Why marijuana's current surge of populari~y in the United States? Peer pressure, CUrI\u00ad osity seeking, less fearfulness about side effects, and antiestablishment symbolism are all involved to a degree. But certainly the most important factor is the intoxicat\u00ad ing effect of the drug itself. The type of altered sense of reality created by mari\u00ad juana is the bottom line of why it is experi\u00ad encing such widespread use today. While marijuana is consumed for its effects, what a user may actually experience is highly variable and uncertain and may range from zero effects to hallucinations and from relaxed euphoria to acute feelings of panic and discomfort. The effect achieved depend:., upon the environment in which the drug is consumed, user feelings at the time of consumption, and the dose. The dose, in turn, depends upon the route of ingestion--usually smoked (~igaret~e ?r wet or dry pipe) or eaten (solid or liquid preparations)--and THC content (near 0 percent in hemp to 60 percent in crystal\u00ad lized hash oil). It is this broad possible combination of variables that makes the effects of marijuana highly inconsistent between users and for an individual user from one time to the next. The desired effects of marijuana have been variously described as a sense of well\u00ad being, a dreamy state of rela~ation and euphoria, diverted alterations In thought formations, a more vivid sense of touch and perceptions, and distorted concepts of time and space. Symptoms fairly com-56 mon!y, but not always, associated with marijuana use are reddening of the eyes, dryness of the mouth, hunger, mild TACHYCARDIA, and reduction of pressure in the occular fluid of the eyes. Whether the effects of marijuana are sub\u00ad ject to TOLERANCE is open to differences of opinion. There are strong indications, however, that tolerance does occur. Smith and Seymour (in press) postulate that the tolerance associated with marijuana use would take thE; form of a II U II curve if the degree of tolerance is plotted on one axis and the extent of use plotted on the other. Novices (because af inexperience, resist\u00ad ance, and largely unknown reasons) often exhibit a high tolerance to the intoxicating effects of marijuana. Occasional users experience the lowest tolerance, and there\u00ad fore get high easier. Heavy users, like novices, also exhibit tolerance and seldom receive the full impact of the drug effects once experienced at earlier stages of use, according to Smith and Seymour The adverse effects of marijuana may be either acute or chronic. Acute adverse effects include the acute behavioral toxic\u00ad ities and the acute toxic reaction. Acute behavioral toxicities include inte rference with immediate memory and other intellec\u00ad tually related skills. Such toxic effects pose definite impediments to positive per\u00ad formance in the classroom, particularly by adolescents. Another form of acute behav\u00ad ioral toxicity to marijuana use is believed to result in j~lIpaired driving skill and c:'ratic dr;ving. Safety-threatening decreases in reaction time, perceptual\u00ad motor coorc.ination, and attention may be experienced The other type of acute adverse reaction is the acute toxic reaction in which the user may experience anywhere f,'om mild to extreme discomfort from the effects of the drug. The intoxication brings on a sense of loss of control, fear, and self-doubt. Dr. David Snlith and his associates (Smith and Seymour, in press) at the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic in San Francisco have observed the acute reaction to marijuana and describe the malady as fo! lows \", , , marijuana can precipitate an acute psychotic reaction in a marginally adjusted or poorly organized personality. In such cases, the psychosis is characteristic of the per\u00ad sonality structure of the user, not of the drug. The drug intoxication merely tri~\u00ad gers the psychosis. This can happen with a variety of drugs, including LSD and PCP. Even with better organized personal\u00ad ities, precipitate severe, though less profoundly disorganizing, psy\u00ad chological changes, particularly in the presence of threatening environmental stimuli. I ntoxication may produce a keener awareness of existing stresses and may hinder the ability to maintain structural defenses. In both cases, problems can occur for persons who are quite familiar with the drug but who are caught in a confluence of various psychosocial stresses, threatening stimuli, or a higher dose of marijuana than the individual is used to. II Marijuana has been suspected of having an impact on several of the body's major organs and functional systems, resulting in chronic adverse effects. Among the various targets of current investigation 57 a re the heart, lungs, immune system, brain, endocrine system, reproductive system, and cell chromosomes. The most conclusive evidence of adverse effects relates to the lungs. Heavy mari\u00ad juana smoking poses all the potentially threatening risks associated with heavy tobacco cigarette smoking, including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer. Marijuana can increase the heart rate in individuals, and it can reduce the sperm count and motility in males and interfere with fertility in females. Studies of pregnant nonhuman primates and rats have shown that marijuana consumed at comparable human dosages posed serious threats to their fetuses. There is also evidence that marijuana use can precipitate seizures among epileptics. The use of marijuana is, therefore, unwise and contra\u00ad indicated among individuals with heart con\u00ad ditions, fertility problems, pregnancy, or epilepsy. Evidence related to the adverse effects of marijuana on the immunr system, endocrine system, and cell chromosomes is contradic\u00ad tory and inconclusive. Studies of brain damage or brain atrophy resulting from prolonged marijuana use have been largely negative in their findings. The issue of whether chronic adverse psychological effects result from heavy marijuana use remains cloudy, but many clinicians, includ\u00ad ing Dr. William Pollin, Director of NIDA, feel that regular use of marijuana may seriously interfere with psychological func\u00ad tioning (Pollin 1979:6). The chemistry of marijuana, a natural, organic substance, is extremely comp'lex. Its chemistry also changes from the fresh plant, to the dried preparation, to the inhaled smoke produced by burning. Dried marijuana contains over 420 chemical. com-pounds, including 61 chemicals--the canna\u00ad binoids--that are specific to cannabi s. Delta-9-THC is generally cited as the psy\u00ad choactive ingredient of marijuana, but recent\" research suggests that other com\u00ad pounds acting independently or interacting with delta-9-THC also contribute to the intoxicating potency of the drug. (For a description of the botanical nature of mari\u00ad juana, see cannabis.) Research on the metabolism of marijuana has centered primarily on THC. Like nearly everything else associated with mari\u00ad juana, the metabolic process is complex and not entirely understood. It has been briefly described by Dr. Reese Jones (198():57-58) in the following manner: IIAfter absorption, because THC is so fat soluble, it leaves the bloodstream very rapidly. . . The THC in the blood is rapidly changed to l1-hydroxy-THC, a metabolite that is also psychoactive, and to at least 20 other known metabolic products that are either relatively inactive or have unknown activity. This metabolism mostly occurs in the liver. . THC leaves the blood rapidly, not only because it is metab\u00ad olized but also because of its efficient uptake by tissues. An understanding of the pharmacologic properties of TH C is necessarily complex because of its compli\u00ad cated pharmacokinetic behavior: that is, its apparent entry into multiple body com\u00ad partments, THe's multiple metabolites, the formation of both active and inactive metab\u00ad olites, and the tendency for TH C and metabolites to bind tightly to proteins in the blood and to remain for long periods of time in fatty tissues. While stored in body fats, THC and its metabolites are slow Iy released back into the bloodstream. Thus, 5 days after a single injection of THC, 20 percent of the THC remains stored, while 20 percent of its metabolies remain in the blood. Complete elimination of a single dose can take 30 days. After the passage of about 6 hours, the step that limits the rate of elimination of unchanged T H C in the blood is not its metabol ism but rather the very\u00b7slow return to the plasma of THC that has been sequestered in the tissues .... Given the slow clearance of cannabinoids, one might predict that repeated administra\u00ad tion of marijuana at intervals of less than 8 to 10 days should result in accumulation of THC or its metabolites in the tissues.\" The dosage of THC contained in marijuana is extremely variable and, for the ordinary user, unpredictable. The potency of dried leafy marijuana depends upon a number of variables including the genetics of the plant, the soil and climate in which it was grow'n, when and how it was harvested, its sex t how it was prepared t the parts used, and how it was stored before use. THC content also varies radically across the spectrum of marijuana preparations: hemp and wild U.S. cannabis (less than 0.5 percent); cultivated marijuana (0.5 to 58 5 percent--1 to 2 ;1ercent common); sinse\u00ad milla (up to 6 percent); hashish (8 to 14 percent); hash oil (15 to 40 percent); hash oil crystals (up to 60 percent). The Uni\u00ad versity of Mississippi School of Pharmacy, under contract with N I DA, grows, ha rvests, prepares, and assays an assortment of standardized marijuana strains. The sam\u00ad ples are labeled with :their exact cannabi\u00ad noid content and are distributed for use in research projects around the country. Marijuana has been used as a medical agent since antiquity. The Chinese employed it as an anesthetic 5,000 years ago. The ancient Persians, Greeks, Romans, East Indians, and Assyrians used cannabis to control muscle spasms, reduce pain, and treat indigestion, and it has since been used as an herbal preparation in folk medi\u00ad cine in Asia and Africa. It was accepted into IIprofessionalll Western medicine around 1839 and enjoyed medicinal status through\u00ad out the 19th century for the treatment of a host of ills from insomnia to menstrual cramps. At one time marijuana extracts were available from such major pharmaceu\u00ad tical houses as Parke-Davis, Squibb, and Lilly (Young et al. 1977: 130). With passage of the proscriptive MARIJUANA TAX ACT OF 1937, medicinal marijuana products became more difficult, and less popular, to prescribe. In 1941 marijuana was dropped from the two official compendia of drugs in the United States, the U.S. PHARMA\u00ad COPEIA and the NATIONAL FORMULARY, although it has continued to be used thera\u00ad peutically in Asia and the Midd Ie East. Despite the prejudice and taboo status marijuana has received in the United States for most of the 20th century, scientists are again looking at it for its medicinal properties. Marijuana, or its derivatives, are being tested as potential treatment aids for loss of appetite, anorexia nervosa, heart attack, migraine headache, hyperten\u00ad sion,asthma, epileptic seizure (see can\u00ad nabidiol), spasticity, and insomnia. .Two of the more promising areas of medical application are for the treatment of occular pressure associated with glaucoma and as an antiemetic for controlling the nausea side effects of certain anticancer drugs. There is also evidence marijuana can be effective in controlling the spasticity suf\u00ad fered by individuals with multiple sclerosis, stroke, cerebral palsy, paraplegia, and spinal cord injuries. Currently 32 States have passed laws facilitating the use of marijuana in research and treatment. Mari\u00ad juana is classified as a Schedule I drug by the DEA, which operationally defines it as a hallucinogen without medical applica\u00ad tion. A bill is now pending in the U. S. Congress that would reschedule marijuana to allow its use in medical treatment and provide for the availability of therapeutic marijuana to the medical community. Is marijuana saint or sinner? It is more than likely neither, being not easily reduced to simplistic notions of all black or all white. It is legally contraband, but it is widely used. It is undoubtedly toxic, but it also has medical uses, It is the recreational drug of choice of millions of adults (an estimated 16 to 20 million current users), but it is nearly universally consid\u00ad ered to be ruinous for adolescents. It is the target of liberation by the political far\u00ad left and the target of vilification by the far-right. Some practicing clinicians in the drug abuse field feel that while marijuana use should not be condoned, other widely used drugs such as alcohol and tobacco pose more of an immediate public health danger to society. Smith and Seymcur (in press), for example, observe that lithe overall issues surrounding marijuana toxicity are emotional'ly charged and fraught with con\u00ad tradictions. At the same time that encul\u00ad turation of marijuana use is spreading across population barriers and becoming fashionable in a wide variety of circles, public officials and health professionals seem to be finding it politically expedient to take a hard line agai nst its use. One unfortunate reaction to this surge toward abolition is an evident downgrading of the dangers our young face from alcohol and tobacco, two drugs whose physical dangers have been demonstrated beyond a doubt. What we are seeing is a condoned resur\u00ad gence of these drugs of high abuse poten\u00ad tial by the dominant culture, while the postulated dangers of marijuana are mag\u00ad nified in the public eye. For example, in recent national meetings on marijuana, one drug expert indicated that marijuana is the number one public health problem among youths, while another drug expert stated that he would rather see youths use short-acting drugs like alcohol and tobacco rather than marijuana. All scien\u00ad tific indicators demonstrate that alcohol produces far more damage and public health risk in adolescents than does mari\u00ad juana, and the statements described above are based not on scientific evidence but rather appeal to public stereotype and cur\u00ad rent political ideology that overstates the dangers of marijuana and underreacts to the problem of alcohol. There are . . clinically demonstrated instances of acute and chronic toxic dangers involving the use of marijuana. However, these dangers and other postulated effects must be viewed in perspective relative to other drug abuse problems in our society, includ\u00ad ing legally sanctioned drugs such as alco\u00ad hol and tobacco. II Research on marijuana continues. While few findings on the drug's effects have been definitive, the notion that marijuana is IIsafell is facing a mounting challenge. According to NlDA's Dr. William Pollin (1979:10), \"Unfortunately, the hesitancy of the scientific community in not drawing unwarranted definitive concl usions from what are preliminary research findings has led many to conclude that marijuana is with\u00ad out serious medical haza rd, even for the very young. In reality, the situation is more like that following the popularization of cigarette smoking at the time of World War I. It required 50 years of research for the truly serious implications of ciga\u00ad rette smoking to become apparent . . while much remains to be learned about the health implications of marijuana . our present evidence clearly indicates that it is not a 'safe' substance . virtually all clinicians working with children and adolescents agree that regular use of mari\u00ad juana by youngsters is highly undesirable . there is little serious question that regular use of an intoxicant that blurs real- . ity and encourages a kind of psychological escapism makes growing up more difficult. While there is controversy over the impli\u00ad cations of present research concerning adult use, few would argue that every effort should be made to actively discour.:.. age use by children and adolescents.\" Also spelled marihuana.

A term sociologists first applied to adoles\u00ad cent urban gang members who tended to 387-396 0 -82 - 5 : QL 3 59 give up their gang association when they entered their twenties. When Charles Winick analyzed the Federal Bureau of Narcotics inactive file of addicts (files with no new report entries for 5 years), he discovered that addicts who had been using heroin for 10 years tended to become i~ac\u00ad tive in the FBN's files at about age 30. Winick (1962) hypothesized that these indi\u00ad viduals went through a maturing-out proc\u00ad ess similar to the urban gang members. Don Waldorf (1973) suggests that length of heroin use may be more important than age as a factor in the cessation of heroin use. He states tha t, \"I t may be that per\u00ad sons 'burn-out' of heroin use and addiction after an extended period of use rather than mature-out with age.\" (RIS 27:351-- 15 entries) Mayor's Committee on Marihuana See La Guardia Report. mazindol A SYMPATHOMIMETIC AMI NE used as an ANORECTIC.

Contrast with nonmedical drug use. medical models Explanatory models that tend to define drug abuse or addiction in medical, not social, terms. Drug abuse is seen as a chronic disease rather than a social prob\u00ad lem, an aberrant phenomenon afflicting otherwise healthy individuals. Attention is focused on the drug taken as a disease\u00ad causing agent, rather than on the per\u00ad sonality of the drug user or the society in which the user lives. The individual and/or social needs to take the drug are deemphasized, and efforts are usually directed toward medical cures and drug abuse prevention measures (Jacobs 1976: 115; Siegler and Osmond 1968). See also psychosocial models. (RIS 27:351--14 entries) meperidine hydrochloride One of the most widely used of the OPI-60 o IDS, especially in childbirth and for relief of other severe pains.

Slang names are listed in appendix B. Classification: hal- lucinogens. (RIS 27:214--7 entries) metabolic disorder theory of addiction A drug addiction paradigm that views addiction as -a function of the manner in which the drug is metabolized by the body. For example, Dole and Nyswander (1967) hold that although initial heroin use may be psychological in origin, it is the vari\u00ad able \"imprint\" of the drug on the nervous system that causes the protracted addiction syndrome. By treating narcotic addiction as a metabolic disease with the use of a narcotic antagonist such as methadone, the narcotic hunger that results from the physical effects of the opiates is prevented, thus allowing the individual to live a more normal life. On this theory, see also Lukoff (1977:216-217). See also addiction. metabolism The process by which the body, using enzymes and other internal biochemicals, breaks down ingested substances such as foods and drugs so they may be consumed and eliminated. metabolite The biochemical byproduct resulting from the metabolism of a substance. A metab\u00ad olite may produce a chemical effect that is altogether different from that of the orig\u00ad inal substance. methadon Original American spelling of the drug METHADONE HYDROCHLORIDE. methadone hydrochloride An OPIOID largely used in the maintenance treatment of HERO I N dependency because (1) it prevents heroin withdrawal symptoms; (2) it fulfills the addict's physical need for the drug; (3) at sufficiently high doses it blocks the effects of heroin through CROSS-TOLERANCE, thus a shot of street heroin while undergoing metha\u00ad done treatment will probably give no pleas\u00ad urable effect; (4) it is a longer acting drug than heroin, the average dose lasting 24 hours, thus making it more convenient to administer; (5) it is effective orally, thus breaking the reliance on the ritual of injection; and (6) it can be dispensed at a treatment center. The ultimate aim is to wean addicts from heroin and the heroin lifestyle and allow them to adjust to a new lifestyle through which they can then withdraw from methadone and live drug free. It is thus often used not only for maintenance but for DETOXIFICATION from opiate addiction by reducing doses gradually over a short period. Critics argue that because the patient is still dependent on an opiate narcotic, it is doubtful users will ever withdraw from methadone. Data have shown not only that people can become addicted to metha\u00ad done in such legal settings, but that some people continue to use heroin and other illicit drugs while takirig methadone and that for many methadone has become a drug of preference, thus generating an active illicit market. Some patients complain that methadone and the daily \"treatment\" proc\u00ad ess is just as disruptive as heroin use. Recently. a neW synthetic opiate, LAAM, has been advocated as an alternative to methadone for treatment purposes because daily doses are not An ambulatory treatment program of main\u00ad tenance of heroin addicts on METHADONE, begun experimentally in 1964 at Rockefeller University Hospital, New York. There are two types of programs: the original high-dose model, originally developed by Drs. Vincent Dole and Marie Nyswander in the early 1960s (Dole and Nyswander 1965); and the low-dose model. Both models use the oral administration method, generally in liquid form and dissolved in fruit drinks. In the high-dose model, treatment begins by increasing the patient's tolerance until it can accommodate a daily dosage of between 50 and 120 milligrams. The low-dose model stabilizes the patient on 30 milligrams or less a day.

When taken in large doses for purposes other than sleep inducement, it produces muscular relaxation, feelings of contentment, and total passivity, a state someWhat resembling drunkenness.

In drug abuse treatment programs, a set time and place is reserved for this inter\u00ad action among clients and with the staff within the milieu of the treatment center. Subjects frequently include learning to talk with people about things other than drugs, interacting with others \\\"ithout let\u00ad ting anger turn to violence, learning to ask for help when help is needed, learning to have a good time without having to get high, and learning to cope with new and unfamiliar situations (Maglin 1975). mimetic Imitative.

Still one of the most useful of medical drugs, it is considered by some to be superior to all other pain relievers. In addition to pain relief, it reduces drive states and encourages sleep. Since the Harrison Narcotics Act and the spread of heroin use. the recreational use of mor\u00ad phine has declined, although the subjective effects of the two drugs in equivalent potencies are almost identical.

The naltrexone treatment experience, while still in the clinical trial stage, has had mixed results. The efficacy of the drug in terms of its duration and opiate block\u00ad ade effect has been well documented. Nal\u00ad trexone treatment research programs, how~ver, have been characterized by rela\u00ad tively high client dropout rates. Some therapists have concluded that naltrexone therapy is closer to a drug-free approach than to other chemotherapies such as meth\u00ad adone maintenance and, as such, must be reinforced with strong nonchemical program elements (Taintor et al. 1975; Resnick and Classification: nar\u00ad cotic antagonists. naphtha A highly flammable hydrocarbon obtained by the distillation of petroleum ~,nd similar to kerosene and gasoline.

NARA See Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act. test A test used to determine opiate depend\u00ad ency. Also known as the naloxone chal\u00ad lenge. Another similar procedure is the Nalline test. Both tests rely upon the narcotic antagonistic properties of these drugs to induce visible symptoms when administered to persons with opiates in their systems. These types of tests are frequently used to monitor the use of opi\u00ad ates among inmates in prison. The Nalline test is the older of the two-\u00ad over 100,000 of these tests have been per\u00ad formed annually in the California State prison system alone. The test is based upon the concept that a sma! I dose of nalorphine (Nalline) produces an increase in pupil size in a person actively addicted to narcotics. The subject is placed before a constant lighting source, the pupils are measured, 3 rng of nalorphine is injected subcutaneously, and pupil measurements are taken again 20, 30, and 40 minutes after {he injection. I ncreased pupil dila\u00ad tion of more than 0.5 mm is considered a positive test (DeAngelis 1976). Naloxone (Narcan), unlike nalorphine, is a pure antagonist, and either alone or in combination with nalorphine has shown evidence of producing more reliable results than the NalJine test. DeAngelis (1976:22) describes the concept underlying the Narcan test as follows: \"In the nontolerant, nondependent SUbjEct there is no effect normally. In the subject who has recently had an opiate the pupil will be abnormally constricted. The antag\u00ad onist Narcan will dilate the pupil. If this happens, the presence of an opiate in the system is suggested but no evidence for dependence has been found. \"Narcan has been introduced as a test for physical dependence. It causes Igoose\u00ad flesh,' which is a typical sign of with\u00ad drawal and has nothing to do with acute opiate actives. This sign should be largely independent of whether or not the addict has recently used an opiate. If he is not dependent, the sign will not be elicited.\" See al so narcotic antagonist. narcolepsy A condition characterized by fits of sleep or uncontrollable feelings of extreme sleep\u00ad iness. It may be pathological in nature and may also result as a side effect of certain drugs. (RIS 27:355--6 entries) narcosis From the Greek \"narkosis,\" a benumbing. A reversible state -of pathological reduction in responsiveness and a marked slowing down of the physiological system; a state characterized by stupor or insensibility and a feeling of painlessness or well-being (Chaplin 1975; Dorland's Illustrated Medi\u00ad cal Dictionary 1974). narcotic Medically, usually refers to any drug that dulls a person1s senses and produces a sense of well-being in small doses, and causes insensibility, stupefaction, and even death in large doses. A drug capable of producing NARCOSIS. Sometimes incor\u00ad rectly used to refer to all CNS depressants, including barbiturates and alcohol, and the belladonna group of hallucinogens. Some insist that only those depressant drugs that both sedate and numb or dull the sensation of pain (produce ANALGESIA) should be so classified, thus limiting the use of the tp.rm to OPIUM, the OPIATES, and the OPIOIDS. The term was often used loosely in the 19th century to refer 64 to all nonalcoholic drugs, particularly.those that could produce sleep or hallucinations. Beginning in the early 20th century, the term came to be a synonym for disapproved, illicit drugs, or any \"street\" drug used recreation ally that produced sleep or hallu\u00ad cination and/oY\" appeared addicting or harmful. America's first Federal antinar-cotics law, the HARRISON NARCOTICS ACT OF 1914, included cocaine as a \"nar\u00ad cotic.\" Marijuana, peyote, and chloral hydrate and popu\u00ad larly classified as \"narcotics\" as concerns over their use grew and controls were extended to include them. The term also assumed a social meaning that encompassed debility, addiction, insanity, crime, and death (Bonnie and Whitebread 1974:28). The application of the term \"narcotic\" to any illicit drug still remains (Josephson 1974:xix). The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs defines a \"narcotic\" as any drug under international control, excluding alcohol and nicotine. Bejerot (1975:19) defines it as \"exclusively a legal term\" referring to those \"addicting sub\u00ad stances which have been subjected to spe\u00ad cial national or international legislation.\" Schultes (1976:5) defines it as \"any sub\u00ad stance that has a depressive effect, whether light or great, on the central nervous system\" and includes marijuana. Because of the confusion and negative con\u00ad notations that have developed around the word, most authorities today recommend that, in terms of pharmacological effects, it should be utilized only to refer to the analgesic depressant opium, the opiates, and the opioids. Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act (NARA) of 1966 A Federal law establishing CIVIL COMMIT\u00ad MENT of drug abusers to an in-hospital phase of treatment and an aftercare phase in their home communities. The act also provides for assistance and support to States and municipalities in developing treatment programs and facilities. NARA emphasizes total care: hospitalization plus followup supervision and support to maintain an addict's motivation for rehabil\u00ad itation upon return to the community. Persons eligible for the program are (1) narcotic addicts charged with certain Federal offenses who desire to be committed for treatment in lieu of prosecution (title I), (2) addicts convicted of Federal crimes who are committed by the court (title II), and (3) addicts who wish voluntarily to apply for commitment (title III). N IDA has responsibility for patients under title I; the Department of Justice has respon\u00ad sibility for titles II and III. Both the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services have recom\u00ad mended repeal of NARA on the grounds that the procedures are cumbersome, cer\u00ad tain aspects are infrequently used, it has not proven to be cost beneficial, and in many respects it is incompatible with con- tempora ry treatment approaches. (RI S 27:355--6 entries; 27:290--6 entries) Narcotic Addiction Control Commission (NACC), New York The State agency that ran the New York Addict Commitment Program between 1966 and 1D79. Established in 1966, the NACC incorporated most of the elements of the California civil commitment program. (See CIVIL ADDICT PROGRAM, CALIFORNIA.) Addicts could be committed by either civil or criminal processes, the first applying to addicts who had not been arrested, the second to those who had been arrested and convicted. Under CIVI L COMMIT\u00ad MENT, any person could file a petition to get an addict committed for an indefinite period not to exceed 3 years. CRIMINAL COMMI TMENT was for a maximum of 3 years if the crime committed was a misde\u00ad meanor, 5 years if a felony (New York City 1973; Waldorf 1973:105). This agency was known as NACC between 1966 and 1972; subsequently, it has been known as the Drug Abuse Control Commission (1973-1975), the Office of Drug Abuse Services (1976- 1978), and the Division of Substance Abuse Services (1978-present). All addict com\u00ad mitment centers were closed by 1979. (RIS 27:355--9 entries) narcotic analgesic A term often used synonymously with NAR- COTIC. See also opiate narcotics. narcotic antagonist A drug that blocks or counteracts the effects of OPIATE NARCOTICS. Many have been derived by chemically altering some aspects of natural or synthetic opiate narcotics (Wikler 1958). Among the best known antagonists are CYCLAZOCINE, NALOXONE, NALORPHINE (Nalline), and NAL TREXONE. In antagonists can block the psycholog\u00ad ical and physiological effects of opiate narcotics, including the development of TOLERANCE and (PHYSICAL) DEPENDENCE, and can reverse or prevent toxic effects. They can also precipitate an intense acute WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME in opiate-narcotic\u00ad dependent individuals who have not been detoxified, and this property is sometimes employed for identifying physically depend\u00ad ent persons for medical and legal purposes. (See Narcan test.) Narcotic antagonists may be pu re or mixed. The pu re narcotic antagonists (e.g., naltrexone and naloxone) in reasonable doses will produce little effect on an opiate-detoxified or non-opiate\u00ad dependent person. The mixed, or partial, narcotic antagonists (e. g., cyclazocine, nalorphine, and PENT AZOCI NE) have slight 65 narcotic agonist properties and their cessa\u00ad tion will induce withdrawal symptoms in a user who has developed a physical depend\u00ad ence to opiates. See also extinction. Narcotic Drug Control Act of 1956 A Federal law that specifically outlawed heroin and increased already existing penalties for the transportation, sale, and smuggling of heroin and marijuana into the United States. Restrictions were les\u00ad sened on tapping phone lines, reading telegrams of known traffickers in drugs, and issuing search warrants in narcotics cases; agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Customs were empowered to make arrests without war\u00ad rants from a court for any narcotics viola\u00ad tions committed in their presence. A control record system was established within the Bureau of Narcotics to retain information on all narcotic addicts and vio\u00ad lators that was to be made available to Federal, State, a.1d local law enforcement officials (Encyclopedia of Sociology 1981). Most of the provisions of this act were repealed and replaced by the DRUG ABUSE ACT OF 1970. Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act of 1922 A Federal law authorizing the Federal Nar\u00ad cotics' Control Board to set import quotas on the amounts of opium, cocaine, and their derivatives needed to fulfill medical needs. 1 n addition, under Section 2f of this act, possession without a prescription was made presumptive evidence of conceal\u00ad ment of drugs illegally imported in violation of this act, thus making possession for nonmedical use a Federal crime (Bonnie and Whitebread 1974:20). Repealed and replaced by the DRUG ABUSE ACT OF 1970. Narcotics Anonymous (NA) Narcotics Anonymous (NA) is a worldwide self-help fellowship for recovered drug abusers who give each other support to remain lc1ean.\" NA was formed in 1953 and has over 700 affiliated chapters across the. United States. As its name suggests, NA has adopted the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) model, using an adaptation of the Twelve Steps. Briefly, these steps involve-- Acknowledging that one is a drug abuser '\" Accepting a power greater than oneself and turning one's will and life over to the care of that higher power (as each individual understands the power) GIl Making a moral inventory and redressing wrongs Carrying the NA spiritual message to other drug abusers. 66 In addition, NA uses AA's Twelve Tradi\u00ad tions, which outline the principles that guide the operation of the organization and indi\u00ad vidual chapters (e.g., reliance on member donations for financial support, rejection of professional involvement, maintenance of anonymity in the press and media). The NA fellowship is open to all persons who have a drug problem, no matter what type. Their meetings, held at least weekly, may consist of Twelve Steps discussions, talks by guest speakers, and open or topic discussions, as well as the AA practice of sharing. Demographically, members tend to be young adults, of mixed socioeconomic backgrounds, from all races, and of both sexes (although some groups report that males predominate). Some members may be in or have graduated from treatment pro\u00ad grams, but this is not necessary.

National Commission on Drug Abuse This commi ssion of nationally promi nent citizens was appointed by President Nixon in 1971. I t undertook a 2-year exami nation of drug use, misuse, and abuse and con\u00ad cluded that the old definitions and old ways of looking at these problems required a new set of terms and perspectives. The commission issued two reports (National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse 1972, 1973) that define U',,; issues, provide data on drug-using behavior, assess the social impact, and formulate a rationale toward a coherent social policy toward illicit drugs. It posed a number of recom\u00ad mendations, including the decriminalization of marijuana. Participants in a comparable study of mari\u00ad juana in 1938 appointed by New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia found their recommen\u00ad dations similarly ignored by authorities. Young et al. (1977:131) note that the study group \"found no proof of addiction, no link to aggressive or anti-social behavior, and no sign of tolerance or withdrawal symptoms. Its findings were ignored, however, and marijuana retained its unjust association with hard drugs and hardened criminals.\" See also Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs.

National Institute on Drug Abuse (N IDA) The National Institute on Drug Abuse--or N IDA--was created by Congress under the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972 (Public Law. 92-255). It began operating in 1974 to provide a meaningful response to the growing enigma of illicit drug use. Prior to N I DA the Federal drug effort was scattered across many agencies, and financial support for grassroots treat\u00ad ment programs and drug-related research was plagued with uncertainty. With NIDA's inception the various Federal drug pro\u00ad grams were in large measure consolidated into a single agency. In addition. the budget for the Federal drug activities incorporated into NIDA was increased, authority for new programs was granted, and commitments of long-range support were voiced by both the Congress and the White House. NIDA is organizationally a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. I t is associated with counterpart agencies in the areas of alcohol abuse and mental health under the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA). within the Public Health Serv\u00ad ice. Its annual budget in fiscal year 1981 was $235 million. The vast majority--97 percent--of these funds are funneled to State-and community-based programs in the form of grants and contracts. N I DA headquarters are located in Rockville, Maryland, just north of the Nation's Capi\u00ad tal. N IDA's principal mandate is to support an effective response at the Federal, State, and local levels to the human problems associated with drug use. Because of the complex nature of its charge, N IDA is engaged in a broad spectrum of activities. These activities are designed to address the many facets of this perplexing issue, wh ich is of such great national concern today. They include principally treatment, training, research, prevention, analysis and evaluation, and communications. Address: 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857.

National Survey on Drug Abuse The National Survey on Drug Abuse pro\u00ad vides a broad picture of drug abuse in the American population. In 1979 it was based on a su rvey of 7.224 persons ran\u00ad domly chosen to be representative of those living in households in the conterminous United States. While not completely rep\u00ad resentative of the American population (it does not sample those living in various institutions, the homeless, or those living on military bases and overseas), it pro\u00ad vides a usefu I indication of the general dimensions of the drug problem in the United States and especially of trends in drug abuse. Similar methodology has been employed in the six national su rveys that have thus fa r been conducted (1971, 1972, 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1979). Present plans are to conduct the national survey every 2 years, and the 1981 survey is cur\u00ad rently in progress. Results from the 1977 and 1979 national surveys are published in Abelson et al. (1977), Miller and Cisin (1979), and Fishburne et al. (1979). See also marijuana. Native American Church A religion existing among Native Americans that combines elements of Christianity, native religious rites, and the ritual use of peyote. Peyote use first became appar\u00ad ent among the tribes of the United States in the latter part of the 19th century, when it was used in religious rites and to heal the sick; gradually a religion devel\u00ad oped around the use of the cactus that combined elements of Christianity with the vision-quest ritual typical of the Plains Indians. The religion teaches brotherly love, high moral principles, abstention from ALCOHOL consumption, and considers peyote a sacrament through which God is manifested. Those who practice it have faith in the efficacy of peyote as a cure-all and a true belief in the sacred character of the altered states of consciousness, especially visions, induced by the drug. First legally organized as the Firstborn Church of Christ, today the Native Ameri\u00ad can Chu rch cia ims 250,000 members from 68 all tribes in the United States and Canada (Schultes 1976:120). Although the U.S. Government at fi rst tried to discourage this church, it gradually became recog\u00ad nized that peyotism as practiced by the Indians was a sincere religion, and the courts have upheld it as such under the Bill of Rights. Peyotisrn does not interest all Native Americans; many prefer either traditio:1al Christianity or a revival of their own native religions.

CH \"h: scores of natural medicine healing h~.llniques, what they share in common is that they do not make use of synthetic chemical remedies or surgical techniques. Among the basic concepts of natural medicine are the beliefs that health is a natural state and illness results from bodily imbalances, that sick\u00ad ness results when the body's vital force or animating energy is impeded, that toxi ns create imbalances in the vital force, and that recovery comes by cooperating with nature to restore the vital force through the use of natural substances and mental and physical exercises (Carroll 1980). Examples of natural medicine techniques used in the treatment of drug addiction are acupuncture, acupressure, vitamin regimes, natural diets, dance therapy, macrobiotics, hypnotism, and autohypnotism. nepenthe A potion used by the ancients to dull pain and sorrow. Something capable of causing oblivion of suffering. nervous system The nervous system in humans is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Structurally I the nervous system is divided into the 'central nervous system (CNS), consisting of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, con\u00ad sisting of the nerve fibers and cells that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Functionally, the nerv\u00ad ous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system deals with functions of the senses and the volun\u00ad tary muscles. The autonomic nervous sys\u00ad tem handles involuntary bodily functions such as heartbeat, digestion, and prepara\u00ad tion for stress, fight, or flight. The autonomic nervous system is composed of two countervailing parts: the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The sympa\u00ad thetic system energizes the bod)' for action by processes such as releasing sugars stored in the liver, slowing the digestive process, and increasing heart and breath\u00ad ing rates. The parasympathetic system maintains the .normal involuntary muscle, organ, and gland functions within the body such as salivation, pupil dilation and con\u00ad striction, digestion and elimination, normal heartbeat, etc. (ANTIPSYCHOTIC) TRANQUILIZER or. major tranquilizer. Over 80 neuroleptic sub\u00ad stances have been identified.

Some of the major neurotrans\u00ad mission systems are the cholinergic system, the adrenergic system, and the indoi\"eami\u00ad nergic system. Each of these systems is defined according to the related group of biochemicals responsible for the transrnis\u00ad sion across the synapses. Cholinergic agents include substances that activate the PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, for example, choline and acetylcholine. Adrenergic agents include epinephrine, norepinephine, and dopamine, substance~ that activate the SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. lndoleaminergeric agents include indole and serotonin (a vasoconstrictor, gastric juice inhibitor, and smooth muscle stimulant) . nialamide An ANTIDEPRESSANT, manufactured as Niamid. nicotine The main active ingredient (ALKALOID) of tobacco. Nicotine is believed to be responsible for most of the effects of smok\u00ad ing and for the fact that tobacco smoking is such a powerful habit. An extremely toxic substance, its general physical effects include irritation of lung tissues, constriction of blood vessels, and increased blood pressure and heart rates. The effects of nicotine are complex and unpre\u00ad dictable, appearing to have various differ\u00ad ent and often opposing simultaneous effects. Generally, it produces CNS stimulation, but in high doses it can also have depres\u00ad sant effects. Regular cigarette smokers claim it calms the nerves; neophytes feel dizzy and stimulated. This difference in perception may be due to TOLERANCE to nicotine effects. Although often classified as a stimulant, many authorities prefer to place it in a separate category.

Also used to refer to the ini\u00ad tiation of the WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME. Age of onset is a major variable often studied by epidemiologists alone and in relation to other variables. Winick (1974) suggests an association between the age of onset of heroin use and variables such as the likelihood of continued use, ability to hold a job, criminality, successful reha\u00ad bilitation, and successful social functioning in general. Winick (1974: 112) states, IIThis relationship is crucial because of the fairly consistent evidence that the age of onset has been declining fairly steadily and is positively correlated with mixed dependencies and earlier criminal involve\u00ad ment in a broader range of offenses. II (RIS 27:358--75 entries) operational definition Used to define a concept in the most unam\u00ad biguous terms possible for purposes of research. It seeks to assign specific mean\u00ad ing to a term, thereby eliminating other possible implied meanings. The term IIpri\u00ad f'\" Jry drug problem, II for example, would likely have a different meaning to different drug treatment program staff. It is there\u00ad fore operationally defined under the Fed\u00ad eral CODAP reporting program as lithe drug that is the major problem in that it has caused the most dysfunction. It is the drug problem for which the client was admitted to treatmenLII In this way a working definition for reporting purposes was established that operationally defined the term IIprimary drug problem. II opiate narcotics A major subclass of drugs that, like alco\u00ad hol and barbiturates, are CNS depressants, but, unlike them, are also pain relievers. Sometimes called simply. NARCOTICS or OPIATES, the term 1I0piate narcoticsll is generally preferred as it avoids confusion over what constitutes a Ilnarcoticll and the semantic problem created by classifying the three distinct forms of OPIUM, OPI\u00ad such as aspirin differ from the opiate narcotics in having far less CNS depressant to the two OPIUM alka\u00ad loids MORPHINE and CODEINE and the semisynthetic drugs derived from them, such as HEROl N (diacetylmorphine) and HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE (Dilaudid). (See also PAPAVERI N E.) Sometimes generally used to refer to opium, opium alkaloids and their derivatives, and the synthetic OPIOIDS as a whole, but it has been argued that this semantically blurs the specific distinctions between these types (Margolis 1978). Morphine and codeine, along with opium, are some\u00ad times referred to as natural opiates, and their derivatives semisynthetic opiates. 222--14 entries) opiates, natural Refers and its two alkaloids CODEINE and MORPHINE. opiates, semisynthetic Refers to the from the two opium alkaloids MORPHINE and to resemble the opium alkaloids MORPHINE and CODEINE and their derivatives in action and effect. The principal synthetics are MEPERIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE (Demerol) and its opiates.\" Although semantically incorrect, opioid is sometimes used as a general term that includes all of the opium and 0plumlike derivatives, natural and opium The NARCOTIC from which all the OPI- A TES are derived. It is obtained from drying the milky discharge of the cut, unripe seedpod (capsule) of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), which appears soon after the petals begin to fall. The major natural ALKALOIDS obtained from opium are MORPHINE (10 percent by weight) and CODEI NE. Opium has been used for centuries as a medicinal and rec\u00ad reational drug. Medically, it was formerly used to treat over 50 different diseases. I n 17th-century England it was praised as God's greatest gift to humanity for the relief of suffering, and until the 20th cen\u00ad tury it was considered the most useful therapeutic agent available. Recreationally, it was primarily smoked or ingested orally. (See LAUDANUM.) The development of more effective opiates, opioids, and non\u00ad narcotic ANALGESICS has now virtually eliminated its use medically, and recrea\u00ad tional users have turoi.ld to the intravenous injection of more powerfu I opiates such as (RIS 27:222--14 entries; opiates, RIS 27:220--161 organic disorder Impairment of function attributed to spe\u00ad cifically known or hypothesized pathological lack or impairment of organic structure (English and English 1958).

Contrast with inpatient. overdose The administration of-a quantity of drug larger than that normally or safely taken at one time, or to which the system has acquired TOLERANCE. Usually implies some adverse or toxic reaction, whether fatal or not, and is most frequently applied to excessive consumption of opiate or hyp-notic-sedative drugs that act to depress the central nervous system causing COMA and often death from respiratory depression or complications such as pneumonia or heart failure. Frequent symptoms of non\u00ad fatal drug overdose, are STU PO Rand AG 1- TATION. Accidental overdoses often occur through (DRUG) AUTOMATISM or the use of a sedative drug with alcohol, which potentiates its effects. (See POTENTIA- T ION. ) Opiate overdosage can be arrested by the use of a NARCOTIC ANTAGONIST such as NALORPHINE (Nalline). A variety of home remedies may be' employed to keep the patient awake and reverse respiratory depression (LeDain et al. 1973; Lingeman 1969) The widespread use of the word \"overdose\" on death certificates has been criticized because there appear to be no consistent toxicologic standards for evalua\u00ad tion of what constitutes a lethal dosage (Lettieri and Backenheimer 1974). In prac\u00ad tice, police and/or coroners often classify a death as due to overdose if any evidence of heroin use is found (Brecher 1972). See also deaths, drug-related.

In 1977 the U.S. Congress prohibited the use of foreign aid for the purchase of paraquat, but Mexico has since continued this form of marijuana eradication on its own. With initiation of the Mexican spraying program, there were fears that anyone smoking mari\u00ad juana laced with paraquat would be exposed to a serious health threat. A large number of marijuana samples, particularly on the West Coast, were turned into laboratories for determining whether they contained paraquat. Home testing kits also become avai lable. Recent studies spqnsored by the CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL in Atlanta, however, indicate that the original widespread fear of the health consequences of paraquat spraying was an overreaction (Smith and Seymour, in press).

Its hallucino\u00ad genic properties were known to the Aztecs, who considered it divine and called it \"peyotl.\" During the 19th century, based on the continuing belief in its divine, supernatural powers, use spread among Native Americans, who used it in their religious rites, as an aid to their tradi\u00ad tional search for divine visions, and to heal the sick. Eventually this use devel\u00ad oped into a religion incorporating elements of Christianity, which is now known as the NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH. As a crucial sacrament of this church, legal use of peyote is limited only to bona fide members. Slang names are listed in term coined by S. Rado (1926) to refer to the pleasurable sensation often reported to be experienced by heroin users after intravenous injection of the drug. Rado believed that the whole mental personality of the addict, together with the drug, represents an autoerotic pleasure apparatus. The oral zone was the key fixation point for the libido and the psychosomatic experi\u00ad ence after injecting the drugs functioned as a new edition of the experience that the infant receives on being satiated after a feeding from the mother's breast. This feeling of well-being following the ingestion of a meal he referred to as the ALIMEN- TARY ORGASM. Without heroin; the addict suffers from a tense depression, which is relieved by a pharmacogenrc ela\u00ad tion that is characterized by tINO essential points: (1) it is brought about by the ego itsel f, at wi II, and thus gives the addict an omnipotent sense of control over 387-396 0 -82 - 6 QL 3 75 mood; and (2) it resembles and is pat\u00ad terned on an alimentary orgasm (Chessick 1960; Hoffman 1964).

See also an ANESTHETIC agent in surgical proced\u00ad ures in the late 1950s, but because of its adverse effects now used medically only for veterinary purposes. It is sold and userl on the street as a hallucinogen, often represented as THC, MESCALINE, or PSILOCYBIN. A white, crystalline, water\u00ad soluble powder, it is used orally, injected and sniffed, but most often smoked after being sprinkled on parsley, marijuana, or\u00b7 tobacco. The risk of adverse reactions to PCP is considered. to be great enough to outweigh any usefulness in the treatment of humans; side effects can include agita\u00ad tion, irritability, extreme excitement, visual disturbances and hallucinogens, it exerts a CNS depres\u00ad sant effect rather than a stimulant effect. In small doses effects can be very unpre\u00ad dictable, but it generally produces a state resembling drunkenness. When used regu\u00ad larly, memory, perception, concentration, and judgment are often disturbed. In large, chronic doses, it can cause anes\u00ad thesia, sensory disturbance, permanent brain and nervous system damage (Petersen and Stillman 1978). Classification: hqllu\u00ad cinogens.

Beecher (1956) determined from his studies and those of others that placebos were fairly consistently able to give significant relief from symptoms (e.g., severe postoperative wound pain. pain of angina pectoris, head\u00ad ache, cough, mood change, seasickness, anxiety, and the common cold) in roughly 35 percent of the respondents tested. Beecher has concluded from his extensive studies that placebos are more effective when the pain or stress symptoms of the subject are greater, and vice versa. Con\u00ad trast with nostrum. placental passage of drugs The fetus nearly always receives the drugs taken by its mother and transferred through the placenta. (In the first trimes\u00ad ter of pregnancy when the placenta has not yet become the primary site of maternal\u00ad fetal exchange. the fetus acquires nutri\u00ad tional factors and drugs from surrounding maternal fluids.) Therf,l are very few drugs that do not cross the placenta or enter the maternal fluids and can therefore be given to the mother without any pos\u00ad sibility of di rectly affecting the fetus. Fetal drug toxicity occurs when the fetus has an adverse reaction to a drug taken by its mother. The type and severity of adverse effects of a given drug on the fetus depend on a multitude of factors, including the size and frequency of dose, th~ route of administration, the stage of pregnancy, maternal health and nutritional status, genetic makeup of the mother and fetus, previous obstetrical history, and myriad environmental factors--including concomitant exposure to other drugs, smoking status, and perhaps even environ\u00ad mental pollutants (Finnegan 1979:17-19).

Nearly all heavy users of illicit drugs use more than one drug. The most common definition is the use of more than one drug at different times without necessarily a stror.g preference for any particular drug. It has also been operationally defined by NIOA for funding purposes as dependence on psychoactive drugs in which the primary drug dependence is not heroin, methadone, or alcohol (Kaufman 1977). Kaufman (1977) has observed that \"multiple drugs are used whenever a given drug is not available, a tolerance develops, tension and depression are not relieved, boredom with the drug's effects is experienced.\" Polydrug users often develop a \"high\" orientation and will take almost any drug or combination of drugs to experience the state of being \"high.\" N I DA undertook an extensive effort to develop a better knowledge base about polydrug use by funding the National Poly\u00ad drug Collaborative Project. Under this project, 15 pol ydrug use demonstration ----------------------------------- ~~-- -- ---projects were funded around the country between April 1973 and March 1975. These pilot projects treated over 2,000 patients who had abused a variety of psychoactive drugs, but who did not use a narcotic drug as a primary drug of abuse. The Federal Government initiated these pilot projects to uncover what was felt to be a hidden population of polydrug abusers by offering a service on a limited scale that 'Nas not readily available at the time. By idantifying and treating this group and carefully following their progress on discharge to various compor.;nts of the health and social services systems, it was hoped to learn the characteristics of this ill-defined population and appropriate treatment approaches. Findings from the National Polydrug Collaborative Project are published by NlDA in several volumes under what was fer-merly known as the Services Research Monograph Series and is now called the Treatment Research and Assessment Mone'graph Series.

Focal activities include service career and occupational alternatives, community restorations, self\u00ad understanding, therapy, and the like, designed to change attitudes and behaviors from a sense of powerlessness and nondi\u00ad rection to one of self-worth, (4) inter\u00ad vention programs: 'programs designearor hIgh-risk clients that provide groups and individual counseling and activities as alternatives to drug use, focusing on restructuring the client1s environment, social patterns, and mind set (Retka 1977:4). prevention, primary A concept in the mental health field that refers to actions that anticipate a disorder and foster optimal health. The concept encompasses those activities directed to specifically identified vulnerable high-risk groups within the community who have not been labeled as psychiatrically ill and for whom measures can be undertaken to avoid the onset of emotional disturbance and/or to enhance their leve' of positive mental health. Programs are primarily educational rather than clinical and are oriented towa rd i ncr~asing people's capac\u00ad ities for dealing with crises and taking steps to improve their own lives (Klein and Gol dstone 1977: 27; National Institute on Drug Abuse 1977).

Others prefet\" the term hallucinogens, arguing that upsyche\u00ad delic\" incorrectly combines two Greek roots (psyche--soul, and delos--visible: evident), is biologically unsound, and has acquired meanings beyond the drugs or their effects (Sehultes 1976). psychoactive substances The term preferred by many to refer to DRUGS that affect the central nervous system and alter mood, perception, or con\u00ad sciousness. It is preferred as a SUbstitute for UdrugU because of the value-laden con\u00ad notations and definitional confusions rounding drugs See hallucinogens. psycholeptics See sedativel hypnotics. psychological models In regard to drug abuse, explanatory models derived from general psychological theories. Although there are many schools of thought, those who espouse psycholog\u00ad ical models, particularly in regarc' to heroin addiction, generally hold that (1) those who become abusers are psychologically disturbed, (2) drug abusers do further harm to their psychological state, and (3) sufficient psychological and/or psychi\u00ad atric therapy and support can eventually enable them to abstain from drugs. Although this has been the most generally accepted model, the valiC:ity of each of these positions has been strongly criticized (Iiyama et a\\. 1976:20). The major criti\u00ad cism stems from research that indicates no common psychiatric diagnosis among drug abusers, among whom are found all kinds of people (William 1976:17). Se,e also psy\u00ad chosocial models; sociological models. psychomotor Relating to muscular activity or behavior associated with certain psychological func\u00ad tions. Psychomotor tests measu re such things as manual coordination, reaction time, and other behavior skills (LeDain et al. 1973). (psychomotor performance, RIS 27:372--67 entries) psychopathic personality A personality disorder which is not psy\u00ad chotic in nature, which is la<;:king in mani\u00ad fest anxiety, and which involves inadequate social adjustment (English and English 1958; Chaplin 1975). This term is now rarel y used, and tile psychiatric diagnosis of \"psychopathic personality disorder\" has been replaced with ANTISOCIAL PERSON\u00ad AL/ TY in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (1978). psychopathology Broadly, that content area within behav\u00ad ioral science that specifies, describes, or predicts disordered or deviant behavior and involves an application of the princi\u00ad ples of learning ( motivation, perception, biology, and genetics insofar as they con\u00ad tribute to behJvior in an effort to arrive at general explanatory laws to account for different kinds of behavior (Sutker 1977).

The term was first used in the 1940s and 195 Os, but it was not until the discovery of LSD in 1943 and the synthesis of CHLORPROMA\u00ad ZI NE that a systematic, scientific investi\u00ad gation of drugs that affect the mind became well organized. The science of psycho\u00ad pharmacology links the disciplines of psy\u00ad chiatry, psychology, pharmacology, neurophysiology. See also ethnopharma\u00ad cology. psychosis, amphetamine A IImodelll psychosis that closely resembles paranoid schizophrenia and has been seen 80 to result from long-term amphetamine use (Bell 1965). There is often difficulty in distinguishing amphetamine psychosis from schizophrenia, but it appears that visual hallucinations are more usual in ampheta\u00ad mine psychosis cases, while thought dis\u00ad order is more usual in schizophrenia cases. There is conflicting evidence i.l the relative importance of drug effect or underlying personality factors in precipitation, but many researchers believe that ampheta\u00ad mine psychosis is produced primarily in persons who already manifest a personal\u00ad ity disJrder or predilection for paranoid reaction (Ellinwood 1967). (psychosis, drug, RIS 27:374--61 entries) psychosis, cannabis Also known as hemp psychosis and hemp insanity.. The belief that cannabis can produce psychosis among users of the drug. Most of the reports of hemp psy\u00ad chosis come from Eastern lands, such as India, Egypt,\u00b7 Turkey, and Africa. How\u00ad eve r, the la rge numbe r of Eastern cases so diagnosed have been credited to the frequent lack of any distinction between drug-induced symptoms and independent schizophrenia, and the purposeful and inadvertent inclusion of cases for which no proper diagnosis has been made (Grin\u00ad spoon 1977:261). psychosis, cocaine A psychological reaction to prolonged cocaine use characterized by halludnations. The diagnosis of psychosis often emerges from the presence of tactile sens;:;tions. However, psychosis involves more. than hallucinations and usually implies dysfunc\u00ad tion in an individual's mental processe~, emotional responses, memory, communica\u00ad tion skills, sense of reality, and behavior. The presence of such a wide range of phe\u00ad nomena in cocaine intoxication is less clear than the presence of hallucinations; there-fore, the use of the term is questionable (Siegel 1977). psychosis, toxic Chronic or acute psychotic-like behavior or delirium resulting from impairment of brain function by drugs or poisons. Char\u00ad acteristic symptoms are an unpleasant and extreme confusion, disorientation, aggres\u00ad siveness, depression, or hallucinations (Weil 1972:50). psychosocial models In regard to drug abuse, explanatory models that define it as a problem associ\u00ad ated with both psychological and social factors either as antecedents or conse\u00ad quents. Psychosocial models view drug abuse primarily as a social problem with societal, psychological, and group deter\u00ad minants, a function of the user's total personality in reaction with the sociocul\u00ad tural environment as the user sees it, though not to the exclusion of biological or neurochemical factors.

An older and less preferred term for such drugs is \"psychotropics.\" (RIS 27:223--2 entries) psychotherapy A technique of treating mental disorders by means of insight, persuasion, sugges\u00ad tion, reassurance, and instruction so that the patients may see themselves and their problems more realistically and have the desire to cope with them. Stric;tly used, the term includes only techniques such as psychoanalysis or psychodrama that are utilized by specialists; more broadly, it is applied to any informal talk aimed at per\u00ad sonal adjustment (Zadrozny 1959; Chaplin 1975). (RIS 27:375--15 entries) psyc.hotogenic Producing HALLUCINATIONS and psychotic behavior (Chaplin 1975). psychotomimetic Characteristic of drugs that produce a state similar to or symptomatic of psychoses (Chaplin 1975).

Public Health Service hospitals Two Federal treatment facilities, originally called Narcotic Farms, established in Lex\u00ad ington, Kentucky, in 1935, and in Ft. Worth, Texas, in 1938, which carried the major responsibility for the treatment of opiate addiction in the United States for a quarter of a century. Operated in a man\u00ad ner similar to minimum security penal insti\u00ad tutions, the hospitals gave priority to the admission of Federal prisoners and proba\u00ad tioners who were addicts sent for with\u00ad drawal and detoxification; voluntary patients were admitted when and if space was available. In 1945, the hospitals also began providing vocational, counseling, and psychiatric services. Withdrawal treat\u00ad ment was based on the extent of addiction and, at first, routinely consisted of sub\u00ad cutaneous injections of decreasing amounts of morphine over a period of 4 to 10 days. Subsequently, methadone was substituted for morphine, first through subcutaneous and later through oral administration. 81 The hospitals were also alAthorized to inves\u00ad tigate the cause, treatment, and preven\u00ad tion of drug addiction. Until the late 1960s, individuals desiring medical detoxi\u00ad fication and withdrawal who could not afford private sanitariums had only these hospitals to which to turn. Soon after the hospitals opened, volunta ry patients accounted for 75 percent of admissions, and a total of over 100,000 admissions were made to the hospitals during their years of operation. Although the programs have been criticized for their limited success and their prisonlike conditions, these hospitals did serve the goal of introducing the con\u00ad cept of treatment as a general goal and even as an officially stated Government responsibility and provided an atmosphere in which the addict was considered a patient rather than a lawbreaker at a time when addiction was heavily stigmatized (Cuskeyet al. 1973: 200; Brown 1973:129- 130).

The sites consist of large mole\u00ad cules on the surface of cells in functional, or target, tissues. Receptors serve the two prima ry functions of (1) somehow rec\u00ad ognizing a substance, distinguishing it from others, and (2) transmitting the sig\u00ad nal indicating the presence of the sub\u00ad stance, which brings about pharmacological action in the target tissue. Early research on receptors centered around the hormone estrogen. With dis\u00ad covery of the estrogen receptors, research has expanded to find receptor sites for nearly all of the bodily hormones. In 1971 Avram Goldstein (1976a) and his staff dis\u00ad covered specific opiate receptors in the brains of rats. Human opiate receptor sites in the brain, spinal cord, and intes\u00ad tines have since been identified. The discovery of opiate receptors led researchers to suspect that their affinity for exogenous opiate ALKALOIDS was only coincidental and that the receptors exist because the body produces its own endog- enous opiatelike substances. In 1975 researchers reported the discovery of the two endogenous OPIOID peptides, or ENDORPHINS, labeled methionine-enkephalin and leucine-enkephalin (Hughes and Kos\u00ad terlitz 1977). The discovery of other endorphins has followed, but still very little is known about where and how the endorphins are produced and what their exact role is in modulating mood and pain. recreational drug use See social-recreational drug use. regimen A schedule of treatment procedures designed to address ailment and to achieve a therapeutic resu It. regulation As opposed to PROHIBITION, generally refers to a situation in which use of a drug is permitted but regulated by orderly controls over such factors as potency, price, and the conditions of sale and licensing. rehabilitation The restoration of a person to the best possible level of functioning after suffering a behavioral disorder (Wolman 1973).

RighteoLs dope fiends prefer heroin above all other drugs and consider themselves members of the elite world of opiate users. risks, drug related The risks related to drug taking are affected by a wide variety of pharmacolog\u00ad ical, psychological, and sociocultural vari\u00ad ables. Subsumed within the concept of drug-related risk were two basic compo\u00ad nents: (1) risk to health; and (2) risk of drug-induced behavior. Implicit in the concept of risk and embraced in these risk types are risk to the individual health, welfare, and safety, and risk to society in terms of the public health, wealth, and safety. Risk to the individual and public health is posed by such drug-taking con\u00ad sequences as acute \\'eactions in the form of overdose and psychological trauma, or from diseases that may be directly or indirectly related to drug use and physical or psychological problems of short or long duration. Public safety risks of drug use arise primarily from the behavior induced by the drug experience, such as crime or alterations of perception, judgment, or other mental functions, which may result in disordered or hazardous behavior such as loss of impulse control, which may lead to assaultive, aggressive, or violent acts, or impaired psychomotor function, which may result in hazardous activities such a~ inadequate operation of a motor vehicle (National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse 1973:94). (RIS 27:376--12 entries) ritual Usually refers to tne most directly observ\u00ad able, manifest, and salient part of a reli\u00ad gious observance;. more generally, any highly predictable sequence of behavior. Within the drug field, ritual can refer to a frequent pattern of marijuana smoking in which the users sit in a circle and pass a single cigarette from person to person (Encyclopedia of Sociology 1981; Agar 1977). Many heroin users are said to be addicted to the ritual of hypodermic injections and will not take a heroin substitute that does not involve injection. Peele (1978) theo\u00ad rizes that ritual is actually a part of the object of addiction. roach Slang. Marijuana ciga rette butt. Robinson v.

These experiments are usually conducted over the course of sev\u00ad eral weeks, and the subject is sequentially exposed to different experimental condi- tions. These experimental procedures involving controlled laboratory environ\u00ad ments were originally developed over 40 years ago in the analysis of ethanol self\u00ad administration, and they have subsequently been extended to the analysis of other drugs of abuse (Griffiths et al. 1978; Babor et al. 1976). self-help groups Self-help groups have been formed around many different problem areas in which behavior control is the primary reward for participation. Perhaps the most well\u00ad known self-help group is associated with alcoholism (Alcoholics Anonymous), but scores of groups exist across the country to deal with such varied problems as drug abuse, ciga rette smoking, weight control, divorce, neurotic personality, compulsive gambling, ex-prisoner societal reentry, family crisis, terminal illness, and the like. Although the problem areas may differ, self-heip groups have many factors in com\u00ad mon. Katz and Bender (1976:266) cite the following general characteristics: 84 \"Self-help groups are voluntary, small group structures for mutual aid and the accomplishment of a special purpose. They are usually formed by peers who have come together for mutual assistance in satisfying a common need, overcoming a common han\u00ad dicap or life-disrupting problem, and bringing about desired social and/or per\u00ad sonal change. The initiators and members of such groups perceive that their needs are not, or cannot be, met by or through existing social institutions. Self-help groups emphasize face-to-face social inter\u00ad actions and the assumption of personal responsibility by members. They often provide material assistance, as well as emo\u00ad tional support; they are frequently Icausel- oriented, and promulgate an ideology or value through which members may attain an enhanced sense of personal identity.\" semantic representations, analysis of Study of the verbal processes associated with certain groupings of words. Vocabu\u00ad la ry tests, semantic differential scales (5- or 7-point bipolar scales such as hot/cold, good/bad, pleasant/unpleasant), and other techniques of verbal analysis arc-employed to determine the subjects' attitudes toward and depth of knowledge of the group of words being studied. This information is then often correlated with data obtained on subject behaviors. Analyses of semantic representations of drug abuse terms have been made by sev\u00ad eral researchers (Baron and Galizio 1978; Haertzen et al. 1970, 1974; Newmeyer 1976). There is significant evidence that the degree of illicit drug use, the extent of familiarity with drug terms, and one1s attitudinal persuasions about illicit drug use are positively correlated. The nature of this relationship is highly complex, as is noted by Baron and Galizio (1978): liThe precise ways in which semantic rep\u00ad resentations and other verbal pattems con\u00ad tribute to more overt actions, such as the complex behaviors surrounding use of drugs, remain an enigma. One hypothesis is that language controls other behaviors through its discriminative and classifying functions. From this standpoint, the labels assigned to drugs allow the individual to respond differentially to subtle environmen\u00ad tal and p@rticularly intrapsychic changes. Conversely, labels may lead the individual to respond in common ways to events that differ widely in their stimulus properties. In any event, knowledge of the language of drugs allows the user to communicate with others who supply and use drugs, and on this basis alone must be regarded as an essential part of the entire pattern of drug-using behaviors,1I sensation seeking The process in which the individual actively seeks out stimulation from the environment. Zuckerman's (1964, 1972) Sensation-Seeking Scale measures five factors: general sensa\u00ad tion seeking, thrill and adventure seeking, experience seeking, DISINHIBITION, and boredom susceptibility. According to Zuckerman (1972), drug usage is an aspect of general sensation seeking rather than any specific type; Kohn and Annis (1977) argue that drug use is specifically associ\u00ad ated with a high optimum level for fanta\u00ad sies and unusual perceptual feelings. (RIS 27:3.81--13 entries) sensitization The reverse effect of drug TOLERANCE. The effect of increased responsiveness to a drug with repeated use.

Also referred to as (REVERSE) TOL\u00ad ERANCE. seq'lential treatment method A pharmacologically oriented treatment approach proposed by Goldstein (1976b) in which clients go through a sequence of different treatments. The heroin addict is first maintained on methadone on a daily basis, then switched to LAAM on a three\u00ad times-a-week basis, detoxified and then placed on a pure antagonist such as nal\u00ad trexone, and eventually becomes drug free. Clients can be repeatedly recycled through the sequence until they elevate to the i':lVel of becoming drug free.

Sinsemilla is the potent leaves) of the unpolli\u00ad nated and seedless female marijuana plant. Keeping the female plants unpollinated creates increasing quantities of a sticky substance containing a high concentration of THC (the psychoactive ingrediE:.lilt in marijuana) in thei r flowering tops in a vain attempt to trap pollen from the male plant and become fertilized. If the female plant becomes fertilized, it devotes a la rge por\u00ad tion of its chemical energies to makinr~ seeds and in the process lowers its THe content. The growth of sinsemilla requi res the identification and weeding out of the male plants before they begin pollination and the harvesting of the female plants at the peak of their pollen-luring secretions, both of which are difficult to determine. This process for cultivating marijuana has been used in Asia for centuries and is, for example, used to grow the marijuana contained in THAI STICKS. Its use in the West was popularized after the drug experiences of American soldiers in Vietnam in the 1960s. THC concentrations in sinsemilla can reach 6 percent or more, while ordinary street marijuana sometimes contains less than 1 percent. To increase the potency, growers in ,California and elsewhere are reportedly using the Cannabis indica species of mari\u00ad juana, which contains more THC than its botanical sibling Cannabis sativa.

Unlike experimental use, social and recreational use tends to be more patterned but considerably more varied in terms of frequency, intensity, and duration.

(socioeco nomic factors, RIS 27:385--52 entries) sociogenic drug use An expression coined by Erich Goode for drug use. particularly marijuana use, that from inception is simultaneous with partici\u00ad pation in a specific social group.

Most sociolog\u00ad ical models of d rug abuse rest on the assumption that people are drug abusers because of their inability to reach societal goals. Moreover, drug addiction is seen as a problem that is socially defined and perceived differently by different societal groups. Many of these models further stress that social problems such as drug use, crime, and prostitution meet certain societal needs and will remain in existence as long as those needs remain. These problems will be eliminated only when the basic societal arrangements that perpetuate them are changed (Jacobs 1976:114-115). The main criticism of sociological models is their failure to explain why only some people with a given sociological background become drug users and not others. See also psychological models; psychosocial models. sociopathic personality A personality disorder used to describe chronically antisocial persons who seem unable or unwilling to live within estab\u00ad lished social and moral frameworks and who tend to pursue self-determined goals regard less of the. consequences to self or others. This particular label takes into account the fact that sociocultural norms may be flaunted by individuals so labeled. The term has been used interchangeably with PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY, and both labels have been replaced by ANT 1- SOCIAL PERSONALITY in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (1978). It has been thought by some researchers that the nature of the psycho\u00ad pathic/sociopathic personality makes the likelihood of significant improvement in therapy or treatment of any kind minimal. However, Vaillant (1975) states that the \"realll sociopath is treatable and is dis\u00ad tinguished from the psychopath by an apparent absence of anxiety, supposed lack of motivation for change, and inability to experience depression (Blaine and julius 1977:5).

Typical household solvents include glue (plastic cement), gasoline, paint thinner, nail polish, nail polish remover, lighter and cleaning fluids. The active ingredi\u00ad ents used in these solvent products include acetone, the chlorated hydroca rbons such as carbon tetrachloride, and the petroleum hydrocarbons (toluene, benzene, naphtha, and gasoline). Solvents are CNS depres\u00ad sants and lower heart and breathing rate and impair judgment and muscle coordina\u00ad tion. Like most inhalants, solvents such as glue, the most commonly used I gener\u00ad ally produce a brief period of stimulation with giddiness, euphoria, and muscle trem\u00ad ors, followed by a more lengthy, dreamlike stupor. Effects tend to be short-lived and mild. The petroleum-based solvents such as paint thinner (toluene), lighter fluid (naphtha), and gasoline, generally produce the most extreme effects.

The SWSC is a cost-sharing contract negotiated with Single State Agen\u00ad cies through which local drug treatment programs are subcontracted. This mecha\u00ad nism allows for drug abuse treatment serv\u00ad ices to be delivered within a State under the authority of the agency responsible for statewide planning. 88 Financial assistance is also provided to the States via formula grants (authorized under section 409 of Public Law 92-255) to plan, establish, and evaluate drug abuse treatment and prevention programs. For\u00ad mula grants help the SSAs coordinate drug abuse programs in their respective States. The formula by which funds are allocated reflects relative population and financial and programmatic need. State plan updates are prepared by the SSAs and reviewed annually. N IDA has transferred most of the respon\u00ad sibility for supervising federally supported treatment programs to the States. The SWSC is the principal funding mechanism N I DA has used to transfer these respon\u00ad sibilities.

Often used in the past to relate the use of marijuana to later use of heroin. Although there is no defin\u00ad itive evidence that use of marijuana neces\u00ad sarily leads to the use of heroin or any other drugs, there is evidence tl1at an initial interest in drugs may lead to an expanslon of the one-time usersl drug. interests and possibly to a commitment to a way of life that revolves around or is focused on drugs (Grinspoon 1977:251; O'Donnell and Clayton 1981).

DIMETHOXYMETHAM~HETAMINE street addicts Persons belonging to a well-developed street subculture who see themselves as addicts and organize their behavior around that self-image (Stephens and McBride 1976). A particular type of addict--Iower' class, slum-dwelling, usually a member of a mi nority group, who adheres to a deviant set of values, and whose chief attributes are the \"cool cat\" stance, conning, and ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR (Stephens and Levine 1971:351). The phrase \"on the street\" implies an idle or homeless person in an urban area who might very well be \"down one's street\"--that is, doing some\u00ad thing suited to one's taste (Siegel 1978). A distinction is often made between the \"physician addict\" or upper class addict and the street level or \"street addict\" by asserting that street addicts belong to a \"subculture\" that is insulated from the general culture by a set of unique \"values\" and the need to support the habit, whereas physicians or upper class addicts still belong to the larger culture b~cause they can afford to support their habits by legal means. Thus it is common for scholars to lump the street or \"subcultural addict\" and the criminal addict together. Doing so, however, fails to discriminate between different social patter-ns of drug involve\u00ad ment on the street scene. See righteous dope fiend; career, addiction; subculture, drug.

Subcul\u00ad tural theorists studying the onset of ado\u00ad lescent drug use stress the importance of interpersonal influences and participation in an adolescent subculture that has a dis\u00ad tinctive set of values ()nd conduct norms that are at odds with the more conventional values of the adult or parent culture (Johnson 1973; Good'e 1972). Subcultural ______________________________________________________________________________ ~i .. ' ____ --------------.------------------------------------------------------ theorists focus on the shared norms, values, role definitions, and patterns of behavior governing consumption of illicit drugs and thus provide a bridge between sociological and psychological theories. The drug subculture is seen as providing a person with an alternative lifestyle cen\u00ad tering around I<nowledge of how to obtain and use drugs and how to evaluate the experience. In addition, it provides a set of values and norms and gives respect and admiration to those who adhere to these behavioral prescriptions (Preble and Casey 1969: 21; Stephens and Levine subcutaneous Beneath the skin.

The term SSD syndrome was coined by Bass (1970) to describe over 100 deaths during the sixties he had researched and found to be related to aerosol sniffing. The SSD syndrome is caused when the fluorocarbons (particularly tr ichlorofluoromethane) sensitize the heart to the adrenal hormone epinephrine, which is in itself a strong cardiac stimulant. By potentiating the effect of epinephrine on the heart, wildly erratic heartbeat and increased pulse occur, resulting in the case of the SSD syndrome in heart failure and death. The use of fluorocarbons as propellants in household aerosol products has been banned by the U. S. Envi ronmen\u00ad tal Protection Agency since March 16, 1978. suicide The act of intentionally taking one's own life. The person who kills himself or her-90 self (Fairchild 1976). (RIS 27:388--35 entries) supply reduction strategy Federal drug abuse policy goals are g~ared toward reducing both the demand and the supply of illicit drugs. The supply reduc\u00ad tion strategy outlines the Government's plan for reducing the production, importa\u00ad tion, and flow of illicit drugs in the coun\u00ad try. The domestic component of the supply reduction strategy consists of law enforce\u00ad ment involving the investigation, prosecu\u00ad tion, and seizure of assets of drug traffickers. International .::;ctivities include border interdiction efforts and, through diplomacy and cooperation with foreign governments and international organizations, encouragement of crop eradication programs with income substitution and rural develop\u00ad ment programs, support of international law enforcement prog rams, support of international narcotics control programs by other governments, and support for international prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs.

Synanon A THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY for the reha\u00ad bilitation of drug addicts established in 1959 in California. As originally estab\u00ad lished, the members of Synanon stayed as long as they liked and were discouraged from leaving until they were judged capable of remaining off drugs, although no \"cures\" were claimed.

II It is applied when the subject is awake and responsive and utilizes a liberal amount of verbal reassur\u00ad ance that what the subject is experiencing is transitory and will end once the drug has run its course. Green and Levy (1976) give the following description of the proc\u00ad ess: \"This method is the treatment of choice provided the youth is not overly aggres\u00ad sive, psychotic, convulsive, or showing respiratory depression. The goal is to counteract the anxiety, panic, paranoia, depression and confusion of the bum trip. The manner of the parent should be quiet, relaxed and sympathetic. The youth must be made to feel welcome and to sense that he is wanted. What is needed is rest, reassurance, sympathy and support. \"The youth must be reassured that his mental condition at the moment is due to the drug and will return to norma!. The distortions and frightening experiences are related only to the drug itself and do not indicate an emotional illness. The youth may need help in verbalizing his experience. The parent can assist in this by reviewing for the youth what is going on in the trip, outlining the probable time schedule of events, and emphasizing the self-limiting aspects. \"Simple and concrete statements should be reiterated; who is there, where he is, what is happening, identification of familiar objects such as books, lamps, table, etc. This assists in the process of self\u00ad identification and permits reality to be reassembled .11 TASC Treatment Alternatives to Street Crimes, a federally funded pilot treatment program through which. if local law enforcement authorities approve. a drug-dependent person who has been arrested may enter treatment as a condition of release. When the case comes up for trial, the court may take into account the user's cooperation and success in the treatment program and may determine that he or she should remain in the program as an alternative to prose\u00ad cution or possible incarceration subsequent to prosecution. The TASC treatment units are linked to community programs and use va rious treatment approaches (B rown 1973: 133).

A teetotaler is one practicing or pledged to total abstinence from alcoholic beverages. The first syllable IItee-1I is a reduplication for emphasis of the initial sound in the word IItotal.1I The term first appeared in 1834 in a letter to the Preston Temperance Advocate (Britain) signed \"A Lover of Sociality, and a 'Tee-Total' Abstainer\" (Oxford English Dictionary 1971). temperance The practice of moderation; often used in reference to food and drink, particularly alcoholic beverages. The Temperance Movement was a popular movement to restrict or prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages that became widespread in Northern Europe and North America begin\u00ad ning in 1800 and culminated in the passage of the Prohibition Amendment in the United States in 1919, and in prohibition, partial prohibition, or lesser restrictions in the Scandinavian countries around World War I. Temperance should not be equated with PROHIBITION. While many of the various 19th-century temperance advocates became prohibitionists, calling for total abstention from all alcoholic beverages, many only called for moderation in use, or moderation in the use of beer and wine and abstention from spirits (Austin 1978). teratogenic drugs Drugs that can cause birth defects. tetanus An acute infectious disease that results in II lockjaw ,II generalized muscle spasm, arch\u00ad ing of the back, and seizures.

The headquarters of the Therapeutk Commu\u00ad nities of America are located at 118-21 Queens Blvd., Forest Hills, N. Y. 11375; (212) 520-5205. therapeutic community A generic term describing a wide spectrum of residential treatment approaches and clients, all of which embrace the fundamen\u00ad tal need for individual change through a communal living milieu in order to render stable changes in lifelong self-destructive and socially destructive behavior. The TC concept was fi rst pioneered by Dr. Maxwell Jones and others in Britain in 1947 as a program for social deviants and again, inde.,. pendently, by Chuck Dederick at SYNANON in California in 1958 using drug addicts. In the United States the term has become largely associated with the treatment of drug addiction, but the basic concept can be, and has been, applied to various types of deviant or maladjusted behavior. All T Cs, however I as noted by Dr. Jones (1979: 147) , have basic simi la rities: II All subscribe to the power of the client pe~,-group; all started as residential com\u00ad munities, although later developments include day centers, clubs, etc.; all claim to espouse a democratic social organization and democratic ideals although in practice this is often open to question; all avoid the extreme professionalism of the kind seen in departments of psychiatry in medi\u00ad cal schools and some, like Synanon, repud\u00ad iate professionals altogether. II Generally, drug abuse TCs are operated as long-term, live-in, 24-hour-a-day resi\u00ad dential abstinence treatment experiences, in which individuals help cure each other through group therapy, mutual reinforce-93 ment, companionship, and social pressure. The interactions between members, and betweetl individuals and the group, are utilized to reinforce and strengthen con\u00ad tinued abstinence. Two types of GROU P THERAPY are usually employed. The first is confrontation or ENCOUNTER GROUP therapy, in which community members meet in regular and frequent sessions in order to analyze each other's past drug-taking behavior and conduct in the program. MILIEU THERAPY is aimed at further strengthening internalization of community values. Two of the major modern thera\u00ad peutic communities are SYNANON (est. 1959) and DA YTOP VI LLAGE (est. 1963). While the traditional abstinence community requires persons to stay for an extended period, usually 1 ,to 2 yea rs, short-term communities have also been established. In MULTIMODALITY TREATMENT commu\u00ad nities (such as TINLEY PARK), methadone maintenance and abstinent patients have been combined in the same setting (Deitch 1973; DeLeon and Beschner 1977:7-9).

This model, which was given ap~roval by ROBI NSON v.

Classification: hallucinogens. tobacco 94 Dried leaves of the plant Nicotiana tabacum, which are most often inhaled but have been chewed. The three main constituents of tobacco smoke are NICOTINE, carbon mon\u00ad oxide, and tar. Nicotine, the main active ingredient, makes up about 1.5 percent of the average cigarette. Long-term use has been shown to have numerous adverse effects, principally on the bronchopulmo\u00ad nary and cardiovascular systems. Smoking is now believed to be the main cause of lung cancer, is associated with cancers of the mouth and respiratory tract, and facili\u00ad tates respiratory infections. Smokers are also much more likely than nonsmokers to develop coronary heart disease, cerebro\u00ad vascular disorders, and peripheral vascular disease. Overwhelming evidence indicates that tobacco smoking is a major health hazard. Pipe and cigar smoking in which tobacco is not regularly inhaled, are less hazardous. Tobacco smoking is almost a worldwide phenomenon. Generally, no country\u00b7s inhabitants, once introduced to tobacco, have given it up, nor have other smoking substances been successfully sub\u00ad stituted. See substance abuse. (RIS 27: 223--14 entries) tolerance A decrease in response to a d rug dose that occurs with continued use. It can be caused by both physiological and psy\u00ad chosocial factors. Tolerance has been shown to be both relative and highly sub\u00ad ject to change, and it is now believed that heroin users can lose their tolerance in several days (Lettieri and Backenheimer 1974). Thus many addicts enter treatment programs specifically for the purpose of bringing down their tolerance to manage- able levels. See also cross-tolerance; tolerance, reverse. Dews (1978) points out that tolerance may develop under a variety of circumstances other than drug US(;l, including exposure to heat, cold, electric shock, hunger, and the like. He delineates three types of pharma\u00ad cological tolerance: dispositional, physio\u00ad logical, and behavioral. According to Dews, in the case of disposi\u00ad tional tolerance, as a result of exposure to a drug, the physicochemical processes handling the drug in the body are so modi\u00ad fied that reduced concentra;tions of the drug reach the receptive cells, as in the case of an increased rate of metabolism of the drug following repeated administration, as by the induction of higher activity of metabolizing enzymes. Dews defines physiological tolerance as a change in the receptor cells, or related cells, such that the effects of a dose \u00b7of the drug are reduced, even though the receptor cells are subjected to the same concentration of the drug. Behavioral tolerance is defined as a change in the effect of a drug due to alteration of environmental constraints. Behavioral tolerance results from behavioral mecha\u00ad nisms in the user's environment. (RIS 27: 390--17 entries) tolerance, evanescent Tolerance toward drugs that lasts for only a short 'time (a few hours).

However, tran\u00ad quilizers haVE: been shown to have undesir\u00ad able side effects also, to be habituating, and to be widely misused. Tranquilizers are particularly dangerous as they poten\u00ad tiate (see POTENTIATION) the effects of other depressants such as the opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol, and a safe dose of either when taken together can cause coma and even death. Unlike SEDATIVE/ 95 HYPNOTICS, such as barbiturates, they do not generally cause hypnosb., drowsi\u00ad ness, or loss of alertness, although there are many exceptions, especially when taken in amounts larger than necessary. Tran\u00ad quilizers are usually classified according to thei r therapeutic use into two categories: (1) (ANTIANXIETY) TRANQUILIZERS or \"agents\" (formerly (ANTIPSYCHOTIC) such as RESERPINE (Serpasil) and CHLORPROMA- Z I NE (Thorazine). Much confusion is caused by the nonspecific use of the gen\u00ad eral label \"tranquilizers,\" particularly as the antianxiety and antipsychotic tranquil\u00ad izers are quite dissimilar chemically and pharmacologically in respect to their uses and effects. The antianxiety tranquilizers are classified as SEDATIVE/HYPNOTICS; the TRANQUILIZERS prescribed as seda\u00ad tives to reduce ANXIETY and tension, sometimes called minor tranquilizers, as distinct from the major or (ANTI PSY\u00ad CHOTIC) TRANQUILIZERS. They are widely prescribed as sedatives that have relatively few other significant effects on emotional, cognitive, or perceptual' proc\u00ad esses, although there is much disagreement surrounding the extent to which they achieve this goal. Unlike the antipsychotic tranquilizers, which do not produce euphoria or other pleasant effects and are rarely used nonmedically, the antianxiety tranquilizers produce effects subjectively similar to alcohol and barbitur'ates and are often used nonmedically. I n much of the scientific literature, the term is restricted to use of the benzodiazepine derivatives chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (Librium) and diazepam (Valium), pro\u00ad panediol derivative meprobamate (Equanil and Miltown). Sometimes the term is used in a broader sense to refer to other of the new nonbarbiturate sedatives such as seda\u00ad tive/hypnotics. tranquilizers, antipsychotic A major classification of drugs commonly used to treat psychiatric problems falling under the rubric of psychosis. Consists of four classes of drugs: (1) phenothia\u00ad zines, such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine); pine such haloperidol (Haldol); thioxan\u00ad thines, such as Navane. Rarely used non\u00ad medically, they lack euphoric properties and generally produce unpleasant side effects. Preferred to BARBITURATES as calming agents because in moderate doses they calm without inducing sleep, they do not cause physical dependence, and even in large doses they do not induce coma or anesthesia. Also called major tranquilizers, antip~ychotic agents, or NEUROLEPTICS. tranylcypromine sulfate An MAO INHIBITOR used in the treatment of severe mental depression. Manufactured as Parnate.

In practice, treat\u00ad ment programs can and do offer virtually any combination of these methods, at times mixing together seemingly opposing ele\u00ad ments (National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse 1973: 315) See also treatment outcome.

See also detoxification. treatment modalities Treatment methods, techniques. Drug treatment modalities include therapeutic communities, residential centers, outpatient drug-free treatment clinics, detoxification clinics, and methadone maintenance clinics. Modalities also refers to the processes used in treatment, such as group therapy, indi\u00ad vidual counseling, family therapy, and psychopharmacological agents (Blaine and Julius 1977:12). See also multimodality treatment; community-based treatment; maintenance treatment. (treatment models, RIS :7:392--18 entries) treatment outcome Refers to the success of a given treatment program in achieving its goals, usually defined in terms of continued abstinence from the use of the drug for which the client is being treated, but also such fac\u00ad tors as increased employment and decreased crimi nal ity. In 1973 Cuskey et al. empha\u00ad sized the need for more thorough evaluation of all treatment modalities, observing that for the most part the standards and goals of treatment programs have not been well defined, well evaluated, or well measured. All claim success but define success dif\u00ad ferently, and often programs ignore attri\u00ad tion and relapse rates, attract or admit only certain kinds of personalities and eliminate those prone to failure (Cuskey et al. 1973:202-4). O'Donnell (1965) describes the problem of comparing out\u00ad comes of treatment of opiate-dependent individuals. Differences in criteria of improvement, length of followup, and nature of the population studied are often so great that comparisons may be invalid. He also points out that failure may be registered by events other than drug use and that many addicts who return to drug use at one point in time again may become abstinent yet remain registered as relapsed.

Ts and Bs is experiencing increasing use nationally among heroin addicts because it costs less than Jne\u00ad quarter the price of heroin and, unlike sLreet heroin, its potency can be deter\u00ad mined and controlled. There are major health risks associated with the use of Ts and Bs, including damage to the small blood vessels of the lungs, eyes, and brain; seizures and convulsions, and fatal\u00ad ity due to overdose.

Classification: sedative/hypnotics. typology A classification scheme containing two or more categories (types) based on charac\u00ad teristics of the things being classified that are considered by the classifier to be of importance. The criteria most often used in evaluating typologies are \"exhaustive\u00ad nessll--the extent to which all items being classified can be placed in 1'1e scheme-\u00ad and \"mutual exclusiveness\" -toe absence of overlapping between the categories. Typologies can describe indl.dduals, groups, or whole societies (Encyclopedia of Sociology 1981). (RIS 27:394--35 entries) 97 unconventional drug use Dr~g use sc n as outside the accepted social bounds of d rug-using patterns. This term was proposed by Josephson (1974:xvi) as a substitute for DRUG ABUSE. Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) Periodical statistical bulletins issued annu\u00ad ally by the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 1932 that contain data on various categories of law-breaking and law enforce\u00ad ment compiled from reports sent in regu\u00ad larl,y and ac~ording to a uniform plan by police agencies throughout the Nation. Critics argue that the statistics fail as adequate measures of the magnitude and trends of crime, that a vast amount of crime remains hidden, that much crime that is detected is not reported, and that much that is reported is not recorded (Inciardi and Chambers 1972). Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act An act drafted and promulgated in 1932 by the National Conference of Commission\u00ad ers on Uniform State Laws, a private semi\u00ad official body that proposes a wide variety of uniform laws for enactment by States. Enacted by mo'.;t of the States between 1933 and 1937, the act sought to eliminate the amalgam of conflicting State narcotic laws and thE'J weaknesses of State enforce\u00ad ment proc..:dures,. In this act marijuana wa s with opiates and' cocaine as a narcotic drug\" At the time the act was being drafted, the Federal Bureau of Nar\u00ad cotics was under pressure to regulate marijuana consumption, but the agency itself was not eager to take on this task and suggested that an optional clause criminalizing marijuana should be included in the Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act. I t was also proposed to define all the drugs as \"habit formingll and to rename the act the Uniform Habit-Forming Drug Act, but this proposal was defeated because of uncertainty over what defined a habit-forming drug. As a result mari\u00ad juana came to be classified as a n;rcotic in subsequent State legislation (Bonnie and Whitebread 1974).

I n the drug abuse field, however, urinalysis has cQme tQ be used synony\u00ad mously with testing for the presence of illicitly used drugs. See also urine testing for drugs. urine temperature See certified urine. urine testing for drugs The first major use of urine testing to screen for the illicit use of drugs was by Drs. Dole and Nyswander as part of their methadone maintenance treatment regimen. At present over 20 million of these tests are routinely performed annually as part of drug abuse treatment and military, busi\u00ad ness, and penal drug screening programs. If an individual uses a drug illicitly, traces of it or its metabolite will show up in the urine. Catlin (1973:2) describes this process as follows: IIWhatever the route of entry into the body, the drug is carried by the blood stream to the brain, liver, kidneys, and other organs. Once the drug is in the body, two processes begi n: metabol ism and excretion. Metaboli sm refers to the changes in the chemical form of the drug. For example, as soon as heroin enters the body it is metabolized into morphine, and in turn morphine is metabolized into mor\u00ad phine glucuronide. In fact, although her\u00ad oin is the drug taken by the addict, little or no heroin is found in the urine. What is found are the principal metabolites of heroin-morphine and morphine-glucuronide. Therefore, to detect heroin use, the tests are designed to detect either morphine, morphine-glucuronide, or both. Similarly, little or no cocaine is found in the urine; the tests are designed to detect a cocaine metabolite. In the case of barbiturates 98 and amphetamine, both the drugs and their metabolites are found \u00b7in the urine.1I Other body fluids such as blood, sweat, and saliva, body tissue, and even the SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (e.g., the Narcan test) can be used to screen for the presence of drugs. Urine testing has become the preferred procedure by many programs because specimens can be easily obtained with minimal facilities and by an unskilled technician, the process is pain\u00ad less, it can provide highly reliable results, and it is relatively inexpensive. Of the many different drug urine tests in use today, two characteristics are basic to ail of them--their sensitivity and their specificity in detecting various drugs. The sensitivity of a test is determined by the smallest concentration of a drug or metabol ites that can be detected and is expressed in micrograms per milliliter of undiluted urine. The specificity of a test refers to the degree to which it can dis\u00ad criminate between closely related drugs, metabolites, or naturally occurring sub\u00ad stances (Catlin 1973). New techniques are still being developed, but the most widely used urine tests for drugs currently in use are (Catlin 1973; technique T) Radioimmunoassay (RIA) Hemagglutination Inhibition (H I) Mass spectrometry Drug screening kits FPN Un iversal Test See certified urine; dirty urine; false posi\u00ad tive; false negative. U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) Legally recognized book of standards for drugs published by the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. It contains standards for strength and purity and formulas for making nearly all drugs cur\u00ad rently in use. The USP, first published in 1820, is revised every 5 years.

Also called \"consensual crimes. n Examples include homosexuality, prostitution, gam\u00ad bling, Clnd drug use (Schu r 1965). Brecher (1972: 45) prefers the expression IIcrimes without complaints. II As the prin\u00ad cipals in these acts have voluntarily, often eagerly, exchanged prohibited goods and services, few complaints to law enforce\u00ad ment authorities come forward. The attempt to prohibit such crimes has thus been criticized as an impossible goal and one inevitably leading to law enforcement corruption and illegal behavior stemming from the police's zeal to enforce the unen\u00ad forceable and because of the unlimited opportunities for enrichment that these crimes present (Blumberg 1973:109). Vietnam veterans Drug use fopiates and cannabis) among American soldiers stationed in Vietnam took place on a fairly wide scale according to published reports. Lee Robins in her extensive studies of drug use patterns among Vietnam veterans found that, in a sample of 898 veterans, 386 had used opi\u00ad ates while stationed in Vietnam (Robins and Helzer 1975; Robins et al. 1974). One by-product on the American drug scene of thousands of Vietnam veterans has been the introduction of drug pr'actices used in the Orient, such as the 51 NSE- Ml LLA method of cultivating marijuana and the use of the more potent Cannabis indica variety of marijUana. Another by-product has been the serious rethinking of the L ________________________ _ 99 lIintractable\" nature of opiate addiction. Of the 386 opiate users in the Robins study, for example, 189 were addicted users while in Vietnam, but only 5 percent continued their addiction after returning to the United States. The others simply stopped using drugs or shifted their drug use patterns to other drugs such as alco\u00ad hoi, amphetamines, or barbiturates. Con\u00ad tinued drug use has been found to be associated with a high incidence of difficul\u00ad ties reintegrating into civilian life. These findings have been verified by others such as Nance et al. (1980) and Mintz et al. (1979).

Some of these drugs have been called deliriants although delirium is only one of many potential effects and is clearly not restricted to thesB substances. Many are quite similar in effect to the sedative group; some have certain psyche\u00ad delic or hallucinogenic effects. Most of these substances are not used medically, although several have been employed as surgical anesthetics: (inhalants, RIS 27: 210--5 entries) volunta ry treatment See treatment, voluntary. wild lettuce Wild lettuce, also known as lettuce opium (Lactuca virosa), and even crisp lettuce (Sativa capita) found at the supermarket, contains small amounts of the chemical lac\u00ad tucarium, a mild sedative/hypnotic.

Also refers to the fermented juice of any other fruit, or of other plants and fermentable substances, except those fermented from grains, which are called beers. Classification: sedative/hypnotics. withdrawal syndrome (or symptoms) A cluster of characteristic reactions and behavior, of varying intensity, depending on the amounts of the drug taken and the length of time used, sometimes fatally severe, which ensue upon abrupt cessation of a drug upon which the body has devel\u00ad oped (PHYSICAL) DEPENDENCE (Lingeman 1969). The traumatic bodily upheaval that can result from cessation of regular admin\u00ad istration of a drug. Like tolerance, with\u00ad drawal is difficult to define in precise medical terms as it is most readily defined by observation of the behavior of the drug L1ser (Peele 19'77). For opiates, withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, restlessness, generalized body aches, insomnia, perspira\u00ad tion, hot flashes, nausea, diarrhea, rise in respiratory rate, cramps, dehydration, and loss of body weight. For barbiturates, 100 symptoms include tremo r, progressive weak\u00ad ness, dizziness, visual distortion, weight loss, nausea, sudden drop in blood pres- su re, anxiety, convulsions, epilepsyl ike seizures, and psychotic reactions (Lingeman 1969) . There is c. serious debate over the severity and frequency of the appear\u00ad ance of extreme withdrawal. There is much evidence to indicate that withdrawal is to a significant extent a function of social surroundings and not simply dependent on the amount and length of time a drug is taken. Among U.S. soldiers using her\u00ad oin in Vietnam, researchers have found that withdrawal occurred similarly within a unit, but that it differed between units; returning soldiers also underwent far less withdrawal than was expected. Within the therapeutic community of DAYTOP VILLAGE, the complete suppression of withdrawal has been reportzd among individuals who experienced extreme withdrawal in prison. Extreme withdrawal seems to be rather rare amon g street users; also, hospital patients receiving narcotics dosages stronger than those available on the street rarely show evidence of withdrawal (Peele 1978:63). Grinspoon and Hedbiom (1975: 153) emphasize that a withdrawal reaction \"is no more than a fairly well-defined set of physiological symptoms, different to differE:'nt drugs,\" which is neither the major cause nor the most important medical 0, social consequence of drug use. Stud\u00ad ies by Martin and Jasinski (1969) indicate that a pl'otracted opiate withdrawal syn\u00ad drome consisting of decreased blood pres\u00ad sure, pulse rate, pupil diameter, and body temperature can last up to 6 months.

Drug Classification 116 B. Drug Slang Terms and Bibliography 121 C. Trade Names 127 D. Acronyms Commonly Used in the Drug Abuse Field 129 116 APPENDIX A Drug Classification The following classification scheme groups drugs first according to their primary pharmacological and psychological action and second according to other shared characteristics, such as chemical structure or duratior, of action. The scheme is arranged alphabetically by generic name (except in the case of the barbiturates, which are listed in order of duration of action), and is the basis on which the drugs defined in this guide are categorized. Trade names, listed in parentheses, were taken from the 35th edition of the Physician's Desk Reference (Oradell, N.J.: Medical Eco\u00ad nomics Company, 1981).1 Drug effects are not precisely the same for all individuals, nor even necessarily the same for the same person at all times, even at the same dosage. They vary widely and often unpredict\u00ad ably, depending on such factors as physiological characteristics, personality and mental state, imagination and mood, expectations of what the drug will do, previous experience with the drug, the condition and properties of the drug being taken, the dosage, the route of administration, and the setting in which it is taken. Nevertheless, for each drug there exist primary effects or experiences and other relatively uniform characteristics. Not all of the over 400 drugs used recreationally are defined in this volume; only those that are most commonly utilized and fre\u00ad quently discussed in the drug research literature are included. Like all the definitions, those for drugs are by no means comprehensive discussions. The user is simply provided a descrip\u00ad tion of each drug's primary effects. Readers interested in learning more about drugs should consult the numerous drug dictionaries and reference articles cited in individual definitions. ANT IDEPRESSA N TS MAO 1 These listings are not exhaustive, and some drugs may be manufactured under other proprietary names as well. --------------------~----------------------------------------------------~--~~ 117 Tricyclic Amitriptyline VOLATILE B Black birds bombers Black Mollies Bombido Bombita Bottles Brain ticklers Brownies Browns Bumble bees Cartwheels Chalk Chicken powder Christmas trees Coast to coasts Co-pilots Crank Crossroads Cross tops Crystal Dexies Diet pills Dominoes Double cross Eye openers Fives Footballs Forwards French blue Head drugs Hearts Horse heads Inbetweens Jam Jam Cecil Jelly babies Jelly beans Jolly beans Jugs L.A.
