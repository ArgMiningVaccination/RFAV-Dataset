Video transcription for Plymouth Meeting as follows: Hey everyone, Dr. Anthony Memmo here, and I have been getting a lot of calls and emails on what people should take to boost their immune system give their body's the best chance to fight any potential invader, especially in times like these. What is important to remember is that this current health concern is called a Novel Virus, What that means is that we haven't seen it before, therefore there is no immunity for it and certainly no medical cure. So what that means is that we as individuals need to focus on our own health and boosting our own immune systems to help give us the best chance to stave off any unwanted invader. Now, In my last video, I posted 6 different tips to keep ourselves healthy in the thick of this growing pandemic... So In this video, I am going to share with you my approach to boosting my immune system with specific nutrients and herbs. Now first I need to preface this video by saying that this is my own protocol. This is exactly what I am taking, however, as a disclaimer, I need to say that this information is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Again, this is my own personal Supplement list that I have put together through the years based on my own clinical and personal experience. So with that being said the first supplement that I am taking is called ViVi: VIVI: So Vivi has Pau D'arco as well as Bitter Almond, Leptotaenia and jojoba oils. So all these are believed to have anti-viral properties and work synergistically when taken together. It is a great supplement that I always keep on hand to help ward off any immune challenges that come my way. Next is Fung DX. Fund DX is a great supplement and I find that I use it a lot for various reasons. It has a few similar nutrients as Vivi does like the Pau'D'arco and leptotaenia oil. But it also has Clove and Cassia which are thought to be anti-microbial, L-lycine which people often use on cold sores because it's believed to have anti-viral properties as well as various mint components which are believed to have strong antioxidant properties. So it is definitely a good one for me in times like these. Next I am taking Andrographis: This is one of my favorite herbs because it is believed to have an amazing potency and a strong anti-microbial effect. Melissa oil: So Melissa oils is also known as Lemon Balm, which many of you have probably heard of that. It is commonly found in a lot of herbal teas. So Melissa oil is believed to have an anti-viral benefit and is thought to decrease the virus's ability to replicate. Which is could definitely a good thing if your goal is to fight a viral infection. So Melissa oil can be put directly into a tea or put a couple of drops on your feet at night. I usually just place a drop in my tea. I'll be honest, I don't love the flavor of the oil but I do like the immune support, so I continue to take it. Vitamin C: Vitamin C has been thought to help the body boost immune function for nearly a century. I don't think any immune support list would be complete without Vitamin C. For this particular crisis, I am taking this CAMU CAMU powder. Camu Camu is a fruit found in South America and has about 10-20x the vitamin C than an orange. Camu Camu is one of my go to superfoods because it has so many great health benefits. So with everything that is going on right now I just add 1-2 scoops in my smoothie or water everyday for that little extra immune boost. Last but not least I am taking, DV3, So DV3 is the active version of Vitamin D. Vitamin D is often talked about but more times than not, it's benefits are really understated. Most people think of Vitamin D for calcium support for strong bones, which is true and important but from an immune stand point we now know that Vitamin D can help modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses. So essentially, having adequate Vitamin D levels can help our bodies recognize immune challenges such as various infections and help create or modulate an immune response to effectively fight it off. So for me this one is also essential for my everyday health. So guys for all who had asked, that is my current protocol. I hope you all found this video helpful. So that's all I have for this segment I just want to say stay safe, get adjusted and I look forward to seeing you all soon.
