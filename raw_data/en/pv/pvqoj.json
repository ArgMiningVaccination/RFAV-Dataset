This document is not intended to provide or take the place of medical advice, diagnosis or treatment, or legal advice. Ontario continues to monitor for cases of mpox (formerly monkeypox) and is working collaboratively with health care providers, Public Health Ontario (PHO) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to address health risk(s). New guidance will continue to emerge as new information becomes available and the epidemiology of this situation evolves. Imvamune\u00ae Vaccine Imvamune\u00ae is a live attenuated, non-rep licating vaccine that is approved in Canada for protection against smallpox, mpox, and other orthopoxvirus related illness; it is 3rd generation smallpox vaccine. It is produced from the Modified Vaccinia Ankara-B avarian Nordic (MVA-B N) strain of orthopoxvirus and was developed to provide an alternative for the vaccination of immunocompromised individuals and those with atopic dermatitis, who could not safely receive earlier generation (replicating) smallpox vaccines. Health Canada first approved the use of this vaccine for active immunization against smallpox in a public health emergency in 2013. In 2020, Health Can ada expanded approval of Imvamune\u00ae to include additional indications, specifically for mpox and related orthopoxvirus infections in adults 18 years of age and older at high risk of exposure. The use of Imvamune\u00ae has not been studied in individuals less than 18 years of age or in those who are pr egnant or breastfeeding. Imvamune\u00ae can be used as post exposure prophylaxis (PE P) in individuals with a recent high-ri sk mpox exposure. This is based on evidence extrapolated from animal studies and historical experience with smallpox vaccine in humans which suggest that vaccination after an exposure to mpox infection may prevent infection or lessen disease severity in those who become infected. Individuals with signs or symptoms of mpox infection should not receive the vaccine as the vaccine is not indicated in the treatment of mpox infection.2 | PageUse of Imvamune\u00ae in Ontario Given the current epidemiology in Ontario , Imvamune\u00ae should be offered as a two -dose primary series, with at least 28 days between first and second doses for individuals currently eligible for pre -exposure or post- exposure vaccination. A full dose , 0.5ml of Imvamune \u00ae, should be given via the subcutaneous (SC) route for each dose . This approach will continue to be evaluated with any changes in the epidemiology and evidence surrounding the vaccine . Imvamune \u00ae should be considered for v accination - whe n Imvamune\u00ae is administered before known exposure to t he virus Post-e xposure vaccination - when Imvamune\u00ae is administered for individuals who have had a high -risk exposure to a probable or confirmed case of mpox, or within a setti ng where transmission is h appening. 1)For the -queer individuals who self -identify or have sexual partners who self -identify a s belonging to the gay, bisexual, pansexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) community AND at least one of the following: Had a confirmed sexually transmitted infection within the last year Have or are planning to have two or more sexual partners or are in a relationship where at least one of the partners may have other sexual partners, Have attended venues for sexual contact (i.e., bath houses, sex clubs) recently or may be planning to, or who work/volunteer in these s ettings; or Have had anonymous sex (e.g., using hookup apps) recently or may beplanning to; and/or Are a sexual contact of an individual who engages in sex work. b)Individuals who self -identify as engaging in sex work or are planning to, regardless of self -identified sex or gender.3 | PageHousehold and/or sexual contacts of those identified for pre -exposure vaccination eligib ility in parts (a) and (b) above AND who are moderately to severely immunocompromised (see Appendix A) or pregnant may be at higher risk for severe illness from a mpox infection may be considered for pre-ex posure vaccine and should contact their healthcare provider (or their local public health unit) for more information. Also see relevant sections under \"Special Populations\" for additional considerations. 2)For the Purposes of Post -Exposure Vaccination throughout Ontario The provision of Imvamune\u00ae for post -exposure vaccination requires an assessment of the risk of exposure by the public health unit. If the identified person has a risk of potential exposure that is expected to continue beyond 28 d a ys following the first 0 .5mL SC dose , a dose , 0.5mL SC, s hould be offered . The first dose should be offered ideally within 4 days (up to 14 days) from the date of the last exposure to individuals who are a high risk contact of a confirmed or probable case of mpox. The second dose should be offered at least 28 days after the first dose. Anyone who self-id entifies as a high risk contact of a confirmed or probable case of mpox should contact their local public health unit for further assessment to see if post-ex posure vaccination would be recommended. I ntermediate risk contacts may also be offered post -exposure vaccination , following t he public health unit's assessment of individual risks and benefits (i.e., to balance the risks from exposure, protection from vaccination and potential side effects from the vaccine). Post -exposure v accination is n o t r ecommended fo r low -risk contacts including he a lth care w orkers (see T a ble 1). 4 | PageTable 1. Recommendations for Post- exposure Vaccination according to risk of infection Risk of exposure1 Post- exposure Vaccination High Recommended Intermediate May be recommended based on the public health unit's assessment of risks and benefits Low Not recommended No/very low Not recommended Special Populations Individuals with History of Previous Smallpox Vaccine Individuals eligible for Imvamune\u00ae as pre -exposure vaccination or post -exposure vaccination who previously received either an older generation replicating (live) smallpox vaccine or Imvamune\u00ae can be re -vaccinated: For individuals with a history of receiving 1 dose of a live smallpox vaccine, asingle dose of Imvamune\u00ae is recommended. For individuals who completed a 2 -dose series o f Imvamune\u00ae more than 2 years ago, a single booster dose of Imvamune\u00ae i s recommended. F or individuals who completed a 2 -dose serie s of Imvamune\u00ae within the last 2 years, no further doses are recommended. Individuals W ho have had Previous Mpox Infection At this time, i ndividuals who have been diagnosed as a confirmed case of mpox in the current outbreak are NOT recommended to receive the mpox vaccine; this is based o n the limited utility of the vaccine given that these persons are e xpected to have infection-me diated immunity due to recent 1 Recommendations for the management of cases and contacts of mpox in Ontario----------------------------------------------------5 | Pageinfection. This recommendation is based on current evidence and may change as more information becomes available. Research Laboratory Employees Research laboratory employees working directly with replicating orthopoxviruses, are eligible to receive two doses of Imvamune\u00ae at least 28 days apart as post - exposure vaccination or pre -exposure vaccination if there is an ongoing risk of exposure. Moderately to Severely Immunocompromised Individuals who are m oderately to severely immunocompromise d and are currently eligible for pre -exposure vaccination should receive two doses of the Imvamune\u00ae vaccine administered at the recommended interval. Please refer to: Appendix A for the definition of moderate to severe immunocompromise; and Appendix B for guidance on how to verify eligibility in this population. Clinical trials of Imvamune\u00ae have included people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with a CD4 count of equal or greater than 100. There is less experience in individuals with severe immunosuppression. Additional risk/benefit discussion is indicated for those with severe immunosuppression prior to receiving vaccine as post -exposure vaccination. Allergy/Hypersensitivity Individuals who are hypersensitive to this vaccine or to any ingredient in the formulation or component of the container shou ld not r eceive the vaccine. A list of ingredients can be found in the product monograph . Note: Imvamune\u00ae may contain trace amounts of antibiotics (gentamicin andciprofloxacin) and egg products (e gg cell DNA and protein) which are used during the vaccine production process. Individuals with knownhypersensitivity to these products are still able to safely receive Imvamune \u00ae but sho uld be monitored for an additional 15 minutes (30 minutes total) afte r vaccine administration. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding There are very limited data on the use of Imvamune\u00ae in pregnancy. Noclinical trials have been conducted in pregnant individuals, although6 | Pageapproximately 300 pregnancies have been reported to the manufacturer with no safety issues identified. There are no data on whether the vaccine is excreted in breastmilk, although this is unlikely as the vaccine is non- replicating. Additional risk/benefit discussion is indicated for those who are pregnant orbreastfeeding prior to receiving vaccine as post -exposure vac cination . Children and Youth Imvamune\u00ae vaccine is not authorized for use in persons under 18 years of age, and has not been studied in this age group, although it has been offered to children as PEP in previous United Kingdom mpox incidents as cited in UK PEP guidance. Clinical trials have studied other vaccines (TB and malaria) using Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) as a vector in children with a reassuring safety profile. Additional r isk/benefit discussion is indicated for persons under 18 years of age prior to receiving vaccine as post-ex posure vaccination. For the process of setting up infectious disease consults for mpox post-ex posure vaccination in pediatric populations, please refer to Appendix C. Persons with Atopic Dermatitis Persons with atopic dermatitis may have more frequent and more intense reactions after vaccination. This population was specifically studied in clinicaltrials as those with a history or presence of atopic dermatitis are contraindicated to receive the previous generation of smallpox va ccine (ACAM2000). Potential Side Effects of Imvamune\u00ae The most common side effects include reactions at the injection site like pain, erythema, induration and swelling. The most common systemic reactions observed after vaccination are fatigue, headache, myalgia, and nausea. Most of the reported adverse drug reactions observed in clinical trials were of mild to moderate intensity and resolved within the first seven days following vaccination. Older generation (i.e., replicating) smallpox vaccines have been a ssociated with myocarditis. No case of myocarditis or pericarditis was identified in clinical trials of Imvamune\u00ae, however post market surveillance of vaccine recipients identified 7 | Page cardiac adverse events of special interest (AESIs) including asymptomatic troponin elevation, abnormal ECG findings, tachycardia, and palpitations. Cardiac AESIs were reported to occur in 1.4% (91/6,640) of Imvamune\u00ae recipients and 0.2% (3/1,206) of placebo recipients who were smallpox vaccine -na\u00efve. Individuals should be counsel led to seek medical attention if cardiac symptoms (i.e., chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations) develop following vaccination with Imvamune\u00ae. Informed Consent The Health Care Consent Act, 1996 provides specific information as to the consent required for treatment. According to the HCCA, and the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) and College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) standards, nurses and physicians are accountable for obtaining consent when providing treatment. It is therefore the responsibility of the health practitioner who is proposing the treatment to take reasonable steps to ensure that informed consent for that treatment is obtained. According to the HCCA, consent to treatment for a capable person is informed if, before giving the consent: a. the person received the information about the treatment that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would require to make a decision; and b. the person received responses to his/her requests for additional information about the treatment. This information must include: The nature of the treatment The expected benefits of the t reatment The material risks of the treatment T he material side effects of the treatment A lternative courses of action The likely consequences of not having the treatment. The elements required for consent to treatment include: The client must have the capacity to consent The consent must relate to the treatment The consent must be informed The consent must be given voluntarily 8 | PageThe consent must not be obtained through misrepresentation or fraud. Evidence of Consent: Although the H CCA states that consent to treatment may be expressed or implied (i.e., w ritten or verbal), the CNO and CPSO strongly advise nurses and physicians to document that consent was obtained from the client. Examples include: 1) a signed consent form and/or 2) documented consent in the client's health records. How to order Imvamune\u00ae To order the vaccine, the local public health unit must complete this electronic form. Please contact the Vaccine Policy & Programs Branch at vaccinesupplyandlogistics@ontario.ca for any questions. Clinicians who think they have a patient (i.e., a contact of a case) who might be recommended to receive post-e xposure vaccination using the criteria above should contact their local public health unit. Co-A dministration of Imvamune\u00ae Interactions with Imvamune \u00ae and other vaccines have not been established. If vaccine timing can be planned, it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks for live vaccines (or COVID -19 vaccines) or 2 weeks for inactive vaccines before or after administration of Imvamune\u00ae. These suggested waiting periods are precautionary but may help prevent erronerous attribution of an AEFI to one particular vaccine or the other. However, t he administration of Imvamune\u00ae as pre-o r post-e xposure va ccination should not be delayed in an individual who has recently received another vaccine. If vaccines must be co-a dministered, immunization on separate limbs is recommended to minimize the risk of interaction.
