The President was invited by the Government of Mauritius in the context of the celebration of the 45 th anniversary of the Independance of Mauritius and the 21st anniversary of the Republic of Mauritius. On the occasion of the 7th anniversary of the inscription of the Aapravasi Ghat on the World Heritage List, the AGTF organized a Consultative Committee involving stakeholders, partners, collaborators, the local community and members of the public to present the latest developments at World Heritage Site and our future strategy for conservation, promotion, research and education. The objective was to inform the public and to receive feedback from the people involved with or interested in the World Heritage Property. The AGTF worked in collaboration with the Ministry of Arts & Culture, the University of Mauritius and the National Heritage Fund to prepare a proposal to inscribe Geet Gawai on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The Geet Gawai is part of the legacy of indenture that is still vibrant in Mauritius. An international recognition would further sustain its safeguarding.

Miao Foh, Research Assistant, AGTF Designed and Printed by Cathay Printing Ltd.11-22 31-39 41-51 23-293Editorial Editorial 2nd November 2013 marks the 179th anniversary of the arrival of indentured labourers in Mauritius. More than four decades ago, it was the Late Beekrumsing Ramlallah who began this important tradition with an annual yaj in order to pay a heartfelt tribute to the memories, trials and tribulations of our immigrant ancestors. Around a decade ago, the Government of Mauritius took the bold and laudable initiative of choosing this date to observe this special day in our country's rich and complex history which forever altered the demography, economy, society and politics of our small Indian Ocean island-state. In 2002, the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund was established and ever since then, it has played a paramount role in promoting the local and international importance of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site, other indenture sites and the experience of the indentured labourers in Mauritius. Around a year ago, I assumed the Chairmanship of AGTF and ever since then, several key projects and publications have been achieved such as the three volumes on indentured labour in Mauritius which saw the participation of more than 30 local and international authors, a publication on Immigrant Gokoola and the village and temple that bear his name. Today, AGTF is about to launch for the first time, a book of poems on the Aapravasi Ghat and indentured labour by Dr. Khal Torabully, a well-known Mauritian writer. In March of this year, we had the pleasure of the historic visit of the Honourable Pranab Kumar Mukherjee, the President of India, at the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site. In July 2013, excavations were undertaken by a team of professional archaeologists from the USA and Western Europe, with the support of AGTF , which provide new insights into the living conditions and health of the indentured and ex-indentured labourers during the 19 th century in Mauritius. During the same month, a successful consultative committee with important stakeholders in the Aapravasi Ghat Buffer Zone was organized in order to mark the 7th anniversary of the inscription of our site on UNESCO's prestigious World Heritage List. Earlier this year, a detailed inventory of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Mauritius linked with indentured labour was completed. Furthermore, in September of this year, a national half-day workshop was organized for Mauritian writers which will lead to the publication of several short studies on the sugar estates, villages and localities of our country linked with indentured labour. During the course of this year, I visited Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad, Guadeloupe and Martinique, where I launched the idea of setting up an International Indentured Labour Route Project. In June 2013, I gave an important speech at an international conference on indenture and slavery where I strongly advocated for the Indian Diaspora countries to take part in the establishment of such an international project. Now more than ever, in line with the recommendations of UNESCO's World Heritage Committee and the commitment which was taken at the international conference on indentured labour in December 2011 in Mauritius, the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund together with the Ministry of Arts and Culture are finally taking the necessary steps in order to make the International Indenture Labour Route a reality. 4Newsletter No.11 When looking forward to 2014, it is with great pleasure that I announce that in the context of the 180th anniversary of the arrival of the indentured labourers in Mauritius, an itinerary exhibit, concerning the forthcoming Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre (BRIC), will be put on display in Mauritius, Reunion Island and South Africa. In January 2014, it is presumed that it will be one of the important exhibits at the next Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas in India. In early 2014, Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre (BRIC) will become operational while the landscaping of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site and the conservation of the Old Labourers' Quarters at Trianon will be completed. During the coming months, our Mauritian citizens, tourists and other foreigners will be have the opportunity to discover and even \"rediscover\" the long, rich and complex history of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site, other indenture sites and the experience of the indentured labourers in Mauritius. This forms an integral part of the commitment of AGTF to promoting our unique historical site. In the near future, AGTF plans to have an operational replica of the ship Atlas, which brought the 36 indentured workers to Mauritius, docked near the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site. Its main objective will be to take Mauritian and foreign visitors for a tour of Port Louis harbor and around Mauritius and relive and understand the experience of the arriving indentured labourers. The Indian High Commission in Mauritius has agreed in principle to provide help and support for the implementation of this important project. Next year, as part of the 180th anniversary commemorations, a major international conference will be held which will include the launching of several publications by Mauritian authors and a voluminous AGTF souvenir magazine. The completion of these AGTF projects and the launching of these publications are tangible examples of the AGTF's commitment to fulfilling the objectives of its Act and the vision of our Prime Minister in preserving and promoting our Mauritian cultural heritage. As I conclude my editorial, I have a very special thought for my ancestors Immigrant Utchanah his parents, Immigrants Gengiah and Juggamah, and his three sisters, Chinamee, Juggamah and Pydamah, who left their place of birth at Vizagapatnam in the Telugu-speaking districts of southern India. In September 1865, they arrived and were registered at the Immigration Depot or the present-day Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site. Just like hundreds of thousands of other immigrant men, women and children, through their hardwork and sacrifices, they transformed this small rocky and barren island into a garden of sugar. They contributed to the making of modern Mauritius through their toils and tears and today we are their proud descendants and inheritors. Mahen Utchanah Chairman, Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund 2 nd November 2013 Newsletter No.11 t is my pleasure to be associated with the publication of the annual Newsletter 2013 of the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund. I would like to congratulate the Chairperson and Members of the Fund for their excellent initiative in commemorating the 179th Anniversary of the arrival of the first Indian Immigrants in Mauritius in the latter half of the 19 th Century. As we all know, through their sweat and toil, the Indian Immigrants who were brought into Mauritius to work in the sugar cane fields, have laid the foundations for a modern and prosperous Mauritius. The history of Mauritius is replete with the hardships and tribulations that our forefathers had to undergo in the hands of their colonial masters. They had to work from dawn to sunset, very often to the detriment of their health in order to shape the destiny of our country. Many of them even lost their lives in the sugar cane fields because of the treatment that was meted out to them. The commemoration of their arrival in Mauritius is therefore a legitimate way of immortalizing the contribution they have in the socio-economic development of Mauritius. I take this opportunity to wish the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund success in its endeavor. H.E. Mr Rajkeswur Purryag, GCSK, GOSK President of the Republic 28 August 2013 Republic of Mauritius I6 he Chairperson and members of the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund deserve our congratulations for their dedication and continued furtherance of illuminating our past history of indentured laboureurs. I am glad that we managed to have the Aapravasi Ghat inscribed on the World Heritage List of UNESCO in 2006, for it throws light on an important part of our history and the unsung heroes who laid the foundation of modern Mauritius. No country can aspire to move forward if it ignores its history, however painful. It is my fervent hope that the younger generation shows a keener interest in our history. Many of our citizens do not seem to realize the harsh reality of our past, and how it was only by dint of hard work, sheer perseverance and solidarity that we managed to overcome adversity and turn our country into a peaceful and tolerant society, which has given an enduring meaning to the words first uttered by the Father of our Nation about Mauritians being an example of \"Unity in Diversity\". Dr the Hon Navinchandra Ramgoolam, GCSK, FRCP Prime Minister 04 September 2013 Prime Minister Republic of Mauritius T7 am once again pleased to associate myself with the commemoration marking the 179 th anniversary of the landing of the first indentured labourers at the Aapravasi Ghat. As the landing place of a majority of our ancestors, this World Heritage Site reminds us that we are a country of immigrants; a country that has overcome the vicissitudes of history in the preceding centuries to develop into a prosperous nation. While it is important to pay homage to those enterprising pioneers who did not waver in the face of adversity, it is our duty to preserve their ethos. It is largely thanks to these legacies of savoir-vivre and tolerance that today we are citizens of a peaceful, multi-ethnic and democratic society that stands out as an example in the League of Nations. Government will continue to preserve and promote this World Heritage site for the benefit of humanity. The site will witness significant developments with the completion of Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre project next year. This will enhance visitor experience while making the Aapravasi Ghat a major attraction in the city. I congratulate the Chairman and members of the Board as well as the employees of the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund for their good work. I take this opportunity to assure them my continued support. M. Choonee Minister Lord Mayor's Office Republic of Mauritius I he Aapravasi Ghat, also known as the Immigration Depot or the Coolie Ghat, has always been a landmark in the history of Mauritius. Its recognition as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 2006 is an added value. Recognition at international level is yet another means to pay tribute to the ancestors of a majority of Mauritians. Those first immigrants have left their imprints at this historical site of Port Louis, also a place of great cultural and emotional significance. It is worth noting that the City Council had been among those institutions who spared no efforts to have the Aapravasi Ghat listed as World Heritage. Preserving heritage is preserving a country's, a nation's identity. However, ways and means should be looked into so that this heritage can fully integrate a plan whereby this prime location of the city could be developed to its full potential. As it is every year, the 179 th anniversary of the arrival of indentured labourers at the Aapravasi Ghat would be yet another occasion to remember those ancestors who, through their hard work, sacrifices and tears, left us a priceless legacy. We honour their contribution to the social and economic progress of Mauritius.

The publication of Khal Toorabully's Voices from the Aapravasi Ghat newsletter in October 2013.Newsletter No.11 11HISTORY Over the past eighty years, several books and articles have been written on the indentured labourers and the indentured labour system in Mauritius. However, one of the important themes of research which have been largely neglected by Mauritian historians and scholars are the free Indian immigrants who reached Mauritian shores during the nineteenth century. Therefore, the life-stories of the non-indentured Indian immigrants are one of the research themes which is currently being documented by the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund as part of its research objectives for 2013 and 2014. Who were the Free or Non-Indentured Indian Immigrant ? It is commonly known in Mauritius that between 1826 and 1910, more than 462,000 indentured workers arrived in Port Louis. However, few Mauritians are aware that, during the same period, an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 free Indian immigrants came to work and live in our country. A careful analysis of the records of the National Archives Department, Mahatma Gandhi Institute Indian Immigration Archives and the Civil Status Office indicates that between the 1820s and 1830s, several dozen free immigrants landed in Port Louis each year. Furthermore, between the 1840s and 1920s, hundreds arrived annually.Who exactly were the free or non-indentured immigrants from the Indian sub-continent? During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the free immigrants paid their own passages when they got on board their ships in Indian ports such as Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Pondicherry, Cochin, Tanquebar, Cuddalore, Karikal and Surat. Their passages usually cost two to three pounds sterling and they had to bring their own rations which was an additional cost of more than one pound. Once they arrived in Port Louis, they did not pass through the Immigration Depot (known today at the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site) because they were registered at the Customs Department and the Police Headquarters in Port Louis. They were provided with an identification number which consisted of the free immigrant's passenger list number and the year of their arrival, the two numbers were usually divided with a slash. It became an integral part of their identity in Mauritius during the remainder of their lives just like our Mauritian national identification card. As part of the formalities, each non-indentured immigrant had to deposit ten pounds sterling in the form of a financial security, through the Police Department, into the local government savings bank which allowed them to obtain a residence permit for twelve months. However, Bizloll (No.747/47) arrived as a Free Passenger from India in 1847. He was a sirdar, small property owner and was arrested as a vagrant in 1881 when he was 56 years old. He was released shortly after producing his papers. Source: MGI Indian Immigration Archives, PH Series: Vagrant Photos and Registers Ghilaza (No.361/48) arrived as a Free Passenger from India in 1848 as a child. He was a job contractor and independent vegetable cultivator and was arrested as a vagrant in 1881 when he was 43 years old. He was released shortly after producing his papers. Source: MGI Indian Immigration Archives, Moka.\"They Came to Mauritian Shores\": The Experiences of Free or Non-Indentured Indian Immigrants in Nineteenth Century Mauritius Dr. Satteeanund Peerthum, Historian and Satyendra Peerthum, Historian12Newsletter No.11 HISTORY this financial security was returned to them once the free immigrant left a copy of proof of employment and residence which had to be valid for a period of one year and renewed each year. The British Governor was the only one who could give such an authorization, through the Office of the Colonial Secretary where the non-indentured immigrants sent their residence requests. Ever since the 1820s, there was an Assistant Colonial Secretary who was responsible for issues dealing with residents, aliens and free immigrants in the colony. It is important to note that between the 1820s and early 1900s, there were tens of thousands of non-indentured Indian immigrants who had to follow the rules and regulations of a government ordinance of 1817 regulating the aliens and foreigners in the colony. During the nineteenth century, the free immigrants had to spend on average between twelve to thirteen pounds sterling for their passage, rations on board their ships and the right of residence in Mauritius. Therefore, they had to have access to some financial resources and many among them were skilled and semi-skilled workers or had many years of work experience in India. The amount of money they spent to come to Mauritius represented the wages of several months for them. Thus, it was a well-planned decision before they left the Indian sub- continent in search of new opportunities and to improve their lives in Mauritius. Between the 1820s and early 1900s, the overwhelming majority, or more than three fourths, of the non-indentured Indians who arrived in our country were single adult males between the ages of eighteen and forty. A careful analysis of the list of engagements, vagrant registers, civil status records and bi-annual reports on the sugar estates for the period between the 1860s and early 1900s is quite revealing. They show that during this period, the non-indentured Indian immigrants consisted only 1% to 5% of the local estate work force. Most of the free Indian immigrants went to work in Port Louis, its suburbs, in the towns and villages of the colony. In addition, it was only a minority among them who went to work as day labourers and as \"engaged labourers\" on one-year contracts on the sugar estates. Free Indian immigrants or Free Indian passengers, such as Bizloll, Peerthum, Ghilaza, and Parawatta made an important contribution in the making of the Mauritius economy during the 19 th and early 20th centuries. Their lives and achievements form an integral part of the history of indentured labour and Indian immigration in colonial Mauritius. Peerthum (5750 bis). A Free Indian Immigrant arrived in Mauritius during the early 1860s. He worked as a day labourer in Savanne and Flacq. He passed away in 1905 at the age of 59.

Source: MNA. Quarantine meaning a period of forty days (une quarantaine de jours) is enforced isolation. This system existed in this island since the eighteenth century, but a rigorous form of isolation was introduced by the British when large scale Indian immigration started in 1834. This period coincided with serious outbreaks of disease such as smallpox in 1830s and cholera in the 1850s and 1860s. Although England also suffered from cholera pandemics, the government removed all forms of quarantine restrictions by the mid-nineteenth century, however in its colonies, including Mauritius; rigorous quarantine regulations continued and became even more oppressive as the century unfolded. In Mauritius, Indian immigration was at the base of the development of the sugar industry, but at the same, it was the cause of considerable concern with the arrival of large number of Indians with smallpox or cholera. At first, the Colonial Office encouraged the setting up of an isolation station with adequate facilities to accommodate unhealthy Indians because very often they were forced to stay isolated on the ships in the harbour for a long period of time before they were allowed to land. The old quarantine station at the Ile aux Tonneliers was small and did provide enough shelter. The press, members of the government and also local medical circles were against the plan of the government to set up a permanent station at this place, many believed that winds could carry miasma from that place to the town. They pressed the authorities to consider islets at a distance from the main land, such as Flat and Gabriel Islands. Some inhabitants even petitioned to set up a station at Rodrigues, which was refused by the government. The government accepted with reluctance to set up a station at Flat Island. From the mid-1850s, it became the main station. British medical officers very often showed their disapproval to direct immigrants to those stations, very often sites of considerable misery. But the pressure was always strong, even the Municipality of Port Louis was against immigrant ships anchoring in the harbour. At each rumour of disease, the streets of the town flared up with protests. Succeeding governors did not change the practice, although it was costly and dangerous. They preferred not to antagonise local opinion. Governor Napier Broome's statement summarizes the prevailing situation, that there were three delicate issues in the colony, 'land, labour and quarantine.' In spite of important progress of medicine, vaccination campaigns, and important discoveries concerning the cause of disease such smallpox and cholera, the quarantine system was maintained in Mauritius well into the twentieth century.

Source: MGIIIA/PG Series .Satyendra Peerthum, HistorianAnother Perspective on to Mauritian Shore s: Mozambican, Malagasy and Comorian Indentured Century Mauritius The African and Malagasy Indentured Workers One of the largely neglected research themes in modern Mauritian historiography is the experience of the non-Indian workers during the 19th century, specifically the Malagasy, Mozambican and Comorian indentured workers. From 1839 to there were thousands of Malagasy, Mozambican and Comorian contractual labourers who came to Mauritian shores to work in Port Louis and on the island's sugar estates. During that period, I compiled statistics that showed that about 4,133 non-Indian indentured workers arrived in Mauritius; of which around 3,607 were Malagasy, 320 were Mozambicans and 206 were Comorians. The Malagasy indentured labourers came mainly from eastern, central and north-western Madagascar and included important local tribal nations and groups such as the Antanosy, Antamboly, Merina, Tamboly, Sakalava, and the Betsimisarakas. The Mozambicans who came, belonged to powerful tribal nations such as the Makua, Yao, Maravi, Lomwe and Nginodo. The Comorian workers were Schirazi, an ethnic mix between Arabs and East Africans, and they came mostly from Anjouan and some from Grande Comore, Mayotte and Moheli. These men were skilled and semi-skilled workers and were engaged. They were engaged on indenture contracts for 1 and 2 years, unlike the 5-year indenture engagements of the Indian workers. However, most of the time, they were given the same contractual terms and conditions as their Indian counterparts. Many of them did not complete their indenture contracts; mostly because there was a high death rate among them and because they were regularly arrested as vagrants and deserters by the local colonial police and in such case, repatriated to their home countries. The case-study of Tsimalay, Ravaton and Kadhey are one of the many examples of the experience of Malagasy, Mozambicans and Comorians indentured workers in Mauritius. The Tsimalay, Ravaton and Kadehy In October 1850, Tsimalay arrived in Mauritius as a contractual worker from Taomasina (Tamatave) in the north east Madagascar. On 28 th October of the same year, Thomy Hugon, the Protector of Immigrants, provided him with an immigrant ticket just like tens of thousands of other Indian indentured workers. Tsimalay was employed on a 3-year contract as a blacksmith for Mr. Loustau, part-owner of Chamouny Sugar Estate in Savanne District. He was born in a village near Tamatave in 1830, he was a Christian and his father was Tsimaika, a dock worker. A Ship Register showing the arrival of Mosa, Hamesy Kombo and other 1853, he completed his three-year contract and obtained a certificate of discharge from the Stipendiary Magistrate of Savanne with the support of his employer. Lousteau described his former worker as being \"intelligent and hard working\" and regretted his departure. By December 1853, Tsimalay got on board a ship bound for Tamatave at the age of 23. Compared to Tsimalay who chose to return to his home country, the immigrants Ravaton and Kadehy are good examples of Malagasy indentured workers who adopted Mauritius as their new home. They were both from the island of Nossi-Be, located a few kilometres off the North East coast of Madagascar. They arrived at the Immigration Depot in Mauritius in July 1850. Immigrant Ravaton, son of Takon, was 35 years old when he was registered and worked as a labourer on Grande Rosalie Sugar Estate in Pamplemousses District. After finishing his two-year contract, he went to work as a messenger in Port Louis. He passed away there in March 1859 at the age of 43. His fellow traveler and friend, Kadehy, son of Marsakay, arrived in Mauritius when he was 22 years old. He was sent to work on a two-year contract as a labourer at Bagatelle Sugar Estate in Moka District. By 1865, he became a labour overseer on that particular sugar estate and was able to purchase a small plot of land near the village of Moka. In September 1877, Kadehy died at the age of 49 and his property was inherited by his wife, a creole lady, and his two sons. Between the arrival of the first indentured worker (1826) and the end of indenture system (1910), an estimated total of more than 467,400 indentured workers came to Mauritian shores. Out of which, from 1829 to 1870, a total of 9,484 Malagasy, Mozambican, other African workers, Chinese, Liberated Africans, Arab workers from Aden, Sinhalese and other \"Non-Indian\" labourers landed in Port Louis. Therefore, they represent an estimated total of more than 2% of all the contractual workers who reached our country. As we commemorate the arrival of the indentured workers on 2 nd November 2013, we should have a special thought for Immigrants Tsimalay, Ravaton, Kadehy, Oswald Nanjeea and the thousands of other Mozambican, Malagasy and Comorian indentured workers who worked for the development of our country. After all, most of them voluntarily crossed the Mare Indicum as they came to Mauritian shores in search of a better life. At the same time, during the early post-emancipation era, they were brought to our country in order to supplement and then to replace the slaves and apprentices as the island's main work force.

He has produced three books on this topic, starting with his dissertation \"Contracts for Suriname - Labour Migration from British India under the Indentured Labour System 1873-1916.\" This study dealt with the system of recruitment in India.His second book titled The New Avatar of Slavery - Indian Immigrants under the Indentured Labour System in Suriname 1873-1916 goes in depth into the functioning of indentured labour on the plantations in Suriname.His third publication Tetary the obstinate - The Resistance of Indian against the Indentured Labour System in Suriname 1873-1916 is a study of resistance against the system. Bhagwanbali is a classic historian. He avoids speculation. He immerses himself in the archives. He painstakingly gathers the details that show how the system worked. The picture is astonishing. Here are some of his conclusions: 1. Migration was not an individual action. It was an organized system where the colonialist had the lead and control. The former enslaver-planter placed an order to recruit labourers. It was not the other way round, that the labourers were offering themselves for work on the plantations. 2. The system of recruitment was based on deception. The workers agreed to a contract without any idea of what they were going to experience in a system of oppression and exploitation. The reality of indentured labour was hidden in the recruitment. 3. In the labour camps (we don't use the word 'plantation' because it does not reflect the actual conditions) the reality was horrendous. The workers lived in the same houses as the former enslaved Africans. The performed the same tasks. They endured the same system of racist treatment. Bhagwanbali provides details of the use of the whip. He cites names and the number of lashes individual Indians received, women included. The medical situation was really bad. The number of people who died in the period of indenture ship was extremely high: 16% (5.500 out of 34.000). 4. In the period 1873-1916, there were 40 uprisings in the labour camps quelled by police and military: 31 workers were executed in two of these uprisings: 24 in labour camp Mari\u00ebnburg and 7 in labour camp Zorg en Hoop. Among those executed was a young woman, Tetary, the only female who actually led an uprising of indentured labourers. Tetary, gender and revolt Until the publication of the third book of Bhagwanbali nobody in the Suriname community knew the name of Tetary. Recently a two-series documentary has been produced by Sandew Hira on Tetary and the uprising in labour camp Zorg en Hoop. The documentary dramatized the background and the events of the uprising. It was broadcasted by the Hindu Broadcasting Corporation in Holland and shown in Suriname in June 2013. The documentary devoted a fair portion of the time to the position of women during indenture ship. A young historian working in the National Archives of Suriname, Tanya Sitaram, was the lead narrator in the documentary. She provided the analysis of gender, indentureship and revolt. The lead actrice, Kajol Tahdil (see photo), was shown in a discussion between young women reflecting on their lives and in heated debates with men. Sitaram is currently working on a master thesis on women and indentureship. There are two schools in the study of indenture ship in Suriname. The differences between these schools are on three levels. The first is the level of conceptualization of colonialism. The old school - which I named scientific colonialism - accepts the legitimacy of colonialism. Colonialism as a system is not questioned. The new school - which I Newsletter No.11 17HISTORY term decolonizing the mind - questions the right of one people to conquer and rule other people. The different conceptualization is reflected in different concepts that are used such as the concept of plantation versus labour camp. The second is the level of research. The old school focuses on descriptive narratives with implicit assumptions regarding the legitimate morality of colonialism. The new school provides analysis of historical facts and focuses on the humanity of the indentured labour and the inhumanity of colonialism.The third is the level of policy implication. The study of Bhagwanbali produced detailed personal information about the Indians that were executed in the labour camps. One policy implication is that we pose the question: does the family of these people in India know what really happed to their kin in Suriname? The colonialist did not bother to report to the family what happed. Our legacy is to do our utmost to trace their relatives in India and recount to them what heroic actions they were involved in. Naturally this means that we set in motion a process of fundamentally questioning the system of colonialism. This is the experience of Suriname. I wonder if something similar is happening in other countries. The Tamil Indian Immigrants Bhuruth Dinand, AGTF Board MemberThe Tamil Hindus were brought to in 1728 from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. They were the first immigrants from the South Eastern India who were non Hindi speaking and who arrived before the mass immigration of indentured labourers. They came as craftsmen to Mauritius from the French port of Pondicherry for the construction of the French colonial buildings and port in the city of Port Louis. These Tamil craftsmen were small in number until the beginning of 1830s more of them were brought during the immigration of indentured labourers. The Tamil Hindus share not only a geographic ancestry but also a linguistic and cultural heritage that is intimately linked to their distinct religious practices. Tamil labour immigrants mostly came from the south Indian port city of Madras known as Chennai in modern India. They were sent to work on sugar estates all over the island of Mauritius and they grouped together to preserve their traditions. The Tamils practiced their daily religious rituals as well as their unique and popular religious festival Kavadee -Fire Walking. With such a visible and religious practice on the sugar estates, they were able to secure a plot of land for shrines and later temples known as Kovils. The Tamil community with the help of the Tamil craftsmen built the first Hindu temple in 1850. The early establishment of Tamil Kovils was primarily due to the economic independence of a small number of Tamils connected to the merchant class. They built the kovils in the evening hours but due to their lack of formal training in temple architecture many of the kovils were simple in structure. These kovils provided a resting place for the protecting deities and a centre for the local Tamil community. Tamils are devotees of Shiva known as Shaivaite and most Kovils in Mauritius are dedicated to Murugan, son of Shiva or a form of the mother goddess such as Marriamen. With the growing number of Kovils, Tamil organisations arose to build and administer these religious centers as well as to promote the interests of Tamils in general. The Mauritius Tamil Temple Federation (MTTF) was established in 1960 to oversee the administration of the Mauritian Kovils. The MTTF continues to provide the leadership for the Tamil community. The Tamil community in Mauritius has a rich cultural history. 18Newsletter No.11 HISTORY Commemorating The Making of Our History Remembering the Pioneer Indentured Labourers of 2nd November 1834 Mr. Dravindranath Ramloll (MSK) AGTF Board Member Since 2nd November 2001, the Republic of Mauritius commemorates the Arrival of the Indentured Labourers as part of the Mauritian Heritage and in remembrance of all indentured labourers. This commemoration ceremony has since then taken place at the former Immigration Depot, now known as the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site. The 2nd November has been decreed as a Public Holiday in memorial of the arrival of the 36 Indentured Labourers on board of the Atlas. The Recruitment of Arbuthnot's Coolies It was on the 10th of September 1834 that 36 'Hill Coolies' of the 'Dhangar' caste signed a five-year contract with Georges Charles Arbuthnot of the Hunter-Arbuthnot & Company, a British trading company in Mauritius, in the presence of C. Mc. Farlan, at the Calcutta Police Head Office. The Hill Coolies originated mostly form the hills of Bihar in Eastern India who were living in Calcutta then. McFarlan, the Chief Magistrate of Calcutta, read and explained in detail the contract to the Indian labourers with the help of an Indian interpreter. 36 Coolies, 30 men and 6 women, agreed to work in Mauritius by putting their thumb marks on the contract as per terms and conditions proposed. Together with the contract, there was also a separate list consisting of the 36 indentured labourers' names on which each of them wrote an 'X' next to their names. Some of their names were Callachand, Dookhun, Bhomarah, Bhoodhoo, Lungon and Bhudhram. The sirdar namely in charge of the labourers, was assisted by Subaram. According to the contract which was in Bengali language, the males were going to get a wage of five rupees per month while the opposite sex would earn only four rupees per month. An advance of six months' pay was already given to them before they were embarked. The company which recruited them paid their passage from Calcutta to Port Louis. As a result, one rupee was deducted from their monthly salary by the same British company in order to pay for their return passage at the end of their contract. In addition to a monthly wage, basic needs such as food, clothing, lodging and health were being provided to the contractual labourers. As far as concerned to the wages of the Sirdar and his assistant, they received ten and eight rupees per month respectively. The Arrival of Arbuthnot's Coolies After the contract was signed, MacFarlan sent a letter to the Secretary to the Government of the Bengal Presidency, H. Prinsep, informing him of the agreement. The Chief Magistrate requested the Vice-President and Governing Council of the Bengal Presidency to give their stamp of approval to the contract and to allow the labourers to sail for Mauritius. On 15 th September, the Vice-President in Council gave his assent to the contract. Thus, the 36 Hill Coolies embarked on the Atlas and began their historic voyage to British Mauritius. The Atlas which was under the command of Captain Hustwick transported not only the 36 contractual labourers but also George Arbuthnot and other passengers as well as a large cargo of rice. After a long voyage which lasted for more than six weeks, the Atlas reached Port Louis harbour on Sunday afternoon on the 2 nd November 1834. Before they could land, Arbuthnot wrote an official letter on behalf of Hunter-Arbuthnot & Company to Governor Nicolay requesting that \"they be allowed to land 36 Hill Coolies from the ship Atlas, whom they intend to employ on their Estate, under guarantee that they shall not become a Newsletter No.11 19HISTORY charge on the Colony\". Once they received the Governor's approval, the labourers were being registered. Hunter-Arbuthnot & Company provided Governor Nicolay with a financial guarantee which was kept in trust by the local colonial government in the Colonial Treasury and would be returned to that British company after the five-year contract of the labourers had expired. As a result, during the afternoon of 3 rd November, permission for the landing of the labourers was given by the British governor. However, it was only on Tuesday morning, 4 th November that the 36 Hill Coolies were landed close to the old Customs House, not far from the present-day Aapravasi Ghat. The Journey to Antoinette Sugar Estate in Rivi\u00e8re du Rempart Later that same day, Arbuthnot's coolies were taken to Belle Alliance Sugar Estate near present-day Piton, in Rivi\u00e8re du Rempart. In 1834, Belle Alliance was owned by Hunter-Arbuthnot & Company and it stretched over an area of 502 acres and had a workforce of between 190 to 200 slaves. The Indian labourers worked from sunrise to sunset, six days a week and they were also required to perform light duties on Sundays. Thus, they worked side by side with the slaves of Belle Alliance in the sugarcane fields. The arrival of Arbuthnot's coolies is the particular event that is commemorated each year on 2nd November at Indo-Mauritians and Indian Immigrants at Antoinette Estate Camp in the early 1900s. Source: Macmillan Illustrated, 1916the Aapravasi Ghat. These early indentured labourers and the tens of thousands who followed in their footsteps between 1835 and 1839 were pioneers of a migration which was eventually to transform the character of Mauritian life and industry. Furthermore, during the first period of the indenture system, between November 1834 and May 1839, around 25 468 Indians were introduced into this small Indian Ocean island. During this period, the local sugar planters began to import Indian labourers to supplement and eventually to replace the apprentice labourers to work in the island's sugar canefields, in their homes, and in Port Louis. Between November 1834 and March 1839, around 25,700 Indian labourers were landed on Mauritian shores. However, immigration from the Indian subcontinent was suspended in May 1839 only to be renewed in January 1842, when it became controlled and sponsored by the British authorities of India and Mauritius and a Protector of Immigrants also was appointed in Mauritius. Each year on 2 nd November, the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund commemorates the arrival of the indentured labourers in accordance with the mission statement of the Fund and the objectives of its Act. It forms an integral part of AGTF's devoir de memoire in making the Mauritian nation remember the sacrifices and achievements of the indentured workers and to perpetuate their memory as part of the process of nation building. After all, our history is a continuation of their history and thus, their history is our history.20Newsletter No.11 HISTORY Tracing My Roots Babita Bahadoor, Research Assistant Tracing your roots is not an impossible task as long as you know where to go and find the right documents. You do not need to be a professional researcher to carry out a research on your lineage. This article provides details on the procedures undertaken in order to trace the genealogy of indentured labourers (comprising of Indians, non-Indians and Liberated Africans). Most Indian labourers originated from the Bengal, Bombay and Madras Presidencies. Non-Indian indentured labourers comprised of Abyssinians, Chinese, Comorians, Malagasies, Mozambicans, Omani and Yemenis. As far as concerned to a 'Liberated African', he was an enslaved individual who was given a new identity under the law and apprenticed for a period of 5 years. After the completion of his/her term of apprenticeship, he/she became a free British subject. The non-Indentured labourers were those who were termed as 'passengers' and most of them came on the island during the 19 th century for trading purposes. Built in 1849 in view of receiving a large contingent of contractual labourers, the immigration depot, namely the Aapravasi Ghat is one among the well preserved historical sites in Mauritius. This depot was in operation until late 1938 when the post of Protector of Immigrant was abolished. It was only at the immigration depot that the registration process of indentured labourers took place. After its cessation as an immigration depot, all the records which included Emigration Agency Certificates, Marriage Certificates, Photographs of Immigrants, Ticket registers and personal details of immigrants (Immigrant No., name, age, caste, sex, etc) were transferred to the Indian Immigration Archives at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute, Moka (IIA MGI). To start with, you have to ensure that you have in your possession all required documents with you, for instance, Birth, Marriage or/and Death Certificates of your Father, Grand Father and great grandfather. Notarial deeds also are important documents. The next step to follow is to look for the Immigrant Number which is found on one of the aforesaid documents.What is an Immigrant Number? An Immigrant Number was assigned to each indentured labourer during the registration process at the Immigration Depot. As from 1842, necessary measures were being undertaken by the Government of India and Mauritius in view of controlling the emigration of Indian labour and thus, upon their arrival at the immigration depot, indentured labourers were registered and were assigned an immigrant number found on their Tickets. The Immigration Number is a unique one without which it would have been impossible to identify an indentured labourer. In case, you do not have any of the aforesaid documents or the Immigrant No., it advisable to start looking for these documents at the Civil Status Office (Birth, Marriage and/or Death Certificates) or the Registrar General Office (Notarial deeds). After acquiring those precious documents, you have to identify the Immigrant No. An example is to look for the Birth Certificate of your great grandparents (father/mother), in which the Immigrant No. may be found just below the name of his/ Figure 1: How to find the Immigrant No. 1st Generation Name of Immigrant Immigrant No. Year 1842 - 1910? 2nd Generation Your Great Grandfather's BC/DC/MC 3rd Generation Your Grand Grandfather's BC/DC/MC 4th Father's BC/DC/MC 5th 21HISTORY Indian Immigrants as Postman Ghirish Bissoon, Postal Museum When we talk about the recruitment of Indian immigrants to Mauritius, the first picture that comes to our mind is that of a labourer. After the abolition of slavery and even after the resumption of coolie trade in 1842, it is true that Indian immigrants were brought to Mauritius to work in fields as labourers. But there were other jobs that they were performing and one of them was the job of postman. \"On 11 October, the Colonial Postmaster informed the Governor that he had obtained the services of fourteen \"convict couriers\" as per his earlier estimates of February 1847 and requested the services of two additional \"couriers\" to ensure proper working of his department\" (Huron, J.M and Marion, R., 2012). The postmen were wearing a jacket, two cloth trousers, brass arm plates on which Post Office were engraved and turbans. Furthermore, those Indian Convicts marked history as they were the first ones who conveyed letters with the first stamps of Mauritius in 1847(See picture). In short, Indian immigrants did not only contribute in the development of agriculture but also in the development of communication on the island of Mauritius. Source: Jean Marie Huron and Robert Marion (2012), The Story of The Mauritius Post Office The Challenge of delivering a letter 1638-2012, The Mauritius Post Ltdher father's and mother's name. Figure 1 may help you find the Immigrant No. Once you have been able to trace the Immigrant No., you have to contact the Indian Immigration Archives based at the MGI, Moka. After all these procedures have been carried, you will receive a certificate, on which details of your forebear will be mentioned such as name, age, origin, name of father/mother, name of kin accompanying the indentured labourer, port of embarkation, physical signs/marks, and even a picture of the person can be obtained if available. Photography was introduced at the Immigration Depot in 1865. After your research in case you found out that your forebear was not an indentured labourer, then you will probably come across a 'Passenger Number'. The difference between the two numbers is that the Passenger Number provides both an identification number along with the year when the latter was registered. Details of the Passenger No. can be obtained in the Z2D Series at the Mauritius National Archives located at Coromandel. The records cover the period 1826 and 1902. However, compared to an Indentured Immigrant, very few information is available regarding a Passengers. Once you have been able to find information on your ancestors, you may either reconstruct your family tree or with the help of the Certificate obtained at the IIA, MGI, procure a PIO (People of Indian Origin) Card issued by the Indian High Commission in Mauritius on behalf of the Government of India. One important thing you must bear in mind is that most of the archival documents are dated as from the 19 th century and some of them are in the process of deterioration while a few of them have already been damaged completely. Therefore, in certain cases, some of the information may not be obtained due to these problems. We wish you a marvelous expedition on the search of your ancestors.

There started to be written in human history one of the massive migrations of Indian labour. This marked the beginning of an odyssey across the kalapani , a sad journey of exile across the tempest- tossed ocean. Especially in early days, lured away by recruiters (mestries) to a place known as Mirich Desh which they were made to believe to be Mauritius, a place thought credulously to be north of North India, the coolies blindly accepted to come in their search for greener pasture with the hope to go back to their homeland hereafter. The sea passage lasted for about 30 to 35 days and was an arduous one and there were manifold untold stories of the cruelty, torture and humiliation they had suffered. They had braved the seas and out of this conundrum they have forged fortitude, and a sense of comradeship and brotherhood known as jehajibhai . But the indomitable souls of the coolies remained unshakeable. They have carried with them their unwavering Indianness. They kept their culture deeply buried in their souls no matter what hardship they endured. The stories of the coolies are written with their blood, sweat and tears. They have watered the soil of Mauritius to metamorphose it into paradise. The great majority of these coolies were country folk and they had left behind their villages for the first time. On their sea voyage, they weathered many a storm: home sickness, sea sickness, food, water, living space and outbreak of epidemic. In the early days of indentured labour, the sea captain, committed many irregularities in the records like age, caste and the deceased ones were replaced by others during period of embarkation. Most of them had to use thumb signature. The death toll was about 7% due to diseases and some committed suicide. During the journey, the sanitary conditions were neglected. They were shipped like animals. The most daring rebelled against the prevailing conditions when their womenfolk were ill-treated, when living conditions were beyond human endurance. On the 18th April 1874, coolies aboard the Allum Ghir under the leadership of one Balgobin refused to go up the deck as food not meant for human consumption was thrown to them and a handful called upon their shipmates to remain below decks as a sign of protest. The rebellion was quelled down with utmost savagery and the ringleaders were handcuffed and punished mercilessly. Many voices made themselves heard during the sea journeys in spite of brutal repression during the first waves of indentured labour. The road to Aapravasi Ghat was strewn with hardships. When the coolies set foot on the stony steps of Aapravasi Ghat, little did they realize the life of misery, deprivation and alienation awaiting them in the camps sucriers . Uprooted from their cultural environment, they were coerced to work day and night for a mere pittance in a feudal society and if ever they fell sick their salary was systematically curtailed. At times, they had to work without any salary. They longed for the days to return homeland (Bharat ) which they had not banished from their souls but it was a dream left unfulfilled. Their only consolation was to see their coming generations climb the social ladder: the sons of Girmitya . From thatched settlements to palatial residences. From coolie to Ministers and Prime Minister. Newsletter No.11 23PROJECTS AND HERITAGE MANAGEMENT AGTF Projects in 2014 Corinne Forest, Head Technical Unit Corinne Forest, Head Technical UnitThe year 2013 has been marked by continuity and progress in our projects. The Conservation Project of the \"old labourers' barracks\" at Trianon is in process. As at now, almost all walls were restored and consolidated. The next step is to define the best option to undertake the restoration of the roofs. To this end, sample testing is currently taking place. Concurrently, the \"old Labourers' Barracks\" have been fully documented. This detailed documentation led to the identification of what we believe is a place of worship in chamber 9. For this reason, the chamber will be kept intact until a specific restoration plan for the chamber is in place. In 2014, the technical team wishes to focus on a development plan for Trianon heritage Site where key questions will be addressed. The objective is to develop a project proposal for the establishment of an exhibition area at Trianon. The ultimate goal is to define how Trianon Heritage Site could be a place of attraction for tourists but also for residents in the area while preserving the site. The AGTF believes that using heritage helps its preservation. However, heritage should be used within a defined framework that retains the authenticity and integrity of the place. A second area of concern is heritage in the buffer zone. The objective in 2014 will be to consolidate our database on Geographical Information System to better manage and valorise heritage in Port Louis. The GIS is a key tool to manage heritage in urban areas in particular when requests need to be addressed promptly with precise information at hand. To document this database further, but not only, the research programme will continue. We will particularly focus on the early years of indenture. This specifically to document further the key position of Mauritius in the history of indenture and the role this colony played after the British chose Mauritius to evaluate the system of indenture. The key role of Mauritius is also a focus for the outreach programme that is implemented at World Heritage Site and in schools. This programme is particularly important when the general perception may see heritage as something immovable and static. Our goal is to organise activities and in particular educational activities that involve children. The children are taking part in specifically designed activities such as ceramic making or lime making so that they can apprehend the process used in the past. Once involved, children get a different approach of the past and can finally figure out what were the traditions and what they were used for and why? This is how we propose to approach the study of our past and revive it through new modes of communication so that this knowledge is passed on from generation to generation. In 2014, our main project - Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre (BRIC) Project - will come to an end. From our point of view, it will be the opportunity to share the results of years of research on indenture and achievements at the AGTF but most important, it will be the first place dedicated to the history and experience of indenture in Mauritius and one of the rare ones in the world. Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre (BRIC) Project The year 2014 marks the opening of the Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre. This project has long been mentioned as a necessity to promote Mauritian heritage and the meaning of the Aapravasi Ghat for Mauritius and also for other countries where the Diaspora of indentured labourers settled. The idea of a museum was first mentioned in 1970s when the question of the future of the former Coolie Ghat or Aapravasi Ghat was debated and in particular, when the conservation of the archives kept at the Aapravasi Ghat were discussed before finally being transferred to the Mahatma Gandhi Institute in 1976. Later, the \"Museum Project\" was discussed again when the Promenade project was devised and implemented in 1996. Although it seems that plans were prepared by a professional Architect, it is only when the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund was created in 2001 that the setting up of a museum became the mandate of a dedicated institution. At the AGTF , this project started in 2011 with the enlistment of the services of a professional team composed of Museologists (AGTF), Historians (UoM and Framingham University, USA), Architects (Morphos Architects Ltd; Land Concept Ltd), Engineers Construction of the boat section in BRIC24Newsletter No.11 PROJECTS AND HERITAGE MANAGEMENT Conservation of the Old labourers Quarters of Trianon Ashvin Nemchand, Research Assistant The \"Old labourers Quarters\" (Trianon barracks), is one of the rare surviving structures in Mauritius which offers an insight into the living conditions of Indian indentured labourers. As such, the \"Old Labourers Quarters\" reflect the knowledge, beliefs and traditions of the diverse and rich cultural background of the indentured labourers who came to Mauritius. It is therefore important to restore and conserve this historic building as it is directly and tangibly linked with the way of life in the sugar camps during and after the indenture period. While restoring and conserving historic buildings, it is essential to preserve the authenticity and integrity of the structure. The main principle in conservation is to respect the use of traditional techniques and materials for restoration. There are mainly three reasons in adopting such techniques. Firstly, the use of repair materials which are the same as the original to provide continuity with the past, secondly, by matching the original materials and techniques, the repair material will age just like the original. Finally, it was found that the use of modern materials along with modern technique could cause serious alterations to the original fabrics of many masonry buildings.Repointing of the joints of the exterior walls of the barracks Repointing of joints is one of the processes described in the conservation project of the Trianon barracks. Repointing is undertaken as a part of the process to restore the ability of the masonry wall to control water ingress and preserve its historical authenticity. In April 2013, raking of the joints of the barracks started. Raking is the process of removing the decayed mortars from the joints of the stones. The mortars are carefully removed with a fine chisel or other implements which fit into the joints to a minimum depth of 25 mm. Raking of the exterior walls of the barracks \u00a9 AGTF(Nuzeebun Project Consultants Ltd; Prodesign Ltd), Quantity Surveyor (Chuttur and Partners Ltd), Graphic Designer (Design Element Ltd), and an Archaeologist (Dr Diego Calaon, Italy). First, the project raised the need to define key concepts and address questions. The main question was what do we want to show at BRIC? What should be the main focus? Considering that Aapravasi Ghat is a World Heritage Site, the focus was naturally put on the experience of INDENTURE in Mauritius and on the reasons why Aapravasi Ghat is so significant for the history of humanity. It was also important to consider WHAT does the public want to know? To this purpose, several audience surveys and feedback from visitors were taken into consideration during the elaboration of the display. In particular, it seemed important to explain where indentured labourers came from and why did they come to Mauritius? The concern of the audience was also on the rights of the indentured labourers and to which extend was an indentured labourer free? The second step was to define HOW should information be presented to the public and what would be the best means of communication / media to convey information? Audience surveys were also used to have an understanding of the visitor expectations. Several working sessions took place to address questions and define concepts: this stage was essential to develop a detailed display plan. Based on the display plan, the design phase started to materialise the proposed concepts into technical and architectural plans. The constant interaction between the team members was essential to come up with final plans for BRIC. After a call for tender, the interior and landscaping works were undertaken as per the plans of the Architects by Ramloll Bhooshan Construction and Renovation Ltd (the selected bidder) from 2nd May to mid-November 2013. Once the interior and landscaping works are completed, the mounting of the exhibition will require three months to be completed. The opening of the Interpretation Centre is scheduled for March 2014. Newsletter No.11 25PROJECTS AND HERITAGE MANAGEMENT After the removal of the decayed mortar, the joints are washed with water to remove any remaining particles. Moreover, when doing the lime pointing, the joints are wetted in order to avoid water suction from the mortar. While carrying out the lime pointing works, it is important that the mortar be fully pushed and filled inside the joints to avoid air gaps. After the pointing has been completed, the repointed areas are sprayed with water during the setting time to prevent the finished work from drying out too quickly. Repointed walls of the barracks \u00a9 AGTF Repointing of the exterior wall \u00a9 AGTF Spraying water on repointed joints \u00a9 AGTFThe raking and repointing process on the exterior walls of the Trianon barracks started in the April 2013 and was completed in July 2013. Presently, the interior walls of the first 6 chambers are being documented and the algae growth is being treated before the removal of the dead mortar and pointing of the interior walls. The Trianon barracks provide insights into the traditional knowledge of past artisans who built these buildings. In a few years, it is planned to include Trianon Heritage Site in the heritage trail on indentured labour among Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site and the Vagrant Depot. 26Newsletter No.11 PROJECTS AND HERITAGE MANAGEMENT Adapting historical buildings for modern use Natasha Kheddoo-Ramcharitar, Research Assistant Surrounded by historical structures built during the French and British periods, the city of Port Louis has seen its environs transformed from an old to a modern urban area. Unfortunately, modernisation also led to the destruction of many of these historical buildings. As a result, only few old structures have survived today. Considering that it is the capital city of Mauritius, Port Louis has been the place where significant development has occurred. This development has materialized into modern buildings with new designs that sometimes detract from the traditional style of the city. For some, investing in our past to build our future can be more profitable than spending on new buildings. For example, old structures can be reused for commercial activities. This is called \"Adaptive reuse\" when an old building is converted from its original use to another. Adaptive reuse gives life to a site, rather than keeping it unused or opting for its demolition. It is generally accepted that using heritage buildings allow their long term preservation as opposed to discouraging their use. It is considered that successful adaptive reuse projects are the ones which best respect and preserve the building's heritage significance and that add a contemporary layer providing additional value for future use. Sometimes, adaptive reuse is the only way that a building's fabric can be properly cared for and interpreted, while making better use of the building itself. Generally, when a building can no longer serve its original purpose, a new use through adaption may be the only way to preserve its heritage significance.The Buffer Zones of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Property include many historic structures that were identified during the cataloguing and documentation process initiated in 2006. Since then, it is noted that the demolition of old buildings is still a reality. According to the owners, these old buildings were not profitable for their business as there were too many maintenance problems such as leakage, insufficient space to run their daily commerce, high cost implication for maintenance and difficulty to obtain insurance from insurance companies. In order to enhance the traditional style of Port Louis, the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund prepared a Planning Policy Guidance (PPG6) for the buffer zones which was approved in June 2011. This PPG provides also measures to halt demolition and guide development towards the reuse of Port Louis's traditional style for both old and new buildings. The objective is to encourage architectural harmony in the buffer zones. The trend to rehabilitate the original style of Port Louis stated in this planning document was followed by some promoters who have shown keen interest to reuse the old buildings for their daily activities. We have noted recently the development of several projects that show good examples in the area. One recent example of an adaptive reuse in the Buffer Zone of the AGWHP is the Bramer Bank situated at Place d'Armes. Built during the 1830's by private companies, the building was used for retail purpose. Restoration work of the building was initiated some three years back and was opened to public this year offering banking facilities.

The publication entitled \"Gokoola: Family, Temple and village, by the Banian Tree we Stand\", co-authored by V .Govinden of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute and Dr. Marina Carter of the United Kingdom, was launched in December 2012 in Gokoola village. The book relates the life of Immigrant Gokoola who arrived in Mauritius as an Indian Indentured Labourer in 1841. As a Sirdar, job contractor, land owner and land speculator in the north of the Island, he played a very important role in the establishment of Gokoola Temple and the village which bears his name. This event also marks the 166 th anniversary of the arrival of immigrant Gokoola in Mauritius and the 145 th anniversary of the erection of the Hindu Temple of the Village. The Gokoola temple is among the first Hindu temples built during British period. Another publication launched this year is \"Angaje: Explorations into the History, Society and Culture of Indentured Immigrants and their Descendants in Mauritius\". It was launched in April 2013 at the Subramanium Hall, Mahatma Gandhi Institute, Moka. The publication is composed of articles divided in 3 volumes: volume 1 focusses on the early years of indenture, volume 2 provides insights into the indenture period and experience and volume 3 explains the legacy of indenture in our society today. The objective of this publication was to encourage the new generation to research and to write about Indentured Labourers in Mauritius and elsewhere and also to provide the latest state of multi-disciplinary research on indenture labour. Through this publication, the AGTF is fulfilling the objectives of its Act, its management plan and the recommendations of UNESCO's World Heritage Committee with regards to research on Indenture. The books also tell us about the transition from slavery to indenture and the diversity of the Indentured population. The immigrants and their descendants struggled for their social and economic mobility and for a better tomorrow for themselves and their children. They became small planters, Cultivators, Shopkeepers, Sirdars, Job contractors, Businessmen, Lawyers, Doctors, Scholars, Politicians, Pundits and Notables and at the same time, they reproduced their cultural traditions in Mauritius. Mr. Moussa I. Rawat, Chairman of Bramer Corporation Ltd and Director of Bramer Banking Corporation Ltd, explains: \"Bramer Corporation's growth philosophy adheres to the principle of respect of all regulations inclusive of building regulations and the promotion of sustainable development and architecture. We decided to make our contribution to the rich Mauritian architecture legacy by keeping the exterior and the interior of the building as close to what existed already. The preservation of our heritage is priceless and we believe that we have succeeded. We invite the Public and other Port Louis land and building owners to visit our headquarters so that they can experience the fact that preservation and modernization can be symbiotic.\" A similar example of adaptive reuse in the Buffer Zone is the Joonas & Co Ltd building located at corner Louis Pasteur Street and Royal Street. Restoration of the building was carried out before the proclamation of the PPG6. The building has been well restored and currently operates as showroom for tiles and sanitary wares. The Joonas building has definitely added value to the area and has encouraged other promoters to invest in rehabilitation projects. Similarly, the Currimjee building located on the opposite of the Joonas building is at present undergoing restoration work. The building was constructed during the 1880's and was unused for more than 10 years. Listed as a Grade 1 building (equivalent to National Heritage), the structure was under major threat and was in need of urgent repair.The building was then acquired by Currimjee Jeewanjee & Co Ltd who took the initiative to restore it and to convert it into office space. Today, development projects for adaptive reuse are not only limited to the Buffer Zone. Promoters who believe in heritage rehabilitation are now investing in old buildings located in other commercial areas of Port Louis. The building occupying the Nando's restaurant situated at Sir William Newton Street is one such good example. Adaptive reuse has the potential to add value to the buffer zones and revive the historic centre of Port Louis that was, in the early days, a cultural and lively city. 28Newsletter No.11 PROJECTS AND HERITAGE MANAGEMENT Catherine Chane-Kune, directrice de la culture (DCS) au Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vill\u00e8le et du Grande \u00e0 la R\u00e9union.

En septembre un documentaire produit par le centre et relatant \u00e0 Perrine, Boodhoo, Chairperson of Bhojpuri Speaking UnionA Unique Genre brought by Indentured Immigrants from the Bhojpuri Belt of India and developed on Mauritian Soil The Gammat Music is a style of singing that takes its origin from the Bhojpuri Belt of Bihar and UP in India. This tradition of singing has been transmitted by the Girmitias , the indentured immigrants who crossed the Kala Pani to come to Mauritius as from 2nd November 1834. It is one of the richest forms of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Mauritius. Over the years, the Gammat developed its own unique style proper to Mauritius. This style of singing is also prevalent in South Africa, Fiji, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname where it has evolved in variant forms. In Suriname, it is known as Baithak Gana. However, there is a common thread that runs through all of them in the manner and style the songs are sung, in their rhythm, tempo and tunes. They have also been taken to Holland by third waves of migrants from Suriname to Holland, like Moti Mahre, to USA and Canada by singers of the Caribbean Countries, to England and France by Mauritian singers like Shashi Sohadeb. L'Accroche In Mauritius, or jugal bandi / sawal - jawab setting, where two groups of singers and their accompanists face each other on the stage in a lyrical duel. These singers compose their own songs and engage in a musical question and answer genre on the spot. The singers challenge each other and have to be adept and resourceful. They draw their inspiration and ideas from the Hindu Scriptures such as the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, Gita, Satyarth Prakash and works of various saints like Kabir. They also base their composition on day -to-day life, eternal values, nature, and life in general and societal happenings. The singers need a good command of Hindi and Bhojpuri. Many singers resort to a Guru to polish their lyrics or to compose their morceaux. Gammat has a great hold on the audience: it has an electrifying impact. The Gammat singer plays his own harmonium and chimta, Sona Noyan who passed away on February 8th this year at the age of 67 is accredited to be the king of Gammat because of his unique style of singing, the vibrancy of his lyrics and tunes that he developed over five decades. He has left behind a rich legacy of innumerable memorable songs. The Bhojpuri Speaking Union under the aegis of the Ministry of Arts and Culture paid a vibrant homage to Sona Noyan on May 31 this year at a Shradhanjali Gammat night at his native village Trois Bras, Petit Raffray. On this occasion, his wife Deoranee Etwarea, lifelong companion in his musical journey was honored with a shawl and a trophy for his lifelong achievement. The street where stands his house has also been named Sona Noyan Gali to pay tribute to this great Bhojpuri Singer. Sona Noyan has entered l'accroche with his formidable 'opponents' or challengers such as veteran singers like Basant Soopaul, Roi du Sud of Riviere des Creoles, of Tranquebar. Style of Singing A style very much particular to Sona Noyan is that of throwing back his hair kept deliberately long which would fall on his face again and again, as he played his harmonium in that slanted position and sang in that throaty voice of his which would set ablaze, in frenzy his mesmerized fans. Sona Noyan could hold his audience spellbound for the whole night. It is to be noted that the Government of Mauritius has included the Gammat genre of singing as an important aspect of the intangible cultural heritage of the country in the inventory and nomination dossier sent to UNESCO. As a safeguarding measure against threats by modernity and DJ culture, the Bhojpuri Speaking Union has undertaken among its activities to promote, propagate and encourage the Gammat style of singing among the younger generation of singers. We give for the benefit of readers a rendering of Sona Noyan's most famous and prized song (MBC Bhojpuri Bahar TV competition of 1996) - Khale Pile and a translation in English by the author - Dr. (Mrs.) Sarita Boodhoo. 32Newsletter No.11 ANTHROPOLOGY Geet Gawai An invaluable piece of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indian Indentured labourers Khale Pile Bhojpuri Version English Version Zindagi mein What is there in life Han Zindagi mein kaba Yes, what is there in life Khale pile jile bhaiya Eat, drink, live o brother Zindagi mein ka ba What is there in life Gharwa duwarwa Your house, Your belongings Sab haije rahjala All will be left behind Char din ke chandini ba The moonlight lasts for four days Phir andheri raat ba There after follows the dark night Hathi aur ghora Your elephants, your horses Sab haije rahjala All will be left behind Khali hath jala All will depart empty handed Sab duniya se baba From this world, O Man Ik din ba aana ho to (If it is written) that you will come Ek din ba jana one day Para pari sab jala Then for sure, you will depart one day Aague piche sabjala By turn, everybody will have to go Koyi na rahalba Some today, some tomorrow No one has come to stay (for good) Khale pile jile bhaiya Eat, drink, live o brother Zindagi mein ka ba What is there in life Zindagi mein kaba What is there in life Han Zindagi mein kaba Yes, what is there in life Khale pile jile bhaiya Eat, drink, live o brother Kiran Chuttoo-Jankee, Research Assistant Geet gawai is one of the practices identified as a legacy of indenture in Mauritian society. Generally when people talk of geet gawai they refer to the rituals, songs and dance performed as part of the Hindu wedding ceremony. However, this term is not only limited to the famous Friday night rituals and celebrations but it includes all the songs and dances performed during rites of passages starting from birth to death. Moreover, it was also part of daily routine life. For instance, Geet gawai which literally means singing was also done while grinding grains and spices, while children were playing or were simply in the form of lullabies to sleep babies and children. It has many tangible elements associated with it. It a tradition that migrated to our island together with Birth ritual- 'Jeera Jawaine' song. Source: AGTF Photo Indian immigrants that came as indentured labourers and also as traders or for other purposes. Performed during rites of passage, Geet Gawai is a combination of social practices, rituals, music- both vocal and instrumental, dance and drama. It is also an embodiment of knowledge, know-how, skills and practices developed by its bearers. It displays the community's ways of thinking and beliefs through the Bhojpuri language and Oral traditions. It is a way of life rather than just performance. Without it the practitioners cannot perform any rite of passage, ritual, traditional healing system, social organisation or festival. However, there are particular persons traditionally associated with Geet Gawai and there are specific persons associated with each aspect of the social practice or ritual. Some of them only men perform (sabad and baharya puja for instance) and others only women (lalna, harparawri, jantsar etc). The first bearers of the Geet Gawai tradition arrived in Mauritius in the 19th Century. Those families continued their tradition and its transmission through word of mouth whether it is playing of instruments, dance, music, craftsmanship, rites or rituals. With the evolution of environment, influence of other cultures and change in time and space, this element underwent lots of transformations. For instance, women no more sing and dance during weddings in the confined rooms where men are not allowed; today gents are invited to join in. Work songs like jantsar are no more practised since grinding mills have been replaced by electric grinders. New musical instruments have been introduced in addition to the traditional instruments to create music. Large variety of entertainment through technology and media led new generations to slow down interest in this element of heritage which resulted in scarcity of practitioners. Nevertheless, the demand for Geet Gawai is quite high mainly during birth ceremonies, weddings and funeral ceremonies (for Ramayan chanting and sabad). Sabad is sung during funeral ceremonies and according to surveys done in the Oral History and Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage projects carried out by the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund, there are hardly two groups that sing sabad in Mauritius and the presence of these groups are highly solicited. The practitioners have seized the opportunity to commercialise it in the sense that people have to pay groups of practitioners to perform Geet Gawai during rites of passages. Also, Compact Disks have been introduced by tradition bearers, singers and musicians. Therefore, though in its evolved way, even today, Geet Gawai is practised throughout the country among diverse groups of the Mauritian people. The bearers of this element are committed to develop, preserve and promote Geet Gawai in Mauritius. It has an inseparable connection with the descendants of Indian immigrants in the country. There is today the need to preserve the essential parts of the ancient forms of Geet Gawai so that it does not lose its authenticity. The Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund inscribed under criterion VI on the World Heritage List which refers to the Intangible cultural heritage is fully engaged in the identification and promotion of all the Intangible Cultural Heritage related to indenture. The AGTF embarked on an Inventory of elements of intangible heritage related to Indenture that was partly funded by UNESCO in March 2010 to identify, safeguard and promote intangible cultural heritage with a view to proposing elements for inscription. Irrespective of domains (i.e. oral traditions and expressions, performing arts, social practices, rituals and festive events, knowledge and practices, or traditional craftsmanship), the project inventoried some 70 elements of Intangible Cultural Heritage related to the indenture labour system. Beyond the inventory, the activities carried out by the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund to highlight Intangible Cultural Heritage are as follows: Living exhibitions organised yearly, the \" Varshik Parampara Utsav\" in which young and old generations present folk songs and dances and in which traditional game players and craftsmen are invited to present their knowhow and share traditional delicacies; A three-day workshop, \"Bhojpuri at the crossroads,\" also organized by the Trust Fund's Oral History Unit at the University of Mauritius in July, 2010; An audio CD of birth songs from Mauritius and India, sung in Bhojpuri and called Sohar, or Intangible Heritage (released in November, 2010, it is the first in a series that the Trust Fund intends to publish; Sabad- sung during funeral ceremony Source: AGTF Photo Collection.34Newsletter No.11 ANTHROPOLOGY Launching of E-book of tales from Mauritius in English, French, Creole and Bhojpuri by the Prime Minister Dr Navin Ramgoolam in 2011; The presentation of a replica of an Indenture Village in November 2012.

The AGTF collaborated with the NHF and MAC in the preparation of nomination dossiers of Geet Gawai that has been sent to UNESCO for possible inscription on the Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This element is not only an invaluable piece of Intangible Heritage but is also an important social medium for communication among family members who get together and exchange meaningful and emotional moments. It leads to intra-community interaction and cohesion by spreading the message of peace and harmonious living in society at large. Rasam and Sagoo Aartee Pydatalli, Field Guide More than 90 percent of indentured labourers who came to Mauritius were of Indian origin.

Kathleen.hrrington-watt@pg.canterbury.ac.nz The Indentured Labour photographic portraits were originally created as a tool to identify and consequently control the indentured labour population in Mauritius, however today they are something much more in the lives of Mauritian people. My research understands photographs to be more than an image that records a moment in time or identifies a subject. Photographs can also be objects that both inform and perform social functions. They help to tell us about the life and times of the people being photographed and they can also tell us about the intentions and perspectives of the photographer taking the image. Ultimately, photographs are made for an audience and therefore the experience of those that view them is integral to their function. Therefore, photographs have complex social relationships with the people who engage with them and these relationships shift and change over time and in different contexts. My research is concerned with the social significance of these photographs and the changes they have been through over time. Today, the Indentured Labour portraits found in the MGI photographic archives (PG archives) are often displayed on the covers of books, magazines and whenever the topic of indenture is discussed. These images are often referred to in context of the information that is attached to them: the name of the person; where they originated from; the port they departed from and when they arrived; on what ship they arrived on; their age; their marriage status; their caste; their height; where they worked, and finally, the all-important 6-digit immigration number. Although these portraits are strongly embedded within this historical data and text, it is important to recognize that as photographic images, they are remarkable in their own right. Within the world's history of photography, these particular images mark the beginning of the photographic portrait as a form of identification. Today, this method is still used in identification systems around the globe. The scale of the photographic processes embarked upon by the British administrators, and the production of so many images can only be described as an extraordinary endeavour. The quality of the images produced at this time is commendable given that photography as a technology was still in its infancy in the mid 1800's. The images produced are extraordinary due to the skilful use of light and pose: as a result, the facial features, clothes, hair, jewellery, personal bearing and expression can be clearly determined by the viewer. Ironically, these photographs, though produced in the context of surveillance and control, Portrait of Chinna Sunnaisee (name as per record) taken in 1875 after arrival in Mauritius at the age of 6. Source: Photograph courtesy of Sunnassee family36Newsletter No.11 ANTHROPOLOGY can be described today as aesthetically appealing, or beautiful. Perhaps the most remarkable point about these images is the resilience of these photographic archives (as well as the other archives), considering their neglect and lack of conservation until the 1970's when their immense historical significance was first recognised. Thankfully a large amount of the original photographic portraits have remained intact. Even though the photographic paper and processing chemicals used at the time of creation can easily become unstable when exposed to light, heat, humidity and pollution the photographs have survived! It could be said that the photographic portraits mirror the resilience and persistence of the indentured labourers themselves. From a post-colonial perspective, these photographs represent the use of the photographic image as a tool for control and dominance by the colonizers, reflecting similar stories of photography and its use throughout the colonial era in colonies around the world. However, overtime, the agency (force) of these photographic portraits has changed. They are now viewed as Mauritian national treasures in academic, social and political spheres, and in family and individual worlds they are perceived as significant objects. When people are seeking information about their ancestor's arrival in Mauritius, they not only hope to find information, they also hope to find a photograph of their ancestor. Unfortunately, not all persons will find their ancestral photograph. Their ancestor may have arrived prior to the photographic identification system being established, or their ancestor's image may have been amongst the lost and damaged ledgers that fell victim to neglect and deterioration before the archives came under the protection and conservation of the National Archives in 1975. When ancestor photographs such as the photograph of Chinna Sunnaisee (above) are found and viewed by their descendants, they stir up feelings and thoughts that often surprise them. The descendant often feels a personal connection with their ancestor; they finally have a face, a person to directly relate to. At times when viewing the image, they feel overwhelmed with emotions that are hard to put into words. When the photograph is of a child, strong emotions of sympathy, sorrow and wonder are experienced. The photograph encourages the descendent to reflect on the stories they have been told about their ancestors and the struggles they faced. They consider the benefits they experience today as an outcome of their ancestors' trials and tribulations. When looking at their ancestor, they also search for physical resemblances. They spend time looking at their clothes; jewellery; hair; skin and facial features and contemplate the expression on their ancestors' face. After viewing the photograph, the descendent sometimes comments that their preconception of their ancestor and indentured labour has changed. They previously thought about their ancestor/s as poor, weak and powerless, however, after viewing the photograph they see them as: dignified, strong and determined. After obtaining the photograph from the MGI archives, the descendant takes a copy of their ancestor's photograph home. The photograph is often stored safely in a file with other important documents and or framed and displayed amongst other family images in the home. They may also be included in ancestral ceremonies and religious rituals. More recently with the digitisation of the photographs, the images are now in digital form and will now reside in their descendants personal computers. This transferring of the ancestor's image from the archives into the home of their descendants begins a new phase and journey in the life of the photographic image. As can be seen, the context of the photograph continues to change overtime, as it moves from the archive to the home or into the public eye through publications and exhibitions. With each shift, the photograph changes meaning and significance. It is no longer an item in a ledger; it has transformed overtime into a highly significant object in the social lives of its descendants, a Mauritian treasure. So far, this research has uncovered many ideas and insights regarding the significance of these photographs in Mauritius, further research will hopefully continue to broaden our understanding of these images and their complex social life. Thank you, to all those people who have already shared their precious stories and images with me. I would be happy to meet with anyone who has already obtained their ancestral photograph or who would like to find their ancestral photograph.

In my keynote address, I indicated new research possibilities in post-hybridity paradigms. German theorists, indeed, felt the need to go beyond the categorization of post-colonial hybridity and explore innovative theories and visions. It is well established that after the seminal Orientalism written by Edward Said, who pioneered research in post-colonial studies, also favoured by Indian writers who wanted to forsake colonial stereotypes, hybrid theories flourished, to challenge eurocentric visions of the world. There was a void in the wake of decolonization and emerging voices in Literature and identity visions. Post colonialism became the new horizon of university studies across the globe, with its promises and pitfalls as hybridity, dualistic in nature, can also mean a devalued entity in the relation with the other. This concept was therefore under close scrutiny during this symposium under the helm of Professor Ottmar Ette, a renowned German thinker. He was the one who invited the poetics of coolitude to Berlin 2 years ago. The German thinkers and theorists found that the indentured period, and the way it was developed in coolitude, an interesting perspective to understand a globalised world and question hybridity as a means of addressing complexity. It is now undebatable that coolitude offers a migrational problematics still under way, with modern migrants. It delineates how they negotiate their presence in a foreign land or in a space of cultural complexity. In this vision of the world, the diversity of India is articulated with the human diversities of the world through the judicial status conferred on the coolie or indentured, by way of his/her contract, after the abolition of slavery. Instead of framing this historic episode as an essentialist trope, coolitude envisaged a humanistic approach which initiated the first discourse between the descents of slavery and the indentured, a perspective much favoured by UNESCO. More will come from this very fecund meeting in Germany. UNESCO sites and \"cultural security debates\" in Morocco In the last Assilah Forum in July 2013, Morocco, I was invited to speak about \"cultural security\", more specifically, I was engaged in a debate regarding the role of UNESCO sites in preserving heritage and the memories of populations; and how to use them to guarantee this cultural security. I reminded Mr Mohamed Benaissa, former External Minister of Foreign Affairs of Morocco and the organiser of the paramount forum of Assilah, one of the most important in the world, about the History of Mauritius, with its multifarious waves of migrations. He found this situation quite akin to the one prevailing in his own country, where there is much cultural and ethnic diversity. A steam ship anchored at Trou Fanfaron in 1910.

An audience survey sheet has been designed to gather this information. The Outreach calendar is planned in respect of zone, institution, association, district, and age group. The total number of audience from January till August 2013 is approximately 4100. The 4 zones were targeted which consisted of 26 schools (comprising of State, Private Aided, and Private Unaided) and 8 associations of different age group from different districts.The Outreach Programme consists of: A Power Point Presentation A short film on Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Property Interaction with the audience Quiz Pedagogical activities for children such as Puzzle, 'atelier Ceramic', Quiz and Story Telling The Outreach Programme is a key component of the future Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre. At the round table, we had the exceptional contributions of Mr Mounir Bouchenaki, Special adviser to Mrs Irina Boukova, Director General of UNESCO, who spoke about remarkable experience about UNESCO sites in conflicts and their possibilities of reconciliation. For instance, Mr Bouchenaki, who was personally in charge of several missions for UNESCO, among which, the appraisal of the situation in Kosovo, Irak and Afghanistan, highlighted the issue of heritage sites which can get entangled in political and ideological manipulations. He gave the example of the bridge of Mostar, which was gunned down, even if it was not a military target. The idea behind its destruction was that it was a link between the Christians and Muslims, and by bringing it down, it meant those two segments of the population were trapped in an ethnic conflict most of them did not want. I spoke about the role of the Aapravasi (ex-Coolie) Ghat in the building of a national identity in Mauritius, especially from the angle of the humanism of diversity coolitude entails. I reminded that the spirit prevailing over the classification of the Ghat. Indeed, the Ghat bears a great symbolical significance, and as such, was thought as a catalyst to favour nation building in Mauritius. Coolitude allowed to prevent a competition of memories, as was underlined in his November 2011 speech by Dr. Navin Ramgoolam. The Prime Minister stressed the fact that this Humanism of Diversity allows the Nation to develop a dialogue between the descents of indentured and slavery in Mauritius. He was well aware of this necessity, as my recommendations were also taken into account in the Steering committees of the Justice and Truth Commission. By reminding that Mauritius has two UNESCO sites, one dedicated to resistance to slavery and the other to indentured, I brought to mind that this situation was unique in the world, as clearly, UNESCO intended to appraise the dialogue in the Humanism of diversity propounded by coolitude in a view of broadening our negotiations of cultures, identities and enriching humanities at large. The sites (Le Morne and the Aapravasi Ghat) in Mauritius are thus possible instruments to promote better understanding between human groups and contribute to a higher level of cultural security for Mauritius.Abdul Karim Siddhi, indentured worker from India.

The following activities were proposed: Guided visit of Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Property Story Telling Educational activities on: Traditional techniques of Construction Making ceramics. Puzzle programme in the Interpretation Centre. To this end, a new activity was elaborated and evaluated before its inclusion in the programme. The new activity is called \"The development of ceramics\" and aims at explaining how ceramics was initially developed in early civilizations and how it spread around the world in the 19 th Century. This is in connection with the artefacts that will be presented in the Interpretation Centre and directly in line with the discoveries made during the excavations in 2011, 2012 and 2013 at BRIC. The Heritage Guide/Public Outreach Officers's role is to explain to the young audience the evolution of pottery and relate it to the lives of our ancestors. In practice, children are invited to make their own ceramic with a lump of clay. They are shown the ancient technique used to make ceramics in the Neolithic period. They use this technical guidance to shape a pot. The evaluation of the activity showed that they were entirely involved in the activity. Parents also showed keen interest in participating. During the activity, satisfaction survey was undertaken to support the evaluation of the activity. The analysis of the qualitative surveys revealed that the testing of 'Ceramics' was a success. Parents stated that the activity with 'Ceramics' was a learning experience through entertainment exploration, mental stimulation and excitement for their children. Through this educational activity, children learnt something new and also different from the usual academic knowledge. Hence, the evaluation showed that the activity was a means to enhance visitor experience. The survey revealed that the large majority of visitors were satisfied with the activity. Therefore with the upcoming Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre (BRIC), the AGTF hopes to implement this educational activity on 'Ceramics' and further contribute to the understanding and promotion of our history and heritage by the younger generation.

The objective is to foster understanding of the evolution of WHS and to attract new and regular visitors. There was also a need to develop further educational activities as part of the public 44Newsletter No.11 EVENTS AND OUTREACH Urmila Ramkissoon and Vedita Jha, Heritage guides/Public Outreach Officers According the Management Plan (2013-2018) of the AGTF , \"the education and dissemination program is a key to further communication and promote the outstanding Universal Value of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Property\". In this context, on the 7 th of May 2013, the outreach officers of the AGTF participated in a conference held at the St Esprit College of Black River. The conference had for theme \"The Mauritian Culture\". The conference was organised by the \"A\" level students of Travel and Tourism of the St Esprit College. They had a course work project which involves planning and managing a travel and tourism event which they subsequently transformed into a platform to discuss and present the Mauritian culture in general. In this line of thought, the conference saw the participation of different stakeholders, like the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund, the Nelson Mandela Centre for African Culture and the National Heritage Fund, which are responsible for the safeguarding and promoting of the cultural heritage of the cosmopolite country which is Mauritius. During the conference, the outreach officers of the AGTF gave an introduction to the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Property and presented a virtual visit of the site. The objectives of this presentation were: To promote and create awareness about the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site and other sites related to indenture; To disseminate and educate people on the indentured system thus enabling the audience to have a better understanding and appreciation of our past; To create awareness about heritage and the need to preserve it; To promote heritage and encourage visitation and discoveries of same. During the presentation, the outreach officers laid emphasis on the system of indenture and an attempt was made to relate it in a broader context to the Mauritian culture.

We had two key note speakers for the conference. The first one was Stephen Small, who advocated to study the subject on the basis of a theory. The tile of his paper was: \"There's Nothing as Practical as a Good Theory: Free and Unfree labour Across the Atlantic\". The second key note speech was from Vijaya Teelock from Mauritius. Het title was: \"The Mauritius Justice Commission concerning Indentured Labour: the missed opportunity?\". The purpose of this last speech was to see of other countries can learn something from the Mauritius experience. Aim of the conference The aim of the conference was to connect historical specificities of slavery, indentured labour and migration to contemporary issues of globalisation, Diaspora, identity formation, nationalism and transnationalism. A second aim of the organisers was to promote new perspectives and approaches in the study of forced and free migration and their impact on the society. By bringing scholars together from various parts of the world - senior scholars as well as new promising talents - they wanted to stimulate exchange of ideas, set up new networks and strengthen existing ones. The central theme was: Linking slavery, indentured labour and migration to contemporary issues. Some questions to be answered during the conference were: What are the legacies of slavery and indentured labour in social, economic, cultural, political fields? How did post-slavery identity formation occur in different parts of the world in general? What has been the psychological impact of slavery and indentured labour?How are transnational identities developing in the world of today?How is the process of identification related to the imaginary relation with the country of origin and with other \"partners in distress\" in the Diaspora? In the case of the second migration or the twice Diaspora, what is perceived as country of origin, in other words: What kind of home land perspectives do people have and which impact will this have on their relation with the former homeland? In which ways did the various groups adapt to the new environment? What has been the policy or attitude of the receiving countries or societies? Opening Session with two cabinet Ministers and members of diplomatic corps.46Newsletter No.11 EVENTS AND OUTREACH How are localizing processes ('creolization') expressed in migrant cultures?

How are transnational ties and identities recognised and institutionalised by the State in the former homelands? What has been the policy of the countries of origin regarding their former citizens living in Diaspora?How and why are local processes of identity formation related to emotional and practical identification to the countries of origin, and how do these countries feature in these processes? Which are the social, economic, cultural and political consequences of migration and Diaspora in modern times? Some themes suggested by the organisers were: The legacy of slavery and indentured labour: historical and current developments, with special reference to the psychological legacy of slavery and indentured labour: historical and current developments.

During his stay, the public was invited to a presentation on his latest research forming part of his forthcoming publication on the slave trade in the Indian Ocean. His presentation provided an overview of British, Dutch, French, and Portuguese slave trading in the Indian Ocean between 1500-1850. In addition to outlining the general features of this activity, including the number of slaves traded by Europeans during this period, the presentation argued that the late 18th and early 19th centuries witnessed the development of an increasingly connected movement of slave, convict, and indentured labor within and ultimately beyond the confines of the Indian Ocean basin. Dr Krish Seetah, Archaeologist from the University of Stanford, USA, gave a talk at the AGTF on the archaeological research conducted in Mauritius. The objective of his talk was to explain how archaeology could contribute to the understanding and documentation of the indenture period. Recent research in Bois Marchand or Trianon have shown the need to apprehend research on indenture on a global scale. He reminded that research on these sites need to be contextualised within a global perspective to reveal the significance of indentured sites in the local and international contexts.Lecture and Presentation at AGTF The visit of his Excellency Pranab Mukherjee the President of the Republic of India on 12 March 2013 \" The visit to this historic Heritage site of Aapravasi Ghat, where brave men and women from India and other shores first set foot in Mauritius when they arrived here more than 175 years ago, would remain etched in my memory.
