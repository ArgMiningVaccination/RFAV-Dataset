For more information on the entire ETS please see the extended set of [ETS FAQs]. September 22, 2022 Please note: [Footnotes](#updates) describing the updates to these FAQs can be found at the bottom of this webpage. Background - Q: Why did Cal/OSHA propose revising the COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards? A: Cal/OSHA proposed revisions to the COVID-19 emergency temporary standards (ETS) in light of updated guidance from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and to make the ETS more flexible if changes are made to CDPH guidance in the future. - Q: What is the status of the ETS? A: The following are the effective dates of the ETS: - Original ETS: November 30, 2020. - First re-adoption: June 17, 2021. - Second re-adoption: January 14, 2022. - Third re-adoption: May 6, 2022. - Q: What are the effective dates of this version of the ETS? A: This latest ETS update is effective from May 6, 2022 through December 31. 2022. What Changed - Q: What are the important changes in the May 6, 2022 revised ETS? A: The important changes include the following: - Definitions. Some of the definitions in the ETS were revised. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 3205(b)) - The definitions of \"close contact\" and \"infectious period\" are now defined so that their meaning will change if CDPH changes its definition of the term in a regulation or order. This will allow more flexibility and consistency with CDPH. - The definition of \"COVID-19 test\" was simplified to make it easier to use self-administered and self-read tests. A video or observation of the entire test process is no longer necessary; just a date/time-stamped photo of the test result will now be sufficient. - The definition of \"fully vaccinated\" was deleted as this term is no longer used in the regulations. All protections now apply regardless of vaccination status and ETS requirements do not vary based on an employee's vaccination status. - Face Coverings. Changes were made to face covering requirements (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 3205(c)(6) - Face coverings requirements are the same for all employees regardless of vaccination status. - Face coverings are no longer mandatory for unvaccinated workers in all indoor locations. - Face coverings are mandatory in the ETS when CDPH requires their use, which currently includes the following indoor settings, regardless of vaccination status (this list will change if CDPH changes their requirements): - Emergency shelters - Cooling and heating centers - Healthcare settings - Correctional facilities and detention centers - Homeless shelters - Long term care settings & adult and senior care facilities - Cleaning and disinfecting requirements were deleted (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 3205(c)(7)) - Respirators must be provided for voluntary use to employees who request them and who work indoors or in vehicles with other persons. This now applies to all employees where previously it only applied to unvaccinated employees. This is consistent with changes made throughout the regulation to provide the same protections to all employees regardless of vaccination status (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 3205(c)(7)(C)). - COVID-19 testing must be made available to all employees with COVID-19 symptoms. As with respirators, this now applies to all employees regardless of vaccination status whereas previously it only applied to unvaccinated employees (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 3205(c)(7)(D)). - Exclusion of employees who had close contact. The detailed prescriptive requirements for exclusion of employees after close contact have been deleted. Instead, employers must review [CPDH guidelines](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx')for employees who had close contact and implement quarantine and other measures in the workplace to prevent COVID-19 transmission in the workplace. This allows for greater flexibility in the regulations (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 3205(c)(9)). For more information, please refer to the section on [CDPH's Isolation and Quarantine Guidance](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#iso)in the [general FAQs](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html), and to [Cal/OSHA's fact sheet on quarantine and isolation](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/Isolation-and-Quarantine-fs.pdf). - Exclusion of employees with COVID-19. The requirements for employees who test positive for COVID-19 have been updated to reflect the most recent June 9, 2022 [CDPH Isolation and Quarantine Guidance](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#iso). Regardless of vaccination status, employees who test positive can return to work after 5 days if the employee has a negative test, symptoms are improving, and they wear a face covering at work for an additional 5 days. Otherwise most employees can return after 10 days. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 3205(c)(10)). For more information, please refer to the section on [CDPH's Isolation and Quarantine Guidance](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#iso)in the [general FAQs](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html), and to [Cal/OSHA's fact sheet on quarantine and isolation](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/Isolation-and-Quarantine-fs.pdf). - Outbreaks - Testing and Exclusion.
