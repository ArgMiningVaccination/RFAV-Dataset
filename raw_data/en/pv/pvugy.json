This label expansion is based on Allergan and another manufacturer selectively waiving orphan exclusivity marketing rights each company held for the use of their respective neurotoxins in the treatment of pediatric patients with spasticity caused by cerebral palsy. BOTOX\u00ae was first approved in June 2019 for the treatment of pediatric patients with upper limb spasticity and in October 2019 for the treatment of pediatric patients with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy. BOTOX\u00ae has not been shown to improve upper extremity functional abilities, or range of motion at a joint affected by a fixed contracture. Spasticity is a debilitating neurological condition involving muscle stiffness that can result in tight muscles in the upper and lower limbs. The severity can range from mild to severe, often interfering with normal muscular movement and function. This can result in delayed or impaired motor development, as well as difficulty with posture and positioning. Common causes of spasticity in children include cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and stroke. \"Cerebral palsy is the most common cause of pediatric spasticity, which can have a profound impact on a child's development and quality of life. With its established safety and efficacy profile, we are pleased that BOTOX\u00ae can now more broadly support physicians treating pediatric spasticity,\" said Mitchell F. Brin, M.D., Senior Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer, BOTOX\u00ae & Neurotoxins, AbbVie. \"Building upon our 30 years of research and development efforts with BOTOX\u00ae, our commitment to neurotoxin innovation continues, and it is particularly rewarding to bring forth new treatments to advance care for pediatric patients.\" The safety and efficacy of BOTOX\u00ae as treatment for lower limb spasticity for pediatric patients is supported by a Phase 3 study with more than 300 patients two to 17 years of age with lower limb spasticity because of cerebral palsy. These trials included a 12-week, double-blind study and a one-year open-label extension study. Allergan is committed to providing resources and services, such as the [BOTOX\u00ae Savings Program](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2854489-1&h=3636018372&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.botoxsavingsprogram.com%2F&a=BOTOX%C2%AE+Savings+Program), to help ensure BOTOX\u00ae is accessible and affordable to patients. About BOTOX\u00ae BOTOX\u00ae is one of the most widely researched medications in the world, with a proven history as a therapeutic agent.1 First approved by the FDA in 1989 for two rare eye muscle disorders - blepharospasm and strabismus in adults, BOTOX\u00ae was the world's first approved botulinum toxin type A treatment. Today, BOTOX\u00ae is FDA-approved for 11 therapeutic indications, including Chronic Migraine, overactive bladder, leakage of urine (incontinence) due to overactive bladder caused by a neurologic condition, cervical dystonia, spasticity, and severe underarm sweating (axillary hyperhidrosis). Backed by strong science and continuous innovation, BOTOX\u00ae proudly embraces its past while boldly looking to the future. BOTOX\u00ae (onabotulinumtoxinA) Important Information Indications BOTOX\u00ae is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used: - To treat overactive bladder symptoms such as a strong need to urinate with leaking or wetting accidents, a strong need to urinate right away, and urinating often in adults 18 years and older when another type of medicine (anticholinergic) does not work well enough or cannot be taken - To treat leakage of urine (incontinence) in adults 18 years and older with overactive bladder caused by a neurologic disease who still have leakage or cannot tolerate the side effects after trying an anticholinergic medication - To prevent headaches in adults with chronic migraine who have 15 or more days each month with headache lasting 4 or more hours each day in people 18 years or older - To treat increased muscle stiffness in people 2 years of age and older with spasticity - To treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that happens with cervical dystonia (CD) in people 16 years and older - To treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older BOTOX\u00ae is also injected into the skin to treat the symptoms of severe underarm sweating (severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) when medicines used on the skin (topical) do not work well enough in people 18 years and older. It is not known whether BOTOX\u00ae is safe or effective to prevent headaches in patients with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days each month (episodic migraine). BOTOX\u00ae has not been shown to help people perform task-specific functions with their upper limbs or increase movement in joints that are permanently fixed in position by stiff muscles. It is not known whether BOTOX\u00ae is safe or effective for severe sweating anywhere other than your armpits. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION BOTOX\u00ae may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX\u00ae: - Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months - Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX\u00ae has been used at the recommended dose to treat chronic migraine, severe underarm sweating, blepharospasm, or strabismus. BOTOX\u00ae may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX\u00ae. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities. Do not receive BOTOX\u00ae if you: are allergic to any of the ingredients in BOTOX\u00ae (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc\u00ae (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport\u00ae (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin\u00ae (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site. Do not receive BOTOX\u00ae for the treatment of urinary incontinence if you: have a urinary tract infection (UTI) or cannot empty your bladder on your own and are not routinely catheterizing. Due to the risk of urinary retention (not being able to empty the bladder), only patients who are willing and able to initiate catheterization post treatment, if required, should be considered for treatment. Patients treated for overactive bladder: In clinical trials, 36 of the 552 patients had to self-catheterize for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX\u00ae compared to 2 of the 542 treated with placebo. The median duration of postinjection catheterization for these patients treated with BOTOX\u00ae 100 Units (n = 36) was 63 days (minimum 1 day to maximum 214 days) as compared to a median duration of 11 days (minimum 3 days to maximum 18 days) for patients receiving placebo (n = 2). Patients with diabetes mellitus treated with BOTOX\u00ae were more likely to develop urinary retention than nondiabetics. Patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease: In clinical trials, 30.6% of patients (33/108) who were not using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) prior to injection, required catheterization for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX\u00ae 200 Units as compared to 6.7% of patients (7/104) treated with placebo. The median duration of post-injection catheterization for these patients treated with BOTOX\u00ae 200 Units (n = 33) was 289 days (minimum 1 day to maximum 530 days) as compared to a median duration of 358 days (minimum 2 days to maximum 379 days) for patients receiving placebo (n = 7). Among patients not using CIC at baseline, those with MS were more likely to require CIC post injection than those with SCI. The dose of BOTOX\u00ae is not the same as, or comparable to, another botulinum toxin product. Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX\u00ae should be discontinued. Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX\u00ae. Tell your doctor if you have any breathing-related problems. Your doctor may monitor you for breathing problems during your treatment with BOTOX\u00ae for spasticity or for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. The risk of developing lung disease in patients with reduced lung function is increased in patients receiving BOTOX\u00ae. Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX\u00ae for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX\u00ae may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX\u00ae. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch. Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX\u00ae for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX\u00ae. Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. Bronchitis was reported more frequently in adults receiving BOTOX\u00ae for upper limb spasticity. Upper respiratory infections were also reported more frequently in adults with prior breathing related problems with spasticity. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX\u00ae for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX\u00ae for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were not reported more frequently than placebo. Autonomic dysreflexia in patients treated for overactive bladder due to neurologic disease. Autonomic dysreflexia associated with intradetrusor injections of BOTOX\u00ae could occur in patients treated for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and may require prompt medical therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia was greater in patients treated with BOTOX\u00ae 200 Units compared with placebo (1.5% versus 0.4%, respectively). Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; have symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and are being treated for urinary incontinence (symptoms of a urinary tract infection may include pain or burning with urination, frequent urination, or fever); have problems emptying your bladder on your own and are being treated for urinary incontinence; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX\u00ae can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX\u00ae passes into breast milk). Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX\u00ae with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX\u00ae in the past. Tell your doctor if you received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc\u00ae, Dysport\u00ae, or Xeomin\u00ae in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic by injection; take muscle relaxants; take an allergy or cold medicine; take a sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners. Other side effects of BOTOX\u00ae include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, dry eyes; drooping eyebrows; and upper respiratory tract infection. In people being treated for urinary incontinence other side effects include: urinary tract infection, painful urination, and/or inability to empty your bladder on your own. If you have difficulty fully emptying your bladder after receiving BOTOX\u00ae, you may need to use disposable self-catheters to empty your bladder up to a few times each day until your bladder is able to start emptying again. For more information refer to the Medication Guide or talk with your doctor. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.
