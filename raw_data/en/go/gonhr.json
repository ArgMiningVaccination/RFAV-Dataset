Caffeine was widely used by ancient civilisations.

Whether present in natural sources or in Red Bull Energy Drink your body processes caffeine the same way.

Red Bull contains Vitamin B6, B12, Niacin and Pantothenic acid. There are two types of vitamins: fat soluble and water soluble. Red Bull contains water-soluble vitamins. Water-soluble vitamins do not get stored as much in the body as fat-soluble vitamins. Instead, they circulate through the blood plasma. Whatever the body does not use is released. Red Bull contains the water-soluble B-group vitamins niacin (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. Red Bull Energy Drink is made with real sugar. Sugars are well known carbohydrates and can be found in many foodstuffs from fruits, fruit juices to other beverages including energy drinks.

One 8.4 fl oz can of Red Bull Energy Drink contains 27 g of sugars. This total amount is in the same range of sugar level found in an equivalent amount of apple juice.
