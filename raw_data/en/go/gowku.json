We formed a multi-departmental team, surveyed our audience and consulted with national museum organizations and sister institutions. We developed comprehensive guidelines and step-by-step procedures to make visitors of all ages feel safe, comfortable and at ease from the time they enter the building to the time they leave. We also have comprehensive guidelines for our staff. In addition to an increased frequency of building-wide cleaning, we have enhanced our cleaning protocols to include the use of hospital-grade cleaning solutions and regular cleaning of high-touch surfaces (like elevator buttons, door knobs, handles, railings and restroom fixtures) and common areas throughout the day.
