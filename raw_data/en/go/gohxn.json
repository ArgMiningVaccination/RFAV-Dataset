We need to take care of our spiritual senses in order to grow in abundance. Using crystals for spiritual healing will usher in the necessary energy to find or reconnect with a higher purpose that helps guide us through the challenges of life. Do you ever feel like there's just way too much going on in your head? That's because there absolutely is. But if we can actively learn [physical and psychological practices that integrate](https://www.thecut.com/2016/12/a-psychiatrist-on-why-your-mind-has-a-mind-of-its-own.html) these energetic realms, we can live more harmonious, happier lives. The thing is, we have our physical forms but also a spiritual body that exists and exudes an aura that defines us as humans. That aura may carry on even after our physical body expires. The spiritual body needs nurturing so we can leave a positive footprint. Late scholar Howard Clinebell defined [7 spiritual needs we experience](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/enhance-your-wellbeing/purpose/spirituality/seven-spiritual-needs) as humans: - To experience love's power and healing in many forms - relational, self, and divine - To experience rebirth through divine consciousness and transcendence - To hold beliefs that guide us through challenges and tribulations - To carry values and intentions to bring goodness and equality that inform personal and social choices - To explore inwards to discover creative expression and self love - To recognize unity with others and nature - To access resources that heal, teach, and strengthen beliefs in all moments of life To meet these needs, we can put into motion those practices that bring our physical form in contact with our spiritual thoughts. A great way to amplify these practices is to incorporate crystals for spiritual healing that exhibit very physical attributes while working on vibrational, metaphysical auras. Ways to Use Crystals for Spiritual Healing There are endless ways to use crystals. These 5 ways are especially targeted to invite spiritual healing within your personal aura and to ignite a physical-spiritual relationship with your crystals. Meditate With Them One of the best ways to connect to your spiritual thoughts comes through meditation. [Meditation](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/types-of-meditation) can look very different to different people. For example, some may find silent prayer as a form of meditation, while others practice mindful thought release and stillness. Crystals for spiritual healing can amp up your meditation practice. Finding crystals that resonate energy related to your spiritual dilemma or current feelings is the first step. Then, by sharing space or touch with these crystals as you meditate and visualize their healing energy traveling through and over you, you will experience the gradual enlightenment to spiritual understanding. Go Deep With Them Crystals naturally have an \"ooh-ahh\" factor - they are beautiful stones made of minerals with elemental properties that can dazzle our sense of sight. That alone can have a powerful effect on us. We may not even realize the deeper spiritual power crystals release. That's why going deeper into understanding crystals and their energies can have profound consequences. A great way to dive into the deep end is to let a crystal \"choose\" you. Look at an array of crystals and listen for the one that echoes, \"Me, me, me!\" That's your mind connecting with the stone. Once you have the crystals that want to help empower you, learn more and more about them. You can go deeper and deeper with a crystal through [chakra healing](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/chakra-healing), [kundalini awakening](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/kundalini-awakening), [cord cutting](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/cutting-energy-cords), and [Feng Shui](https://cosmiccuts.com/pages/feng-shui-meaning). Eventually, you may venture to a new crystal, but you can always come back to earlier crystals. Spiritual healing and growth never truly ends. Resonate Its Energy Back To It As you get to know your crystals, you will learn that some crystals absorb negative energy and need care and cleansing to operate at their optimum frequency. You need to take care of them like they take care of you. That's part of the beauty of crystal therapy. You learn how to emulate the positive vibrations of your crystals for spiritual healing. You study what it is that your crystals do for you. You feel the energy as it works on your spirit, and you mirror it back to the crystal, causing a resonant effect. This is the highest form of crystal healing work because it allows you to radiate it out to the world. Place Them on Your Chakras We talk about placing crystals on chakras a lot, but it's because your chakras are such important energy nodes in your physical body that radiate emotional and spiritual frequencies. Use crystals during [chakra meditation](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/chakra-meditation) or wear crystals close to your chakra nodes. For spiritual healing, your upper chakras - [crown](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/crown-chakra-stones), [third eye](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/third-eye-chakra-stones), and [throat](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/throat-chakra-stones) - have a hard job. These chakras help you connect with the Divine, realize your spiritual beliefs, and communicate your inner truth to others. You don't want to ignore your other chakras, of course. They all work in balance, and the [heart chakra](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/heart-chakra-stones) is incredibly important to connect the spiritual loftiness of the upper nodes with the grounded stability of the lower chakras. Hold Them While Journaling or Reading Spiritual Books Another way to combine mental [self-care routines](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/self-care-routine-crystals) with crystals for spiritual healing is simply by holding them through what you practice. Holding crystals while you [journal](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/journaling-for-self-care) can help you unlock insights and creatively express what spiritual messages you receive. Holding crystals while you read spiritual books or listen to podcasts about spiritual healing can amplify and embed the message in your psyche. There are crystals especially attuned to boost your memory and focus so you can store divine lessons deep in your mental and spiritual bodies. 10 Best Crystals for Spiritual Healing With great ideas on how to engage with crystals during soul reflection and study, take a look at what we consider the best crystals for spiritual healing. Amethyst We have to start with [Amethyst](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/amethyst) because it carries so many dichotomous yet cooperative properties to enhance spiritual growth. It's multi-hued purple color gives it a violet flame vibration, which you'll find in other purple crystals, but Amethyst's is super-charged! The violet flame vibration brings healing to the user by unveiling intuition and wisdom that echoes through the universe, especially aligned with the crown chakra portal to higher consciousness. This divine window through Amethyst enables spiritual clarity. It this sounds a bit out there in outer space, it's because, frankly, it is. This is where Amethyst's unique duality shines. While it allows you to access enlightened thinking, Amethyst keeps you grounded and calm while feeling energized and alert to the spiritual messages that are meant for you. Labradorite The Stone of Magic, [Labradorite](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/labradorite) is a grey crystal with iridescent layers of blues, greens, golds, and reds. It targets the [throat chakra](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/throat-chakra-stones) to enable us to articulate our inner truth and purpose but brings balance to [all the chakras](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/all-the-chakras).

Lapis Lazuli The Wisdom Keeper, [Lapis Lazuli](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/lapis-lazuli), is a deep blue stone with gold and white sparkles caused by the presence of minerals, such as Sodalite and Lazurite. Its unique blue has been considered a sacred color and was used by royal women, like Cleopatra, crushed as eye shadow and paint base for images of the Virgin Mary. Focusing on the third eye chakra, Lapis Lazuli leads the way to spiritual enlightenment. It ignites the desire for divine knowledge and spiritual intuition.

Lodolite One of the best crystals for spiritual healing is [Lodolite](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/lodolite), the Stone of Power. It's a master healer because it is fundamentally Clear Quartz with other minerals incorporated inside. The inner crystals - like Chlorite, Feldspar, Hematite, and Epidote - have properties that are amplified by the Clear Quartz.

Another crown chakra tool, these crystals for spiritual healing help set us in place within the universe so that we can inhabit our true spiritual roles.

These crystals for spiritual healing are actually smooth, rounded stones found in the holy Narmada River in West India. Tapping into the divine connection with Lord Shiva, Shiva Lingam conducts potent energy for kundalini awakening that can change your existing understanding of the world and awakens truth and spiritual consciousness.
