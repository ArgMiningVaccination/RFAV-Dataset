Light-intensity physical activity may increase the production of a hormone known as <i>ghrelin,</i> which is responsible for appetite and may increase food intake.

When capsaicin is applied topically to the skin, it causes the release of a chemical called <i>substance P.</i> Upon continued use, the amount of substance P eventually produced in that area decreases, reducing pain in the area.</p>\\n<p>But this doesn't mean you should go rubbing chile peppers where you have pain. Chile peppers need to be handled very carefully, because they can cause burns if they come in contact with the skin.</p>\\n<p>Therefore, if you have pain and want to harness the power of chile peppers, ask your oncologist or physician about prescribing a capsaicin cream. It has shown pretty good results with regard to treating <i>neuropathic pain</i> (sharp, shocking pain that follows the path of a nerve) after surgery for cancer.</p>\\n<p>Another benefit of chile peppers is that they may help with indigestion. Seems counterintuitive, right? But some studies have shown that ingesting small amounts of cayenne may reduce indigestion.</p>\\n\"},{\"title\":\"Garlic\",\"thumb\":{\"src\":null,\"width\":0,\"height\":0},\"image\":{\"src\":\"https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/402708.image4.jpg\",\"width\":533,\"height\":400},\"content\":\"<p>Garlic belongs to the <i>Allium</i> class of bulb-shaped plants, which also includes chives, leeks, onions, shallots, and scallions. Garlic has a high sulfur content and is also a good source of arginine, oligosaccharides, flavonoids, and selenium, all of which may be beneficial to health. Garlic's active compound, called <i>allicin,</i> gives it its characteristic odor and is produced when garlic bulbs are chopped, crushed, or otherwise damaged.</p>\\n<p>Several studies suggest that increased garlic intake reduces the risk of cancers of the stomach, colon, esophagus, pancreas, and breast. It appears that garlic may protect against cancer through numerous mechanisms, including by inhibiting bacterial infections and the formation of cancer-causing substances, promoting DNA repair, and inducing cell death. Garlic supports detoxification and may also support the immune system and help reduce blood pressure.</p>\\n\"},{\"title\":\"Peppermint\",\"thumb\":{\"src\":null,\"width\":0,\"height\":0},\"image\":{\"src\":\"https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/402709.image5.jpg\",\"width\":535,\"height\":356},\"content\":\"<p>Peppermint is a natural hybrid cross between water mint and spearmint.

Many commercial varieties are on the market, or you can make your own by boiling dried peppermint leaves in water or adding fresh leaves to boiled water and letting them steep for a few minutes until the tea reaches the desired strength.</p>\\n<p>Peppermint can also soothe a sore throat.

Although the results are mixed, there is no harm in giving it a try, provided your oncologist is not opposed. If given the green light, simply make the tea, let it cool, and rinse and gargle as often as desired.</p>\\n<p>Chamomile tea may be another way to manage digestive problems, including stomach cramps.
