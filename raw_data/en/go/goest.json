METHODS:The [vaccination] [strategies]are of a compartmental [epidemic]model in which the daily [vaccination]rate and the daily testing rate for the identification and isolation of asymptomatic subjects are the control variables. Different kinds of algebraic constraints are considered, representing different [vaccination]scenarios in which the total amount of [vaccines]available during the [time]period under consideration is limited or the number of daily available [vaccines]is limited. These optimal control problems are numerically solved by means of a direct transcription [technique], which allows both equality and inequality constraints to be straightforwardly included in the formulation of the optimal control problems. RESULTS:Several numerical experiments are conducted, in which the objective functional to be minimized is a combination of the number of symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious subjects with the [cost]of [vaccination]of susceptible subjects and testing of asymptomatic infectious subjects. The results confirm the hypothesis that the implementation of early control [measures]significantly reduces the number of symptomatic infected subjects, which is a key aspect for the resilience of the [healthcare system]. The [sensitivity] [analysis]of the [solutions]to the weighting [parameters]of the objective functional reveals that it is possible to obtain a [vaccination]strategy that allows [vaccination] [supplies]to be saved while keeping the same number of symptomatic infected subjects. Furthermore, it indicates that if the [vaccination]plan is not supported by a sufficient rate of testing, the number of symptomatic infected subjects could increase. Finally, the [sensitivity] [analysis]shows that a significant reduction in the [efficacy]of the [vaccines]could also [lead]to a relevant increase in the number of symptomatic infected subjects. CONCLUSIONS:The numerical experiments show that the proposed approach, which is based on optimal control of compartmental [epidemic]models, provides [healthcare systems]with a suitable [method]for scheduling [vaccination]plans "}
