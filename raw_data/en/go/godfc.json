Asked if it was too early to say whether the vaccine, which is licensed to AstraZeneca, stops disease developing, Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: \"We haven't quite got to that point yet. We're obviously not going to rush that.\" \"We're getting close, and it's definitely going to be before Christmas, based on the progress,\" he told BBC Radio when asked when the trial investigators would be unblinded to efficacy data and results released.
