CODE MOVEMENT The 20 13 CPT, HCPCS, and CDT codes were placed as shown in Attachment A These proposed placements will be placed on the HERC website to be available for viewing by the various health plans. Final approval of these placements will be done at the HERC meeting on January 10, 2013. These codes will appear on the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List as approved by the HERC in January. A missing tympanostomy tube removal procedure code was added to the acute mastoiditis line Tympanostomy procedure codes that were mistakenly not removed from the hearing loss line were removed A pharyngoplasty procedure code was added to the line with congenital neck problems ITEMS CONSIDERED BUT NO CHANGES MADE The use of silver compounds for treatment of dental caries was discussed but no decision regarding coverage was reached The prioritization of pseudobulbar affect was discussed but no decision was reached A prenatal genetic testing guideline was discussed, and a work group will be convened to write it Changes to the guideline for hysterectomy for menstrual bleeding disorder were discussed, and will be readdressed at a future meeting GUIDELINE CHANGES The coding specifications regarding cognitive behavioral therapy for low back pain were changed to indicate the correct CPT code Mistakes in the coding specification for bariatric surgery on the type 2 diabetes line were corrected The non-prenatal genetic testing guideline was modified to reflect changes needed for the new 2013 CPT genetic testing codes, as shown in Appendix C Two dental guidelines were modified and one deleted as shown in Appendix C The chronic otitis media with eff usion treatment guideline was modified as shown in Appendix C A new guideline allowing coverage of puberty suppression in adolescents under new gender dysphoria line was adopted for the ICD- 10 (October 2014) Prioritized List as shown in Appendix B Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 2 VALUE-BASED BENEFITS SUBCOMMITTEE Meridian Park Health Education Center December 13, 2012 8:300 AM - 2:30 PM Members Present: Lisa Dodson, MD, Chair; Kevin Olson, MD, Vice-chair; Present: Coffman; Ariel Smits, MD, MPH; Livingston, Bruce Boston, OHSU Gary Allen, DMD, Advantage Dental; Christina Schad, MD, and Julie Brown, Avenir Pharmaceuticals; Steven Duffin, Oral Health Outreach; Beryl Fletcher, ODA; Deborah Loy, Capital Dental; Aubrey Harrison, Basic Rights Oregon. Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meeting was called to order at 8:35 am and roll was called. Dr. Williams, an orthopedic surgeon practicing in Roseburg, was introduced as a new member of the subcommittee. Minutes from the 10/11/12 VbBS meeting were reviewed and approved with one change requested by Pollack regarding his remarks on the treatment resistant depression section. Action: HERC staff will post the approved minutes on the website as soon as possible. Coffman shared the work of a group that is trying to make the coverage guidance process more efficient and more reflective of the actual authority of these guidances. There was a general discussion about what authority the guidances and Prioritized List guidelines have. The HERC has the authority to prioritize conditions, and the Legislature determines the coverage level. Other insurers or other bodies may or may not choose to follow these guidances. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 3 Straightforward Discussion Topic: Straightforward Issues Table Discussion: Smits introduced a document with straightforward coding changes. There was no discussion. Actions: 1) Add 69424 to line 178. 2) Remove 69424 and 69433 from line 383 3) Add 42950 to line 71 Topic: Low Back Pain Coding Specifications Discussion: Smits introduced a document with changes needed for the low back pain line coding specifications. There was no discussion. Actions: 1) Add the following coding recommendation to Line 400 for the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List a. Cognitive behavioral therapy (90785-90840) only pairs on Line 400 with the low back diagnoses (344.60, 722.1, 722.2, 722.7, 724.4) 2) Add the following coding recommendation to Line 562 for the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List a. Cognitive behavioral therapy (90785-90840) only pairs on Line 562 with the low the following coding recommendation for Line 400 for the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List a. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( 90785-90840 ) only pairs on Line 400 with the low back diagnoses (344.60, 722.1, 722.2, 722.7, 724.4) 4) Change the following coding recommendation for Line 562 for the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List a. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( 90785-90840 ) only pairs on Line 562 with Bariatric Surgery Coding Specification Discussion: Smits introduced a document with changes needed for the bariatric surgery line coding specifications on the April 1, 2013 list. There was no discussion. Actions: 1) The coding specification for line 33 was changed to read: CPT codes 43644-43645 and 43846-43848 (Roux- 43770-4377 45 (laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding) are only included on this line as treatment according to the requirements in Guideline Note 8 when paired with: 1) a primary diagnosis of 250.x0 or 250.x2 (Type II Diabetes with or without complication); 2) a secondary diagnosis of 278.00 (Obesity, Unspecified) or 278.01 (Morbid Obesity); AND, 3) a tertiary diagnosis code of V85.35-V85.4 05 (BMI >= 35). New Codes 2013 Topic: 2013 CPT codes Discussion: Smits introduced several documents with recommendations for the placement of the 2013 CPT, CDT and HPCPS codes. These recommendations were accepted as shown in the meeting materials (see Appendix A), with the exceptions below. Other code changes recommended in the various issue documents were also accepted as shown in the meeting materials unless noted below. This discussion section includes the genetic testing and psychiatric CPT codes. 1) 52287 (chemodenervation of the bladder). The subcommittee altered the suggested guideline for this procedure to clarify that it was to be used for overactive bladder caused by several types of spinal diseases and that a patient must have failed appropriate pharmacologic management first rather than antimuscarinic medications, as there may be other types of appropriate medicatio n. 2) 64615 (Chemodenervation for migraine). This code is recommended to be added to the Excluded File as suggested by staff. There was considerable discussion about the differing recommendations of trusted sources (MED vs NICE). There was some discussion about these sources possibly using different studies or having differing amounts of industry and patient/provider input. Livingston said the MED report found studies with statistically significant differences with botulinum therapy, but that these differences were Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 5 not clinically significant. Dodson noted that this treatment might be cost effective if it lowered ER costs/utilization. Croswell as noted that chronic migraine patients are not very functional, and any therapy that would allow them to be more productive should be considered. Gibson recommended not covering due to lack of clinically significant outcomes. Kirk felt that this therapy was not medically appropriate based on the evidence. Payers could make exceptions for high ER utilizing patients if the payer felt that this might decrease their overall costs. Shaffer noted that this exception could not be made for FFS patients if the treatment was placed on the Excluded File . Livingston reviewed GRADE criteria and noted that this therapy would likely not be recommended for coverage using this criteria. The decision was made to not cover. 3) 81235 (EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) testing). The subcommittee recommended placing on the line which included the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (line 278), as this is the diagnosis for which this code is utilized (not the Diagnostic File). Olson noted that this procedure is a test on tumor tissue, not germ line tissue and therefore is not a genetic test. It therefore should not be included in the non-prenatal genetic testing guideline and that portion of the suggested guideline changes was not accepted. 4) 86152/86153 (Cell enumeration using immunologic selection) were recommended for placement on the Excluded File rather than the Diagnostic File. Olson stated that these tests are expensive and their place in cancer care is dubious. He recommended against coverage 5) 86711 (JC virus antibody) was placed on the multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease lines (35 and 268) rather than the Diagnostic File. Livingston reported that this test is only FDA approved for use in these 2 indications. The subcommittee was concerned about over use for other indications without evidence of benefit. 6) 90839/90840 (psychotherapy for crisis) were not added to the low back pain lines (400 and 562) 7) 90863 (pharmacologic management) was recommended for addition to the Excluded File as this applies only to prescribed psychologists in 2 states (not Oregon). AMH suggested leaving this code open to allow for non-MD and non-NP mental health providers to bill for medication management. Pollack felt that this code was inappropriate for Oregon, as psychologists do not have prescribing privileges here. 8) 95782/95783 (pediatric polysomnography) are recommended to be placed on the Diagnostic File rather than the Ancillary File, because the subcommittee felt that these tests are used in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep issues. Pollack asked HERC staff to consider moving all polysomnography CPT codes from the Ancillary File to the Diagnostic File 9) The \"C\" HCPCS codes did not have placement determined. These codes are used solely during hospitalization and have never been included on the Prioritized List. There was discussion about the C codes for drug eluting cardiac stents. HERC staff was asked to consider having HTAS review drug eluting vs bare metal cardiac stent technology. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 6 10) S8930 (electrical stimulation of auricular acupuncture points) had no final placement decision made. Ocker provided the Regence BCBS coverage position on this technology, which is that it is investigational. Ocker and HERC staff will work with acupuncture experts to determine 1) if this HCPCS code is used solely for a device or if it is intended for use for standard electrical stimulation of ear points; 2) if an acupuncturist who does traditional electrical stimulation of ear points can use the usual acupuncture CPT codes for billing; 3) determine if this procedure should be added to any or all of the current lines which contain acupuncture CPT codes. This topic will be readdressed at the January, 2013 VBBS meeting. 11) D7952 was added to line 648 (there was a mistake in line number listed in the meeting materials) Actions: 1) See Appendix A for new CPT, CDT and HCPCS code placements a. These proposed placements will be placed on the HERC website to be available for viewing by the various health plans. Final approval of these placements will be done at the HERC meeting on January 10, 2013. These codes will appear on the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List as approved by the HERC in January. 2) 77435 was removed from all current lines and are recommended to be added to the Excluded File 3) A new guideline was added to line 351 as shown in Appendix B 4) 92973, 92975, 92977 were removed from all lines other than lines 51, 76, 108, and 195 5) The non-prenatal genetic testing guideline was modified as shown in Appendix C 6) Dental guidelines 17 and 53 were modified as shown in Appendix C 7) Dental guideline note 91 was deleted New Discussion Items Topic: Silver Nitrate Treatments For Dental Caries Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document regarding use of silver nitrate for treatment of dental caries. Deborah Loy, Capital Dental, submitted written testimony and gave oral testimony against allowing silver nitrate use. She felt that this treatment was not the right treatment for the vulnerable low income population it was targeted for. She testified that its use had no support from professional organizations and had no U.S. evidence to support its use. She feels t hat its use results in a very poor cosmetic outcome. She also argued that the various types of silver treatment are not interchangeable, and the usual agent used globally is not FDA approved in the US. Loy also acknowledged that if there were good evidence available to support its use, she and others would reconsider, but at this point there is too little known about harms and about comparative efficacy to current treatments. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 7 Dr. Gary Allen a dentist with Advantage Dental, gave written and oral testimony in favor of the use of silver compounds for treatment of dental caries. He testified that the MED review recommendations did not reflect the findings of the review itself. He feels that silver diamine fluoride has evidence of effectiveness, but that this technology is very old and much of the literature would not be found by a standard search of recent studies. He argued that the cosmetic outcome was not that poor, as it turns an otherwise brown stain into a black stain. Silver compounds are used widely internationally to treat dental caries. However, these compounds are not approved in US for this use, but are under review for approval. Silver nitrate + fluoride varnish is being used by some dental providers in Oregon. Silver diamine fluoride would be preferred when available in the US. Dr. Allen argued that silver treatments would be another tool in the toolbox. The typical course of treatment would be 5 applications over a 3-4 month period with restoration at the end of that course. He argued that halting the bacterial infection is important. He also felt that this therapy may be cost savings if avoiding hospitalization of children for extensive dental work. Tyack asked clarifying questions about the need for further restorative treatment after treatment with silver nitrate. Livingston noted that no studies looked at the comparative outcomes of repeated applications of silver diamide fluoride with delayed restoration vs immediate restoration (what would be standard of care in the United States). Tyack also expressed concern about the potential for discrimination against poor children with black teeth. Glass ionomer cement was offered as another alternative with superior cosmetic outcomes. Kirk noted that OHP dental director Mike Shirtcliff has reported significant decrease in ER visits with this treatment in his organization. Livingston also shared public testimony that had been received by Dr. Steven Duffin. Questions were asked about how silver treatments are billed. The reply was that these treatments are billed with the CDT code for \"desensitizing agent\" which is not-specific. If the proposed guideline specifying that it is not a covered treatment is not adopted, then dental plans may cover it. Jacobo noted that the desensitiv izing code is not currently reimbursed by DMAP and would not be reimbursed under FFS, but that the capitated dental plans could choose to reimburse for it. Tyack expressed concerns for high costs associated with this approach due to mid- level dental providers in FQHC model using this treatment and then billing at the v ery expensive FQHC wrap-around rate. Allen responded that this would not likely happen under a DCO global budgeting model. Loy replied that even with DCO's, the FQHC wrap -around payment would still apply. Loy noted that the board of dentistry is currently looking into the type of provider that should be allowed to apply silver compounds. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 8 Actions: The decision was to defer further discussion until the January VBBS meeting. The members will read over the materials in more detail. HERC staff will make a summary of the testimony (written and oral) and other evidence provided for this meeting. HERC staff will also consult the board of dentistry for input on this topic. Topic: Pseudobulbar Affect Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document with recommendations regarding the prioritization of pseudobulbar affect (PBA). Testimony was heard from Christina Schad, MD, on behalf of Avanir Pharmaceuticals. She testified that PBA should be a covered condition, as this condition is under-recognized and undertreated. The prevalence of this condition is10-20% of patients with underlying neurologic conditions and 40% of ALS patients. About 2 million Ame ricans suffer from PBA. PBA causes distress, affects quality of life, and affects occupational functioning. It affects a patient's ability to interact with health care, participate in rehab, and can cause relationship issues. Dr. Schad testified that this condition is a significant burden on patients, family, and caregivers. Coffman noted that PBA would be covered as a co-morbid condition on the Prioritized List and that the ICD-9 code should be billed as a secondary code when an underlying condition is present. Pollack noted that he had a patient that he attempted to try this medication for, and had considerable difficulty obtaining coverage for it. He noted that the patient did not respond well to this treatment. He feels that PBA is a significant condition and should be covered. Smits noted that a new line could be created for PBA with the next biennial review, and scored with the usual methodology. If more timely movement of this condition is needed, the VBBS could consider where such a line would be located and find a similar line in that area of the List that the diagnosis could be added to. Actions: No decision was made. Staff will create a mock line with PBA and score it with the usual methodology and bring a proposed new code placement based on this theoretical line to the January VBBS meeting. HERC staff will also contact neurology experts for independent input. Coverage Guidances for Review Topic: Viscosupplementation for Osteoarthritis of the Knee Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 9 Discussion: This topic was tabled until the January VBBS meeting. Actions: Will be discussed at the January VBBS meeting. Topic: Percutaneous Interventions for Low Back Pain Discussion: This topic was tabled until the January VBBS meeting. Actions: Will be discussed at the January VBBS meeting. Topic: Management of Chronic Otitis M edia in Children Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document with recommended changes to the otitis media treatment guideline. Dr. Ericka King from OHSU Pediatric ENT testified about concerns she and her colleagues have about the proposed changes to the guideline and about the literature used for the creation of the HERC coverage guidance on this topic. She recommended re-inserting the stricken language \" For the child who has had chronic OME and who has a hearing deficiency in the better-hearing ear of 25 dB or greater, myringotomy with tube insertion recommended after a total of 4 to 6 months of effusion with a documented hearing deficit.\" She said that children with a 25dB hearing loss are at risk for language delay. There was discussion that the current location of chronic OME below the funding line was preventing children from getting needed care. The committee directed Dr. King to bring this concern to the legislature as it is a funding issue. Livingston brought up that the last sentence regarding individualized treatment plans was problematic for DMAP. She recommended putting in wording that ear tubes should be covered for these diagnoses. There was discussion about adding the CPT code for ear tube to these diagnosis lines (Down 's syndrome, craniofacial anomalies, etc.). Williams suggested adding PE tubes back to the hearing loss lines. Livingston noted that PE tubes were not indicated for hearing loss unless effusion is present, in which case the diagnosis would be on the chronic OME line. Actions: 1) The chronic otitis media treatment guideline was modified as shown in Appendix C. it will be brought back to the January VBBS meeting as a straightforward item. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 10 Previous Discussion Items Topic: Puberty Suppression for Transgendered Youth Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document with information regarding puberty suppression in transgendered youth. Jenn Burleton from TransActive , Dr. Kari n Selva from Legacy Pediatric Endocrinology and Dr. Bruce Boston from OHSU Pediatricc Endocrinology gave testimony in favor of coverage of this treatment. The main discussion was about the type of mental health evaluation that would be required prior to this therapy. There are several non-MD mental health providers who are very competent in this area. The proposed guideline wording was changed from \"psychiatric evaluation\" to \"mental health\" evaluation. Tyack and Olson made comments in support of coverage. Tyack felt that there was no alternative treatment and Olson felt that, despite weak evidence, the committee heard strong testimony about the utility of use in this vulnerable population. He also felt that this treatment was unlikely to be abused. Selva asked that HERC staff ensure that medical visit E&M codes are on the new Gender Dysphoria line for the ICD-10 Prioritized List to allow providers to see these patients for monitoring of this type of treatment. Note: staff reviewed the new line and it includes E&M codes appropriate for this type of care. Actions: 1) A new guideline for the gender dysphoria line on the ICD-10 list was adopted as shown in Appendix B Guidelines Topic: Guideline note 44, Menstrual Bleeding Disorders Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document regarding proposed changes to remove a defined hemoglobin level from guideline note 44. Williams expressed concern that without a specific number, there would be no method to objectively determine if anemia was present. Livingston noted that this guideline change would result in increased numbers of hysterectomies for menstrual bleeding disorders. Taray noted that DMAP is already covering many of these cases without the documentation of this hemoglobin level, so the number of new cases with this change would likely be smaller than expected. She noted that there are about 2 cases per month approved by DMAP in the FFS population without a documented hemoglobin of 10. Kirk noted that his plan is using and enforcing this clause. In general, there was a sense that hysterectomy for this indication has significant potential for overuse. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 11 Several alternate wording proposals were put forth. Livingston suggested adding language to require \"documented precipitous loss or requiring iron treatment.\" Dodson felt that there were already considerable \"hoops\" to get thro ugh in this guideline. She did not feel that the hemoglobin of 10 clause added much to the guideline. She felt that there was no good medical evidence that the value of 10 makes a difference as compared to any other value defining anemia. This number was picked arbitrarily. Taray suggested putting an OR between clauses 1a and 1b; however, the group did not accept this suggestion as it would allow a patient with normal periods but anemia for an unrelated reason to qualify for a hysterectomy. Actions: 1) HERC staff will seek input from the OHP medical directors regarding the utility of having a hemoglobin level of 10 required in this guideline. HERC staff will also research other guidelines, such as Blue Cross, to see what type of definition is used for anemia, if any. This topic will be brought back to the March 2013 VBBS meeting (the next OHP medical directors meeting is after the January VBBS meeting) Topic: Prenatal genetic testing guideline Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document regarding plans to create a prenatal genetic testing guideline. The group decided that it should go through the coverage guidance process and engaging experts to assist. Actions: 1) HERC staff to identify experts and bring to a subsequent Evidence-based Guidelines Subcommittee meeting Public Comment: No additional public comment was received Issues for next meeting: Coronary brachytherapy External elements exposure issues Stereotactic radiation therapy for intracranial AVMs ( Personal history of cancer V codes Auricular acupuncture Enzyme replacement therapy for Guacher's disease and PKU Silver compoun ds for caries treatment Pseudobulbar affect prioritization Changes need ed to the Prioritized List to bring into alignment with coverage guidances on viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the knee, percutaneous Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 12 interventions for low back pain, and management of chronic otitis media in children Guideline on immunizations/prevention tables Expensive/marginally effective drug guideline Guideline Note 37 on abnormal reflexes radiculopathy Next meeting: Thursday, January 10, 2013, Meridian Park Hospital, Conference Room 117 Time: TBD The meeting adjourned at 2:45 PM.

V.1.2012 (5/2/12). www.nccn.org 2) Genetic counseling should precede genetic testing for hereditary cancer. Very rarely, it may be appropriate for a genetic test to be performed prior to genetic counseling for a patient with cancer. If this is done, genetic counseling should be provided as soon as practical. a) Pre and post-test genetic counseling by the following providers should be covered. i) Medical Geneticist (M.D.) - Board Certified or Active Candidate Status from the American Board of Medical Genetics ii) Clinical Geneticist (Ph.D.) - Board Certified or Active Candidate Status from the American Board of Medical Genetics.

Although the yield of Fragile X is 3.5- 10%, this is included because of additional reproductive implications. Appendix C Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Appendix C 5) A visit with the appropriate specialist (often genetics, developmental pediatrics, or child neurology), including physical exam, medical history, and family history is covered. Physical exam, medical history, and family history by the appropriate specialist, prior to any genetic testing is often the most cost- effective strategy and is encouraged. C) Related to other tests with specific CPT codes: 1). The following tests are not gene analysis, drug metabolism), gene analysis, gene analysis, gene analysis, common variants (eg, - 1639/3673) 2) The following tests are covered only if they meet the criteria for the Non-Prenatal Genetic Testing Algorithm AND the common variants (eg, R183P, G278S, E422X): Cover only when the newborn screening test is abnormal and serum amino acids are normal gene sequence: covered for patients who are symptomatic or who have positive newborn screening for CF AND genetic testing for common mutations is negative AND if the patients ethnicity has <90% coverage by common mutation panels. genetic counseling. d.

Generic testing or the anpha-1 phenotype test is appropriate is the protein test is abnormal or borderline. The genetic test is appropriate for siblings of people with AAT deficiency regardless of the AAT protein test results. 3) Do not cover a more expensive genetic test (generally one with a wider scope or more detailed testing) if a cheaper (smaller scope) test is available and has, in this clinical context, a substantially similar sensitivity. For example, do not cover CFTR gene sequencing as the first test in a person of Northern European Caucasian ancestry because the gene panels are less expensive and provide substantially similar sensitivity in that context. GUIDELINE NOTE 17, PREVENTIVE DENTAL CARE Line 58 Dental cleaning and fluoride treatments are limited to once per 12 months for adults and twice per 12 months for children up to age 19 (D1110, D1120, D1203, D1204, D1206). More frequent dental cleanings and/or fluoride treatments may be required for certain higher risk populations.

GUIDELINE NOTE 51, CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION Line 502 Antibiotic and other medication therapy (including antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids) are not indicated for children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) (without another appropriate diagnosis). There should be a 3 to 6 month watchful waiting period after diagnosis of otitis media with effusion, and if documented hearing loss is greater than or equal to 25dB in the better hearing ear, tympanostomy surgery may be indicated given short but not long term improvement in hearing. Formal audiometry is indicated for cChildren with chronic OME present for 3 months or longer. or Children with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss at any time should have hearing testing upon diagnosis . Children with chronic OME who are not at risk for language or developmental delay should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. For the child who has had chronic OME and who has a hearing deficiency in the better- hearing ear of 25 dB or greater, myringotomy with tube insertion is recommended after a total of 4 to 6 months of effusion with a documented hearing deficit. Adenoidectomy is not indicated at the time of first pressure equalization tube insertion. It may be indicated in is an appropriate surgical treatment for chronic OME in children over 3 years with who are having their second set of tubes. First time tubes are not an indication for an adenoidectomy. Tube insertion should be covered for p atients with craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and patients with speech and language delay along with co- morbid hearing loss. Section 3 Straightforward Items Coronary Brachytherapy Issue: During the 2013 CPT code review of cardiac stenting, HERC staff identified that the CPT code for coronary brachytherapy is on multiple inappropriate lines. Description: Intracoronary brachytherapy with gamma or beta radioactive ribbons for the management of in-stent restenosis of native coronary vessels following successful PTCA. Multiple contraindications exist, including acute MI, left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, and type of lesion. Current list placement: CPT code 92974 (Transcatheter placement of radiation delivery device for subsequent co ronary intravascular brachytherapy) is currently on multiple lines (approximately 40). It is only used for coronary artery stent issues. At the 2013 CPT code review, cardiac stenting was limited to 4 lines with coronary artery disease diagnoses. The corona ry brachytherapy code is therefore on multiple lines that are inappropriate.

There are various treatments on this line, including embolization and various lines for treatment of benign and malignant tumors of the CNS. However, it is currently not covered for treatment of AVMs . From Dr. Chris Kirk: We have a member with \"anomaly of cerebrovascular system\" - ICD-9 code 747.81. It is a deep parietal AVM. He cannot have surgery due to it's deep location. It is not amenable to embolization because of its lack of a specific arterial vessel that can be embolized. The team at OHSU would like to claim that this is \"...a commonly accepted treatment method for this patient's situation...\" and that it is supported in the literature (they offered no citations). Evidence 1) Friedlander 2007 , review of AVMs a. Radiosurgery is often recommended if an arteriovenous malformation is less than 3 cm in diameter and is located in an eloquent area where surgeryis likely to cause a neurologic deficit. b. Although data from randomized trials to guide the choice of intervention are lacking, treatment (surgical resection, radiosurgery, embolization, or a combination of these) is generally considered appropriate for arteriovenous malformations that are grade I to III.24,33 The choice of therapy will depend on the specific features of the lesion, with consideration of the age of the patient, presence or absence of bleeding and associated aneurysms, diameter and location of associated aneurysms, and pattern of venous drainage. 2) Fleetwood 2002, review of AVMs a.

After a brief postictal period, she recovers fully and does not report headache or other neurologic symptoms. She takes no medications and her medical history is unremarkable. Com-puted tomography of the head suggests a right evidence of hemorrhage. reso-nance imaging, and magnetic resonance of the brain show a right occipi-tal arteriovenous malformation, 3.5 cm in diameter, as well as a feeding-artery aneu-rysm, 1.5 cm in diameter. How should her case be further evaluated and managed? The Cl inic a l Problem Arteriovenous malformations of the brain are focal abnormal conglomerations of dilated arteries and veins within brain parenchyma, in which a loss of normal vas-cular organization at the subarteriolar level and a lack of a capillary bed result in abnormal arteriovenous shunting (Fig. 1). Arteriovenous malformations can occur anywhere in the central nervous system; in this article, I focus on those in the brain. Small arteries involved in arteriovenous malformation are deficient in the smooth-muscle layer. 1 The tangle of abnormal arteries and veins in the malformation (often referred to as the arteriovenous malformation nidus) are connected by one fistula or, more commonly, several fistulas. The direct arteriovenous connection results in high-pressure vascular channels, particularly in veins with fibromuscular thickening and incompetent elastic lamina; these veins are at risk of rupture, often with cata-strophic results. The most common presenting sign of an arteriovenous malformation is intra- cerebral hemorrhage (occurring in 42 to of clinically apparent arteriovenous malformations). 2-7 A first hemorrhage most commonly occurs in patients between 20 and 40 years of age.2-4 Data are conflicting regarding associations between age and the risk of hemorrhage, with studies reporting either a higher risk in older patients, in younger patients, or in both (bimodal peaks) or a constant risk over time. 4,5,8,9 Sex does not appear to affect the risk of rupture.6,10,11 Hemorrhage of arteriovenous malformations accounts for approximately 2% of all strokes.10,12 Other presenting signs of arteriovenous malformations include seizures, mass effect (from direct compression or swelling related to the malformation, putting pressure on surrounding structures), and ischemic steal (due to preferential low-resistance blood flow through the arteriovenous malformation, resulting in the hypoperfusion of adjacent structures). Even in the absence of bleeding, headaches (specifically migraines) have been associated with arteriovenous malformations. 13 The prevalence of arteriovenous malformation is estimated at approximate- ly 0.01% of the general population, but reported rates range from 0.001% to 0.52%. 3,10,11,14,15 The lesions are thought to be congenital in origin. Although occa-This Journal feature begins with a case vignette highlighting a common clinical problem.

Asenigmatic as these lesions remain, we have gained a betterunderstanding of their pathogenesis, clinical presentation,and natural history. Major developments have also beenmade in microsurgical, endovascular, and radiosurgicaltreatments. In this seminar, rather than providing anexhaustive review of all aspects of arteriovenousmalformations, we summarise the most recent andrelevant published work, focusing on the past 5 years, andin particular on new information that changes ourapproach to patients with arteriovenous malformations.We will also discuss several studies that have focused onthe outcome of these patients after treatment. For a moredetailed assessment of the present state of treatment forarteriovenous malformations, we recommend recentreviews 1-3and the American Heart Association guidelines for management of arteriovenous malformations.4 Pathology Few developments have been made in pathologicalfindings of arteriovenous malformations, but, Martin andVinters 5provide a good overview of expected findings. Arteriovenous malformations are lesions that are definedby presence of arteriovenous shunting through a nidus ofcoiled and tortuous vascular connections that connectfeeding arteries to draining veins (figures 1-3).Histologically, cells found within the nest generally showchronic reactive changes and are thought to be non-functioning. Vascular structures retain the characteristicfeeding arterial and draining venous components, but nocapillaries are seen these two elements, creatingdirect arteriovenous shunting. Arterial and venouselements Lancet 2002; 359: 863-73 Department of Neurosurgery and Stanford Stroke Center, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA (I G Fleetwood MD, Prof G K Steinberg MD) Correspondence to: Prof Gary K Steinberg, Department of Neurosurgery and Stanford Stroke Center, Room R281, EdwardsBuilding, Stanford University, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, the elastic lamina of the arterial intimal layer is mostly intact, but might show some degradationor deficiencies. The thickened veins can be discerned bytheir size and the absence of elastic staining. Bothelements can also show hyperplasia of the smooth-musclecells in the tunica media. If haemorrhage has occurred,the Arteriovenous malformations have persistent or reconstituted abnormalconnection between the arterial and venous systems. In1987, Yasargil 6postulated that, rather than being a simple structural connection, these lesions might be a\"proliferative capillaropathy\". This suggestion thatarteriovenous malformations are dynamic in nature hasbeen lent support by several case reports (describedbelow), and by two recent theories. Most theories aboutthe embryogenesis of these lesions include a definitivestatement about their congenital nature, and attributethem to either persistence of a primitive arteriovenousconnection or development of such a connection after itsinitial closure. In 1996, Mullan and colleagues 7showed that arteriovenous malformations are generally impossibleto identify in utero or with perinatal ultrasound,suggesting that they are either too small to detect in theseArteriovenous malformations Ian G Fleetwood, Gary K Steinberg Arteriovenous malformations of the brain are congenital vascular lesions that affect 0\u00b701-0\u00b750% of the population, andare generally present in patients aged 20-40 years. The usual clinical presentations are haemorrhage, seizures,progressive neurological deficit, or headache. Results of natural history studies have shown a yearly haemorrhage rateof 1-4%. Frequency of rebleeding has increased over the years, and several factors that increase risk of haemorrhagehave been identified. Although substantial, the morbidity associated with haemorrhages could be less than previouslythought. Over the past decade, great advances have been made in application of endovascular embolisationtechniques, stereotactic radiosurgery, and microsurgery, allowing effective multidisciplinary malformations, including those previously deemed to be untreatable. Increasing attention has been paidto management of flow-related aneurysms associated with these malformations. Finally, many reports of recurrentarteriovenous malformations have coincided with new theories regarding the embryogenesis of these disorders and laboratory work suggesting their proliferative potential. Seminar Search strategy and selection criteria Data for this seminar were identified by searches of BioMedNet and PubMed with the search terms \"arteriovenousmalformation\" or \"AVM\" in combination with the terms\"cerebral\" or \"intracranial\". We then \"aneurysm\", \"treatment\", \"surgery\", and\"radiosurgery\". We focused on publications in the past 5 years, but did not exclude commonly referenced and highlyregarded older publications. Relevant articles not identifiedwith the search strategy described above, but referenced inthe bibliographies of these papers, could also be included.Several recent review articles and book chapters were alsoincluded because they provide comprehensive overviews that,in some cases, were beyond the scope of this seminar. Thereference list was subsequently modified during the peer-review process on the basis of comments from reviewers. Clinical Policy Bulletin: Stereotactic Radiosurgery to the following selection criteria. I. Cranial stereotactic radiosurgery with a gamma kn ife, Cyberknife, or linea r accelerator (LINAC) is considered medically necessary when used for any of the following indications: A. For treatment of members with symptomatic, small (less than 3 cm) arterio-venous (AV) malformations, aneurysms, lesion is unresectable due to its deep intracranial location or if the member is unable to tolerate conventional operative intervention; or B. For members with trigeminal neuralgia that has not responded to other more conservative treatments (see CPB 0374 - Trigeminal Neuralgia Surgery ); or C. For treatment of brain malignancies (prima ry tumors and/or metastatic lesions). II. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with a gamma knife, Cyberknife, or linear accelerator (LINAC) is considered medically necessary for localized malignant conditions within the body where highly precise application of high-dose radiotherapy is required (e.g., lung or liver metastases not amenable to surgery, medically inoperable early stage lung cancer, primary liver cancer not amenable to surgery, spinal and para-spinous tumors, not an all inclusive list). III. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is consider ed medically necessary when stereotactic radiosurgery are met. Fractionated stereotactic radiot herapy is useful for treatment of tumors in hard- to-reach locations, tumors with very unusual shapes, or for tumors located in such close proximity to a vital structure (e.g., optic nerve or hypothalamus) that even a very accurate high-dose single fraction of stereotactic radiosurgery could not be tolerated. IV. Stereotactic proton beam radiosurgery: please see CPB 0270 - Radiotherapy . Aetna considers stereotactic radiosurge ry experimental and investigational for all other indications because its effectiveness for these indications has not been established including: Cluster headaches Epilepsy (except when associated with treatme nt of AV malformations or brain tumors) Mammographic microcalcification Parkinson's disease. Background With any external beam radiation therapy, the highe st dose of radiation devel ops where multiple beams intersect. Thus, the fewer beams there are, the greater the dose reaching other areas traversed by the Policy History Last Review: 04/24/2012 Effective: 11/29/1995 Next Review: 01/24/2013 Review History Definitions Additional Information Clinical Policy Bulletin Notes Close Window Aetna.com Home | Help | Contact Us Search Go Page 1 of 11 Stereotactic Radiosurgery 12/20/2012 http://www.aetna.com/c pb/medical/data/1 _99/0083.html Page 1 of 0110 Cigna Medical Coverage Po licy Subject Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Effective Date ............................ 6 /15/2012 Next Review Dat 4 /15/2013 Coverage Po licy Number ................. 0110 Table of Contents Coverage Policy .................................................. 1 General Background ........................................... 3 Coding/Billing Information ................................... 9 References ........................................................ 11 Policy History ..................................................... 17 Hyperlink to Related Coverage Po licies Inpatient Admission for Radiation Therapy Intensity -Modulated R adiation Therapy (IMRT) Neutron Beam Therapy Proton Beam Therapy for Intracranial and Skull Base Tumors Proton Beam Therapy for Lung Cancer Proton Beam Therapy for Ocular Melanoma, Ocular Hemangiomas and Macular Degeneration Proton Beam Therapy for Prostat e Cancer INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna companies including plans formerly administered by Great -West Healthcare, which is now a part of Cigna. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard Cigna benefit plans. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy . In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supercedes the information in the Coverage Po licies . In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as t reatment guidelines.

Question source : DMAP and HERC staff Issue : Most V10 series codes (personal history of cancer) are lo cated on funded lines. For many cancers, there is an altered screening schedule (more frequent colonoscopy in colon cancer, for example) or screening modality ( e.g. breast MRI instead of mammogram in breast cancer ) if a patient has a history of that cancer. Other cancer survivors may need periodic PET scans, X- rays, blood work, specialist visits, or other types of surveillance and follow up. Most V10 codes are located on funded lines. However, 2 are located on unfunded lines and several are located on the Excluded List. These should be considered for movement to funded lines. There are several \"unspecified\" codes that are Excluded and should remain so.

At that time, HERC staff indicated th at there was not enough information available to make a placement determination for this code. Staff has consulted experts and reviewed additional materials. Definition : Auricular electrostimulation involves the stimulation of acupunc ture points on the ear. Devices, including the P-Stim and E-pulse , have been developed to provide ambulatory electrical stimulation over a period of severa l days. Auricular electr ostimulation is being evaluated for a variety of conditions, including pain, depression, and anxiety. The P-Stim device is a single-use miniature electrical stimulator for auricular acupuncture points that is worn behind the ear with a self-adhesive electrode patch. A selec tion stylus that measures electrical resistance is used to identify 3 auri cular acupuncture points.

Auricular Electro-Acupuncture 2 Roger Batchelor, DAOM L.Ac., NCNM Devices for full-body and ear acupuncture are typically the same, and usually simple. These devices are essential for acupunc ture. It is comforta ble for patients and efficient for practitioners. Res earch on conventional devices is extensive, such as the work of Becker and most notably Dr. Han, Ji-Sheng. Han led government research on acupuncture in China for 30 years, and found that electro acupressure or acupuncture (specifically alternating be tween 2 and 100 Hz) boosted all 5 known neurotransmitters in the cerebrospinal fluid. He published a wealth of research articles in English, searchable on PubMed, and presented at top-le vel scientific conferences internationally. For this, he was awarded China's top science prize a few years ago. Most LAcs are unaware of Dr. Han's work, but it provides rich scientific ba sis for ElectroAcupun cture (EA). Many acupuncturists use a simple 10 Hz if an alternating current is not available on their machines --many of my MD ac upuncture colleagues use this as a convention. It was the waveform successfully applied on two acupoints on a patient's head during a 3 hour surgery at OHSU in 2004 that precluded the use of any chemical anesthesia. One EA device, called 'micro current,' markets something that claims great effects --alt hough the patient does not feel anything. Some of my colleagues swear by these devices, attending special workshops by the manufacturer. As is the case with mo st medical devices, however, there is no independent research on them. In the past, this was billed as Elec tro acupuncture, for s lightly more than conventional. These devices do not require additional training nor capit al investment, since the devices cost less than $500, and great on es run for about $300 or less. I've never understood why a separate code or cost was ju stified with these devices. This billing practice probably encouraged the use of EA by practitioners, which is harmless, but is not a good model for influencing practice for the sake of a few dollars . The list makes sense. It is an essential practice for acute situations where hours of stimulation are needed, such as surgical or de ntal anesthesia/analges ia, or obstetric labor and delivery. It is interesting that every research article I surveyed that compared EA to conventional acupuncture for treating depression had superior results for EA: that was about a dozen articles in 2005. It makes a strong case for EA with this condition. EA is well known for pain of all types. I would not lim it it to the pain conditions below. It would not be my first choice for pregnancy, but is essential for labor and delivery. Working at Hooper Detox, we found EA to help diffi cult detoxification, such as opiates.

DESCRIPTION Auricular electrostimulation is a t ype of ambulatory electrical stimulation of acupuncture points on the ear. Devices, including the P -Stim and E-pulse, have been developed to provide continuous or intermittent stimulation over a period of several days. A lso known as auricular electro -acup uncture, this type of electrostimulation is being evaluated for a variety of conditions, including pain, depression, and anxiety. Regulatory Status Both t he P-Stim (NeuroScience Therapy Corp) and the E -pulse ( AMM Marketing LLC ) devices have received mark eting clearance through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 510(k) process for use in treating acute or chronic pain by a qualified practitioner of acupuncture. Note: This policy does not address Cranial Electrostimulation Therapy, which is considered separately in DME Policy No. 83.06 . MEDICAL POLICY CRITERIA Electrical stimulation of auricular acupuncture points is considered investigational for all indications, including but not limited to chronic and acute pain. 1 - MED146 SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE The principal outcomes associated with treatment of pain due to any cause may include: relief of pain, improved functional level, and return to work. Relief of pain is a subjective outcome that is typically associated with a placebo effect. Therefore, data from adequately powered, blinded, randomized, sham - controlled trials (RCT) are required to control for the placebo effect, determine its magnitude, and determine whether any treatment effect fr om an auricular electrostimulation device provides a significant advantage over the placebo. Treatment with an auricular electrostimulation device must also be evaluated in general groups of patients against the existing standard of care for the condition being treated. For example, in patients with pain symptoms, treatment with an auricular electrostimulation d evice should be compared to other forms of conservative therapy such as rest, non- steroidal anti- inflammatory medications, physical therapy, or st eroid injection s. Literature Appraisal Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported on the use of the P- stim device and are the focus of this policy. In 2004, Sator-Katzenschlager et al. reported a randomized double-blind controlled study of auricular electro -acupuncture compared to conventional manual auricular acupuncture in 61 patients with chronic low back pain (duration of at least 6 months). [1] All needles were connected to the P - Stim device; in the control group, devices were applied without electrical stimulation. Treatment was performed once weekly for 6 weeks, with needles withdrawn 48 hours after insertion. Patients received questionnaires assessing pain intensity and quality, psycholo gical well -being, activity level, and quality of sleep using visual analog scale (VAS). There was a significant improvement in pain at up to 18 weeks' follow- up. Auricular electro -acupuncture resulted in greater improvement in the outcome measures than that of the control group. For example, at 18- week follow -up, VAS pain intensity was less than 5 in the control group and less than 2 in the electro-acupuncture. This study is limited by the small number of participants. In 2003, this group of investigators had reported similar effects in a small randomized study of 21 patients with chronic cervical pain. [2] In another European study from 2008, Bernateck et al. reported the use of the P- Stim device in a RCT of 44 patients with rheumatoid arthritis.[3] The control group received autogenic training, a psychological intervention in which participants learn to relax their limbs, breathing, and heart. Electro -acupuncture (continuous stimulation for 48 hours at home) and lessons in autogenic training were performed once weekly for 6 weeks. In addition, the control patients were encouraged to use an audiotape to practice autogenic training every day. The needles and devices were removed after 48 hours. Seven patients withdrew from the study before beginning the intervention; the 37 remaining patients completed the study through 3 months of follow- up. The primary outcome measures were the mean weekly pain intensity and the disease activity score (DAS -28). At the end of treatment and at 3-month follow- up, a statistically significant improvement was observed in all outcome measures for both groups. There was greater improvement in the electro-acupuncture group than the control group (e.g., VAS pain 2.79 vs. 3.95) during the treatment period. This difference did not persist at the 3 -month follow- up. The clinical significance of a 1 -point difference in VAS from this small trial is unclear. 2 - MED146 A 2011 randomized trial from Europe tested the efficacy of the P- Stim in 40 female patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.[4] Patients were randomly assigned to receive auricular acupuncture or sham stimulation. Patients in the control group received electrodes without needles and the P- Stim devices were applied without electrical stimulation. The P -Stim device was placed behind the ear at the end of the operation on all patients while they were still under general anesthesia, and the dominant ear was completely covered with identical dressing in both groups to maintain blinding. Postoperatively, patients received 1,000 mg paracetamol every 6 hours, with additional piritramide given on demand. Needles and devices were removed 72 hours postoperatively. A blinded observer found no significant difference between the 2 groups in consumption of piritramide during the first 72 hours postoperatively (acupuncture vs. placebo: 15.3 mg vs. 13.9 mg, respectively) or on VAS scores taken at 0, 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours (average of 2.32 vs. 2.62, acupuncture vs. placebo, respectively). In this small study, use of the P-stim device was not associated with improved pain management following gynecologic surgery, although the study size may have been too small to find differences between groups where they existed. Clinical Practice Guidelines There are no evidence- based clinical practice guidelines that recommend the use of auricular electrostimulation devices for any indication . Summary The evidence available at this time is insufficient to evaluate the effect of auricular electrostimulation on health outcomes, including acute and chronic pain. Additional randomized studies with a larger number of subjects are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment approach. Therefore, auricular electrostimulation is considered investigational.

Question Source : ICD-10 pediatric metabolic consultants Dr. Buist, and Dr. Dave Koeller, OHSU Genzyme pharmaceuticals Issue: At the August 2012 VBBS/HERC meetings enzyme replacement therapies (with the exception of infantile Pompe's disease) were included on Line 684, including treatment of Gaucher's disease. At that time, there was no high quality data (Cochrane reviews or randomized controlled trials) identified to support coverage. Those studies that were identified appear to focus on primary endpoints of hemoglobin concentrations and not on patient-oriented outcomes. Since that time, the ICD-10 pediatric metabolic consultants Drs. Buist and Koeller have approached staff with additional evidence and the makers of Cerezyme have also submitted evidence with the request that since this is so rare RCT evidence is not available and case series and registries should be considered. Clinical Background: Gaucher disease is characterized by a deficiency of \u00df-glucocerebrosidase activity, resulting in accumulation of glucocerebroside in tissue macrophages which become engorged and are typically found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and occasionally in lung, kidney, and intestine. Secondary hematologic sequelae include severe anemia and thrombocytopenia in addition to the characteristic progressive hepatosplenomegaly , skeletal complications, including osteonecrosis and osteopenia with secondary pathological fractures.

Aetna considers alglucerase, imiglucerase, miglustat, taliglucerase alfa, and velaglucerase alfa experimental and investigational for all other indications because of insufficient evidence in the peer-reviewed literature. This policy is based, in part, on the recommendations of the International Collaborative Gaucher Group U.S. Regional Coordinators and the National Institutes of Health Technology Assessment Conference on Gaucher Disease. Cigna, 2012 Cigna covers the following long-term enzyme replacement therapies as medically necessary for Type 1 imiglucerase miglustat (Zavesca\u00ae) as medically necessary for the treatment of mild to moderate Type 1 Gaucher disease in adults for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option. When coverage is available and medically necessary, the dosage, frequency, site of administration, and duration of enzyme replacement therapy should be reasonable, clinically appropriate, and supported by evidence-based literature and adjusted based upon severity, alternative available treatments, and previous response to enzyme replacement therapy. Health Partners, 2011 Enzyme replace ment therapy for Gaucher's disease is considered medically necessary for pediatric and adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Type I Gaucher disease resulting in one or more of the following conditions: moderate to severe anemia, thrombocytopenia with bleeding tendency, bone disease, significant hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The labeled dosage is 60 units/kg administered every other week as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. However, after therapeutic goals are achieved, the lowest effective dose should be used. Annual reauthorizations will require (1) a statement of progress against therapy goals which should include assessments of hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver and/or spleen volumes by MRI (when MRI is clinically indicated); and (2) for all regimens using more than 30 units/kg every other week, a statement of medical necessity indicating that the lowest effective dose to maintain therapeutic goals is being used. Cost information Based on a recommended dosing of 60U/kg every 2 weeks, the monthly cost for a 100kg person would be $50,088. This translates to an annual cost of $601,056. Summary There are no high quality studies to support the use of enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher Type 1. There are case series and cohort studies without controls that demonstrate improvements in hemoglobin, platelets, spleen size, liver size, bone density , bone crises, and bone pain. There is a single comparative study that found improvement in bone mineral density at 8 years. There is no data available about patients who discontinue therapy or who choose not to be on therapy compared to those remaining on therapy. This comparative data would be possible to obtain from the registry. There no evidence to show that ongoing treatment with ERT prevents long-term clinical complications (e.g. infection, hospitalization, and mortality). HERC Staff Recommendation 1. Option 1: Make no change. Await comparative data to demonstrate efficacy on patient-oriented outcomes. 2. Option 2: If the decision is made to prioritize this therapy higher, Guideline Note 67 would need to be modified as follows : GUIDELINE NOTE 67, ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY Lines 67, 264,684 Enzyme replacement therapy for Type 1 Gaucher disease is included on Line 67 and for infantile Pompe's disease is included on Line 264. All other enzyme replacement therapies are included on Line 684. Consider adding this additional wording to the guideline: Enzyme replacement therapy is only included on Line 67 for Type 1 Gaucher's disease in adults when at least two or three of the following criteria are met: Moderate to severe anemia (hemoglobin less than or equal to 11.5 g/dL (adult women) or 12.5 g/dL (adult men) or less than or equal to 1.0 g/dL or more below the lower limit of normal for age and sex); or Signi ficant hepatomegaly (liver size 1.25 or more times normal (1,750 cc in adults)) or splenomegaly (spleen size 5 or more times normal (875 cc in adults)); or Skeletal disease beyond mild osteopenia and Erlenmeyer flask deformity; or Symptomatic disease, including abdominal or bone pain, fatigue, exertional limitation, weakness, or cachexia; or Thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than or equal to 120,000/mm3) with bleeding history For children and adolescents with Type 1 Gaucher's disease , the above criteri a do not need to be met, they simply must be symptomatic. For all recipients of enzyme replacement therapy there needs to documentation of responsiveness to the enzyme replacement therapy and the lowest effective dose should be used in order for continued coverage.

INTRODUCTION TO LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISORDERS Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles that contain numerous acid hydrolases whose function is to catabolize a wide range of macromolecules including lipids, proteins and complex carbohydrates1. They play a critical role in the normal cellular metabolism, protein localization, membrane transport, development and cell intercommunication.1 If there is an absence or defective function of one of these enzymes, there is a bottleneck in the catabolic pathway leading to progressive accumulation of specific macromolecules. This progressive accumulation of substrate eventually interferes with cellular function.1 Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) include over 40 monogenic inherited disorders that are a consequence of a deficiency of a single enzyme or protein.1 The genetic causes of most have been identified. Currently no definitive genotype-phenotype correlation has been demonstrated in most LSDs and therefore genotype often does not predict the clinical course of the disease nor does residual enzyme activity levels.2 LSDs are all extremely rare and are part of a la rger category called \"orphan diseases\". Orphan diseases are defined as conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 patients.3 The collective prevalence of LSDs has been estimated at 1 in 7700 individuals.4 LSDs differ from each other by a number of variables including the underlying genetic defect, the associated enzyme deficiency, the substrate stored and the cell types affected. Because of this, LSDs encompass remarkable heterogeneity.2 Given how rare these disorders occur, the pathophysiology and natural history is often not well understood. Longitudinal data collection in disease registries for a subset of disorders has greatly helped to more clearly delineate the natural histories, although questions still remain. Research has led to various disease-specific approaches for the delivery of endogenous or exogenous lysosomal enzymes to targeted tissues via the bloodstream. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) provides the deficient enzyme exogenously and is currently available for 6 LSDs: Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Pompe disease, and Mucopolysaccharidosis types I, II and VI. Other therapeutic approaches currently used or under exploration in some LSDs include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (which provides matched donor hematopoietic Genzyme Corporation l 500 Kendall Street l Cambridge, MA l 02142, USA l T 617-252-7500 l www.genzyme.com GMRM-0039- 01 3 stem cells that can produce the missing enzyme), gene therapy, chaperone therapy and substrate reduction therapy.1 2. GAUCHER DISEASE a. OVERVIEW Gaucher disease is a lysosomal glycolipid storage disorder that results from a deficiency in activity of the lys osomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (acid -glucosidase). This enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of its substrate, glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside) in cells derived from the monocyte/macrophage system.5 Thus, Gaucher disease is an inherited metabolic disease that primarily affects organs where tissue macrophages are prevalent. b. EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INHERITANCE Published estimates of the incidence of Gaucher disease range from 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 60,000.4,6,7 The estimated prevalence of symptomatic patients in the United States is less than 3,000.6 Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and affects both males and females.5 Three subtypes of Gaucher disease are commonly recognized: type 1 (non-neuronopathic), type 2 (acute neuronopathic), and type 3 (chronic neuronopathic). Type 1 is by far the most common type, representing approximately 94% of the total Gaucher disease population.8 Onset of clinically evident signs and symptoms in type 1 Gaucher disease can occur i n childhood or late into adulthood. Onset of type 2 and type 3 occurs in infancy and childhood respectively. Patients with type 2 disease, which is characterized by severe and rapidly progressive neurological and cutaneous symptoms, usually die before 2 years of age. Patients with type 3 disease are more slowly progressive and characteristically have ophthalmologic and developmental central nervous system manifestations. Type 3 patients commonly live into their second to fourth decades of life.5 The focus of this clinical submission is on Gaucher disease type 1. c. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in the aci d -glucosidase gene, GBA. Over 300 different pathological mutations have been identified to date.6 A mutation in the GBA gene impacts the production or enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase and leads to progressive accumulation of the substrate, glucosylceramide. The hallmark of untreated Gaucher disease type 1 is the accumulation of lipid-engorged cells primarily in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and secondarily in the lungs, kidneys and intestines.5 Gaucher disease exhibits extreme phenotypic heterogeneity even among individuals with the same genotype.6 Genzyme Corporation l 500 Kendall Street l Cambridge, MA l 02142, USA l T 617-252-7500 l www.genzyme.com GMRM-0039- 01 4 d. DISEASE MANIFESTATIONS i. Natural History The natural history of this disorder has been more fully delineated through the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry. The ICGG Gaucher Registry was established in 1991. As of 2012, approximately 6000 patients have been enrolled at more than 400 sites globally. A number of clinical features of Gaucher disease have been elucidated as a result of data collected in the ICGG Gaucher Registry.9 The natural history can differ between patients with Gaucher disease type 1 in terms of age of presentation, cluster of presenting symptoms, disease progression and co- morbidities. Symptoms of Gaucher disease type 1 can present in childhood through adulthood. Signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease type 1 that manifest during the first and second decade of life are usually indicative of more rapidly progressive disease compared with disease that is diagnosed later in life.5, 24 Survival in Gaucher disease type 1 ranges from 6 to 80+ years.5 ii. Primary Clinical Manifestations The most common clinical manifestations of Gaucher disease type 1 include hematologic, visceral and bone symptoms. Hematologic manifestations Anemia (low hemoglobin level) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) are the most common hematologic manifestations of Gaucher disease. Severe anemia (hemoglobin level < 10g/dL) or moderate anemia (hemoglobin level between 10 g/dL and <12 g/dL) was found in 69% of patients with intact spleens in a study from the ICGG Gaucher Registry.8 Anemia is a major cause of fatigue in Gaucher patients. Thrombocytopenia which may be found in combination with coagulopathies, leads to easy bruising and excessive bleeding; in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding events can be life-threatening. Seventy-six percent of patients with intact spleen and 13% of splenectomized patients in the ICGG Gaucher Registry presented with moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count 60,00/mm3 120,000/mm3) to severe thrombocytopenia count < 60,000/mm3).8 Visceral manifestations The accumulation of Gaucher cells in spleen and liver can lead to massive hepatosplenomegaly. In patients with Gaucher disease type 1, a diseased spleen can be up to 70 times its normal volume and the liver can be up to 10 times its normal volume.5 This organomegaly can lead to secondary consequences such as decreased appetite, poor nutrient absorption and cachexia. A study of 1,698 patient with Gaucher disease enrolled in the ICGG disease registry found that 50% had spleen volumes more than 15 times normal and 37% had spleen volumes 5-15 times normal.8 Seventy-nine Genzyme Corporation l 500 Kendall Street l Cambridge, MA l 02142, USA l T 617-252-7500 l www.genzyme.com GMRM-0039- 01 5 percent of patients had liver volumes at least 1.25 times normal, including 23% with liver volumes more than 2.5 times normal.8 Bone manifestations While hematologic and visceral symptoms are often the most obvious manifestations of Gaucher disease, bone symptoms are typically the most debilitating. Bone disease is generally progressive and over 80% of patients with Gaucher disease have bone involvement at the time of diagnosis (Table 1).8 Bone symptoms include bone pain, osteoporosis, necrosis and loss of cortical bone. The most prevalent bone abnormality is a failure of the distal femur and the proximal tibia to remodel correctly, resulting in the classic \"Erlenmeyer flask\" appearance; this generally does not cause symptoms. Bone pain has been reported in up to one-third of patients at the time of diagnosis.8 Osteopenia is also common and is often found in pediatric as well as young adult patients. Severe bone manifestations such as lytic lesions, infarcts, avascular necrosis, fractures and joint collapse are less common but are severely painful and often incapacitating. Table 1.

Pediatric manifestations Approximately two-thirds of patients with symptomatic Gaucher disease type 1 have disease manifestations in childhood.10 Early symptoms are associated with the development of more severe manifestations. A report from the ICGG registry of 887 untreated children younger than 18 years of age with Gaucher disease type 1 showed that 34% had growth retardation, 87% had hepatomegaly, 95% had splenomegaly, had anemia, 50% thrombocytopenia, and 91% had radiologic evidence of bone disease.10 Older children tend to have significantly more severe skeletal manifestations than younger children; this may be related to the slower progression of skeletal disease or to the stress put on bone growth and remodeling during and after puberty. Children with untreated Gaucher commonly have retarded growth and have also have delayed puberty.10 iv. Associated Clinical Co-morbidities Patients with Gaucher disease may also be at increased risk for co-morbidities, including pulmonary hypertension, multiple myeloma and Parkinson disease. Genzyme Corporation l 500 Kendall Street l Cambridge, MA l 02142, USA l T 617-252-7500 l www.genzyme.com GMRM-0039- 01 7 Pulmonary hypertension Individual case reports have described glycolipid-laden macrophages lining the pulm onary capillaries, resulting in pulmonary hypertension with classic plexogenic vasculopathy. The prevalence of mild pulmonary hypertension in patients with Gaucher disease type 1 has been reported to be as high as 30%.10 Asplenic patients appear to be at higher risk primarily due to the higher migration of lipid-laden macrophages to the liver, skeleton and to lung tissue.11 Multiple Myeloma Patients with Gaucher disease type 1 are at an increased risk for developing multiple myeloma; recent estimates of the risk relative to population norms range from a 6-fold to 50-fold increase.12, 13, 14 Gaucher has also with both monoclonal and polyclonal gammopathies. Monoclonal gammopathy may precede multiple myeloma. 12 Parkinson Disease Single mutations in the GBA gene have now been established as a major genetic risk factor for developing Parkinson disease; however it is not yet clear to what degree Parkinson disease incidence is elevated in the Gaucher population, nor what is the underlying mechanism for this increased risk.15,16 e. DIAGNOSIS Gaucher disease is usually suspected based on clinical presentation (often including unexplained bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, or hematologic abnormalities) or family history . The diagnosis of Gaucher disease is made by demonstration of decreased acid -glucosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts (<30% of normal activity).1 Demonstration of two mutant alleles of the GBA gene provides diagnostic verification.1 3. CEREZYME TREATMENT a. OVERVIEW Prior to the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), the treatment of Gaucher disease was limited to symptomatic care and treatment to address anemia, hypersplenism (splenectomy), bone pain, osteopenia/osteoporosis and other bone manifestations (surgical joint replacement, analgesics, etc). These interventions fail to address the underlying pathology of Gaucher disease type 1 and in the case of splenectomy can lead to additional disease complications.17 In contrast, ERT provides an exogenous source of glucocerebrosidase that is targeted to the lysosome and breaks down the accumulated substrate. The first ERT for Gaucher disease, Ceredase\u00ae (alglucerase injection), was derived from placental tissue. Ceredase was approved by the FDA in 1991. A recombinant form of glucocerebrosidase, Cerezyme\u00ae (imiglucerase for injection), was developed and approved by the FDA in 1994. Genzyme Corporation l 500 Kendall Street l Cambridge, MA l 02142, USA l T 617-252-7500 l www.genzyme.com GMRM-0039- 01 8 Enzyme replacement therapy is the accepted standard of treatment for symptomatic patients with Gaucher disease type 1. Cerezyme has been proven to be both safe and highly effective. Cerezyme has been shown to significantly improve visceral, hematologic and skeletal signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease type 1 in both adult and pediatric patients.18,19,20, 22, 23 i. Indication Cerezyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for pediatric and adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Gaucher disease type 1 that results in one or more of the following conditions: 21 a. anemia b. thrombocytopenia c. bone disease d. hepatomegaly or splenomegaly The FDA approval for this indication was granted in May 1994. ii. Safety information Table 2 includes adverse event information. Experience in patients treated with Cerezyme shows that approximately 13.8% of patients experienced adverse events that were judged to be related to Cerezyme administration and that occurred with an increase in frequency. Symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity have been noted in approximately 6.6% of patients. Anaphylactoid reaction has also been reported in <1.5% of the total patient population. Additional adverse reactions have been reported in approximately 6.5% of the population each with an incidence of less than 1.5% each.21 Approximately 15% of patients have developed IgG antibodies, and these patients have a higher risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Therefore periodic monitoring is suggested; caution should be exercised in patients with antibodies or prior symptoms of hypersensitivity.21 The long term safety of Cerezyme has been demonstrated.20 Since the approval of Cerezyme in May 1994, Genzyme has maintained a worldwide post marketing database of spontaneously reported adverse events and adverse events discussed in the medical literature. International safety data compiled between 1997 and 2004 reveal the majority of patients have tolerated 1- to 2-hour infusions of Cerezyme without the development of adverse events and have been treated with Cerezyme for up to 10 years without any evidence of long-term toxicity.20 A review of accumulated safety data, including more than 10 years of immunosurveillance experience has not identified any new significant safety concerns about the use of Cerezyme in patients with Gaucher disease.20 Genzyme Corporation l 500 Kendall Street l Cambridge, MA l 02142, USA l T 617-252-7500 l www.genzyme.com GMRM-0039- 01 9 Table 2.

OUTCOME DATA AND SUPPORTING CLINICAL EVIDENCE i. Original Treatment Study Ceredase Pivotal Trial The original pivotal trial showed the impact of Ceredase on Gaucher disease type 1.22 Splenic and hepatic volumes decreased in all patients within 6 months. No antibodies to Ceredase were developed during the trial. Hemoglobin levels increased significantly. Infusions were well tolerated, and side effects were minimal. Quality of life improved (patient assessment). ii. Randomized Controlled Study Cerezyme Pivotal Trial: Ceredase Versus Cerezyme Comparative Efficacy Study A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial established that there are no significant clinical differences between Ceredase and Cerezyme.23 There were no significant differences in hepatic or splenic volume changes between the Cerezyme and Ceredase groups. Therapeutic response to Cerezyme was not diminished because of anti- glucocerebrosidase antibody development. iii. Open Label Study Skeletal Response 1) A prospective, nonrandomized, open-label study of 33 Cerezyme- or Ceredase- na\u00efve patients with skeletal manifestations of Gaucher disease type 1 found the following:25 Genzyme Corporation l 500 Kendall Street l Cambridge, MA l 02142, USA l T 617-252-7500 l www.genzyme.com GMRM-0039- 01 10 Cerezyme treatment significantly reduced bone pain after 3 months of therapy, and this effect was sustained throughout the rest of the 4-year observational period. Lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) significantly improved after 24 months of Cerezyme therapy and continued to improve thereafter, reaching near-normal levels at 48 months. Femoral neck BMD increased significantly after 36 months of Cerezyme therapy. iv. Registry Data As mentioned earlier in this document, the ICGG Gaucher Registry was established in 1991 by the International Collaborative Gaucher Group to longitudinally track the clinical assessments and clinical outcomes of patients with Gaucher disease, irrespective of treatment status. The ICGG Gaucher Registry is supported by Genzyme Corporation and governed by an international group of physician advisors. It is the largest observational registry for Gaucher disease in the world and currently includes data on more than 6,000 patients from more than 60 countries. The data collected include demographic variables, disease characteristics (including genotype, spleen status, hematologic parameters, liver function data, and liver and spleen volumes), clinical and radiologic assessments of skeletal involvement, quality of life measures and therapeutic goals. Analyses of ICGG Gaucher Registry data provide valuable information that can be applied to optimizing disease management. This information has included:18, 8, 19 Ongoing insight into the Gaucher disease process Demographics and disease characteristics The effects of Cerezyme on various clinical manifestations of Gaucher disease Assessment of success in achieving and maintaining established therapeutic goals Large, randomized, controlled clinical studies in rare diseases are difficult to conduct; the ICGG Gaucher Registry provides an alternative source of data for evidence-based decision-making for individual physicians and managed care organizations. From 1991 through 2009, ICGG Gaucher Registry data have made possible 31 peer-reviewed publications on Gaucher disease, including 15 papers analyzing the natural history of the disease and 16 papers considering the observed effects of enzyme replacement therapy with Ceredase and Cerezyme. Effectiveness of Long-term Enzyme Replacement Therapy 1) An analysis of long-term (2 to 5 years) effects of treatment with Ceredase o r Cerezyme based on 1,028 patients in the observational ICGG Gaucher Registry found the following:18 82% of patients with a history of bone crises reported none within the first year of treatment.

Improvements in hemoglobin levels, platelet counts, and liver and spleen volumes were sustained after 3 to 5 years of treatment. 2) A recent analysis of 757 patients at baseline and after 10 years of ERT in patients enrolled in the ICGG Gaucher Registry showed improvements across disease parameters including: 26 Sustained increases in hemoglobin level and platelet count Sustained decreases in liver and spleen volumes Improvements seen in both splenectomized and non-splenectomized patients. Skeletal Response 1) A retrospective analysis of the effects of treatment with Cerezyme (n=342), compared with no treatment (n=160), over an 8-year observational period found the following: 27 Treatment with Cerezyme 60 U/kg every 2 weeks resulted in a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD over time Mean BMD levels approached the mean value for the normal healthy population after 8 years of treatment. Increases in lumbar spine BMD were dose-dependent. 2) A retrospective analysis of patients with Gaucher disease type 1 who had bone pain (n=244) or bone crisis (n=219) before Cerezyme/Ceredase treatment found the following: 28 Cerezyme or Ceredase treatment significantly reduced the frequency of bone pain and bone crisis during each of 3 years of treatment compared with the pretreatment frequency. The frequency of bone crisis was significantly reduced from 17% before treatment to 5%, <1%, and 3% in the first, second, and third year of Cerezyme or Ceredase treatment, respectively. The frequency of bone pain decreased from 49% before treatment to 30%, 29%, and 30% in the first, second, and third years of Cerezyme or Ceredase treatment, respectively. No significant differences were seen between the two treatments. 3) A retrospective analysis of 2,700 patients enrolled in the Gaucher registry who were not diagnosed with avascular necrosis (AVN) prior to inclusion were included in a study to determine whether the time from diagnosis to initiation of treatment with Cerezyme influenced the rate of avascular necrosis in these patients. 29 An incidence rate of 13.8 per 1,000 person years was observed in patients not receiving ERT In patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase, an incidence rate of 8.1 per 1,000 person years was observed In contrast, an AVN incidence rate of 16.6 per 1,000 person years was observed in patients who initiated therapy greater than two years after initial diagnosis Genzyme Corporation l 500 Kendall Street l Cambridge, MA l 02142, USA l T 617-252-7500 l www.genzyme.com GMRM-0039- 01 12 The adjusted incidence ratio in the treated group overall was 0.59 Pediatric data 1) A study from the ICGG Gaucher Registry analyzed clinical responses to long-term Ceredase or Cerezyme treatment (8 years) for 884 children with Gaucher disease type 1 found the following: 30 Visceral: Liver and spleen volumes decreased from 2.0 and 23 multiples of normal, respectively, at baseline to near-normal or normal volumes in all children after 8 years of Ceredase or Cerezyme treatment.

THERAPEUTIC GOALS Due to its heterogeneity, the management of Gaucher disease requires an individualized approach to treatment that takes into consideration the patient's disease manifestations and disease burden as well as quality of life needs. 31,32 Physicians from the ICGG who are expert in the management of patients with Gaucher disease, have developed a disease management algorithm that includes evaluation and monitoring guidelines, evidence based therapeutic goals and guidelines for individualized dosing. Ideally, patients with Gaucher disease can be enrolled in the ICGG Registry to track therapeutic goals and patient outcomes and benchmark against aggregate patient data. Key therapeutic goals are listed in the table 3. Monitoring guidelines are provided in Appendix B.

SUMMARY Gaucher disease is a lysosomal glycolipid storage disorder that results from a deficiency in activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase and resulting accumulation of the substrate glucosylceramide. Clinical manifestations include serious hematologic and visceral complications and debilitating bone disease. Gaucher disease is highly variable in presentation and age of onset. Earlier onset, especially in children, is associated with a more severe course of disease. Enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease provides an exogenous source of the missing enzyme. Cerezyme is a recombinant ERT manufactured by Genzyme, a Sanofi Company. Expected outcomes of ERT with Cerezyme in adult and pediatric patients with Gaucher disease type 1 include: decreased hepatomegaly and splenomegaly18,30 normalization of hemoglobin levels and reversal of anemia in most patients18,26,30 reversal of thrombocytopenia to levels sufficient to prevent bleeding (reduced clotting)18,30 reduction in bone marrow infiltration33,34,35 Reduction in frequency of bone crises and bone pain18,25,28,30 improvement in bone mineral density (BMD) (lumbar spine and femoral neck)25,27,30 acceleration of growth in growth-retarded children 30 attainment of normal height in most children after 8 years of treatment 30 Improvement of health-related quality of life 36,37 Low incidence of treatment-related or treatment-limiting adverse events20 Low rate of formation of IgG antibody to imiglucerase (~15%) 20 Genzyme Corporation l 500 Kendall Street l Cambridge, MA l 02142, USA l T 617-252-7500 l www.genzyme.com GMRM-0039- 01 14 5.

Clin Genet effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on bone crisis and bone pain was investigated in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) type 1 followed over 4 years. Data from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry were used. Only patients with bone crisis and/or bone pain data for 1 year prior to ERT, and for each of 3 years after the start of ERT, were included. Bone crises were reported in 17% of patients during the year before starting ERT. The frequencies of bone crises decreased to 5%, ,1% and 3% for 1, 2, and 3 years after initiation of treatment, respectively (p ,0.0001). Bone pain followed a similar pattern of response. Bone pain was reported in 49% of patients the year before treatment and decreased to 30% in the first year, 29% inthe second year, and 30% in the third year of ERT (p ,0.0001).

It results from deficient activity of acid b-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.45; glucocerebrosidase), which leads to the accumu-lation of glucosylceramide in organs that contain large numbers of cells in the monocytic/macro- phage lineage (1). GD type 1 is differentiated from GD type 2 and GD type 3 by the absence of primary central nervous system involvement (1). The bone marrow and mineralized skeleton are prominent sites of pathology in GD type 1 (1, 2). Nearly all patients have radiologic evidence of bone marrow infiltration and expansion because of the presence of populations of characteristic macrophage-derived storage Gaucher cells (1-3).Untreated, many patients suffer progressive and often disabling morbidity attributable to skeletal complications, including osteopenia, lytic lesions, pathological fractures, avascular necrosis, and joint destruction (3-5). Skeletal manifestations can be severe in both splenectomized patients and those with intact spleens. Affected patients can have major skeletal disease in the presence of asymptomatic hepatosplenomegaly and/or mini- mally altered hematologic parameters (3, 5-6). Symptoms of bone disease in patients with GD include bone crisis and bone pain (1, 3). Bone crises are often associated with acute bone infarction. They typically begin with regional dull, aching pains that become intense and 205\u00a9 2008 Dove Medical Press Limited.

Intravenous enzyme replacement with imiglucerase is the accepted standard for treatment of symptomatic patients and has been effective in reducing many of the signs and symptoms of type I Gaucher disease in the majority of patients without serious adverse effects. An alternative therapeutic approach is substrate reduction therapy with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) (miglustat; reduces intracellular storage of glucosylceramide. Miglustat was recently approved in Europe and the United States for symptomatic patients with mild to moderate clinical manifestations for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not an option. This review article discusses the results of clinical studies and use of miglustat as a therapeutic agent in patients with type I Gaucher disease.Keywords: Gaucher disease, miglustat, substrate reduction therapy First described by Dr. Philippe Gaucher in 1882, Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by the de ciency of glucocerebrosidase, and is characterized by the accumulation of glycosylceramide that leads to dysfunction in multiple organ systems (Beutler and Grabowski 1995). Three types of Gaucher disease have been described, but, actually, these represent different degrees of severity along a spectrum. The clinical features of type I Gaucher disease, the non-neuronopathic form, are sple-nomegaly, which is more prominent than the hepatomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and bone lesions. Type II Gaucher disease is the most severe form, which presents with severe central nervous system involvement and is generally fatal within the rst 2 years of life. Type III Gaucher disease, the subacute neuronopathic form, presents in early childhood with severe manifestations resembling type I (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and bone lesions) and has a more chronic course with onset of neurological disease towards the end of the rst decade (Beutler and Grabowski 1995). In 1991, the advent of targeted enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using algucerase (Ceredase \u00ae; Genzyme by the introduction of imiglucerase (Cer- ezyme\u00ae; Genzyme Corporation) resulted in huge improvements in the treatment of patients with Gaucher disease. Imiglucerase is a modi ed form of glucocerebrosidase, created using recombinant DNA technology, and is given as intravenous infusions, usually every other week. Imiglucerase acts like the naturally occurring enzyme glu-cocerebrosidase to break down the glucosylceramide that has accumulated in Gaucher cells (Barton et al 1991; Grabowski et al 1998). In the majority of patients (/H1102290%), ERT has been effective in reducing many of the signs and symptoms of type I Gaucher disease but has no or limited effect on the neurologic ndings of type II and III Gaucher disease because of its inability to cross the blood - brain barrier (Weinreb et al 2002).

The e/C128ect of enzyme replacement therapy on health-related quality of life in 25 adults with type 1 Gaucher disease was investigated over a 2-year period. Quality of life was assessed using the SF-36Health Survey (SF-36). Psychological functioningwas assessed using the Symptom Checklist-90R. Theresults indicated signicant improvement in 7 of 8 SFscale scores beginning at 18 months of therapy(P< 0.05 to 0.001). The SF scale showing im- provement rst was Vitality (energy level and fatigue) at 6 months of therapy ( P< 0.01). The SF-36 scales showing the largest improvements were Role-Physical and Social Functioning ( P< 0.001). Compared tothe general US adult population, the study popula-tion's health prole was signicantly lower prior to starting therapy but by 24 months of therapy there were no di/C128erences between the two. No di/C128erenceswere found in psychological functioning compared toa US adult normative group at the start of therapy.However, within the study population there was sig-nicant improvement in mood and global functioningand fewer psychological symptoms reported at 24months of therapy. The ndings indicate that enzyme replacement therapy for type 1 Gaucher disease has a positive impact on health-related quality of life fromthe patient's perspective. Key words: Enzyme replacement therapy, Gaucher disease, Quality of life Introduction Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which there is deciency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase and accumulation ofglycosphingolipids. Lipid deposit occurs primarily inthe spleen, liver and bone marrow with resultant or-gan dysfunction and clinical symptomatology [1].Chronic, non-neuronopathic Gaucher type 1 is themost prevalent form of the disorder. Incidence is es-timated to be 1/40,000-60,000 in the non-Ashkenazi Jewish population and up to 1/1000 in the Ashkenazi Jewish group. Patients with type 1 disease show sig-nicant variability in age of clinical presentation, inseverity of symptoms and in long-term disability.Patients may be asymptomatic or manifest somecombination of anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepato-splenomegaly and/or bone disease [2]. Gene identication has allowed for delineation of ve mutations which account for the vast majority ofmolecular defects in the Ashkenazi Jewish population(95%) and somewhat less (50%) for the non-Jewishcases [3]. Although there has been some general cor-relation between specic mutation burden and se-verity of clinical symptoms, correlation is notinvariant and clinical course is largely unpredictable[4]. This is particularly true of bone disease whichmay be insidious in onset and progression but even- tually disabling [5]. The development of enzyme replacement therapy in 1990 ushered in a new era of treatment for Gau- cher disease. E/C128ectiveness of treatment as monitoredby physiologic parameters has been documented formany but not all patients [6, 7]. Because enzyme re-placement therapy is costly and must be maintainedfor life, assessment of general health improvement, both physical and mental, is critical to evaluating the value of therapeutic intervention. This is particularlyimportant given the phenotypic variability in theclinical course of patients, both with and withoutenzyme replacement. Given the extraordinary costand the degree of uncertainty in predicting the clinicalcourse of the disease, understanding the potentialbenets of therapy beyond improvements in physio- logical parameters and observable symptoms is rele- vant [4, 8, 9]. Measurement of health-related quality of life is now widely used in health outcomes research and longitu-dinal monitoring of health status [10-12].

Summary Disease characteristics. Gaucher disease (GD) encompasses a continuum of clinical findings from a perinatal lethal disorder to an asymptomatic type. The identification of three major clinical types (1, 2, and 3) and two other subtypes (perinatal-lethal and cardiovascular) is useful in determining prognosis and management. GD type 1 ischaracterized by the presence of clinical or radiographic evidence of bone disease (osteopenia, focal lytic orsclerotic lesions, and osteonecrosis), hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and thrombocytopenia, lung disease, and theabsence of primary central nervous system disease. GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by the presence ofprimary neurologic disease; in the past, they were distinguished by age of onset and rate of disease progression,but these distinctions are not absolute. Disease with onset before age two years, limited psychomotordevelopment, and a rapidly progressive course with death by age two to four years is classified as GD type 2.Individuals with GD type 3 may have onset before age two years, but often have a more slowly progressivecourse and may live into the third or fourth decade. The perinatal-lethal form is associated with ichthyosiform orcollodion skin abnormalities or with nonimmune hydrops fetalis. The cardiovascular form is characterized bycalcification of the aortic and mitral valves, mild splenomegaly, corneal opacities, and supranuclearophthalmoplegia. Cardiopulmonary complications have been described with all the clinical subtypes, althoughvarying in frequency and severity. Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of GD relies on demonstration of deficient glucosylceramidase enzyme activity in peripheral blood leukocytes or other nucleated cells. Carrier testing by assay of enzyme activity is unreliable because of overlap in enzyme activity between carriers and non-carriers. Identification of two disease-causingalleles in GBA, the only gene in which mutations are known to cause GD, provides additional confirm ation of the diagnosis but should not be used for diagnosis in lieu of biochemical testing. Management. Treatment of manifestations: When possible, management by a multidisciplinary team at a Comprehensive Gaucher Center. For persons not receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT), symptomatic treatment includes partial or total splenectomy for massive splenomegalyand thrombocytopenia. Supportive care for all affected individuals may include: transfusion of blood products forsevere anemia and bleeding, analgesics for bone pain, joint replacement surgery for relief from chronic pain andrestoration of function, and oral bisphosphonates and calcium for osteopenia. Prevention of primary manifestations: ERT is usually well tolerated and provides sufficient exogenous enzyme to overcome the block in the catabolic pathway, clearing the stored substrate, GL1, and thus reversing hematologicand liver/spleen involvement. Individuals with severe GD, primarily those with chronic neurologic involvement (GDtype 3), can benefit from bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

In this 48-month, prospective,non-randomized, open-label study of the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on bone response, 33 imiglucerase-na \u00a8ve patients (median age 43 years with one or more skeletal manifestations such as osteopenia,history of bone crisis, or other documented bone pathology) received imiglucerase 60 U/kg/2 weeks. Substantial improvements were observed in bone pain (BP), bone crises (BC), and bone mineral density (BMD). Improvements in BP were observed at 3 months (p ,0.001 vsbaseline) and continued progressively throughout the study, with 39% of patientsreporting pain at 48 months vs73% at baseline. Eleven of the 13 patients with a pre-treatment history of BC had no recurrences. Biochemicalmarkers for bone formation increased; markers for bone resorption decreased. Steady improvement of spine and femoral neck BMD, measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was noted. Mean Z score for spine increased from 20.72/C61.302 at baseline to near-normal levels (20.09/C61.503) by month 48 (p \u00bc0.042) and for femoral neck from20.59/C61.352 to 20.17/C61.206 (p \u00bc0.035) at month 36. This increase was sustained at 48 months. With imiglucerase treatment,patients should anticipate resolution of BC, rapid improvement in BP, increases in BMD, and decreased skeletal complications.KB Simsa, GM Pastoresb, D aDepartment Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA,bDepartment of Neurology, New York University, New York, NY, USA, cUniversity Research Foundation for Lysosomal Storage Disease, Inc., CoralSprings, FL, USA, dDepartment of Human Genetics, University of Pittsburgh,Pittsburgh, PA, USA, eTower Hematology Oncology Medical Group, Beverly Hills,CA, USA, fDepartment of Pediatric Genetics, University of California SanFrancisco, San Francisco, CA, USA, gDepartment of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA, andhGenzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA Re-use of this article is permitted in accordance with the Creative CommonsDeed, Attribution 2.5, which does notpermit commercial exploitation.

Weinreb, MD, Joel Charrow, MD, Hans C. Andersson, MD, Paige Kaplan, MD, Edwin H. Kolodny, MD, Pramod Mistry, MD, Gregory Pastores, MD, Barry E. Rosenbloom, MD, C. Ronald Scott, MD, Rebecca S. Wappner, MD, Ari Zimran, MD PURPOSE: Gaucher disease is the rst lysosomal storage dis- order to be treated with macrophage-targeted enzyme replace- ment therapy. Previous studies in relatively small numbers ofpatients demonstrated short-term efcacy of this treatment.This study describes the effects of 2 to 5 years of treatment onspecic manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Physicians reported data from 1028 patients to the Gaucher Registry. Assessment of responseincluded serial measurements of hemoglobin concentration,platelet count, liver and spleen volumes, and the occurrence ofbone pain and bone crises.RESULTS: Among anemic patients, hemoglobin concentra- tion increased to normal or near normal within 6 to 12 months,with a sustained response through 5 years. In thrombocytope-nic patients with intact spleens, the most rapid response oc-curred during the rst 2 years, with slower improvement there-after. The likelihood of achieving a normal platelet count de-creased with increasing severity of baseline thrombocytopenia.In patients who had undergone splenectomy, platelet countsreturned to normal within 6 to 12 by 30% to 40% during follow-up; splenomegaly de-creased to 60%, but rarely to volumes below ve timesnormal size. In patients with pretreatment bone pain or bonecrises, 52% (67/128) were pain free after 2 years and 94% (48/51) reported no additional crises.CONCLUSION: Enzyme replacement therapy prevents pro- gressive manifestations of Gaucher disease, and amelioratesGaucher disease-associated anemia, thrombocytopenia, orga-nomegaly, bone pain, and bone J Med. 2002;113: 112-119. \u00a92002 by Excerpta Medica, Inc. Type 1 Gaucher disease is a multi-system disease caused by a genetic deciency of lysosomal gluco-cerebrosidase (1). Its clinical manifestations in- clude thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly,and bone dysplasia (2). placental tissue, or imiglucerase, a recombi-nant the same effectiveness as alglu-cerase [3]) ameliorates anemia and thrombocytopenia,decreases organomegaly (4), and may improve or preventthe progression of bone disease (5). The individual response to treatment is difcult to pre- dict because the clinical expression of disease is highlyvariable. This report from the Gaucher Registry presentsthe 2- to 5-year effects of enzyme replacement therapy onthe specic manifestations of the disease as a benchmarkfor assessment of individual responses in terms of hema-tologic abnormalities, organomegaly, skeletal pain, andbone crises. METHODS Patients The organization of the Gaucher Registry has been de- scribed by Charrow et al. (6). Eligible patients had type 1Gaucher disease and were treated with alglucerase (Cere-dase, Massachusetts)or imiglucerase (Cerezyme, Genzyme atleast 6 months. All patients had baseline (pretreatment)data and at least one response parameter during 6 to 60months of monitoring.

PII S0002-9343(02)01150-6Effect of Enzyme Replacement Therapy With Imiglucerase on BMD in Type 1 Gaucher Disease A Zimran,6 and The effect of ERT with imiglucerase on BMD in type 1 GD was studied using BMD data from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry. Data were analyzed for 160 untreatedpatients and 342 ERT-treated patients. Imiglucerase significantly improves BMD in patients with GD, with 8years of ERT leading to normal BMD. Introduction: The objective was to determine the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT; Cerezyme, imiglucerase) on BMD in type 1 Gaucher disease (GD). Materials and Methods: The study population included all adults (men, 18-70 years; women, 18-50 years) enrolled in the International Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry for whom lumbar spineBMD measurements were available. BMD data with up to 8 years of follow-up were analyzed for 160 patientswho received no ERT and 342 patients treated with ERT alone. BMD was assessed by DXA of the lumbarspine. Z scores for patients with GD were compared with a reference population. From the model's estimate,percent of patients by age and sex with osteoporosis (T score /H113492.5) were calculated. Results: DXA Z scores for patients with GD in the no ERT (untreated) group were significantly below normal (yintercept /H115050.80 Z score units, p< 0.001) and remained 1 SD below the reference population over time (slope/H115050.010 Z score units per year, p/H115050.68). The DXA Z scores for patients with GD who received ERT at a dose of 60 U/kg/2 weeks were significantly lower than the reference population at baseline (y -intercept /H11505 1.17 Z score units, p< 0.001), but improved significantly over time (slope /H11505+0.132 Z score units per year, p< 0.001). A significant dose-response relationship was noted for the ERT group, with the slopes for the three main dosing groups of 15, 30, and 60 U/kg/2 weeks of +0.064, +0.086, and +0.132 Z score units per year,respectively. The BMD of patients with GD treated with ERT increased to 0.12 (60 U/kg/2 weeks), 0.48 (30U/kg/2 weeks), and 0.66 (15 U/kg/2 weeks) SD of the mean of the reference population after 8 years of ERT,approaching the reference population. Estimated risk of osteoporosis of this GD population, if left untreated,ranged from 10 to 30% in women and 10% to 25% in men. Conclusions: ERT with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) may increase BMD in patients with GD. Response to treatment with imiglucerase is slower for BMD than for hematologic and visceral aspects of GD. A normal(age- and sex-adjusted) BMD should be a therapeutic goal for patients with type 1 GD.J Bone Miner Res 2007;21:119-126.

(Blood. 2010;115(23):4651-4656) Introduction Gaucher disease (GD) is a multisystem disorder involving the liver, spleen, bone marrow, skeleton, lungs, and occasionally the centralnervous system. GD is an autosomal the deciency of /H9252-glucocerebrosidase. 1Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is currently the standard of care for thetreatment of symptomatic Gaucher disease. Alglucerase injection(Ceredase; placental-derived /H9252-glucocerebrosidase was the rst enzyme formulation approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for thetreatment of type 1 GD. Imiglucerase for injection (Cerezyme;Genzyme Corporation), a recombinant analog of /H9252-glucocerebrosi- dase produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, received FDAapproval in 1994 and gradually replaced alglucerase. Both enzy- matic preparations have been generally well tolerated and efca-cious in the improvement of type 1 Gaucher-related hematologicabnormalities and reduction of hepatosplenomegaly. 1-3 as gene-activated [GA-GCB]) is an investigational human /H9252-glucocerebro- sidase, produced in a human cell line using proprietary Gene Activationtechnology (Shire Human Genetic Therapies Inc [Shire HGT]). It (/H11011 63 that targets macrophages via mannose receptors, andacts to degrade accumulated glucocerebroside within the macrophages. 4 The amino acid sequence of velaglucerase alfa is identical to that of thehuman, wild-type enzyme, unlike imiglucerase, which differs from thewild-type human enzyme sequence by a single amino acid substitutionat position 495. 2Another distinguishing structural feature is that velaglucerase alfa has higher /H9251-mannosyl content than imiglucerase.To evaluate the safety and efcacy of velaglucerase alfa, a phase 1/2 trial was performed. The primary objective was to assess the safety of velaglucerase alfa administered intravenously at a dose of60 U/kg every other week for 9 months in adult patients withsymptomatic type 1 (nonneuronopathic) Gaucher disease (GD1).The secondary objective of this trial was to assess the clinicalactivity of velaglucerase alfa on key disease features. 1The extension study was similarly designed to evaluate the long-termsafety and assess the effects of velaglucerase alfa on 4 diseasemeasures: hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, liver volume,and spleen volume. 1The results of the 9-month phase 1/2 open-label, single-center study of velaglucerase alfa and its 39-month extension, through 48 total months, are reported here. Methods The phase 1/2 and extension study were conducted in a single center (Gaucher Clinic, Shaare Zedek Medical Center). These studies wereconducted in compliance with US Food and Drug Administration regula-tions and approved by the Gaucher Clinic Institutional Helsinki (Ethics)Committee and the Israeli Ministry of Health. The start of the phase 1/2 trial(April 2004) predated the July 2005 requirement for registration withNational Institutes of Health. The extension trial was registered asNCT00391625 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00391625?order /H110058).

Cerezyme \u00ae is produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian cell culture (Chinese hamster ovary). Purified imiglucerase is a monomeric glycoprotein of 497 containing 4 N-linked (Mr = 60,430). Imiglucerase differs from placental glucocerebrosidase by one amino acid at position 495, where histidine is substituted for arginine. The oligosaccharide chains at the glycosylation sites have been modified to terminate in mannose sugars.The modified carbohydrate structures on imiglucerase are somewhat different from those on placental glucocerebrosidase. These mannose-terminated oligosaccharide chains of imiglucerase are specifically recognized by endocytic carbohydrate receptors on macrophages, the cells that accumulate lipid in Gaucher disease. Cerezyme \u00ae is supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white lyophilized product. The quantitative composition of the lyophilized drug is provided in the following table: *This provides a respective withdrawal dose of 200 and 400 units of imiglucerase. An enzyme unit (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 micromole of the synthetic substrate para-nitrophenyl-\u00df-D-glucopyranoside (pNP-Glc) per minute at 37\u00b0C.The product is stored at 2-8\u00b0C (36-46\u00b0F). After reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the imiglucerase concentration is 40 U/mL(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for final concentrations and volumes). Reconstituted solutions have a pH of approximately 6.1. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYMechanism of Action/Pharmacodynamics Gaucher disease is characterized by a deficiency of \u00df-glucocerebrosidase activity, resulting in accumulation of glucocerebroside in tissue macrophages which become engorged and are typically found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and occasionally in lung, kidney, and intestine. Secondary hematologic sequelae include severe anemia and thrombocytopenia in addition to the characteristic progressive hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal complications, including osteonecrosis and osteopenia with secondary the hydrolysis glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. In clinical trials, Cerezyme improved anemia and thrombocytopenia, reduced spleen and liver size, and decreased cachexia to a degree similar to that observed with Ceredase \u00ae (alglucerase injection). Pharmacokinetics During one-hour intravenous infusions (7.5, 15, 60 U/kg) of Cerezyme\u00ae (imiglucerase for injection), steady-state enzymatic activity was achieved by 30 minutes. Following infusion, plasma enzymatic activity declined rapidly with a half-life ranging from 3.6 to 10.4 minutes. Plasma clearance ranged from 9.8 to 20.3 mL/min/kg (mean \u00b1 S.D., 14.5 \u00b1 4.0 mL/min/kg). The volume of distribution corrected for weight ranged from 0.09 to 0.15 L/kg (0.12 \u00b1 0.02 L/kg). These variables do not appear to be influenced by dose or duration of infusion. However, only one or two patients were studied at each dose level and infusion rate. The pharmacokinetics of Cerezyme do not appear to be different from placental-derived alglucerase ( Ceredase\u00ae). In patients who developed IgG Cerezyme , an apparent effect on serum enzyme levels resulted in diminished volume of distribution and clearance and increased elimination half-life compared to patients without antibody (see WARNINGS). INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cerezyme\u00ae (imiglucerase for injection) is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for pediatric and adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease that results in one or more of the following conditions: a. anemia b. thrombocytopenia c. bone disease d. hepatomegaly or splenomegaly CONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no known contraindications to the use of Cerezyme \u00ae (imiglucerase for injection). Treatment with Cerezyme should be carefully re-evaluated if there is significant clinical evidence of hypersensitivity to the product. WARNINGSApproximately 15% of patients treated and tested to date have developed IgG antibody to Cerezyme \u00ae (imiglucerase for injection) during the first year of therapy. Patients who developed IgG antibody did so largely within 6 months of treatment and rarely developed antibodies to Cerezyme after 12 months of therapy. Approximately 46% of patients with detectable IgG antibodies experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity. Patients with antibody to Cerezyme have a higher risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Conversely, not all patients with symptoms of hypersensitivity have detectable IgG antibody. It is suggested that patients be monitored periodically for IgG antibody formation during the first year of treatment. Treatment with Cerezyme should be approached with caution in patients who have exhibited symptoms of hypersensitivity to the product. Anaphylactoid reaction has been reported in less than 1% of the patient population. Further treatment with imiglucerase should be conducted with caution. Most patients have successfully continued therapy after a reduction in rate of infusion and pretreatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. PRECAUTIONS General In less than 1% of the patient population, pulmonary hypertension and pneumonia have also been observed during treatment with Cerezyme \u00ae (imiglucerase for injection). Pulmonary hypertension and pneumonia are known complications of Gaucher disease and have been observed both in patients receiving and not receiving Cerezyme . No causal relationship with Cerezyme has been established. Patients with respiratory symptoms in the absence of fever should be evaluated for the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Therapy with Cerezyme should be directed by physicians knowledgeable in the management of patients with Gaucher disease. Caution may be advisable in administration of Cerezyme to patients previously treated with Ceredase \u00ae (alglucerase injection) and who have developed antibody to Ceredase or who have exhibited symptoms of hypersensitivity to Ceredase.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies have not been conducted in either animals or humans to assess the potential effects of Cerezyme \u00ae (imiglucerase for injection) on carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Cerezyme\u00ae (imiglucerase for injection). It is also not known whether Cerezyme can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Cerezyme should not be administered during pregnancy except when the indication and need are clear and the potential benefit is judged by the physician to substantially justify therisk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cerezyme \u00ae (imiglucerase for injection) is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Cerezyme\u00ae (imiglucerase for injection) have been established in patients between 2 and 16 years of age. Use of Cerezyme in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Cerezyme and Ceredase \u00ae (alglucerase injection) in adults and pediatric patients, with additional data obtained from the medical literature and from long-term post-marketing experience. Cerezyme has been administered to patients younger than 2 years of age, however the safety and effectiveness in patients younger than 2 have not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS Since the approval of Cerezyme \u00ae (imiglucerase for injection) in May 1994, Genzyme has maintained a worldwide post-marketing database of spontaneously reported adverse events and adverse events discussed in the medical literature. The percentage of events for each reported adverse reaction term has been calculated using the number of patients from these sources as the denominator for total patient exposure to Cerezyme since 1994. Actual patient exposure is difficult to obtain due to the voluntary nature of the database and the continuous accrual and loss of patients over that span of time. The actual number of patients exposed to Cerezyme since 1994 is likely to be greater than estimated from these voluntary sources and, therefore, the percentages calculated for the frequencies of adverse reactions are most likely greater than the actual incidences. Experience in patients treated with Cerezyme has revealed that approximately 13.8% of patients experienced adverse events which were judged to be related to Cerezyme administration and which occurred with an increase in frequency. Some of the adverse events were related to the route of administration. These include discomfort, pruritus, burning, swelling or sterile abscess at the site of venipuncture. Each ofthese events was found to occur in < 1% of the total patient population. Symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity have been noted in approximately 6.6% of patients. Onset of such symptoms has occurred during or shortly after infusions; these symptoms include pruritus, flushing, urticaria, angioedema, chest discomfort, dyspnea, coughing, cyanosis, and hypotension. Anaphylactoid reaction has also been reported (see WARNINGS). Each of these events was found to occur in < 1.5% of the total patient population. Pre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids and reduced rate of infusion have allowed continued use of Cerezyme in most patients. Additional adverse reactions that have been reported in approximately 6.5% of patients treated with Cerezyme include: nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, fatigue, headache, fever, dizziness, chills, backache, and tachycardia. Each of these events was found to occur in < 1.5% of the total patient population. Incidence rates cannot be calculated from the spontaneously reported adverse events in the post-marketing database. From this database, the most commonly reported adverse events in children (defined as ages 2 - 12 years) included dyspnea, fever, nausea, flushing, vomiting, and coughing, whereas in adolescents (>12 - 16 years) and in adults (>16 years) the most commonly reported events included headache, pruritus, and rash. In addition to the adverse reactions that have been observed in patients treated with Cerezyme , transient peripheral edema has been reported for this therapeutic class of drug.OVERDOSE Experience with dose s up to 240 U/kg every 2 weeks have been reported. At that dose there have been no reports of obvious toxicity. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cerezyme\u00ae (imiglucerase for injection) is administered by intravenous infusion over 1-2 hours. Dosage should be individualized to each patient. Initial dosages range from 2.5 U/kg of body weight 3 times a week to 60 U/kg once every 2 weeks. 60 U/kg every 2 weeks is the dosage for which the most data are available. Disease severity may dictate that treatment be initiated at a relatively high dose or relatively frequent administration. Dosage adjustments should be made on an individual basis and may increase or decrease, based on achievement of therapeutic goals as assessed by routine comprehensive evaluations of the patient's clinical manifestations. Cerezyme \u00ae should be stored at 2-8\u00b0C (36-46\u00b0F). After reconstitution, Cerezyme should be inspected visually before use. Because this is a protein solution, slight flocculation (described as thin translucent fibers) occurs occasionally after dilution. The diluted solution may be filtered through an in-line low protein-binding 0.2 \u00b5m filter during administration. Any vials exhibiting opaque particles or discoloration should not be used. DO NOT USE Cerezyme after the expiration date on the vial. On the day of use, after the correct amount of Cerezyme to be administered to the patient has been determined, the appropriate number of vials are each reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP. The final concentrations and administration volumes are provided in the following table: A nominal 5.0 mL for the 200 unit vial (10.0 mL for the 400 unit vial) is withdrawn from each vial. The appropriate amount of Cerezyme for each patient is diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a final volume of 100 - 200 mL. Cerezyme is administered by intravenous infusion over 1-2 hours. Aseptic techniques should be used when diluting the dose. Since Cerezyme does not contain any preservative, after reconstitution, vials should be promptly diluted and not stored for subsequent use. Cerezyme, after reconstitution, has been shown to be stable for up to 12 hours when stored at room temperature (25\u00b0C) and at 2-8\u00b0C. Cerezyme , when diluted, has been shown to be stable for up to 24 hours when stored at 2-8\u00b0C. Relatively low toxicity, combined with the extended time course of response, allows small dosage adjustments to be made occasionally to avoid discarding partially used bottles. Thus, the dosage administered in individual infusions may be slightly increased or decreased to utilize fully each vial as long as the monthly administered dosage remains substantially unaltered.

A complete patient and family history, preferably including a pedigree, should be conducted. 2. A comprehensive physical examination should be performed at least annually. 3. One or more of these biochemical markers should be consistently monitored at least every 12 months and in conjunction with other clinical assessments of disease activity and response to treatment. Of the three recommended markers, chitotriosidase, when available as a validated procedure from an experienced laboratory, may be the most sensitive indicator of changing disease activity, and is therefore preferred. 4. A baseline sample will be drawn and stored at Genzyme. A subsequent sample is suggested to be drawn at 6 months after starting ERT but is optional. The baseline and additional samples will be tested only if clinically indicated, such as for a suspected immune-mediated adverse event, prior to a switch to home therapy, or for suspected loss of ERT effectiveness. 5. These should be followed appropriately if abnormal based on each patient's age and clinical status. 6. Obtain contiguous transaxial 10 mm thick sections for sum of region of interest. 7. Optimally, obtain hips to below knees. 8.

Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) comprise about 50 unique monogenic autosomal or X- linked diseases with an estimated comb ined incidence of 1 in 77,000 to 88,000 live births. They occur secondary to genet ic mutations that result in deficiency or reduced activity of native intracellular enzymes that catabolize biological macromolecules . These enzyme defects result in accumulation of specific macromolecular compounds within lysosomes in various tissues and organs, causing progressive damage that can become li fe-threatening in some diseases. LSD management traditionally involved supportive care measures tailored to disease stage, the organs and systems involved, and the degree of impairment. However, enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) is now commercially availabl e for six LSDs, typically used lifelong with traditional management practices for each. Purpose . The objective of this Technical Brief is to provide an overview of U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved ERT for the treatment of six LSDs . The purpose of a Technical Brief is to report what outcomes (benefits and harms) have been studied for a technology, drug or procedure; it does not enumerate those outcomes. The Technical Brief also addre sses research gaps identified during its preparation . It is not intended as a comparative effectiveness review or systematic review that draws conclusions as to the clinical benefits and harms of a drug, device, or procedure. It does not assess study quality or the strength of the body of evidence on specif ic outcomes. Methods . Four Guiding Questions were used to frame this Technical Brief . An inspection of t he literature from 1990 through mid-April 2012 included primary studies, as well as narrative and systematic review articles to create an overview of potential clinical outcomes . Other information sources included dosing and other treatment- related information from the FDA - approved product labels ; scientific information packages from the product manufacturers that included unpublished data; and, interviews with physician Key I nformants and patient advocates. Findings . Published clinical studies report a variety of outcomes associated with nine FDA - approved ERT products. They include disease- speci fic intermediate outcomes , such as plasma or urinary levels of macromolecular compounds. Others were common hematological measures (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia), bone pain and skeletal abnormalities, renal function, cardiac function, pulmonary function, growth, and walk ing te sts. Harms repor ted to the FDA and in clinical studies were primarily allergic, including in fusion- associated reactions and anaphylaxis. Immunogenic responses , primarily an IgG -type antibody response and neutralizing antibodies, have been reported . This Technical Brief identified a number of research gaps , including the need for comparative effectiveness studies, dose opt imization, optimal timing for initiation of ERT, and mechanisms involved in uptake and distribution of ERT products. Silver Compounds For Dental Caries Silver fluoride for dental caries Jan VBBS Page 1 Question : Should coverage for silver compounds (silver nitrate plus topical fluoride or silver diamine fluoride) to prevent and treat dental caries be added to the Prioritized List? Question source : Senator Bates Issue : At the December 13, 2012 VBBS meeting, the evidence on the use of silver compounds (specifically silver diamine fluoride) was reviewed, and public testimony was heard about the pros and cons of use of silver nitrate plus fluoride varnish for the arresting of dental caries. Summary of the evidence Silver diamine fluoride appears to be effective at preventing and arresting caries based on evidence only performed resource- poor settings (and none in the United States). There are no studies on silver nitrate + fluoride which is what would be used in the U .S. There are no studies evaluating the utility of arresting of caries compared to standard of care which is immediate restoration compared to delayed restoration. Summary of the argument in favor of silver compounds It stops the infection in the tooth Silver is c oming back into favor Allows for those who do not want restoration (or immediate restoration) to have a means to arrest caries progression Inexpensive chemical Anecdotal evidence from Advantage that it is decreasing their ED visits Summary of the argument against silver compounds There is no data in the US supporting this as a treatment There are no known studies in process actually evaluating the efficacy of arresting caries compared to immediate restorative treatment There is permanent tooth discoloration that occurs Restoration is still required There is a potential large cost associated with the recommended 5 visits over 3- 4 months, and then there would still be the cost of restoration No professional associations recommend it Oregon Board of Dentistry input From Patrick Braatz, Executive Director, Oregon Board of Dentistry \"No official position it is something that Dentists may use.

Strengths and Weaknesses of the Systematic Review: The reviewers used accepted methods to identify and select studies on SDF based on a priori inclusion criteria and the two studies reached similar conclusions. The reported preventive fractions and numbers needed to treat in the systematic review did not compare the SDF to fluoride varnish, and instead compared outcomes for SDF and fluoride varnish to the control groups. 3. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Evidence: Both studies in the review were prospective studies with relatively large numbers of subjects in each study group, which was the main strength. While one of the studies compared SDF to no treatment, the other compared SDF to fluoride varnish. In addition, Chu and colleagues (2002) did not estimate trial sample sizes using a priori power calculations. Safety outcome measures associated with SDF were not clearly defined. There are potential problems with concluding that SDF is safe based on results from a study that may not be adequately powered to detect differences in adverse outcom es that are rare. Lastly, one study assessed the effectiveness of SDF on primary maxillary anterior teeth while the other focused on primary canines, primary molars, and permanent first molars. 4. Implications for Dental Practice: Silver Compounds For Dental Caries Silver fluoride for dental caries Jan VBBS Page 3 Results from two studies suggest that SDF is a promising chemotherapeutic agent that arrests and prevents caries in children. However, SDF has not been approved by the FDA for clinical use in the United States. Additional studies are needed to assess safety. There are also concerns associated with staining caused by SDF, which can be addressed by restoring the SDF -treated teeth with glass ionomer. SDF may have the potential to be used in clinical settings as a chemotherapeutic agent to effectively control and reduce dental caries in high -risk populations. Summary There is evidence in resource-p oor countries that silver diami ne fluoride is effective at preventing and arresting caries. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of silver nitrate + fluoride varnish which is what would be used in the US (because the FDA has not approved silver diamine fluoride) and there are no US studies of either type of treatment. There are concerns about costs of repeated visits when restoration is still required and there is no data supporting that delayed restoration compared to immediate restoration is beneficial. Cosmetic concerns about permanent black staining in the teeth exist. Although the international studies are promising, no US major dental organizations currently recommend the use of silver compounds . This appears to be an experimental treatment at this time , and more research demonstrating efficacy and safety is required prior to allowing OHP patients to have this procedure done. Recommendations : 1) Do not add silver treatment s to the Prioritized List 2) Add a guideline to indicate that neither this treatment (Silver diamine fluoride) nor a proxy (silver nitrate plus fluoride) are included on the Prioritized List Guideline Note XX Silver compounds for dental caries Lines 58, 372, 373, 494, 621 Silver compounds for dental caries prevention and treatment are not included on these or any lines on the Prioritized List for coverage consideration. 118 CLINICAL GUIDELINESREFERENCE MANUAL V 34 / NO 6 12 / 13 Originating Council Council on Clinical Affairs Review Council Council on Clinical Affairs Adopted 2002 Revised 2006, 2010, 2011 Purpose The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry ( AAPD) recog- nizes that caries-risk assessment and management protocols can assist clinicians with decisions regarding treatment based upon caries risk and patient compliance and are essential elements of contemporary clinical care for infants, children, and adoles - cents. This guideline is intended to educate healthcare providers and other interested parties on the assessment of caries risk in contemporary pediatric dentistry and aid in clinical decision making regarding diagnostic, fluoride, dietary, and restorative protocols. Methods This guideline is an update of AAPD's \"Policy on Use of a Caries-risk Assessment Tool (CAT ) for Infants, Children, and Adolescents, Revised 2006\" that includes the additional con- cepts of dental caries management protocols. The update used electronic and hand searches of English written articles in the medical and dental literature within the last 10 years using the search terms \"caries risk assessment\", \"caries management\", and \"caries clinical protocols\". From this search, 1,909 articles were evaluated by title or by abstract. Information from 75 articles was used to update this document. When data did not appear sufficient or were inconclusive, recommendations were based upon expert and/or consensus opinion by experienced researchers and clinicians. Background Caries-risk assessmentRisk assessment procedures used in medical practice normally have sufficient data to accurately quantitate a person's disease susceptibility and allow for preventive measures. 1 Even though caries-risk data in dentistry still are not sufficient to quanti- tate the models, the process of determining risk should be a component in the clinical decision making process. 2 Risk assessment: 1. fosters the treatment of the disease process instead of treating the outcome of the disease; 2. gives an understanding of the disease factors for a specific patient and aids in individualizing preventive discussions; 3. individualizes, selects, and determines frequency of preventive and restorative treatment for a patient; and 4. anticipates caries progression or stabilization. Caries-risk assessment models currently involve a combina - tion of factors including diet, fluoride exposure, a susceptible host, and microflora that interplay with a variety of social, cul- tural, and behavioral factors. 3-6 Caries risk assessment is the determination of the likelihood of the incidence of caries (ie, the number of new cavitated or incipient lesions) during a cer- tain time period7 or the likelihood that there will be a change in the size or activity of lesions already present. With the ability to detect caries in its earliest stages (ie, white spot lesions), health care providers can help prevent cavitation.8-10 Caries risk indicators are variables that are thought to cause the disease directly (eg, microflora) or have been shown useful in predicting it (eg, socioeconomic status) and include those variables that may be considered protective factors. Cur- rently, there are no caries-risk factors or combinations of factors that have achieved high levels of both positive and negative predictive values. 2 Although the best tool to predict future caries is past caries experience, it is not particularly useful in young children due to the importance of determining caries risk before the disease is manifest. Children with white spot lesions should be considered at high risk for caries since these are precavitated lesions that are indicative of caries activity. 11 Plaque accumulation also is strongly associated with caries de- velopment in young children.12,13 As a corollary presence of plaque,14 a child's mutans streptococci levels3 and the age at which a child becomes colonized with cariogenic flora15,16 are valuable in assessing risk, especially in preschool children. While there is no question that fermentable carbohydrates are a necessary link in the causal chain for dental caries, a sys- tematic study of sugar consumption and caries risk has con- cluded that the relationship between sugar consumption and caries is much weaker in the modern age of fluoride exposure Guideline on Caries-risk Assessment and Management for Infants, Children, and Adolescents From American Dental Association: Center for Evidence-based Dentistry http://ebd.ada.org/SystematicReviewSummaryPage.aspx?srId=340901e6-21b5-43b4-abd1- c749c720e057 Limited evidence suggests that silver diamine fluoride may effectively arrest and prevent dental caries in children Critical Summary Prepared by: Donald L. Chi D.D.S., PhD OVERVIEW Systematic Review Conclusion: Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is more effective than, and as safe as, fluoride varnish in arresting and preventing dental caries. Critical Summary Assessment: The results of two studies, only one of which was a nonrandomized study that directly compared silver diamine fluoride and fluoride varnish, suggest that silver fluoride diamine fluoride is more effective at arresting and preventing caries on primary maxillary anterior teeth. Evidence Quality Rating: Limited A Critical Silver diamine R. Journal of Dental Research. 2009;88(2):116- 25 Clinical Questions: Compared to fluoride varnish, is silver diamine fluoride a) more effective at arresting and preventing caries? and b) safer? Review Methods: The authors searched five databases (MEDLINE, LILACS, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Brazilian Dental Library) for studies that met the following criteria: 1) assessed silver diamine fluoride as a caries- preventive therapy in humans; 2) published between 1966 and 2006; 3) published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese; 4) adopted a randomized controlled trial, cohort trial, or case-control design; 5) analyzed patients as the unit of observation; and 5) reported variance estimates. Two investigators conducted the review and a third investigator resolved disagreements. Data from the studies were used to calculate two outcomes: prevented fraction (caries arrest or prevention in the treatment group compared to the control group) and the numbers needed to treat (number of children who would need to be treated to prevent one additional decayed tooth surface). Main Results: The authors identified 110 unique studies, from which 12 relevant studies were selected for further review. After reviewing the bibliographies of these 12 studies, three additional studies were selected for review. Two of the 15 studies met all the inclusion criteria. The first was a 30-month prospective cohort trial (N=308) that compared SDF to fluoride varnish. The second was a 36-month prospective cohort trial (N=373) that compared SDF to no treatment. Data from the two studies were not aggregated to generate pooled outcome measures. The reported prevented fractions for arresting active caries ranged from 55.6 percent to 122 percent for SDF and 14.2 percent to 21.3 percent for fluoride varnish. The reported prevented fractions for preventing new caries ranged from 63.6 percent to 83.5 percent (SDF) and 43.7 percent to 55.7 percent (fluoride varnish). For both outcome measures, compared to controls (either water or no treatment), the reported numbers needed to treat were 0.6 to 10 (SDF) and 1.1 to 5.6 (fluoride varnish). Neither study reported significant differences in adverse outcomes between the treatment and control groups. Conclusion: Silver diamine fluoride is more effective than fluoride varnish at arresting active caries and preventing new caries. SDF is equally as safe as fluoride varnish. Source of funding: Fulbright Program and The Forsyth Institute. Commentary: Importance and Context: Although chemotherapeutic agents such as fluoride varnish are known to inhibit dental caries by decreasing acid solubility, high caries rates persist in certain population subgroups (Brickhouse et al. 2008; Parker et al. 2010). High caries rates have stimulated efforts to identify chemotherapeutic agents that will control the infection. To date, a systematic review has not been conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of SDF. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Systematic Review: The reviewers used accepted methods to identify and select studies on SDF based on a priori inclusion criteria and the two studies reached similar conclusions. The reported preventive fractions and numbers needed to treat in the systematic review did not compare the SDF to fluoride varnish, and instead compared outcomes for SDF and fluoride varnish to the control groups. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Evidence: Both studies in the review were prospective studies with relatively large numbers of subjects in each study group, which was the main strength. While one of the studies compared SDF to no treatment, the other compared SDF to fluoride varnish. In addition, Chu and colleagues (2002) did not estimate trial sample sizes using a priori power calculations. Safety outcome measures associated with SDF were not clearly defined. There are potential problems with concluding that SDF is safe based on results from a study that may not be adequately powered to detect differences in adverse outcomes that are rare.

There are also concerns associated with staining caused by SDF, which can be addressed by restoring the SDF-treated teeth with glass ionomer. SDF may have the potential to be used in clinical settings as a chemotherapeutic agent to effectively control and reduce dental caries in high-risk populations.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE Clinical Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of chronic articular disease, affecting approximately 27 million adults in the United States. The most commonly affected joint is the knee, with prevalence estimates ranging from 12% to 16%. To date, there is no known cure for OA nor is there a disease-modifying agent. Optimal management generally requires a combination of both nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies, and joint replacement surgery or a joint salvage procedure may be considered for selected patients with severe symptomatic OA who have not obtained adequate pain relief and functional improvement from medical therapy. Pharmacological therapy generally begins with acetaminophen, followed by nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if sufficient pain relief is not obtained. There is a small risk of systemic adverse effects with NSAIDs. Aspiration of fluid followed by intraarticular injection of a corticosteroid ameliorates pain in some patients, but duration of relief is usually limited to one to three weeks. Additionally, repeated intraarticular injections of corticosteroids have the potential to cause postinjection flare, infection, and progressive, long-term cartilage damage. Recently, viscosupplementation with hyaluronan has been introduced as an alternative intraarticular injection therapy for OA. Hyaluronans are also known as sodi um hyaluronate or hyaluronic acid (HA). Hyaluronic acid is a normal component of synovial fluid and cartilage. The viscous nature of the compound allows it to act as a joint lubricant, whereas its elasticity allows it to act as a shock absorber. Hyaluronic products are characterized by their molecular weight, which varies according to the source of the compound and method of preparation. Five HA products are currently marketed in the United Supartz\u00ae (Seikagaku Corporation), and Synvisc\u00ae (Genzyme). Synvisc a derivative of HA that consists of cross-linked polymers; the compound is referred to as Hylan G-F 20. Hyaluronate preparations have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of pain associated with OA of the knee in patients who have not had an adequate response to nonpharmacological, conservative treatment and simple analgesics. Recent systematic reviews have come to contradictory conclusions regarding the effectiveness of viscosupplementation, and national guidelines vary in their recommendations. Evidence Review There is consistent evidence demonstrating that viscosupplementation results in lower mean pain scores and improves mean function scores a few weeks after treatment. However, the magnitude of benefit may be too small to be clinically important. This evidence is derived from a quantitative synthesis of six meta-analyses performed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2007 which included 42 randomized placebo controlled trials and over 5000 patients (Samson 2007). The authors found that the average change in pain score, although consistent and statistically significant, was small, with weighted mean differences in the range of 1.0 to 22.5 on a 100 point visual acuity scale. While there is no definitive definition of clinical significance, several authors, including Sampson, consider a 20 to 40 point improvement on 100 point pain scales to be clinically significant. The authors also reviewed the five previously published study-level meta-analyses that came to a variety of conclusions regarding the efficacy of viscosupplementation. These ranged from negative to moderately positive to strongly positive. The authors of the Samson review considered only one meta-analysis to have reported data and analysis that fully supported the meta- analysis authors' conclusion. This was also the metaanalysis with a negative conclusion \u2014that the clinical effectiveness of viscosupplementation has not been proven and that viscosupplementation may be associated with a higher risk of adverse events. There is a much greater volume of evidence regarding impact on pain than on function, and many studies did not follow patients beyond three months. Therefore, the impact of viscosupplementation on eventual recovery of function is uncertain. Compared with intraarticular corticosteroid injection, viscosupplementation appears to confer longer- lasting benefit, but the evidence was considered low quality. For comparisons with other treatments, there was insufficient evidence to allow any conclusion. Adverse events occur at a frequency of approximately 2% in single courses of treatment and are primarily transient local reactions, although rare, serious reactions are possible. The rate of adverse events per patient has been shown to increase with repeat courses of treatment, but the only available data were for hylan (high-molecular weight HA). Coverage Guidance: Viscosupplementation for Osteoarthritis o f the Knee 10/11/2012 4 Evidence pertaining to issues other than efficacy and safety is of low quality: Available evidence suggests that viscosupplementation may be as effective as NSAIDs (four RCTs) and results in fewer systemic adverse events (two RCTs); in comparison with intraarticular corticosteroids, it has a delayed onset and longer lasting benefit (nine RCTs plus meta-analysis). Hylan may have a superior benefit compared with that of non -cross-linked HA, but the magnitude of difference is very uncertain and hylan poses a small increase in the risk of adverse events. To date, there is no evidence of a difference in benefit between low and medium molecular weight HA. Younger age may be associated with greater efficacy; evidence pertaining to effectiveness by other patient characteristics and history is lacking. Overall Summary While the evidence demonstrates that viscosupplementation results in lower mean pain scores and improved mean function scores a few weeks after treatment, the magnitude of benefit may be too small to be clinically important.

Coverage Guidance: Percutaneous Interventions for Low Back Pain 10/11/2012 3 SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE Clinical Background Low back pain is the fth most common reason for all physician visits in the United States. Approximately one quarter of US adults reported having low back pain lasting at least o ne whole day in the past three months, and 7.6% reported at least one episode of severe acute low back pain within a 1-year period. Low back pain is also very costly. Total incremental direct health care costs attributable to low back pain in the US were estimated at $26.3 billion in 1998. In addition, indirect costs related to days lost from work are substantial, with approximately 2% of the US work force compensated for back injuries each year. Many patients have self-limited episodes of acute low back pain and do not seek medical care. Among those who do seek medical care, pain, disability, and return to work typically improve rapidly in the rst month. However, up to one third of patients report persistent back pain of at least moderate intensity one year after an acute episode, and one in five report substantial limitations in activity. Approximately 5% of the people with back pain disability account for 75% of the costs associated with low back pain. Many options are available for evaluation and management of low back pain. However, there has been little consensus, either within or between specialties, on appropriate clinical evaluation and management of low back pain. Numerous studies show unexplained, large variations in use of diagnostic tests and treatments. Despite wide variations in practice, patients seem to experience broadly similar outcomes, although costs of care can differ substantially among and within specialties. Evidence Review Recommendation #1: In patients with persistent radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc, it is recommended that clinicians discuss risks and benefits of epidural steroid injection as an option (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). It is recommended that shared decision-making regarding epidural steroid injection include a specific discussion about inconsistent evidence showing moderate short-term benefits, and lack of long-term benefits. There is insufficient evidence to adequately evaluate benefits and harms of epidural steroid injection for spinal stenosis. For radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc, evidence on benefits of epidural steroid injection is mixed. Although some higher-quality trials found epidural steroid injection associated with moderate short-term (through up to 6 weeks) benefits in pain or function, others found no differences versus placebo injection. Reasons for the discrepancies between trials is uncertain, but could be related to the type of comparator treatment, as trials that compared an epidural steroid injection to an epidural saline or local anesthetic injection tended to report poorer results than trials that compared an Coverage Guidance: Percutaneous Interventions for Low Back Pain 10/11/2012 4 epidural steroid injection to a soft-tissue (usually interspinous ligament) placebo injection. Regardless of the comparator intervention, there is no convincing evidence that epidural steroids are associated with long-term benefits and most trials found no reduction in rates of subsequent surgery. Although serious complications following epidural steroid injection are rare in clinical trials, there are case reports of paralysis and infections. There is insufficient evidence on clinical outcomes to recommend a specific approach for performing epidural steroid injection, or on use of fluoroscopic guidance. In addition, insufficient evidence exists to recommend how many epidural injections to perform, though one higher -quality trial found that if an initial epidural steroid injection did not result in benefits, additional injections over a 6-week period did not improve outcomes. Decisions regarding use of epidural steroid injection should be based on a shared decision-making process that includes a discussion of the inconsistent evidence for short-term benefit, lack of long-term benefit, potential risks, and costs. Patient preferences and individual factors should also be considered. For example, epidural steroid injection may be a reasonable option for short-term pain relief in patients who are less optimal surgery candidates due to comorbidities. There is insufficient evidence to guide specific recommendations for timing of epidural steroid injection, though most trials enrolled patients with at least subacute (greater than 4 weeks) symptoms. Evidence on efficacy of epidural steroid injection for spinal stenosis is sparse and shows no clear benefit, though more trials are needed to clarify effects. Although chymopapain chemonucleolysis is effective for radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc, it is less effective than discectomy and is no longer widely available in the United States, in part due to risk of severe allergic reactions. Three trials suggest that intradiscal steroid injection has similar efficacy to chemonucleolysis, although none were placebo controlled. Recommendation #2: In patients with persistent nonradicular low back pain, facet joint corticosteroid injection, prolotherapy, and intradiscal corticosteroid injection are not recommended (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Injections and most interventional therapies for nonradicular low back pain target specific areas of the back that are potential sources of pain, including the muscles and soft tissues (botulinum toxin injection, prolotherapy, and local injections), facet joints (facet joint steroid injection, therapeutic medial branch block, and radiofrequency denervation), degenerated intervertebral discs (intradiscal steroid injection, IDET, and related procedures), and sacroiliac joints (sacroiliac joint injection). There is no convincing evidence from randomized trials that injections and other interventional therapies are effective for nonradicular low back pain. Facet joint steroid injection, Coverage Guidance: Percutaneous Interventions for Low Back Pain 10/11/2012 5 prolotherapy and intradiscal steroid injections are not recommended because randomized trials consistently found them to be no more effective than sham therapies. Recommendation #3: There is insufficient evidence to adequately evaluate benefits of local injections, botulinum toxin injection, epidural steroid injection, intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET), therapeutic or nonradicular low back pain. For local injections1, there is insufficient evidence to accurately judge benefits because available trials are small, lower-quality, and evaluate heterogeneous populations and interventions. Trials of IDET and radiofrequency denervation reported inconsistent results. There were a small number of higher quality trials, and in the case of radiofrequency denervation, the trials had technical or methodologic shortcomin gs, making it difficult to reach conclusions about benefits . For other interventional therapies, data are limited to one to two small placebo-controlled randomized trials (botulinum toxin injection, epidural steroid injection for nonradicular low back pain , PIRFT and sacroiliac joint steroid injection), or there are no placebo-controlled randomized trials (therapeutic medial branch block, coblation nucleoplasty....or other medications). [Evidence Source ] Overall Summary For radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc, evidence on benefits of epidural steroid injection is mixed, with some trials finding moderate short-term benefits and others finding no differences. There is no convincing evidence that epidural steroids are associated with long-term benefits and most trials found no reduction in rates of subsequent surgery . For nonradicular low back pain, there is likewise no convincing evide nce that injections and other interventional therapies are effective, while there is consistent evidence that facet joint steroid injection, prolotherapy and intradiscal steroid injections are no more effective than sham therapies.

CG - Management of Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion in Children 1 Question : How should the HERC approved Coverage Guidance - Management of chronic otitis media with effusion in children\u2014be incorporated into the Prioritized List? Question source : Health Evidence Review Commission Issue : HERC approved the Coverage Guidance : Management of chronic otitis media with effusion in children in October , 2012. This coverage guidance needs to be evaluated for application within the Prioritized List. At the December 2012 VBBS meeting testimony was heard and a discussion to make modifications to the proposed guideline followed. The proposal had recommended striking language including the definition of 25dB hearing loss, and the decision was made to leave this language as part of the guideline. Additionally, the \"individualized\" treatment language was not operationalizeable by DMAP and so the proposal was to add tympanostomy tubes to those specified underlying condition lines (e.g. Down syndrome, cleft palate, and craniofacial anomalies). It was decided not to add these codes to the speech and language delay lines because these are dysfunction lines. HERC Coverage Guidance Antibiotic and other medication therapy (including antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids) should not be covered for children with children with otitis media with effusion (OME) (without another appropriate diagnosis). There should be a 3 to 6 month watchful waiting period after diagnosis of otitis media with effusion, and if documented persistent hearing loss is greater than or equal to 25dB in the better hearing ear, referral for tympanstomy surgery may be covered, given short, but not long- term, improvement in hearing. Formal audiometry should be covered for children with chronic OME present for 3 months or longer. Children with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss should have hearing testing covered initially upon diagnosis. Children with chronic OME who are not at risk for language or developmental delay should be reexamined at 3 - to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. Adenoidectomy should not be covered at the time of the first pressure equalization tube insertion. Patients with craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and patients with speech and language delay along with hearing loss should have coverage based on an individualized treatment plan. CG - Management of Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion in Children 2 Current Prioritized List status: chronic otitis media is included on line 502 CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA Treatment: PE TUBES/ADENOIDECTOMY/TYMPANOPLASTY, MEDICAL THERAPY. Currently, guideline note 51 applies to this line. GUIDELINE NOTE 51, CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION Line 502 Antibiotic and other medication therapy are not indicated for children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME). Children with chronic OME present for 3 months or longer or with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss at any time should have hearing testing. Children with chronic OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or mi ddle ear are suspected. For the child who has had chronic OME and who has a hearing deficiency in the better -hearing ear of 25 dB or greater, myringotomy with tube insertion recommended after a total of 4 to 6 months of effusion with a documented hearing deficit. Adenoidectomy is an appropriate surgical treatment for chronic OME in children over 3 years with their second set of tubes. First time tubes are not an indication for an adenoidectomy.

Section 7 Guidelines Immunization Guideline 1 Question : Should the current Prevention Tables have immunization recommendations removed and placed into a separate table to be maintained by the Oregon Immunization Program ? Question source : HERC staff , Oregon Immunization Program staff Issue : The curr ent Prevention Tables are out of date, and are not scheduled to be replaced until the ICD -10 List in 2014. The immunization recommendations in these tables are out of date, and not regularly updated. The Oregon Immunization Program has proposed having an updated table to be hosted by OIP and regularly updated by their staff. This table will be available through a link in a new Prioritized List guideline. Traditionally, HSC/HERC has followed ACIP immunization recommendations, which are created by publi c health experts and the CDC. The OIP program follows ACIP guidelines.

Dr. Sattenspiel raises the concern that abnormal reflexes are quite subjective and possibly over -interpreted. From Dr. Sattenspiel This statement is from Disorders of the Nervous System - Reeves & Swenson and in my mind it is a reasonable description of reflex examination and grading: Examination of myotatic (\"deep tendon\") reflexes The muscle stretch (myotatic) reflex is a simple reflex, with the receptor neuron having direct connections to the muscle spindle apparatus in the muscle and with the alpha motor neurons in the central nervous system that send axons back to that muscle ( Fig. 8 -1). Normal muscle stretch reflexes res ult in contraction only of the muscle whose tendon is stretched and the agonist muscles (i.e., muscles that have the same action). There is also inhibition of antagonist muscles. Reflexes are graded at the bedside in a semi -quantitative manner. The response levels of deep tendon reflexes are grade 0 -4+, with 2+ being normal. The designation \"0\" signifies no response at all, even after reinforcement. Reinforcement requires a maximal isometric contraction of muscles of a remote part of the body, such as clenching the jaw, pushing the hands or feet together (depending on whether an upper or lower limb reflex is being tested), or locking the fingers of the two hands and pulling (termed the Jendrassik maneuver). This kind of maneuver probably amplifies reflexes by two mechanisms: by distracting the patient from voluntarily suppressing the reflex and by decreasing the amount of descending inhibition. The designation 1+ means a sluggish, depressed or suppressed reflex, while the term trace means that a barely detectible response is elicited. Reflexes that are noticeably more brisk than usual are designated 3+, while 4+ means that the reflex is hyperactive and that there is clonus present. Clonus is a repetitive, usually rhythmic, and variably sustained reflex response elicited by manually stretching the tendon. This clonus may be sustained as long as the tendon is manually stretched or may stop after up to a few beats despite continued stretch of the tendon. In this case it is useful to note how many beats are prese nt. Reflexes Issue Summary 2 One sign of reflex hyperactivity is contraction of muscles that have different actions while eliciting a muscle stretch reflex (for example, contraction of thigh adductors when testing the patellar reflex or contraction of finger flexor muscles when testing the brachioradialis reflex). This has been termed \"pathological spread of reflexes.\" Practice observing normal reflexes in patients and initially among students is an excellent way to determine the range of normalcy. Almost any grade of reflex (outside of sustained clonus) can be normal. Asymmetry of reflexes is a key for determining normalcy when extremes of response do not make the designation obvious. The patient's symptoms may facilitate the determination of which side is normal, i.e., the more active or the less active side. If this is a problem, the remainder of the neurologic examination and findings usually clarify the issue. Decreased reflexes should lead to suspicion that the reflex arc has been affected. This could be the sensory nerve fiber but may also be the spinal cord gray matter or the motor fiber. This motor fiber (the anterior horn cell and its motor axon coursing through the ventral root and peripheral nerve) is termed the \"lower motor neuron\" (LMN). LMN lesions result in decreased reflexes. The descending motor tracts from the cerebral cortex and brain stem are termed the \"upper motor neurons\" (UMN). Lesions of the UMNs result in increased reflexes at the spinal cord by decreasing tonic inhibition of the spinal segment. Lesions of t he cerebellum and basal ganglia in humans are not associated with consistent changes in the muscle stretch reflex. Classically, destruction of the major portion of the cerebellar hemispheres in humans is associated with pendular deep- tendon reflexes. The r eflexes are poorly checked so that when testing the patellar reflex, for example, the leg may swing to - and- fro (like a pendulum). In normal individuals, the antagonist muscles (in this example, the hamstrings) would be expected to dampen the reflex respons e almost immediately. However, this is not a common sign of cerebellar disease and many other signs of cerebellar involvement are more reliable and diagnostic (see Chapt. 10 ). Basal ganglia disease (e.g., parkinsonism) usually is not associated with any predictable reflex change; most often the reflexes are normal. Note particularly the second highlighted section. I would advocate for a statement that reflex status could be r emoved; or at least clarified to require absence of reflexes or markedly diminished reflexes to be considered as objective evidence that meets the guideline for coverage. What we often see is reflexes graded on an 5 point scale, reported as 4/5, and prese nted as sufficient to meet criteria as objective findings of impairment.
