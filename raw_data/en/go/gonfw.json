Price at time of publication: $30 How We Selected the Best Self-Care Gifts for Mom In order to select the best self-care gifts for Mom, we studied the design and features of more than 100 products available on the market. We also researched reviews from customers and competitors and monitored shopping trends to bring you the best and most up-to-date offerings. We considered design, usefulness, personalization, shipping time, lifestyle, interests, and value when reviewing products. We chose self-care gifts for Mom to help her relax, feel appreciated, and take the much-needed (and deserved) downtime. What to Look for in Self-Care Gifts for Mom Sensitivities Lots of self-care items come with fragrance or scents, which can be hard for anyone who is sensitive to scents, fragrances, or even some textures. You might think it smells amazing, but it might be harsh on her skin. Or, your mom might be squeamish when it comes to things like pressure from a massage gun. Take into account any allergies, preferences, or sensitivities when looking for a self-care gift for mom. Personality You know your mom better than anyone, so consider her personality when buying her a gift. She might be someone who likes really luxurious things or someone who is more no-nonsense. A great gift is something your mom never would have bought for herself and one she ends up using all the time, so take that into account when thinking about what to buy. You'll know you hit the jackpot when you can say those two things about a gift. Usefulness Look for gifts that your recipient would actually use for self-care. Moms can be so bad about taking care of themselves\u2014because they're taking care of everyone else\u2014so you'll want to make sure that your gift will actually get used. Evaluate how she spends her time. If she's not super into skincare, skip a facial steamer. And if she doesn't drink coffee, pass on the coffee machine. Pay attention to any hints she's dropping. Maybe she has been talking about picking up a new hobby. In that case, a new set of watercolors might be the gift she never knew she wanted.
