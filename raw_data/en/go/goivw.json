Every doctor and guru is telling you this and that. How do you know what works, but most importantly, what will work for your body specifically? This overwhelming amount of information and the fact that our medical system is broken leaves us searching independently. This book offers a variety of holistic options to improve your health.

This book is full of information on bettering your health- body, mind, and spirit, It not only goes into herbal remedies, but also discusses the cause of imbalances in our health as well as the pros and cons of holistic medicine. As a medical person, I am often leary of books that tout holistic alternative medicine as the \"only way,\" so was glad to see that the author recognizes and states that these remedies may not work for every condition, and may need to be done in conjunction with Western medical treatments as well. She also makes it clear that she is not a medical practitioner, and that all treatments- both Western and holistic- should be undertaken with the oversight of a practitioner. That is good advice. I enjoyed this book and recommend it for anyone seeking to add herbal remedies to their health routine. 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Rory](/listener/amzn1.account.AHM2TZJ4YQBR6WYO24Q3RXYPPD7Q?ref=a_pd_Awaken_c15_rvlsnl_7&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=D3F3DQF7Q0T9W9ZKJ226&pageLoadId=iEOHRP7rY30zIQ0K&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 05-14-23 Great Information - Easy To Follow My first experience with holistic medicine was in the 80's. I found it to be intriguing, mysterious and effective. I thought I had learned a lot about the topic until I listened to this book. It carefully lays out what holistic medicine is and how it came about. Then it explains the difference between western medicine and holistic medicine. I found through this book that while western medicine is focused on symptoms and individual body parts, holistic medicine encompasses the whole body and can include mental, spiritual, and emotional well being as well. It then explains the different types of holistic treatments that you might encounter. This book is a real eye opener for anyone contemplating a holistic approach. 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Cindy](/listener/amzn1.account.AEZ4JIDAZCHCICHXXTZDMXKBSOFA?ref=a_pd_Awaken_c15_rvlsnl_8&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=D3F3DQF7Q0T9W9ZKJ226&pageLoadId=iEOHRP7rY30zIQ0K&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 05-13-23 Great book!

It's time to go back to the old gold way of healing ourselves, I watched a documentary recently where they mentioned that the big pharmaceutical companies in the US are seeking more to make a profit and to sell more medicines and they know that the medicine they sell is not efficient and sometimes they are just relying on Marketing to sell more ... and also they are using bad chemicals formulas that can affect our bodies for the long run and cause us real health issues, therefore I think the time has come to go back to the old way, and start using organic alternative medicine rather than making the pharmaceutical companies richer. 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - J.D. de Leon - 06-01-23 Take Control and Own Your Health This book is a good guide to learning what holistic medicine is and using it as it fits you individually.
