A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Basic Research associated with the Defense Research Sciences Program that provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications. This PE supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences. This PE also supports innovation and robust transition planning in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs to increase the likelihood that DARPA funded technologies take root in the U.S. and provide new capabilities for national defense. The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security objectives. Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber and information domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk. This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including artificial intelligence (AI), computational social science, machine learning and reasoning, data science, quantum science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theories of computation and programming. The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national and homeland security. The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal advancement in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project will provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies will help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; Volume 1 - 1 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 2 of 34 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2024 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0601101E / DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. The Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon transistor scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Additionally, new design and manufacturing advances for three-dimensional microelectronics integration will underpin continued performance improvements as silicon transistor scaling plateaus. Beyond Scaling programs addressed fundamental exploration in each of these areas. The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems. The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information- intensive subareas of life sciences, data sciences, and manufacturing. Innovative technologies developed in this project will address multiple DoD challenges such as identification of and adaptation to emerging threats, access to DoD relevant critical materials for manufacturing and warfighter readiness. Successful programs in this project will integrate diverse disciplines and engineer complex biological systems to detect novel threat agents, accelerate warfighter injury recover, and develop new platform materials and manufacturing processes.

Title: Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) Description: The Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) program is developing techniques to defend against deception and other adversarial attacks on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. GARD addresses the need to defend against deception attacks, whereby an adversary inputs engineered data into an ML system intending to cause the system to produce erroneous results. Deception attacks can enable adversaries to take control of autonomous systems, alter conclusions of ML-based decision support applications, and compromise tools and systems that rely on ML and AI technologies. Current techniques for defending ML and AI have proven brittle due to a focus on individual attack methods and weak methods for testing and evaluation. The GARD program is developing techniques that address the current limitations of defenses and produce ML and AI systems suitable for use in adversarial environments. The GARD program is also developing theory regarding potential fundamental limits on achievable ML robustness. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop and validate measures of adversary costs and enhance AI/ML defense methods to impose asymmetric costs on the adversary. - Develop human-on-the-loop defense techniques that enable the early identification of digital evasion attacks on AI-enabled systems. - Demonstrate model training methods that reduce AI/ML vulnerability to data poisoning. - Extend evaluation framework to support simulation environments and test physically plausible threat models of interest to potential DoD and U.S. Government transition partners.

Accomplishments/Planned in Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 Description: The social and behavioral sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social/behavioral systems relevant to national security such as mental health, humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD. However, current limitations to the speed, scalability, and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD. Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context. The Human Social Systems thrust will address these limitations by focusing on the following technical challenges: (1) developing and validating new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social/behavioral systems; (2) identifying methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics, and behaviors of different social/behavioral systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in such systems, particularly when under stress; (3) developing an understanding of the complex effect of context and incorporating these effects into models; and (4) developing strategic forecasting and operational decision aiding capabilities that account for local contextual and cultural factors to assess the likely effectiveness of and/or responses to actions within an Area of Operations. This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social/behavioral system issues at multiple scales (from small group to cities and/or regions) and will significantly improve DoD stabilization, deterrence, and/or gray zone mission outcomes.

Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in areas such as image recognition, task-focused natural language processing, and strategy games such as Chess, Go, and Poker. In all of these application domains, the machine reasoning is narrow and highly specialized, and the machine must be carefully trained or programmed for every situation. This program addresses the challenge of general machine reasoning on par with common sense human cognition. MCS is developing computational models that mimic core systems of human cognitive development that are grounded in perceptual, motor, and memory modalities; a simulated interaction and learning environment to support machine manipulation of grounded concept models; and common-sense knowledge repositories to support AI system development. AI systems that are capable of human-like reasoning will be able to behave more appropriately in unforeseen situations and to learn with reduced requirements for training data. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop agent models focused on understanding other agent intentions and demonstrate intentional agent reasoning. - Augment cognitive models with expanded experience learning capabilities and enable self-evaluation modes for scenarios that require agent sensemaking, human-machine collaboration, and knowledge transfer. - Create evaluation techniques for generative question-answering for common-sense reasoning tasks and extend commonsense reasoning capabilities to utilize cross-modal (text, image, video) data to improve performance. - Extend the simulation environment to support modeling and performance assessment for environments with complexity, noise, and novelty.

Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 reasoning, and proving diverse properties of software code or design models, for example, the absence of a specific type of defect or security vulnerability. PROVERS integrates formal methods into a modern incremental and iterative development process by running tools at each code commit and delivering results to developers when they can most effectively remediate discovered issues. To achieve this, PROVERS is focusing on creating and sustaining a body of evidence that can co-evolve with the system under change to support continuous assessment and ensure that the system remains free of identified categories of defects and security vulnerabilities through its lifetime. Key PROVERS objectives include enabling proof maintenance and repair capabilities at a cost that is proportionate to code change; integration of formal methods with code, properties, and proofs in a single workflow that reduces human involvement; providing improved explanations to facilitate proof repair; and automating formal methods- based software analysis to support software developers that are not formal methods experts. PROVERS technologies will facilitate the agile development and continuous improvement of mission-critical software systems that meet the high security and quality standards required by the DoD. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop tools and data management techniques appropriate for pipelined software development processes that support incremental proof maintenance and repair. - Identify candidate mission-critical software applications and systems for controlled formal-methods-based experiments to quantify the improvements in development productivity and system security.

Knowledge of attributes and affordances, learned dynamically from data encountered within an analytic workflow, will enable joint reasoning with a human partner. This acquired knowledge will also enable the machine to recognize when an observed object or activity is novel, rather than misclassifying the newly observed object or action as a member of a previously-learned class, and readily learn a new symbolic representation through interaction with its human partner. FY 2023 Plans: - Explore alternative means for automated discovery of distinguishing features among objects and activities. - Devise approaches for utilizing interactions among objects and actions to understand affordances.

Title: Modular Meta-cognition (ModMetaCog) Description: The Modular Meta-cognition (ModMetaCog) program aims to develop machine introspection technologies that enable AI systems to analyze and explain their behavior and improve their performance. Current AI systems sometimes work well in the lab but then perform poorly in the field where they operate as part of larger systems that behave unpredictably and/or when they encounter situations not anticipated during training. ModMetaCog will develop and apply recent results in AI/ML saliency and explainability to create introspection capabilities for AI systems, in effect wrapping a second AI system around the original system. The second AI system acts to analyze and explain the behavior of the first, identify anomalies and potential problems, and either acts to make changes to the first system to fix the problem or to communicate its findings to a human operator for action. ModMetaCog will develop both basic theory of meta-cognition and prototype introspection modules for specific types of AI problems, such as classification, detection, control, and others. ModMetaCog will create machine introspection technologies that enable AI/ML systems to identify when they are performing poorly and to improve their performance when required.- - 7.000 Volume 1 - 15 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 16 of 34 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 Program DEFENSE RESEARCH SCI ENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal advancement in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project will provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies will help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ Integration (A-PhI) program is reducing the size, weight, and power of atomic clocks and gyroscopes for position, navigation, and timing (PNT) applications through the development of integrated photonics. Specifically, A-PhI will demonstrate that a compact photonic integrated chip can replace the optical assembly for trapped atomic gyroscopes and clocks without degrading the performance of the device. PNT is a critical resource for all DoD missions such as communications, navigation, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare. While PNT needs usually are met by using the global positioning system (GPS), GPS signals are vulnerable to disruption and a fallback from GPS is essential. In the absence of GPS, tactical-grade clocks and tactical/navigation grade inertial measurement units (IMUs) currently can provide GPS-like accuracy only for the short term, and longer-term GPS independent strategies are highly desirable. A-PhI will enable long-term GPS independence and enable better-than-GPS PNT accuracy for short durations.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon transistor scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials.

Title: Combatting Anti-Microbial Resistant Pathogens Description: The Combatting Anti-Microbial Resistant Pathogens program is investigating fundamental methods for using preexisting host machinery as a technology to create medical countermeasures that degrade or deactivate pathogen targets. The DoD has long recognized the warfighter's outsized risk of exposure to biological threat agents and to infectious disease, including the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms that are ranked as a Tier 1 threat to the U.S. military. Similarly, the danger posed by bacterial biothreats persists with few countermeasures available. Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of therapeutics for AMR bacteria, bacterial biothreats, and other DoD-relevant diseases and threats. These approaches represent a significant departure from conventional therapeutics, which typically rely on a limited number of small molecules with a narrow set of targets and mechanism of action.

Title: Preventing Blood Stream Infections in Warfighters After Trauma Description: Bloodstream infections (BSI) are a significant source of morbidity in service members that sustain combat-related injuries. Trauma temporarily degrades the efficacy of the host immune system thereby increasing the risk of life-threating opportunistic infections from fungi and bacteria that enter into the blood. If unchecked, bloodborne fungi and bacteria lead to debilitating conditions such as invasive fungal infections (IFI), sepsis, and shock. The Preventing Blood Stream Infections in Warfighters After Trauma program will develop a systems-level approach to design particles that prevent BSI in warfighters that suffer trauma from blast. Prophylactic systems circulating in the blood will be developed to bind infectious particles in the blood early and label pathogens for clearance; and deliver drugs to destroy pathogens and/or restore healthy physiology. Ultimately this program will develop novel technologies that will protect service members from morbidity and mortality associated with BSI. FY 2024 Plans: - Initiate development of carriers that can circulate in the bloodstream for up to three days. - Evaluate the binding affinity of pathogen-agnostic recognition sequences to different types of fungi and bacteria.- - 7.500 Volume 1 - 39 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601117E: BASIC OPERATIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCE UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 8 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2024 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0601117E / BASIC OPERATIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCE C.

FY 2024 reflects program initiation. Title: Outpacing Infectious Disease Description: Military readiness and national security depend on the health and well-being of military service members. Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance. Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness. The Outpacing Infectious Disease program is investigating fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen. Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses. Additionally, methodologies to predict the duration of immune protection are being explored. This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re-formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants. Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a national security risk as a potential pandemic. FY 2023 Plans: - Submit Investigational New Drug (IND) package for clinical trials for therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs). - Complete current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) production of TIPs for clinical trial. - Initiate clinical safety trial for TIPs. FY 2023 to FY 2024 - Title: Preventing the Emergence of Disease (PED) Description: Many emerging infectious disease outbreaks have origins in animal reservoirs and occur in areas where DoD personnel are deployed, putting them at high risk of endemic and emerging diseases. The Preventing the Emergence of Disease (PED) program is investigating how animal pathogens are transmitted to humans and exploring novel approaches to prevent these events. Tools such as detailed molecular analysis and bioinformatics will be leveraged. Researchers will develop models to quantify the probability of pathogen disease transmission from animals to humans. Promising intervention approaches will be developed to prevent viral species jumps from animal reservoirs to humans. Predicting such jumps is a key capability to mitigating outbreaks originating in animal reservoirs.

Title: Deployable Medical Countermeasures for Warfighter Readiness Description: Maintaining robust protection and treatment against infectious disease threats during stabilization operations (e.g., Humanitarian and Disaster Relief [HADR]) requires rapid drug discovery and reducing manufacturing and supply chain burdens. A major limitation of our current response to emerging biological and chemical threats is the lack of immediate availability of ideal medical countermeasures (MCMs) for rapid response, which includes high quality nucleic acid templates for MCM manufacturing. These nucleic acids are also critical for R&D applications ranging from synthetic biology to the testing and development of medical countermeasures. Current DNA production capabilities are limited to less than a handful of US-based manufacturers; it takes weeks to months to produce adequate quality and quantity of DNA at these manufacturing sites and ship them to downstream partners. The Deployable Medical Countermeasures for Warfighter Readiness program aims to develop an on- demand deployable platform to manufacture nucleic acid drugs safely at scale, in short timeframes. The platform will be comprised of a fully contained system capable of selectively manufacturing relevant doses of current Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) grade nucleic acid therapeutics at or near the point of care. This effort will also develop high quality gene-length DNA for research and development. This on-demand platform will enable countermeasures capable of combating novel threats, allowing a small force to prevent regional outbreaks from becoming global emergencies.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the Information and Communications Technology Program that is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies. This PE also supports innovation and robust transition planning in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs to increase the likelihood that DARPA funded technologies take root in the U.S. and provide new capabilities for national defense. The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications. Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems. The project therefore aims not only to create new computing platforms to include quantum technology, but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems. Advances in these areas will allow for DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations. Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, will support new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications. The Cyber Security project is developing the computing, networking, and cyber security technologies required to protect DoD, U.S. government, and U.S. civilian information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems. Information technologies enable important existing and new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. industry. Meanwhile, cyber threats grow in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and U.S. economic competitiveness at risk. The technologies developed in this project will enhance the resilience of information systems to current and emerging cyber threats, enable broad situational awareness of the cyber domain, and provide the basis for accurate, calibrated, and safe cyber response.

Of particular interest are systems that can understand human language, extract information, and reliably categorize content contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act. The technologies developed in this project will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; software developers and certifiers to design, implement, evaluate, and accredit cyber-physical systems and other complex software-reliant systems with greater efficiency and confidence; and unmanned systems and semi-autonomous agents to perform critical missions in contested physical and virtual environments safely and reliably.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2022 The Open, Programmable, Secure 5G (OPS-5G) program is developing open source, 5G network software that ensures security and stimulates innovation in mobile wireless hardware. Current trends in mobile wireless technology development are unfavorable in that the U.S. and allies are increasingly dependent on proprietary technologies offered by foreign suppliers. OPS-5G will develop standards-compliant software for 5G mobile wireless networks that is open source, programmable, and secure by design. The availability of open-source software for 5G will have the additional benefit of opening the mobile wireless hardware market to new participants, stimulating innovation and competition. The OPS-5G program aims to move the mobile wireless market off its current model of opaque, proprietary, and vertically-integrated technology provided by a small number of dominant vendors to a more robust model with increased transparency and open-source technology created by a diverse ecosystem of academic and commercial software and hardware developers. OPS-5G will be coordinated with existing open-source 5G efforts and U.S. Government, DoD, and industry stakeholders. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop and evaluate security architectures capable of defending Internet of Things (loT) class devices with low size, weight, and power characteristics. - Scale programmability-based network defenses to handle large-scale distributed denial of service attacks, deploy, and evaluate security architectures on multiple DoD sites. - Demonstrate secure voice call capabilities over untrusted network nodes to commercial vendors and service providers, the DoD, and other U.S. Government stakeholders.20.000 22.300 21.500 Volume 1 - 58 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 - Test and validate integrated information protection techniques suitable for current and future mobile wireless systems to support DoD operational security needs.

Title: Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) Description: The Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) program is creating methods and tools to recover succinct models of domain data abstractions and logic from source code, add enhancements to the models, and convert them to performant new component implementations verified to be compatible and secure. DoD has a critical need for replacing or reworking components of existing software with more secure and more performant code, including cases where a key performance or security benefit comes from moving parts of the software to new hardware, such as utilizing hardware accelerators, isolation enclaves, offload processors, and distributed computation. However, at present, enhancing legacy software components faces high risk that the new software will not be fully compatible with the existing larger environment. Moreover, verified software is currently written from scratch, starting with a formal specification, rather than incrementally added to a system as provably compatible enhancements. V-SPELLS will address these problems by combining novel concepts in verified programming with recent developments in domain specific languages (DSLs) and systems architecture. V-SPELLS aims to enable piecewise, compatible-by-construction improvement of software components in legacy DoD systems, providing incremental software (re)engineering the benefits of formal software verification currently available only to clean-slate development efforts. FY 2023 Plans: - Refine automated techniques for decomposing legacy code into functional modules with domain data structure and operation definitions, enabling safe replacement and enhancement of targeted components with high-level DSL code. - Integrate development environment for convergent DSL programming with decomposition tools that automate program understanding and downstream compilation tools that produce executable artifacts. - Demonstrate utility by replacing a component in a large legacy distributed system. - Apply tools to DoD legacy components in order to enhance security and performance while ensuring compositional correctness and safety. FY 2024 Plans: - Extend user interface to enable inference of specifications most relevant to component domains and most useful for verification goals. - Develop additional analysis and synthesis passes to increase the percentage of legacy code that can be enhanced by the tools. - Develop connections between component interface models and architectural modeling tools to facilitate adoption by developers. - Demonstrate the enhancement of software components for a platform representative of DoD needs.14.750 18.000 18.000 Title: Hardening Development Toolchains Against Emergent Execution Engines (HARDEN) 5.000 11.000 15.500 Volume 1 - 60 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 Description: The Hardening Development Toolchains Against Emergent Execution Engines (HARDEN) program is developing techniques and tools to anticipate, isolate, and mitigate emergent system behaviors and thereby improve security of complex integrated software. Today's software development toolchains and testing methodologies provide very limited means for reasoning about adversarial reuse of code as written and designed. This results in unwitting creation of stable, reliable patterns of emergent behaviors within systems that adversaries can reuse in attacks. The HARDEN approach to preventing adversarial code reuse is to create techniques, tools, metadata, and instrumentation for reasoning about emergent execution at all stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC), and for flagging code segments and design patterns where there is high potential for adversarial reuse and emergent execution. To assess their utility, HARDEN technologies will be applied to critical system elements such as bootloaders and to integrated software systems. If successful, the technologies developed by HARDEN will facilitate efficient mitigation of complex code-reuse and emergent-execution vulnerabilities at early SDLC stages, and provide the stronger roots-of- trust required by zero-trust architectures and high-assurance integrated military software systems. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop models and mitigations for composable emergent behaviors and for the reliable chaining of exploit primitives even where the effects of any single behavior or flaw are reduced by security mitigations. - Explore automated techniques for identifying implementations that are likely to result in composable emergent behaviors, and for suggesting transformations of implementations that, while semantically equivalent, mitigate emergent composability and thereby disrupt exploit programming. - Initiate application of concepts and techniques to critical system elements such as bootloaders and high-assurance integrated military software systems with the goal of demonstrating the capability to mitigate complex code-reuse/emergent-execution vulnerabilities at early SDLC stages. FY 2024 Plans: - Refine tools involving formal methods and hardware inference engines for reasoning about emergent behaviors and mitigating against exploit programming to scale from component-level analysis to subsystems. - Formalize description languages to construct models of emergent execution including operational exploits and to facilitate usage by non-formal modeling experts. - Establish an initial Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps)-enabled infrastructure and associated workflow to enable integration and facilitate flow from modeling to tooling. - Perform initial evaluation of the effectiveness and accuracy of tools, employing methods such as white-box testing and reverse engineering.

Title: Assured Micropatching (AMP) Description: The Assured Micropatching (AMP) program is developing technologies to enable the rapid production of targeted micropatches to repair legacy program binaries with strong guarantees. At present, the emergency patching of legacy software, even if all relevant information is available, creates too much uncertainty and takes far too long to validate, leaving critical systems with known flaws vulnerable to adversary attack. AMP will create the capability to analyze, modify, and fix legacy software in binary form even when the original source code and/or build process is not fully available. The AMP technical approach involves automatic discovery of known vulnerable components, goal-driven decompilation to isolate and analyze the vulnerable binary components, and minimal-change patching and recompilation to rebuild affected binaries with strong guarantees that the patch will not impair the functions of the system. The technologies developed by AMP aim to enable cyber defenders to quickly and accurately patch legacy binaries in the deployed software systems upon which our military depends. FY 2023 Plans: - Enable and demonstrate the automatic patching of vulnerabilities where exploitation does not involve memory corruption. - Improve and optimize the existing intermediate representations and optimize the location of the provided patch within the original binary. - Conduct a challenge event demonstrating patching of a real-time control device currently in use in a cyber physical system. FY 2024 Plans: - Update micropatch positioning and verifiability adjustments for challenge platforms and patch types. - Demonstrate the automatic patching of vulnerabilities for additional use cases of interest to the DoD. - Conduct a challenge event of a networked system of electronic control modules interoperating over a standard data bus used in commercial vehicles, with appropriate test cases for the whole-system evaluation. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 decrease reflects the shift from development of technologies to enable the rapid production of targeted micropatches to demonstration of these tools and techniques on systems of interest to the DoD.17.000 16.200 9.000 Title: Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation (SIEVE) Description: The Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation (SIEVE) program is developing technology to enable the creation of mathematically verifiable public statements derived from sensitive information that remains hidden. To accomplish this, SIEVE will produce advances in a cryptographic technique known as zero knowledge (ZK) proofs, which simultaneously enable mathematical verification of public statements while provably hiding the sensitive information from which16.000 17.500 9.500 Volume 1 - 62 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 11 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 the statement is derived. The advances produced by SIEVE will make it possible and operationally feasible to verify statements substantially more complex than the current ZK state of the art supports, for example, statements about a software vulnerability that do not reveal details of how the vulnerability can be exploited. FY 2023 Plans: - Determine the feasibility of efficient, end to end verifiable, distributed architectures for private data communication. - Extend ZK proof compilers to additional problem classes and to accommodate probabilistic problem statements. - Further enhance post-quantum analyses to reduce theoretical proof complexity for important use cases and potential transition partners. - Scale-up ZK proof techniques to realistic DoD and U.S. Government use cases and evaluate their functionality, information leakage, and robustness to attack in collaboration with potential transition partners. FY 2024 Plans: - Develop and demonstrate technologies to enhance the privacy of users of cloud, internet, and wireless technologies to enhance DoD operational security and counter digital authoritarianism. - Formulate high-fidelity emulators and modeling tools to enable integration of quantum communications with classical networks. - Optimize ZK proof techniques and quantify the functionality, information leakage, and robustness to attack of ZK proof technology in collaboration with potential transition partners. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY reflects ramping down of work to develop ZK proof techniques and focus shifting to evaluation on realistic use cases of interest to the DoD. Title: Fast Network Interface Cards (FastNICs) Description: The Fast Network Interface Cards (FastNICs) program is creating new networking technologies to accelerate the computation of distributed applications. Today's network and computing subsystems are badly out of balance with each other, a result of incremental technology advances in networking and computing market silos. This has produced a bottleneck at the network interface used to connect a machine to an external network, severely limiting the input/output capability. FastNICs will develop new input/output technologies based on more realistic models of complex multiprocessor compute, interconnect, and memory subsystems. FastNICs aims to enable a dramatic increase in computational throughput for distributed applications such as training of machine learning systems. FY 2023 Plans: - Scale performance and demonstrate network interface hardware on multi-core central processing units.11.000 12.000 5.999 Volume 1 - 63 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 12 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 - Design and develop high-fidelity network simulation to enable accurate performance modeling of workflows over various network topologies. - Evaluate versions of widely used distributed systems software and operating systems that accommodate massively parallel input data streams, and demonstrate machine learning applications to commercial vendors, the DoD, and Intelligence Community.

FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY decrease reflects the shift from development of advanced input/output technologies to workflow demonstrations on DoD and commercial networks. Title: Signature Management using Operational Knowledge and Environments (SMOKE) Description: The Signature Management using Operational Knowledge and Environments (SMOKE) program will develop signature management technologies that generate evasive cyber infrastructure which minimizes signatures as a source of attribution. SMOKE will accomplish this goal by incorporating counter-attribution techniques into the design process; quantitatively measuring attribution risk in real-time; and maintaining evasiveness after infrastructure changes. SMOKE will develop data-driven tools to automate the planning and execution of threat emulated cyber infrastructure needed for network security assessments by red teams. SMOKE will also develop data-driven tools to automate the discovery of cyber threat infrastructure signatures. SMOKE will prototype components that enable red teams to plan, build, and deploy cyber infrastructure that is informed by machine- readable signatures of sophisticated cyber threats. FY 2023 Plans: - Formulate concepts for signature management technologies that enable evasive cyber infrastructure. - Develop tools to automate the acquisition, management, and disposal of red team cyber infrastructure that mimics advanced cyber threat actors, to extract infrastructure associations from large-scale cyber datasets, and to generate machine readable signatures of advanced cyber threats. - Initiate design and implementation of a distributed development environment that enables concurrent development and operational assessment across the military services and commands as a means for accelerating the creation of new cyber capabilities.

FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 increase reflects scaling up of efforts to develop signature management technologies and initiation of performance evaluations in collaboration with potential transition partners. Title: Cyber Agents for Security Testing and Learning Environments (CASTLE) Description: The Cyber Agents for Security Testing and Learning Environments (CASTLE) program, expanding on approaches initiated in the Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) program (PE 0602303E, Project IT-03), will develop an AI-toolkit to instantiate realistic network environments and train cyber agents to enable resilient network operations against advanced persistent threats (APTs). CASTLE will formulate network hardening as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and teach RL agents to operate through the post-breach behavior of widely available penetration testing tools. Over progressive rounds of attack and defense, agents will explore defensive actions to proactively stop on-going attacks while maintaining operationally relevant workflows. Environments will execute agents inside instrumented subnets that are deployed to live networks and will simulate defensive actions that counter APT tools. Agent execution will produce calibrated datasets for progressively improving simulations. The defensive cyber agents developed under CASTLE will provide the DoD with continual security assessments of critical networks and real-time response to cyber attacks.

Title: Constellation Description: The Constellation program, building upon all cyber security technologies developed in this PE and Project, will develop technologies, capabilities, and prototype systems to enable full spectrum military cyberspace operations to deter, disrupt, and if necessary, defeat adversary cyber actors to defend the U.S. Constellation is a collaborative effort involving the cyber operator, acquisition, and developer communities, who will collectively prioritize, select, plan, and approve the development and demonstration of operational prototype systems based on the results of completed and on-going basic and applied research efforts. In this way, Constellation will provide a bridge between S&T and acquisition. Once a specific operational prototype has been selected and approved for development under Constellation, agile development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) will be used to enable operator feedback to drive development and thereby ensure relevance to highly dynamic cyber missions. Technologies of interest include but are not limited to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science (DS); resilient software, networking, and computing systems; data and information assurance; and cyber threat intelligence. The work achieves high relevance through close coordination with U.S. cyber operators and the use as appropriate DevSecOps and other collaborative development processes. The work achieves high velocity through streamlined acquisition, assessment, approval, and deployment processes.

Title: Securing the Software Supply Chain Description: The Securing the Software Supply Chain program will create software development technologies that provide visibility into the software components incorporated and the build chain employed in the creation of complex programs that reuse open and other diverse sources. Software supply chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds) are growing in sophistication and severity. These attacks are enabled by the long complex chains of software reuse which hide dependencies and increase the difficulty of finding and remediating vulnerabilities. The growing dependence on open-source software, where contributor motives may also be obscure, further exacerbates this problem. In addition, lack of knowledge regarding the build chain by which source code is compiled, linked, and loaded results in an executable program about which very little is known, and so the problem of opacity is reinforced at multiple stages in the software development process. The program will develop technologies for automatically tracking the software bill of materials (SBOM), including for software with uncertain provenance, as an important step towards mitigating software supply chain risks. FY 2024 Plans: - Create methods that identify explicit and implicit software dependencies based on automated program and development environment understanding. - Develop automated techniques for collecting or inferring detailed information about the build chain used to create the executable from the source code. - Develop techniques for identifying and tracking high-risk open-source activities.

At present, techniques to measure the severity of software vulnerabilities focus on the exploitability of individual vulnerabilities and ignore the possibility of sequencing exploits into chains, thereby magnifying their severity. To obtain a more accurate assessment, AAV will map vulnerabilities back to the underlying flaw, identify its pre- and post-conditions, and use program analysis and machine learning to assess the potential for composing the associated exploits. FY 2024 Plans: - Formulate approaches for mapping the symptoms of a vulnerability back to the underlying flaw and for identifying pre- and post- conditions. - Develop techniques to accurately assess the severity of a vulnerability chain in software systems with state-of-the-art defenses. - Develop approaches to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in business process applications. - Explore and prioritize demonstrations of severity analysis on vulnerabilities of interest to transition partners. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 increase reflects program initiation. Title: Resilient Anonymous Communication for Everyone (RACE) Description: The Resilient Anonymous Communication for Everyone (RACE) program is developing cryptographic and communication obfuscation technologies to enable anonymous, attack-resilient, mobile communications within a network environment. RACE is developing a mobile communication application and distributed systems that provide a secure message- passing service by combining advances in distributed system tasking with communication protocol encapsulation methods. The RACE system will maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of messaging while preventing large-scale compromise of the system. RACE security is based on rigorous security arguments or statistical arguments based on realistic simulations, and not on ad hoc estimates of security. FY 2023 Plans: - Improve the efficiency of techniques for computing on encrypted routing information to enable the system to scale an additional order of magnitude. - Integrate enhanced components into the secure message-passing system with improved capability to counter a cyber adversary who has the capability to manipulate communication protocol information and interfere with communication nodes. - Enhance the testbed and demonstrate the integrated secure message-passing system against a simulated cyber adversary that has knowledge of and access to the system.

The demand for computing services is growing within both the U.S. Government and commercial industry. In response, new technical approaches are being developed to provide massive computation efficiently and cost effectively. In particular, distributed data centers with high-speed interconnects and customizable hardware, including graphics processing units (GPU) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), are being used by service providers to achieve greater efficiency and improved processing performance. MemOp is exploring new memory architectures that more fully leverage emerging customizable hardware to deliver computing services reliably and at reduced cost. The more promising MemOp memory architectures will be implemented and evaluated in hardware and software. The technologies developed in MemOp will provide enhanced efficiency and improved performance for large scale computing systems. FY 2023 Plans: - Optimize integration of memory and accelerated processing pipelines and evaluate improvements on program testbed. - Harden and transition memory optimization technologies to industry and DoD. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) Description: The Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) program is developing data-driven tools for real-time cyber threat detection, characterization, and protection within enterprise-scale networks. U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, but at present there are few capabilities to efficiently extract and analyze the right data from the right device at the right time for DoD- scale information networks. For example, analysis of an in-memory exploit requires detailed data from a few devices, while analysis of a global botnet attack requires summary data from a great many devices. CHASE is developing novel algorithms and analysis tools to dynamically collect data from across the network, actively hunt for advanced threats that evade routine security measures, and automatically disseminate protective measures that bolster the collective cyber defense posture. FY 2023 Plans: - Integrate threat detection, data retention, and global analysis methods, and harden capabilities for transition to DoD stakeholders. - Transition cyber threat detection and protective measure dissemination technologies to DoD stakeholders.

Title: Computers and Humans Exploring Software Security (CHESS) Description: The Computers and Humans Exploring Software Security (CHESS) program is developing technologies to enable computers and humans to reason collaboratively over software artifacts, such as source code and compiled binaries, with the goal of finding vulnerabilities more rapidly and accurately than unaided human operators. CHESS envisions a future in which high- intensity cyber operations are conducted by computer-human teams. CHESS capabilities will be designed for use by humans of varying skill levels, even those with minimal previous cyber experience or relevant domain knowledge. Achieving the necessary scale and timelines in vulnerability discovery will require innovative combinations of automated program analysis techniques with support for mixed-initiative computer-human collaboration. CHESS aims to enable U.S. operational cyber superiority by combining human-generated insight into the vulnerability discovery process with the speed and scale of computational analysis. FY 2023 Plans: - Quantify the degree to which the cyber reasoning techniques enable non-experts in vulnerability discovery to approach expert- level efficacy. - Harden an end-to-end, integrated computer-human software reasoning system and transition to the DoD and IC. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Searchlight Description: The Searchlight program is developing technologies to ensure that quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees are met for distributed applications operating across the Internet. The increasing use of Internet-based distributed applications creates risks as surges in network use can result in resource shortfalls. Searchlight will develop novel approaches for allocating inherently limited network resources to optimize the performance of distributed applications. Searchlight techniques and systems aim to enable organizations to adapt the QoS for their low-priority traffic resulting in improved QoS for their high-priority traffic without affecting traffic from other Internet users. Searchlight technologies will become increasingly important as 5G systems provide advanced capabilities for organizations to adapt their QoS guarantees. FY 2023 Plans: - Demonstrate an integrated QoS management prototype on relevant use cases and transition to DoD and commercial network service providers.

Title: Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) Description: The Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) program developed technologies to automatically identify, disrupt and investigate social engineering attacks via bot-mediated communications. Social engineering attacks, such as phishing and spear-phishing, typically gain user trust via impersonation to induce behaviors or elicit sensitive information that compromise security of an information system. At present, defending against social engineering attacks falls largely to human users. ASED prevented social engineering attacks by creating counter-social-engineering bots that act on behalf of users to mediate and aggregate communications and auto-identify attackers. ASED greatly reduced the effectiveness of adversary social engineering attacks and improve the security of DoD information systems.6.600 - - Title: Cora Description: The Cora program developed technologies to enable machines to read heterogeneous text-based data sources, extract key entities and activities, and characterize cyber threats. Large volumes of text-based data contain scattered clues about the activities of cyber threats. Automated machine reading and analysis capabilities are required due to the extreme rates at which this text-based data is generated. In addition, the connections between extracted entities and their activities can be very subtle and, because they are buried in noise, difficult to detect and correlate. The Cora technologies assisted cyber analysts by providing them with pre-processed cyber leads that otherwise might not be available.10.740 - - Title: Hardware Optimization (HOP) Description: The Hardware Optimization (HOP) program developed hardware optimizations for national security purposes. Specifically, HOP enabled new national security workloads in high performance microelectronic hardware. This research produced end-to-end hardware optimization toolkits to enhance hardware designs. These toolkits are comprised of algorithms, digital design files, documentation, and binaries.17.100 - - Title: Harnessing Autonomy for Countering Cyber-adversary Systems (HACCS) Description: The Harnessing Autonomy for Countering Cyber-adversary Systems (HACCS) program developed safe and reliable autonomous software agents that can neutralize botnet implants and similar large-scale malware in networked devices. HACCS developed technologies to (1) identify and characterize botnet-conscripted networks of devices to determine the types of devices and the software services running on them with sufficient precision to infer the presence of known vulnerabilities; (2) generate software exploits for a large number of known vulnerabilities that can be used to establish initial presence in each botnet- conscripted network without disrupting system functionality; and (3) create high-assurance software agents that can autonomously navigate within botnet-conscripted networks, identify botnet implants, and curtail their ability to operate while minimizing side9.240 - - Volume 1 - 71 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 20 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 effects to systems and infrastructure. HACCS technologies enable U.S. agencies possessing the appropriate authorities to safely conduct Internet-scale counter-botnet operations. Title: Intent-Defined Adaptive Software (IDAS) Description: The Intent-Defined Adaptive Software (IDAS) program developed technologies to represent the intent of software and its abstract constraints separately from its concrete instantiation, for the purpose of enabling rapid code synthesis and continual adaptation. Modern weapons platforms are increasingly dependent on complex software, increasing the risk of system failures and creating new attack surfaces for adversaries. Software engineers often manage complexity by choosing a particular option that fulfills the immediate needs of the development effort (e.g., by concretization). IDAS developed techniques for deferring software concretizations until uncertainties are resolved, either at build time or during run time, for complex systems. IDAS technology can significantly reduce software development time and maintenance costs, thereby enabling DoD to acquire, sustain, and improve software-based capabilities more cost-effectively.6.379 - - Title: Configuration Security Description: The Configuration Security program developed technologies to analyze, monitor, and modify the configuration of composed cyber-physical-human systems to identify system vulnerabilities and minimize the attack surface while maintaining functionality and performance. Complex cyber-physical systems, such as ships, airplanes, and critical infrastructure, increasingly make use of multiple commodity information technology components. The manual configuration necessary to enable each component to interoperate introduces exploitable cyber vulnerabilities, as do the standard operating procedures that system operators follow. The Configuration Security program developed capabilities to automate the appropriate configuration of such systems within the operational context, ensure secure configuration settings, and prevent malicious changes to these settings.6.050 - - Title: Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) Description: The Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program developed the design, analysis and verification tools needed to allow systems engineers to design-in cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do other quality attributes when designing complex embedded computing systems. The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering. The CASE technical approach formulated cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering. The challenge of resiliency is that it cannot be established through conventional testing methods. CASE focused on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex3.000 - - Volume 1 - 72 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 21 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 networked cyber-physical systems. CASE technologies enable the design of cyber-physical systems that robustly execute their intended function despite the efforts of sophisticated cyber adversaries. Title: Enhanced Attribution Description: The Enhanced Attribution program developed technologies to associate malicious cyber actions with individual adversary operators, and to publicly reveal these actions without compromising sources and methods. The program focused on new approaches for identifying malicious cyber operators, analyzing their software tools and actions, and confirming this information with commercial and public sources of data. As the attribution techniques were developed and showed promise, they provided the basis for new cyber capabilities such as indications and warning of adversary cyber actions. These technologies were implemented in tools for evaluation by potential transition partners.3.000 - Analytics (Cyber) - Congressional Add FY 2022 Accomplishments: - Formulated translation layers between currently siloed binary analysis tools to accelerate progress and enhance capabilities across binary analysis stacks. - Formulated development-to-deployment remote attestation capabilities that can be verified and deployed on a DoD-relevant Zero-Trust Architecture application. - Explored prototype systems that provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability of messaging to enable privacy of communication even in hostile settings. - Extended location-aware privacy capabilities to enhance the operational security of DoD and U.S. Government personnel outside of the continental U.S. - Enhanced technologies and integrated in a simulation platform to facilitate evaluation of power grid restoration capabilities.15.000 - Congressional Adds Subtotals 15.000 - C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but also as trustworthy partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human language, extract information, and reliably categorize content contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act. The technologies developed in this project will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; software developers and certifiers to design, implement, evaluate, and accredit cyber-physical systems and other complex software-reliant systems with greater efficiency and confidence; and unmanned systems and semi-autonomous agents to perform critical missions in contested physical and virtual environments safely and reliably. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2022 Title: Description: The Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AAI) program seeks to go beyond commercially-driven advances in AI and to address important national security challenge applications. In particular, this program is focused on improving human-AI collaborations to mitigate current bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities. If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly accelerate the pace of innovation in many important DoD domains while also reducing the time and cost associated with approval and certification processes needed to transition and deploy new technologies. One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current developmental, approval, and certification processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to greater automation with minimal human intervention. Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems, particularly in novel and/or unanticipated situations. Approaches to addressing these challenges will leverage recent advances at the frontiers of AI research in transfer learning, causal reasoning and associated models. AAI application areas include the following: (1) machine-enabled techniques to efficiently capture, generate, and analyze disparate data sources to accelerate design and development of new materials and chemistries for DoD specific applications; and (2) knowledge management tools that can efficiently capture and disseminate an organization's expertise, experience and data; and (3) social context informed AI approaches to enable reliable and robust forecasting and decision aiding tools for stabilization, deterrence and gray zone operations.55.000 47.500 30.365 Volume 1 - 74 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 23 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 INTELLIGENCE FY 2024 FY 2023 Plans: - Evaluate research in methods to improve human operators' ability to innovate with their AI-enabled platforms during off-nominal scenarios including simulated system failures. - Develop, test, and refine models of the situational awareness demands imposed by yet-to-be-built autonomous systems. - Develop, test, and refine design tools for composing whole-system human machine interfaces. - Continue construction of rapidly reconfigurable human machine interface test environments for highly automated and AI-enabled platforms. - Extend efforts to measure and aggregate an individual's preconscious neural and physiological responses into actionable evidence regarding that individual's beliefs. - Formulate preliminary methods for converting interview questions into stimuli that evoke preconscious neural and physiological responses. - Identify variables that confound the data collection process necessary for aggregating an individual's preconscious response to stimuli. - Demonstrate improved computational efficiency of scalable methods to generate accurate statistics at the outputs of machine learning systems, enabling improved sensor fusion. - Refine approaches for composing techniques into scalable proof generation and repair capabilities within development platforms to increase assurance of systems. - Conduct Legal, Moral, and Ethical (LME) working groups and engagements with industry and university performers to provide technical, academic, and operation expertise and advise on best practices and DoD ethical AI principles. - Develop foundational AI science, advance the state of the art in AI engineering, and create human-machine teaming approaches that support trustworthy AI for mission- and safety-critical domains.

The 2024 decrease reflects a shift from development and prototyping to testing. Title: Learning Introspective Control (LINC) Description: The Learning Introspective Control (LINC) program is developing machine introspection and learning technologies to characterize a modified or damaged military platform from its behavior, and update the control law to maintain stability and control. The current approach to handling platform modification or damage places the burden of recovery and control on the operator, whether the operator is human or an autonomous controller. In contrast, a platform equipped with LINC technology would continually compare the real-time behavior of the platform as measured by on-board sensors with a learned model, determine if the current observed behavior of the platform differs from that model in ways that might compromise stability and control, and implement an updated control law when required. The LINC capability would aid operators in maintaining effective control of military platforms that suffer damage in battle or have been modified in the field to address emergent requirements identified during operations. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop control reconstitution algorithms with performance and computational efficiency necessary for complex DoD systems. - Design and implement a testbed for assessing integrated machine introspection and learning approaches for automated recovery and control of military platforms that suffer damage in battle or are modified in the field. - Develop a computational platform to support experiments involving cyber-physical systems and high-priority use cases in collaboration with Service transition partners. FY 2024 Plans: - Demonstrate computational efficiency of control reconstitution algorithms and establish suitability for integration in DoD systems that have limited spare computational resources. - Integrate initial machine introspection and learning algorithms on the testbed and make performance measurements to establish the feasibility of automated recovery and control of military platforms that suffer damage in battle or are modified in the field. - Perform experiments involving recovery and control of cyber-physical systems and high-priority use cases in collaboration with Service transition partners.

Title: Symbiotic Design Description: The Symbiotic Design program is developing artificial intelligence-based approaches to augment human teams in the design of cyber-physical systems (CPS), and thereby significantly reduce time to deployment and improve the quality of deployed systems. The current generation of DoD systems and platforms integrate cyber and physical subsystems, but the capability of the engineering teams has not scaled with the enormous complexity of modern CPS. Engineering organizations require large teams of engineers that collectively possess the necessary domain knowledge (of component technologies, theories, and tools), but the prolonged timelines of the development process for modern CPS hinders DoD's ability to counter emerging threats. The Symbiotic Design program will address this challenge by transforming the human-focused, model-based design flows used today into a symbiotic process of collaborative analysis by humans and continuously-learning artificial intelligence (AI)-based co-designers. The program will create technologies essential for AI co-design: design space construction, design composition, and design space exploration. The program will demonstrate the approach at realistic scales by a sequence of CPS design challenges of increasing complexity, and quantify the results with respect to development time, system performance, quality, and innovation metrics. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop multi-domain inferencing techniques to automate multi-domain reasoning and model learning. - Scale up techniques for exploration of high-dimensional, multi-domain, combinatorial, and parametric design spaces. - Conduct design hackathons to study productivity of designers and quality of design using conventional engineering tools in comparison to when an AI co-designer and symbiotic design technologies are used. - Perform demonstration and evaluation of symbiotic design technologies through applications to sub-systems and systems of interest to the DoD. FY 2024 Plans: - Develop new mathematical techniques to address topological and 3D placement challenges in complex cyber physical systems design. - Develop integrated toolchains that construct design spaces for a given (partial or complete) design problem and seed designs; automatically compose and evaluate a design point; and explore high-dimensional, multi-domain combinatorial design spaces. - Conduct design hackathons to study the performance and originality of the cyber-physical systems designed using the integrated symbiotic design technologies and toolchains. - Demonstrate and evaluate symbiotic design technologies and integrated toolchains for complex systems of interest to the DoD.

Title: Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) Description: The Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence (AI) Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) program is developing AI and machine learning technologies to aid a human operator in understanding complex sequences of events in the world. For the purposes of KAIROS, an event is an occurrence that results in an observable and recognizable change in either the physical world or human activity. Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security. The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that codify existing event-representation schemas and, when needed, create and codify new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators. Given multimedia inputs, operators will use KAIROS technologies to identify subsidiary event elements, determine their temporal order, recognize complex event sequences, and link disparate events. KAIROS technologies aim to enable analysts and warfighters to understand unfolding events rapidly and accurately. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop the means to interpolate events of interest not reported in multiple sources that occur within complex sequences of events. - Develop the means to predict future events from a sequence of complex events as it is unfolding. - Evaluate the event detection and prediction capabilities with DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) users on problems related to stabilization in regional conflicts. - Optimize the system in response to operational partner assessments on complex real-world event sequences and initiate transition of the technology. FY 2024 Plans: - Develop the means to compute and display sequential information about the constituent events in a complex event and specify when order is or is not important in the sequence. - Design and run an evaluation with potential users to determine the effectiveness of the event schema-based platform in comparison with existing tools. - Prepare an end-to-end analytic platform as well as a schema creation platform for transition partners. FY 2023 to Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 decrease reflects ramping down of development of techniques for learning complex event schemas and event discovery and prediction, and focus shifting to evaluation of techniques and refinements to facilitate transition.22.000 25.300 13.000 Software 12.000 Volume 1 - 78 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 27 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 INTELLIGENCE 2023 FY 2024 Description: The Automated Rapid Certification Of Software (ARCOS) program is developing technologies that automate the capture and evaluation of software assurance evidence to enable certifiers to assess system risks earlier in the process and to commit to engineering decisions more rapidly and safely. Current software certification practices do not scale with the extent, complexity, and interconnection of software being developed by the DoD, so certification is becoming a bottleneck to new system deployment. ARCOS technologies address DoD software system certification time and cost. ARCOS technology will automatically and interactively generate strong assurance arguments that incorporate supporting evidence for certification criteria. ARCOS will also develop techniques to compose assurance arguments for pre-evaluated components into consolidated assurance arguments for new systems incorporating those components. FY 2023 Plans: - Expand assurance case generation to address assurance criteria in multiple domains such as safety and security. - Develop a mechanism to track the provenance of assurance evidence used in assurance case arguments. - Demonstrate an approach to assurance-driven software development that generates evidence appropriate for the high confidence software assurance required for military systems. - Demonstrate automated generation of assurance arguments for a representative complex military system. FY 2024 Plans: - Demonstrate automated assurance case generation and composition to enable simultaneous evaluation of assurance criteria in multiple domains such as safety and security. - Demonstrate assurance-driven software development for a representative complex military system that requires high confidence software assurance. - Integrate and harden technologies for automated generation of assurance arguments for use by potential transition partners. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 decrease reflects ramping down of development of assurance generation techniques and focus shifting to demonstration, hardening, and transition of the software assurance technology. Title: Assured Autonomy Description: The Assured Autonomy program is developing rigorous design and analysis technologies for continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems to enhance system safety in uncertain environments. Currently, the state of the art for test, evaluation, verification, and validation is only applicable to non-learning systems operating in well-characterized environments. As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance. Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems.

FY 2024 Plans: - Transition integrated toolchain and assurance tools DoD partners. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 decrease reflects a shift from assurance toolchain integration and demonstration to transition of an integrated toolchain to DoD partners. Title: Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Modeling (ASKEM) Description: The Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Modeling (ASKEM) program is developing technologies and tools for the agile creation, sustainment, and enhancement of complex models and simulators to enable knowledge extraction and data-informed decision making in diverse scientific domains and military missions. Current modeling and simulation pipelines do not maintain the relevant inputs, assumptions, and modeling choices made during development, while rapidly changing knowledge, semantically-opaque models, and black-box simulators make pipelined development nearly impossible. ASKEM enables a new paradigm for scientific modeling analogous to the transition in software development from the lengthy waterfall model to agile, continual Development and Operations (DevOps). ASKEM modeling automation tools 1) extract model components from documents and code while abstracting implementation details like math framework, language, and platform; 2) compose distinct model and simulator components; and 3) integrate all elements and processes in an extensible workbench that addresses the entire modeling and simulation lifecycle. ASKEM tools enable experts to maintain, reuse, and adapt large collections of heterogeneous data, knowledge, and models with traceability across knowledge sources, model assumptions, and model fitness and thereby bring agile, pipelined development to modeling and simulation. ASKEM technologies will be applied to multiple use cases to drive scalability and generality. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop formal representations and techniques for machine-assisted modeling that support automated composition and decomposition for model creation, sustainment, and customization. - Develop tools for machine-assisted simulator design and construction to enable the rapid composition of models, frameworks, and solvers that are problem appropriate.- 19.200 23.700 Volume 1 - 80 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 29 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 INTELLIGENCE in Millions) FY 2022 FY 2024 - Develop tools for continual machine-assisted validation of models, including construction of fitness-for-purpose simulators. - Initiate development of an extensible workbench that spans the entire modeling and simulation lifecycle to facilitate technology evaluation on diverse use cases in collaboration with transition partners. FY 2024 Plans: - Establish baselines and measure technical component performance for accuracy, timeliness, maintainability, and scalability in selected evaluation domains. - Implement and test all interfaces and components, develop initial human-machine interface, integrate workbench prototype, and validate technical component integration on papers-to-prediction tasks. - Evaluate utility of the integrated system by comparing performance of modelers working with and without the tools on multiple tasks. - Demonstrate and initiate evaluation of the workbench across the entire modeling and simulation lifecycle against diverse use cases in collaboration with transition partners. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 increase reflects continued development of model construction and assembly technologies and scaling up of implementation of technologies in an integrated workbench and evaluation in collaboration with transition partners. Title: Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR) Description: The Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR) program, building on results derived in the Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) program (PE 0602303E, Project IT-04), develops new hybrid AI algorithms that deeply integrate symbolic reasoning with data driven learning to create trustworthy AI-based systems. Here, an AI based system is considered trustworthy if it is: (a) robust to domain informed and adversarial perturbations, (b) supported by an assurance framework that creates and analyzes heterogenous evidence towards safety and risk assessments, and (c) predictable with respect to some specification and model of fitness. ANSR develops hybrid AI algorithms for which it is possible to develop evidence-based techniques that support confident assurance judgments. The key idea is to interleave symbolic and neural representations in hybrid AI algorithms that are capable of acquiring symbolic knowledge through learning and performing symbolic reasoning at scale to deliver robust inference, generalize to new situations, and provide evidence for assurance and trust. ANSR technologies will be demonstrated and evaluated on DoD use cases such as autonomy where trustworthiness is essential. FY 2023 Plans: - Formulate approaches to extract symbolic knowledge from neural network representations. - Initiate development of a pipeline that abstracts neuro symbolic algorithms into formally analyzable representations and evaluates them with respect to a set of mission dependent specifications.- 11.000 14.000 Volume 1 - 81 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 30 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 INTELLIGENCE in Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 - Develop initial use cases and an architecture for engineering and demonstrating mission relevant applications of hybrid AI algorithms. FY 2024 Plans: - Develop and model new hybrid AI algorithms and architectures that deeply integrate symbolic reasoning with data driven machine learning. - Develop an assurance framework and methods for deriving and integrating evidence of correctness and adversarial scenarios for assessing the robustness of hybrid AI algorithms. - Perform initial demonstration and evaluation of hybrid AI technologies and their composition in systems through use cases of interest to the DoD. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 increase reflects ramping up of development of techniques that integrate symbolic reasoning with data-driven machine learning and initiation of evaluation on high priority use cases of interest to the DoD. Title: Learning Autonomy in Synthetic Environments (LASE) Description: The Learning Autonomy in Synthetic Environments (LASE) program will develop simulation-to-simulation and simulation-to-real neuro-symbolic transfer learning techniques that enable more fully unmanned operations by autonomous systems. The autonomy levels of unmanned systems of today are limited because it is assumed that the modeling and simulation (M&S) training environment captures all the relevant phenomena at a high fidelity, when in reality it does not account for the data domain shift common when translating simulation outcomes from the M&S environment to the real world. The LASE approach will integrate symbolic structures (to capture discrete symbolic phenomena like mission objectives) and neural structures (to generalize and encode high-dimensional phenomena like sensor signals, imagery, etc.) to more realistically transfer learned autonomy from a M&S environment. Furthermore, since it is often difficult to choose an appropriate M&S training environment, LASE will also explore the development of a neuro-symbolic digital twin for use in training. LASE transfer of M&S-based learning will enable higher levels of autonomy for systems that operate in environments where command, control, and communications can be restricted or denied. FY 2024 Plans: - Identify universal features of neural perception and symbolic reasoning for sequential decision-making tasks in reinforcement learning. - Formulate approaches for integrating symbolic and neural structures for autonomous systems with higher levels of autonomy. - Develop use cases and a testbed for evaluating performance in terms of time-to-threshold and long-run performance of the neuro-symbolic transfer learning solutions when compared to other transfer learning baselines.

Title: Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) Description: The Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) program is developing a multi-hypothesis semantic engine that generates alternative interpretations of events, situations, and trends from a variety of unstructured sources where there are noisy, conflicting, and potentially deceptive data. At present, information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media, with only informal comparison among competing hypotheses. The consequence of this can be inadequate interpretations, because alternatives are eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence. AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from diverse media into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends. AIDA aims to provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly. FY 2023 Plans: - Enhance the techniques for detecting important changes in otherwise similar documents to achieve a level of precision and recall necessary to enable discovery and analysis of different hypotheses. - Collaborate with transition partners to establish the utility of the technology and tailor the platform for transition partner applications. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Counter Adversarial Artificial Intelligence Description: The Counter Adversarial Artificial Intelligence program enhanced the capability to detect, deflect, and diminish the effects of adversarial attacks on AI-based systems. Defense systems increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities such as machine learning and automated reasoning. These AI-enabled systems are typically engineered and optimized for environments where adversary systems are either static or strictly limited in terms of adaptive behaviors. Engagements between sophisticated AI-enabled systems are likely to become increasingly common going forward. Maintaining AI-superiority for the U.S. will require systems with higher levels of capability. Specific capabilities developed include recognizing when an adversary system is AI-enabled, identifying and modeling adversary AI capabilities based on empirical data, and creating counter-AI strategies including techniques to render adversary AI capabilities ineffective and/or deleterious.6.000 - - Title: Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) Description: The Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) program created technologies to support the development of assured systems that include AI and machine learning (ML) capabilities.

Current methods for development of such systems remains primarily based on trial-and-error designs, with limited abstractions, architectures, and patterns. These developments can be costly, risky, and demanding of very high levels of expertise. To address this, EAISI developed hybrid, neuro symbolic architectures that facilitate the analysis and synthesis of complex systems that must rely on AI-based components. Title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Description: The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program developed a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future. AI is a critical enabler for U.S. military systems that will perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust. Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are at the wrong level of abstraction, not meaningful to a human user, or inconsistent with the full range of behaviors of the AI system. XAI developed the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, specifically with: (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models that are meaningful to end-users, using natural language, saliency maps, and other representations. XAI implementations were developed and demonstrated in next-generation data analytics and autonomous systems.5.000 Analytics (AI) - Congressional Add FY 2022 Accomplishments: - Developed techniques to extract knowledge from structured data as part of an end-to-end automated knowledge extraction and modeling process. - Developed techniques for tracking the provenance of evidentiary artifacts to support model-based engineering and continuous assurance of high-confidence software systems. - Developed evidence curation tools to enable secure software systems engineering and evidence-based assurance judgments. - Augmented AI-based design tools to enhance applicability to unmanned underwater vehicles and air mobility vehicles.10.000 - Volume 1 - 84 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 33 of 33 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 - Enhanced user interfaces to facilitate event schema curation and provide feedback for event schema recognition systems.

Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities to include the entire sea column such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, methods and techniques for servicing assets throughout the sea column, and high bandwidth communications. This project will also examine methods and architectures for distributing maritime operations to enable a more agile, survivable, and cost-effective fleet. The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations, including competing in undergoverned spaces. Programs in this project will break the relative symmetry of land combat to give U.S. forces a decided advantage in the current and future ground battlefield. The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality. This project will develop methods and technologies to expand the maneuver trade space to include the vertical dimension, including subterranean environments, as well as undergoverned spaces. It will leverage advances in artificial intelligence to enable integrated manned-unmanned operations and decrease warfighter exposure through the use of autonomous agents.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 Title: with Resiliency (RACER) Description: Multi-domain operations (MDO) present complex and challenging environments to ground combat platforms. Ground combat platforms must operate in a more distributed manner in these environments to gain a sustained tactical advantage and enhance warfighter survivability. The Army intends to deploy autonomous robotic combat vehicles and optionally manned fighting vehicles to accomplish this objective. In order to meet the demands of an MDO environment, significant advances in perception, planning, and control algorithms are required to autonomously maneuver faster and more resiliently in complex and novel off-road situations. Maneuver environments are characterized by three-dimensional surfaces of highly compliant soils and vegetation, hundreds of positive and negative obstacle classes, no defined road networks or driving rules, and where use of terrain for survivability is critical. In order to achieve operationally relevant speeds and resilience to novel situations on the battlefield, while simultaneously reducing the soldier's cognitive and communications burden and increasing battle space awareness, Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) will develop and demonstrate game-changing autonomous ground combat vehicle mobility using a combination of simulation and advanced platforms. RACER will deliver autonomy algorithms using the latest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine-learning techniques, a code repository, an off-road simulation environment tailored for military off-road autonomy development, tactical route planning methods, and field-demonstrated off-road autonomous capabilities. The culmination of the RACER program will demonstrate fully autonomous maneuver on a military Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in a variety of militarily relevant environments.

Title: Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) Description: The Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) program is developing and demonstrating new autonomous agents and techniques that support a Blue Force Commander in managing the complexity and ambiguity of urban spaces by rapidly identifying and discriminating among potential threats during missions ranging from minutes to hours. The program uses perception-enabled autonomous vehicles to manage complexity and interactions with populations to drive down the ambiguity between peaceful civilians and threats. The program will create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms operating in conjunction with U.S. ground forces that monitor an area overtly to detect hostile forces and establish Positive Identification (PID) before any U.S. troops come into contact. Military units follow strict rules of engagement (ROEs) that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior. This program will establish a Legal, Moral, Ethical (LME) working group comprising multiple individuals (technologists, military, university professors, ethicists, legal experts) to develop an understanding of how escalation and/or de-escalation of force can and should be appropriately applied in the context of supervised autonomous systems. URSA is exploring scenarios and probing behaviors to enable identifying innocent civilians and individuals who pose a threat to U.S. Forces, allies, or non-combat civilians. This mission requires the integration and maturation of novel sensors, and unmanned ground and air vehicles which leverage current techniques in perspective and reactive autonomy to navigate cluttered urban environments. URSA is developing new search and engagement behaviors to disambiguate human actions and serve as evidence that a potential target is a threat. It is implementing new dimensions of evidence such as the human reactions to these engagements to improve confidence in its decisions and building a novel framework for escalating and de-escalating nonlethal force. FY 2023 Plans: - Conduct the final system end-to-end performance evaluation in a live environment.

Accomplishments/Planned in Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 Description: A vast majority of U.S. technology is focused on gaining competitive advantage against near peer adversaries in kinetic engagements where there are known rules and players, concrete timelines and clear winners and losers. While these finite games are important, many critical engagements are closer to infinite contests--dynamic, diffuse high dimensionality interactions that play out over long periods with an ultimate goal of resetting the regional power and influence equilibrium. Competing in these contests is critical for successful stabilization and Humanitarian Assistance Disaster Relief (HADR) missions, as well as operations in undergoverned spaces. Some undergoverned spaces are geographic, where local governance is sufficiently weak such that internal or external parties can compete for influence over the local population. Some contested undergoverned spaces are more conceptual yet still very real, defined by virtual or physical domains that lack or regularly violate ethical, legal, social and institutional order such as supply chains, the cyber-domain, or the creation of new rulesets by unilateral unopposed action in space. The Competing in Undergoverned Spaces developed technologies that focused on successfully competing in infinite contests by developing tools for situational awareness and interpretation of signals, constant acting, assessing and adapting (i.e., iterative Hypothesis A/B testing) and new ways of viewing experimentation from a foundation of asynchronous observations and actions. Specific areas of interest included information, influence or economic tools that rapidly adapt to the environment to yield specific effects that can be sensed. This included developing new options to engage friendly/non-friendly local populations while minimizing the social impact of stabilization. Other areas of interest included sensing tools designed to update pre-existing models to support decision making, and decision tools designed to adapt to changing population or adversary actions. Title: Subterranean (SubT) Challenge Description: The DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge developed novel integrated solutions capable of mapping, navigating, and searching complex and dynamic terrains (tunnel systems, urban underground and cave networks); sensors and computation for perception in austere conditions; distributed information sharing in degraded communications environments; and collaborative autonomy enabling extended operations with minimal human intervention. The core objective of the SubT Challenge was to discover the solution(s) which best outperforms current approaches for manually and laboriously mapping and searching subterranean environments. Newly developed capabilities spanned across four technology focus areas in autonomy, perception, networking, and mobility technologies. The program increased the diversity, versatility, and robustness of relevant system technologies, capable of addressing the multi-faceted needs of a wide range of environments. Innovations were explored in the context of a public-facing, broadly inclusive DARPA Challenge.4.000 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 57.163 65.157 60.481 C.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2022 FY Description: The Influence Campaign Awareness and Sensemaking (INCAS) program is developing analyst-guided techniques, tools, and platforms for the DoD to detect and understand geopolitical influence campaigns in a rigorous, quantitative manner. Increasingly, competitors and adversaries are using influence operations to project soft power. Competitor and adversary influence campaigns can be overt in the form of anti-U.S. messaging, or they can be disguised in the form of complex narratives that seek to advance agendas harmful to U.S. interests. The U.S. Government and DoD need the capability to rapidly detect and understand competitor and adversary messaging campaigns and narratives within the context of the populations and groups for whom they are intended. To accomplish this, the program will develop and operationalize natural language processing, social network analysis, psychographics, and behavioral science-based technologies, and integrate these into a unified influence campaign modeling framework and sensemaking platform. INCAS aims to produce a suite of automated digital tools to enable analysts to better understand how information is being used by competitors and adversaries, and to quantitatively assess in real time and at scale the effects of influence campaigns across time and over multiple platforms. FY 2023 Plans: - Extend tools for extraction of additional influence indicators and of demographic and psychographic population attributes from social media and other messaging at scale, including multimedia messaging. - Develop tools that correlate influence indicators in messaging with population attributes to explain and anticipate responses and analytics for assessing the threat, similarity, and confidence of campaign models. - Demonstrate integration with falsified media tools that can provide additional indicators for adversary influence messaging and campaign elements.13.500 21.499 19.000 Volume 1 - 104 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 17 of 23 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) TT-13 / INFORMATION B.

FY 2024 Plans: - Extend multimedia analytics to discover influence indicators in video and other media and associate these indicators with targeted population attributes. - Develop analytics for assessing the threat and similarity of adversary influence campaigns based on multiple social media platforms. - Extend datasets, human-machine interfaces, and workflows to quantify the effectiveness of influence campaign response strategies. - Provide technology to potential transition sponsors to enable military users to assess utility against adversary influence campaigns. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 decrease reflects ramping down of development of techniques to detect and characterize influence campaigns and focus shifting to assessment of the techniques and transition. Title: Semantic Forensics (SemaFor) Description: The Semantic Forensics (SemaFor) program is developing technologies to defend against multimedia falsification and disinformation campaigns. Statistical detection techniques have been successful, but media generation and manipulation technologies applicable to imagery, voice, video, text, and other modalities are advancing rapidly. Purely statistical detection methods are now insufficient to detect these manipulations, especially when multiple modalities are involved. Existing media generation and manipulation algorithms are data driven and are prone to making semantic errors that provide defenders an opportunity for asymmetric advantage. SemaFor is developing semantic and statistical analysis algorithms that determine if media is generated or manipulated, attribution algorithms that infer if media originates from a particular organization or individual, and characterization algorithms that reason about whether media was falsified (generated or manipulated) for malicious purposes. SemaFor aims to create technologies to identify, deter, and understand adversary media falsification. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop software prototype to address adversarial threat scenarios and to facilitate a deeper understanding of falsified media. - Implement more advanced forms of machine learning and artificial intelligence in media falsification detection, attribution, and characterization techniques for emerging complex adversarial falsified media. - Extend datasets and evaluation efforts to include disinformation in technical documents, media collections, and diverse social media feeds, and conduct demonstration of algorithmic capabilities for use cases of interest to transition partners.21.921 22.015 18.000 Volume 1 - 105 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 18 of 23 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) TT-13 / INFORMATION B.

Title: Computational Cultural Understanding (CCU) Description: The Computational Cultural Understanding (CCU) program is creating cross-cultural language understanding technologies to improve a DoD operator's situational awareness and interactional effectiveness. CCU natural language processing technologies will recognize, adapt to, and recommend how to operate within emotional, social, and cultural norms that differ across societies, languages, and group affinities. To support diverse and emergent use cases, CCU technologies will be engineered to require minimal-to-no training data in a local culture, while maximizing operator success during negotiations and other interactions in the field. CCU will create new component technologies for sociocultural norm discovery, cross-cultural emotion recognition, and communicative change detection. The program will incorporate these component technologies into a prototype platform to assist military users with cross-cultural dialogue. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop a means to analyze interactions between sociocultural norms and emotional feedback, and extend development to a second language-culture pair. - Evaluate technologies for sociocultural analysis and cross-cultural dialogue assistance within negotiation scenarios of interest, such as discovery of local perspectives on an issue, gathering of logistical information, or requesting access to resources. - Develop a means to understand cultural concepts and integrate a concept acquisition framework in automated systems. - Develop an integration testbed for evaluation of cross-cultural language understanding and situational awareness technologies. FY 2024 Plans: - Generalize sociocultural analysis and dialogue assistance techniques to encompass multiple language-culture pairs. - Utilize the integration testbed to evaluate and optimize cross-cultural language understanding and situational awareness technologies.12.000 19.200 16.600 Volume 1 - 106 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 19 of 23 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) TT-13 / INFORMATION B.

FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 decrease reflects ramping down of development and implementation of technologies for cross-cultural language understanding and situational awareness and a shift in emphasis to demonstration and evaluation with military stakeholders. Title: Resilient Supply-and-Demand Networks (RSDN) Description: The Resilient Supply-and-Demand Networks (RSDN) program is developing supply-chain risk management analytics to detect systemic vulnerabilities and improve resilience in supply and demand networks. At present, the separation of supply-chain information into confidential silos obscures a system-wide view, inhibiting comprehensive risk-focused analysis of supply and demand networks. RSDN is developing techniques for modeling both the broad level of the supply-chain network and the detailed level of individual procurement agreements. Network analytics and visualizations will reveal emerging fragilities and enable deep situational awareness of systemic vulnerabilities and potential disruptions. Blind spots due to hidden interdependencies can lead to fragility in supply chains. An RSDN stress-testing framework will enable repeatable scenario analysis of strategic vulnerabilities in supply and demand networks, automated analysis and discovery of patterns of risk, and evaluation of alternative risk mitigation strategies. FY 2023 Plans: - Develop semantically rich representations (such as graphs) of contractual relationships as the basis for visualizing supply and demand networks. - Develop an initial library of vulnerability analytics and visualizations to reveal and understand strategic risks in supply and demand networks. - Instantiate initial datasets for representative use cases and begin development of a stress-testing framework to illuminate the propagation of realistic shock scenarios through a supply and demand network. FY 2024 Plans: - Augment the initial datasets with supplemental information about the participants and their relationships to provide a granular view of each supply and demand network. - Expand the initial library of vulnerability analytics and visualizations with new methods and algorithms to illuminate supply and demand network blind spots and identify data gaps. - Demonstrate a stress-testing capability to assess the propagation of shock scenarios through a supply and demand network and to motivate suitable mitigation strategies.- 9.786 15.000 Volume 1 - 107 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 20 of 23 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) TT-13 / INFORMATION B.

Title: Beyond Linear Signal Processing (BLiP) Description: The Beyond Linear Signal Processing (BLiP) program will perform a fundamental redevelopment of the radar signal processing chain with the intent that smaller radar apertures will operate with the performance of much larger, more expensive radar systems. Building upon earlier technology efforts, including the Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program (previously budgeted in PE 0602716E/Project ELT-01), which focused on hardware-based limitations such as bandwidth and dynamic range, BLiP will focus on the software and signal processing to fundamentally enhance all radars. Multiple recent developments show that non-linear and iterative estimation algorithms can out-perform our current linear radar signal processing algorithms. BLiP will develop and mature the algorithms for specific radar mission areas through rapid development, integration, real-time processing, and field testing. FY 2023 Plans: - Determine radar modes for baseline operation and processing chain. - Produce initial collection from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) radar for distribution to performers.

Accomplishments/Planned in Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 steal U.S. intellectual property in order to achieve commercial and economic advantage. CIE will advance U.S. IO capabilities by a combined information technology and social science approach that spans data analysis, natural language understanding, multimedia analysis, information integrity assurance, and social modeling and simulation. CIE will seek to advance capabilities for estimating the integrity and veracity of disseminated scientific and technical information, anticipating the spread of information across geo-social boundaries, and reducing the harmful influence of misinformation and disinformation on global populations. The technologies to be developed in CIE are essential for the U.S. to compete successfully against adversaries who are making increasing use of IO. FY 2024 Plans: - Explore statistical, information-theoretic, semantic, and other approaches for quantifying and estimating the integrity and veracity of disseminated scientific and technical information. - Devise modeling and simulation-based approaches for anticipating the spread of information across geo-social boundaries. - Formulate social science-based approaches for reducing the harmful influence of misinformation and disinformation on global populations and for measuring the effectiveness of alternative approaches. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: Kill-Webs (ACK) Description: The Adapting Cross-domain Kill-Webs (ACK) program is assisting military decision makers with rapidly identifying and selecting options for tasking and re-tasking assets within and across organizational boundaries. Based on technologies developed in the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contest Environment (RSPACE) program (previously budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), ACK will assist users with selecting sensors, effectors, and support elements across military domains (space, air, land, surface, subsurface, and cyber) to form and adapt kill chains to deliver desired effects on targets. Today's Command and Control (C2) organizations and processes cannot support multi-domain warfighting concepts, especially during joint operations. ACK will address this challenge by utilizing a decentralized approach to allocating resources to tasks and assigning mission orders to assets, motivated by ideas developed in online commerce, sourcing, and supply chain management, such as bid requests and offers.

Accomplishments/Planned in Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY Discovery of Models (D3M) Description: The Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program is developing automated model discovery techniques and tools that enable non-expert users to create empirical models of real, complex processes and phenomena. The ability to understand the battlespace is driven increasingly by expert analysis of sensor and open-source data. The DoD and IC communities are fundamentally limited by a shortage of domain-focused subject matter expert data scientists to construct empirical models that predict behaviors and anticipate contingencies during tactical and strategic planning. D3M is addressing this need by creating technologies that automate the construction of complex empirical models. D3M technologies include a library of data modeling primitives that are automatically selectable, automated approaches for composition of complex models from modeling primitives, and intuitive mechanisms for human-model interaction that enable curation of models by non-experts. D3M is focused on the types of empirical modeling problems commonly encountered by the DoD and IC. FY 2023 Plans: - Harden and transition software tools to DoD partners. FY 2023 to FY 2024 - Title: Causal Exploration of Complex Operational Environments Description: The Causal Exploration of Complex Operational Environments program developed advanced modeling, analysis, simulation, and visualization tools to enable command staffs to rapidly and effectively design, plan, and manage missions in complex operational environments. The U.S. military increasingly operates in remote and unstable parts of the world where mission success depends heavily on cooperation with a wide variety of stakeholder groups on civil, economic, and military matters. These groups typically include host nation government organizations, local civilian groups, and non-governmental organizations, each of which has priorities, sensitivities, and concerns that may differ significantly. Current mission design and planning technologies do not adequately model the range of options or the inherent uncertainties. This program developed tools to create causal, computational models that represent the most significant relationships, dynamics, interactions, and uncertainties of the operational environment including political, military, economic, and social factors. These tools will enable command staffs to design and quantitatively assess potential courses of action in complex operational environments.4.364 - - Title: Warfighter Analytics using Smartphones for Health (WASH) 4.000 - - Volume 1 - 110 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 23 of 23 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) TT-13 / INFORMATION B.

Title: Atmospheric Water Extraction (AWE) Description: The Atmospheric Water Extraction (AWE) program aims to enable water harvesting directly from the atmosphere by leveraging new materials and advanced engineering and manufacturing techniques to alleviate logistical and tactical burdens. Currently, the DoD relies on purification of existing water sources and/or distribution of bottled or treated water to provide the warfighter with sufficient daily hydration. State-of-the-art water-from-air generation systems are not suitable for military applications because the systems do not operate in a range of atmospheric conditions needed by our soldiers, from arid conditions (<40% relative humidity) to extremely humid, and are too energy-intensive (<7 gallons of water output per gallon of fuel). This program will deliver systems with extraordinarily low size, weight, and power (SWaP) characteristics to provide potable water to individual warfighters and expeditionary units and will provide insights into how new materials can help the warfighter overcome existing material challenges. Technologies developed under this program will provide strategic and tactical advantages aligned with the DoD's vision of future combat operations carried out by distributed and self-sustaining forces.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the Electronics Technology Program that is directed towards developing electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible. The PE focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter. This PE also supports innovation and robust transition planning in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs to increase the likelihood that DARPA funded technologies take root in the U.S. and provide new capabilities for national defense. Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority. The Electronic Technology project supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures. Areas of particular emphasis of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors. Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards. This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, Microelectromechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research. The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. This project pursues electronics performance advancements that exploit new concepts in circuit specialization and three- dimensional heterogeneous integration (3DHI) by the optimization of materials, devices, architectures, and designs to achieve specific circuit function at high performance. Because electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our microelectronics infrastructure relies, this envisioned specialization will require incorporation of security safeguards and advancing manufacturing tools and process automation. Accordingly, programs within the Beyond Scaling project will reduce barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and 3DHI by improving producibility. This will significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized microelectronics, particularly for operation in extreme environments. Programs also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting 3DHI to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials and new techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.

The ability to create tunable and reconfigurable band pass and band stop filters in the range of 2 gigahertz (GHz) to 18 GHz will be important for implementing transmit/receive modules in next-generation multi-function arrays. Another important area of interference mitigation is self-interference. WARP is developing the signal cancellation technology that will listen to the transmitted interfering signal and subtract it from the input of the receiver so faint signals near the noise floor can still be detected. Program research will provide feedback mechanisms that intelligently correct these problems. Whether for self- induced interference or external interference jamming, WARP is developing intelligent filtering and self-interference cancellation technologies to protect wideband DoD receivers. FY 2023 Plans: - Demonstrate wideband adaptive filters that implement embedded interference sensing and closed-loop adaptive tuning. - Demonstrate analog signal cancellers that implement embedded leakage channel sensing and closed-loop adaptive tuning. - Prepare demonstration of the RF protection technology that is well-aligned to transition partners within the government.

Title: Quantum Imaging of Vector Electromagnetic Radiation (QuIVER) Description: The Quantum Imaging of Vector Electromagnetic Radiation (QuIVER) program is developing full-tensor magnetic field sensors and will demonstrate them in DoD-relevant applications and concept of operations. In addition to being diagnostically relevant, such sensitive magnetometers could enable future human-machine/brain-machine interfaces. The DoD and industry also use magnetometers for magnetic anomaly detection, which may allow for the discovery of mineral/oil deposits, discovery of old wellheads, or the detection of improvised explosive devices. In addition, magnetometers offer the possibility of magnetic navigation, which may operate in GPS-denied environments. Recent advancements have resulted in the potential to develop highly-sensitive vector magnetometers, which would enable the consequent development of sensitive full-tensor gradient sensors. Such tensors offer more degrees of freedom than their scalar or vector counterparts and potentially provide additional information about the source of the magnetic field. FY 2023 Plans: - Validate sensitivity and functionality of tensor magnetometer.17.000 16.000 9.000 Volume 1 - 138 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 32 R-1 Line #22Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / ELT-01 Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 - Complete construction of tensor magnetometer system for field testing. - Perform field test of tensor magnetometer system.

Title: Fast Event-based Neuromorphic Camera and Electronics (FENCE) Description: The Fast Event-based Neuromorphic Camera and Electronics (FENCE) program will develop and demonstrate a low latency, low power event-based infrared (IR) camera to enable intelligent sensors for tactical DoD applications. Event-based imagers are an emerging class of sensors with major demonstrated advantages relative to traditional cameras. State-of-the-art visible event-based cameras have been shown to produce over two orders of magnitude less data in optimal conditions relative to traditional framing cameras because they transmit data only from pixels that have changed. This leads directly to two orders of magnitude lower data latency and a commensurate reduction in power consumption. Despite their inherent advantages, existing event-based cameras are not compatible with DoD applications because DoD applications regularly face conditions that are not optimal, where issues such as clutter and noise cause a large percentage of the event-based pixels to change simultaneously. When this happens, today's event-based cameras do not perform significantly better than traditional cameras. FENCE will develop an infrared event-based imager consistent with military requirements. FENCE will develop a four-megapixel asynchronous read-out integrated circuit (ROIC), co-designed with a 3D integrated processor that will intelligently remove noise and clutter to maintain low power and latency operation even when faced with all of the pixels firing simultaneously. If successful, this new class of sensors enabled by FENCE will be capable of responding to fast moving targets and discriminating dim targets in noisy conditions. FY 2023 Plans: - Measure ROIC power and timing fidelity. - Conduct critical design review of processor layer. - Fabricate processor layer in advanced node silicon. - Measure processing layer power consumption. FY 2024 Plans: - Integrate components into full focal plane array (FPA). - Measure integrated processor layer power consumption.22.000 19.410 16.997 Volume 1 - 139 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 32 R-1 Line #22Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2024 Defense Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / ELT-01 Millions) FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 - 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2024 decrease reflects moving from design and fabrication to integration and testing. Title: Waveform Agile Radio-frequency Directed Energy (WARDEN) Description: The Waveform Agile Radio-frequency Directed Energy (WARDEN) program aims to extend the range and lethality of high-power microwave (HPM) systems by introducing flexible waveform techniques that use combinations of frequency, amplitude, and pulse-width modulations to significantly improve electromagnetic coupling into complex target enclosures and increase the probability of disruption or damage to internal electronic components and circuits. Applications for HPM systems include counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), vehicle and vessel disruption, electronic strike, and guided missile defense. Current HPM systems use oscillators to produce electromagnetic radiation. These systems are inherently narrowband and lack the frequency agility to support waveforms to maximize electromagnetic coupling and to optimally exploit electronic system vulnerabilities. Lacking the capability to use optimized waveforms, HPM oscillators have been pushed close to the physical limits of peak power generation.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ The Wideband Secured and Protected Emitter and Receiver (WiSPER) program aims to develop an ultra- broadband technology platform to demonstrate a robust, secure, and protected communication link. WiSPER technology provides high signal coding gain to deliver a secured and protected link with significantly enhanced capacity for next generation DoD communications. Current terrestrial tactical radios operate with limited bandwidth at prescribed low frequency bands, which are unable to support high capacity with multiple users and are vulnerable to interference and jamming. WiSPER technology addresses military needs for assured communications, throughput, security, and size, weight, and power limitations of future command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.

Title: Modular Efficient Laser Technology (MELT) Description: The Modular Efficient Laser Technology (MELT) program will demonstrate the first compact, high-power laser tile as the key building block to enable the next generation of scalable high energy laser (HEL) sources for laser weapon systems (LWS). Today's LWS use fiber laser array HEL sources, complex optical benches, and beam directors. These systems are large and heavy, contain large numbers of individual components, and require skilled labor to fabricate and integrate. This makes current LWS difficult and costly to manufacture, limiting their deployment and application. MELT will leverage recent advances in coherent beam combining and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) fabrication techniques to develop tiled arrays integrated with semiconductor-based optical systems, low-loss waveguides, optical interconnects, and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) into a compact laser tile that can be integrated with a supporting backplane to provide scalable HEL sources. This will provide the LWS developer a scalable HEL architecture that maintains excellent beam quality and allows LWS deployment on size, weight, and power (SWaP)-constrained platforms. MELT will leverage a mature industrial base for semiconductor manufacturing, as well as recent advances in photonic integrated circuits, coherent beam combining algorithms, semiconductor cooling techniques, and optical lithography to achieve its program goals. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to Army, Air Force, and Navy.

Title: Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) Description: The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program aimed to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process, and relay image information. This was accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC. Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager can selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution, at a higher frame rate, or with 3-D depth information. The system can interface with virtually any sensor and therefore can be used in any spectral band. By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible.

Current computing architectures are subject to scaling, bandwidth, and memory limitations, and the large size of today's chips limits the movement of data resulting in a fundamental trade-off between circuit size and data throughput. The PLAID program will break this paradigm with new architecture development and will achieve more than a 10X increase in on-chip bandwidth. In addition to the development of this new device, the PLAID program will expedite deployment into DoD systems by engaging the defense industrial base to map DoD-relevant radio frequency (RF) processing problems onto the new architecture. These RF problems may include element-level digital beamforming, multi-target tracking radar applications, and synthetic aperture radar processing. Once applications are mapped onto the new processor, the implementation will be programmed and tested with the intent that the use of the new device developed by commercial industry will directly transition into an asymmetric advantage for the DoD and will be used by the defense industrial base in emerging applications.

Title: Technologies for Mixed-mode Ultra Scaled Integrated Circuits (T-MUSIC) Description: The Technologies for Mixed-mode Ultra Scaled Integrated Circuits (T-MUSIC) program is developing an on- shore semiconductor foundry platform for very wide band radio frequency (RF) mixed-mode integrated circuit analog-to-digital converters for commercial and military systems. Mixed-mode circuits take analog and RF signals and transform them to digital data for processing in computing systems. As defense and commercial wireless applications move to higher frequencies in order to carry more data traffic, integrating the broadband mixed-mode circuitry with high-speed digital processing logic onto one chip becomes imperative to avoid data transfer bottlenecks. T-MUSIC seeks to integrate high-speed, high-performance analog and digital electronics together in highly-scaled silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundries on-shore. Such processes will enable the high levels of integration and performance needed for DoD-relevant and commercial 5G/6G applications. A goal of the T-MUSIC program is to enable very wide bandwidth wireless operations beyond 100 gigahertz (GHz) with low noise and high dynamic range. In addition, T-MUSIC aims to develop next-generation terahertz (THz) mixed- mode devices based on the advanced digital CMOS fabrication platform. The T-MUSIC program will establish advanced on- shore foundry capabilities to establish a long-term domestic world-class RF mixed-mode system-on-chip technology for intended transition to DoD and commercial applications.

Title: Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) Description: The Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) program aims to develop optical signaling technologies for digital microelectronics. Distributed and parallel computing architectures are now pervasive across all size scales, from personal-scale multicore processing units to enterprise-scale high performance computing systems, and span application domains from consumer electronics to DoD systems. Increasingly, however, the benefits of parallelism are constrained not by the limits of computation at individual nodes but by the movement of data between nodes. PIPES will advance microelectronics capabilities by intimately integrating photonics with advanced integrated electronics to yield system connectivity with an unprecedented combination of high aggregate bandwidth, power efficiency, channel density, and link reach. Specifically, PIPES will develop photonic input/output (I/O) capability for application-specific integrated circuits and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are widely used in advanced DoD sensors and radio frequency systems. The goal of the program is improving I/ O bandwidth density, efficiency, and reach by more than 100X to enable disruptive DoD system parallelism and performance scaling. As PIPES technologies mature, they are anticipated to proliferate into central processing units, graphical processing units, and emerging tensor-flow processing units that will impact a wide range of dual-use applications including artificial intelligence, machine learning, large scale emulation, and high-performance computing. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to larger scale commercial performers and the Services.

While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users. Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas: - High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability. - Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, scalability, and composable systems to enable adaptive effects webs. - Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in very high-threat environments. - Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats. The Cyber Systems project develops, implements, and demonstrates techniques, tools, and frameworks for the full range of cyber operations. Cyber is now ubiquitous to warfighting. For non-kinetic operations in advance of lethal conflict, cyber can be a powerful enabler of information operations that limit adversary options and deter adversary actions. For kinetic operations during lethal conflict, cyber can be a force multiplier and provide an asymmetric advantage. The Cyber Systems project aims to create operational prototypes based on the cyber technology developed in applied research programs (budgeted in PE 0602303E, Project IT-03), in the private sector, and in academia. The utility of the operational prototypes that are developed in this project will be assessed, and improvements made, based on demonstrations and evaluations conducted in collaboration with warfighters, acquisition programs, and combatant commands.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2022 The Space-Based Adaptive Communications Node (Space-BACN) program seeks to create a reconfigurable intersatellite optical communications terminal that has low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) and easily integrates onto small satellites, as well as a methodology for cross-constellation command and control (C2). Based on technologies developed in the Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) program (budgeted in this PE/Project), Space-BACN will enable on-orbit communications and data relay between heterogeneous satellite constellations that operate on different optical intersatellite link (OISL) specifications. Today's government and commercial OISL-equipped satellites are unable to communicate with each other due to reliance on single-waveform terminals and a lack of standardization for waveform specifications. Space- BACN will overcome this challenge by developing a modular, reconfigurable optical terminal that is standard-agnostic and able to support most current and future OISL protocols. Space-BACN will also develop a C2 system that controls access and configures connectivity between constellations based on availability and mission requirements. Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services and the Space Development Agency (SDA).

ASTARTE will be compatible with legacy command and control (C2) airspace management tools to take advantage of prior investments in technologies, such as human-machine interfaces, and to minimize costs and the impact on training. Technologies from this program will transition to the Army and the Air Force. FY 2023 Plans: - Implement understanding and decision algorithms in software to run in Army Command Post Computing Environment. - Integrate ASTARTE sensor architecture with existing DoD sensor systems. - Evaluate ASTARTE sensor network performance in live fire exercises to verify predicted performance. - Conduct virtual and live experimentation to assess operational use of ASTARTE technology in joint exercises. - Refine ASTARTE understanding and decision software based on virtual and live experimentation.

Title: Space domain Wide Area Tracking & Characterization (Space-WATCH) Description: The Space domain Wide Area Tracking & Characterization (Space-WATCH) program will enable real-time persistent tracking of objects in low earth orbit (LEO) and provide actionable intelligence on tactical timescales. Based on technologies developed in the Geospatial Cloud Analytics (GCA) program (previously budgeted in this PE/Project), Space-WATCH will enable detection and tracking of objects orbiting the Earth on much faster timescales than current ground-based sensors are capable of by combining proliferated, on-orbit sensors with automated data fusion. By working with commercial companies operating in LEO to host low-cost sensors on their space platforms, Space-WATCH will employ thousands of sensors on orbit to continuously gather data. Space-WATCH will utilize automated algorithms to process and fuse all the collected data for anomaly detection and false alarm reduction, making the data useful and actionable to ground-based operators. This comprehensive data set of objects in LEO and real-time information on anomalies will greatly increase the accuracy of the Department of Defense s space situational awareness, as well as enable appropriate responses to anomalies, such as maneuvering space assets out of the way of orbital debris.

FY 2023 Plans: - Demonstrate a scalable and deployable capability in a range of operational settings with transition partners. - Demonstrate ability to provide enhanced awareness using operational logistics and supply chain data to inform decision making across the logistics enterprise. - Demonstrate the ability to improve resilience within the logistics enterprise. FY 2023 to FY 2024 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY Protected Forward Communications (PFC) Description: The collaborative application of combat power in ground tactical operations demands reliable exchange of rich information and precise coordination of actions across various echelons. These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command. The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries. This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links. The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication architecture to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation. PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC). The PFC program will transition to the Services.

Title: Network Universal Persistence (Network UP) Description: Current radios send network control information and data using the same wireless link. This produces a common failure mode when that wireless link degrades. In many of today's military wireless networks, even brief wireless link outages create a loss of network connectivity that can take minutes to recover once the wireless link is re-established. During these network outages, data transmission is not possible. The Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments. Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost. The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links. The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless links and design and implement mechanisms to maintain synchronization across those separate links. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the U.S. Army's Integrated Network Technology Program of Record. FY 2023 Plans: - Transition Network UP technology to the U.S. Army's Integrated Network Technology Program of Record. FY 2023 to FY 2024 118.290 155.803 160.191 C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Network-Centric Warfare Technology Program that addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts. It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this PE is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations. The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network-centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network-centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network-centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2022 Description: Assault Breaker II (ABII) seeks to change the current warfighting paradigm of reliance on a Service-specific and platform centric force that executes prescribed kill chains to a highly adaptable and capability-based force. This new paradigm operates as a disaggregated kill web able to execute rapidly composable, joint, and all domain kill chains. Building upon technologies developed in the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program, budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-02, ABII will exploit both existing and emerging technologies across the Services to address known capability gaps, opportunities, and threats.

The AMASS C2 software and architecture will coordinate the operations of a heterogenous mix of autonomous air, ground, and surface assets, developed by different Services and vendors, running different swarm behavior software, with different payloads, in order to deliver distributed sensing, kinetic and non-kinetic effects, information operations, and other hybrid effects. AMASS planning and execution software will enable disparate autonomous platforms to collaborate and negotiate with each other to complete complex counter-A2/AD missions and to dynamically adapt to changes in the environment such as attrition, targeting errors, and unanticipated adversary actions, as well as changes in missions or target sets. AMASS provides an unprecedented capability, allowing autonomous platforms developed for specific purposes to contribute to various missions without the need for redesign. AMASS will be conducted in partnership with the Services to leverage their swarm technology investments. The planned transition partners for the capability are Service Programs of Record.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network-centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network-centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network-centric forces. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2022 Title: No (NOMARS) Description: No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) is developing small, low-cost, disaggregated naval platforms to demonstrate the ability to perform persistent power projection and force application combat missions currently conducted from large, high- value capital ships. The NOMARS program will design a ship that can operate autonomously for long durations at sea, enabling a ship design process that eliminates considerations associated with crew. NOMARS focuses on exploring novel approaches to the design of the sea frame (the ship without mission systems) while accommodating representative payload size, weight, and power. The goal of the program is to demonstrate the feasibility of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) that operate autonomously for months to years without human intervention, in large numbers, with only periodic, depot-based maintenance. This capability will enable disaggregated persistent USVs, allowing the surface fleet to credibly threaten peer adversaries and negate their investments in high-cost weapon systems designed to counter large naval targets such as aircraft carriers. A successful NOMARS program will prove feasibility of a small unmanned ship with significantly improved reliability and functional performance over current USVs providing a pathway to allow a distributed lethality concept to become viable: small ships, in large numbers, each of which is individually low-cost and low-value, but in aggregate presents a significant deterrent. The anticipated transition partner is the Navy.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Sensor Technology Program focused on sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment. The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment. Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner. This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2022 Title: Description: The Moving Target Recognition (MTR) program seeks to enable the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors to detect, track, image, and automatically recognize moving ground targets within an area of interest. SAR sensors provide the capability to detect and identify high-value targets in all weather conditions but only when the targets are stationary due to limitations in traditional SAR processing. Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radars are capable of detecting and tracking moving targets, but they cannot form recognizable images of targets. MTR will overcome the limitations of traditional SAR and improve the operational utility of widely deployed SAR sensors on many different types of platforms. The recognition capability will enable new concepts of operation for maintaining persistent custody of high-value targets on the move. Unlike GMTI, which loses custody if the track is broken due to terrain or other factors, MTR-enabled SAR sensors will be able to tolerate coverage gaps by reacquiring and reestablishing identification of the moving targets. Technology developed under MTR will transition to the Services. FY 2023 Plans: - Continue to develop and refine novel algorithms for moving target detection, tracking, and imaging with SAR sensors. - Conduct independent assessment of algorithm performance using airborne SAR data with ground truth. - Optimize software implementations of MTR algorithms for speed, efficiency, and robustness. - Initiate development of ATR algorithms for the moving target images.

Title: Archie Description: The Archie program seeks to develop techniques to characterize the electromagnetic spectrum to enhance radio frequency (RF) situational awareness, maneuverability, and countermeasures in Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environments. Based on technologies developed in the Resilient Networked Distributed Mosaic Communications (RNDMC) program (budgeted in PE 0603760E, Project CCC-02), Archie will leverage distributed communication advancements to enhance distributed electromagnetic warfare (EW) capabilities making them more robust and effective. Current radar and EW systems face the challenge of operating in a more congested and contested RF environment. At present, traditional EW systems do not have the capability to characterize this environment leading to performance degradation. Archie will overcome this by characterizing the electromagnetic spectrum and determining the optimal means by which to deploy radar and EW capabilities. Archie will provide novel and new ways for massive characterization, measuring RF signals of opportunity to aid in the placement and transmission of radar and EW signals.
