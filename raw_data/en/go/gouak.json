Vaccines cannot protect you from many diseases in Italy, so your behaviors are important. Food and water standards around the world vary based on the destination. Standards may also differ within a country and risk may change depending on activity type (e.g., hiking versus business trip). You can learn more about safe food and drink choices when traveling by accessing the resources below. [Choose Safe Food and Drinks When Traveling](/travel/page/food-water-safety) [Water Treatment Options When Hiking, Camping or Traveling](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/index.html) [Global Water, Sanitation and Hygiene | Healthy Water](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/traveler_health.html) [Avoid Contaminated Water During Travel](/travel/page/water-disinfection) You can also visit the [Department of State Country Information Pages](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html) for additional information about food and water safety. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Although Italy is an industrialized country, bug bites here can still spread diseases. Just as you would in the United States, try to avoid bug bites while spending time outside or in wooded areas. What can I do to prevent bug bites? - Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and hats. - Use an appropriate insect repellent (see below). - Consider using permethrin-treated clothing and gear if spending a lot of time outside. Do not use permethrin directly on skin. What type of insect repellent should I use? - FOR PROTECTION AGAINST TICKS AND MOSQUITOES: Use a repellent that contains 20% or more DEET for protection that lasts up to several hours. - FOR PROTECTION AGAINST MOSQUITOES ONLY: Products with one of the following active ingredients can also help prevent mosquito bites. Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. [DEET](http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/chemicals/deet.htm) - Picaridin (also known as KBR 3023, Bayrepel, and icaridin) - Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or para-menthane-diol (PMD) - IR3535 - 2-undecanone - - Always use insect repellent as directed. What should I do if I am bitten by bugs? - Avoid scratching bug bites, and apply hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion to reduce the itching. - Check your entire body for ticks after outdoor activity. Be sure to [remove ticks](http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html)properly. What can I do to avoid bed bugs? Although bed bugs do not carry disease, they are an annoyance. See our [information page about avoiding bug bites](/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites) for some easy tips to avoid them. For more information on bed bugs, see [Bed Bugs](http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/bedbugs/). For more detailed information on avoiding bug bites, see [Avoid Bug Bites](/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites). [Hide](javascript:void(0);) If your travel plans in Italy include outdoor activities, take these steps to stay safe and healthy during your trip: - Stay alert to changing weather conditions and adjust your plans if conditions become unsafe. - Prepare for activities by wearing the right clothes and packing protective items, such as bug spray, sunscreen, and a basic first aid kit. - Consider learning basic first aid and CPR before travel. Bring a [travel health kit](/travel/page/pack-smart.htm)with items appropriate for your activities. - Heat-related illness, such as heat stroke, can be deadly. Eat and drink regularly, wear loose and lightweight clothing, and limit physical activity in the heat of the day. - If you are outside for many hours in the heat, eat salty snacks and drink water to stay hydrated and replace salt lost through sweating. [Protect yourself from UV radiation](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic_info/prevention.htm): use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, wear protective clothing, and seek shade during the hottest time of day (10 a.m.-4 p.m.). - Be especially careful during summer months and at high elevation. Because sunlight reflects off snow, sand, and water, sun exposure may be increased during activities like skiing, swimming, and sailing. - Very cold temperatures can be dangerous. Dress in layers and cover heads, hands, and feet properly if you are visiting a cold location. Stay safe around water - Swim only in designated swimming areas. Obey lifeguards and warning flags on beaches. - Do not dive into shallow water. - Avoid swallowing water when swimming. Untreated water can carry germs that make you sick. - Practice safe boating\u2014follow all boating safety laws, do not drink alcohol if you are driving a boat, and always wear a life jacket. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Most animals avoid people, but they may attack if they feel threatened, are protecting their young or territory, or if they are injured or ill. Animal bites and scratches can lead to serious diseases such as rabies. Follow these tips to protect yourself: - Do not touch or feed any animals you do not know. - Do not allow animals to lick open wounds, and do not get animal saliva in your eyes or mouth. - Avoid rodents and their urine and feces. - Traveling pets should be supervised closely and not allowed to come in contact with local animals. - If you wake in a room with a bat, seek medical care immediately. Bat bites may be hard to see. All animals can pose a threat, but be extra careful around dogs, bats, monkeys, sea animals such as jellyfish, and snakes. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, immediately: - Wash the wound with soap and clean water. - Go to a doctor right away. - Tell your doctor about your injury when you get back to the United States. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Follow these tips to avoid getting sick or spreading illness to others while traveling: - Wash your hands often, especially before eating. - If soap and water aren't available, clean hands with hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol). - Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean. - Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. - Try to avoid contact with people who are sick. - If you are sick, stay home or in your hotel room, unless you need medical care. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Diseases can be spread through body fluids, such as saliva, blood, vomit, and semen. Protect yourself: - Use latex condoms correctly. - Do not inject drugs. - Limit alcohol consumption. People take more risks when intoxicated. - Do not share needles or any devices that can break the skin. That includes needles for tattoos, piercings, and acupuncture. - If you receive medical or dental care, make sure the equipment is disinfected or sanitized. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Plan for how you will get health care during your trip, should the need arise: - Carry a list of [local doctors and hospitals](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health.html)at your destination. - Review your health insurance plan to determine what medical services it would cover during your trip. Consider purchasing travel health and medical evacuation insurance for things your regular insurance will not cover. - Carry a card that identifies, in the local language, your blood type, chronic conditions or serious allergies, and the generic names of any medicines you take. - Bring copies of your prescriptions for medicine and for eye glasses and contact lenses. - Some prescription drugs may be illegal in other countries. Call [Italy's embassy](https://www.usembassy.gov/)to verify that all of your prescription(s) are legal to bring with you. - Bring all the medicines (including over-the-counter medicines) you think you might need during your trip, including extra in case of travel delays. Ask your doctor to help you get prescriptions filled early if you need to. Many foreign hospitals and clinics are accredited by the Joint Commission International. A list of accredited facilities is available at their website ( [www.jointcommissioninternational.org](http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org)). [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Motor vehicle crashes are the #1 killer of healthy US citizens in foreign countries. Walking Be smart when you are traveling on foot. - Use sidewalks and marked crosswalks. - Pay attention to the traffic around you, especially in crowded areas. - Remember, people on foot do not always have the right of way in other countries. Riding/Driving Choose a safe vehicle. - Choose official taxis or public transportation, such as trains and buses. - Make sure there are seatbelts. - Avoid overcrowded, overloaded, top-heavy buses and minivans. - Avoid riding on motorcycles or motorbikes, especially motorbike taxis. (Many crashes are caused by inexperienced motorbike drivers.) - Choose newer vehicles\u2014they may have more safety features, such as airbags, and be more reliable. - Choose larger vehicles, which may provide more protection in crashes. Think about the driver. - Do not drive after drinking alcohol or ride with someone who has been drinking. - Consider hiring a licensed, trained driver familiar with the area. - Arrange payment before departing. Follow basic safety tips. - Wear a seatbelt at all times. - Sit in the back seat of cars and taxis. - When on motorbikes or bicycles, always wear a helmet. (Bring a helmet from home, if needed.) - Do not use a cell phone or text while driving (illegal in many countries). - Travel during daylight hours only, especially in rural areas. - If you choose to drive a vehicle in Italy, learn the local traffic laws and have the proper paperwork. - Get any driving permits and insurance you may need. Get an International Driving Permit (IDP). Carry the IDP and a US-issued driver's license at all times. - Check with your auto insurance policy's international coverage, and get more coverage if needed. Make sure you have liability insurance. Flying - Avoid using local, unscheduled aircraft. - If possible, fly on larger planes (more than 30 seats); larger airplanes are more likely to have regular safety inspections. - Try to schedule flights during daylight hours and in good weather.
