As your children return to school and other in-person activities, it is important to prioritize getting their vaccinations back on track to protect them from vaccine-preventable diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published catch-up immunization schedules that will make sure your child can be vaccinated safely and in a timely manner. On-time vaccinations are essential to protect your child from potentially life-threatening diseases to safeguard a healthy future. The benefits of regular well-child visits and timely vaccinations include: Tracking growth and developmental milestones. Discussing any concerns about your child's health. Getting scheduled vaccinations to prevent illnesses like measles, whooping cough (pertussis), and other serious diseases. Vaccinating your child protects them from many diseases. It also helps protect other children who are unable to be vaccinated because of certain health conditions by preventing outbreaks of disease in your community. SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE02Vaccine-Preventable Diseases We are fortunate to live in a time when vaccines protect our communities from a wide array of potentially life-threatening diseases. These diseases can be easily forgotten because vaccines have protected us from them for so long. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the important role vaccines play in protecting us from serious, and sometimes life-threatening, diseases. It is important to know the facts about vaccines and the diseases they prevent. 1. Chickenpox (Varicella) - Chickenpox is a disease that causes an itchy rash of blisters and a fever. A person with chickenpox may have a lot of blisters\u2014as many as 500 all over their body. In some children, the symptoms can result in hospitalization and even death for young children. CDC recommends your child get two chickenpox shots at the following ages: 12-15 months and 4-6 years 2. COVID-19 - COVID-19 causes a variety of symptoms and can present differently in different people. It often begins with flu-like symptoms but can progress rapidly, resulting in hospitalization and death. There is still much to learn about COVID-19, however it is clear vaccines help reduce the severity of the disease. CDC recommends your child get their primary series of the COVID-19 as early as 6 months, through age 17 years. Boosters are also recommended for 5 years and older, if eligible. Use the CDC COVID-19 booster tool to learn if and when your child or teen can get boosters (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html#when-you-can-get-booster). For the most up-to-date vaccine guidelines, visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html. 3. Diphtheria - Diphtheria can cause a thick covering in the back of the nose or throat that makes it hard to breathe or swallow. Diphtheria can also lead to heart failure, paralysis, and even death. CDC recommends your child get five doses of the DTaP vaccine at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years. At age 12, CDC recommends the single dose Tdap. 4. Flu - Influenza, also known as the flu, is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus that infects the nose, throat, and lungs. Flu can affect people differently based on their immune system, age, and health. CDC recommends your child get the flu vaccine every year starting when they are 6 months old. Some children younger than 9 years old need two doses of flu vaccine, spaced at least 28 days apart. SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE03 5. Hepatitis A - Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease and is transmitted by person- to-person contact or through contaminated food and water. CDC recommends that your child get two doses of the Hepatitis A vaccine at the following ages: 12-23 months, and 6 months after last dose. 6. Hepatitis B - Hepatitis B is a liver disease spread through blood or other body fluids. It's especially dangerous for babies, because the hepatitis B virus can spread from an infected mother to child during birth. CDC recommends your child get three doses of the Hepatitis B shot at the following ages: shortly after birth, 1-2 months, and 6-18 months. 7. Hib - Hib (or its official name, Haemophilus influenzae type b) isn't as well known as some of the other diseases, thanks to vaccines. Hib infection can cause brain damage, hearing loss, or even death. CDC recommends that your child get three or four doses of the Hib vaccine at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months (for some brands), and 12-15 months. 8. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) - Some HPV infections can cause several kinds of cancer and abnormal cells in the cervix that can lead to genital warts. CDC recommends your child be given dose 1 between 11-12 years and dose 2 be given 6-12 months after the first dose. HPV can routinely be given as early as age 9 through age 26, and some adults up to age 45 may get the vaccine after talking to their health care provider. 9. Measles - Measles is very contagious, and it can be serious, especially for young children. CDC recommends that your child get two doses of the MMR vaccine at the following ages: 12-23 months and 4-6 years. Infants 6 to 11 months old should have one dose of the MMR shot before traveling abroad. 10. Meningococcal - Meningococcal causes infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and bloodstream infections. CDC recommends your child get two doses of the MenACWY vaccine at the following ages: 11-12 years and 16 years 11. Mumps - Mumps is best known for causing puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. This is due to swelling of the salivary glands. Other symptoms include fever, head and muscle aches, and tiredness. These symptoms can lead to dehydration, hospitalization, and even death for younger children. CDC recommends that your child get two doses of the MMR vaccine at the following ages: 12-23 months and 4-6 years.SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE0412. Pneumococcal - This disease is caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. It causes ear and sinus infections, pneumonia, and even meningitis, making it very dangerous for children.

Polio - Polio is a crippling and potentially deadly infectious disease that is caused by poliovirus. The virus spreads from person to person and can invade an infected person's spinal cord, causing paralysis. CDC recommends your child get four doses of the polio vaccine (also called IPV) at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and 4-6 years. 14. Rotavirus - Rotavirus is contagious and can cause severe watery diarrhea, often with vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain, mostly in infants and young children. These symptoms can lead to dehydration, hospitalization, and even death for younger children. CDC recommends your child get two or three doses of the vaccine at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months (for some brands). 15. Rubella - Rubella is spread by coughing and sneezing. It is especially dangerous for a pregnant woman and her developing baby. If an unvaccinated pregnant woman is infected with rubella, she can have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects. CDC recommends your child get two doses of the MMR vaccine at the following ages: 12-23 months and 4-6 years. 16. Tetanus - Tetanus causes painful muscle spasms and trouble breathing and can be fatal or cause paralysis. It is caused by a bacterium in the ground, which is why parents often warn kids about tetanus when they get cut on rusted metal. CDC recommends your child get five doses of the DTaP vaccine at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years. At age 12, CDC recommends the single dose Tdap. 17. Whooping Cough (Pertussis) - Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a highly contagious disease that can be deadly for babies. Whooping cough can cause uncontrollable, violent coughing, which often makes it hard to breathe. Its \"whooping\" name comes from the sharp breath intake sound right after a coughing fit.

SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE05Preparation for Vaccine Visits Vaccine visits can be stressful\u2014even for adults! It is best to prepare yourself to support your child during this stressful time. By preparing for a successful visit, you can reduce the fear and reluctance your child might have and make it easier to adhere to their vaccination schedule. Listed below are some ways you can support your child during their visit. 1 For Babies and Younger Children Distract and comfort your child by cuddling, singing, or talking softly. Smile and make eye contact with your child. Let your child know that everything is okay. Comfort your child with a favorite book or toy. A blanket that smells familiar will help your child feel more comfortable. Hold your child firmly on your lap, whenever possible. Embracing your child during vaccination offers several benefits, as you can: Safely prevent your child from moving their arms and legs during injections. Avoid frightening your child by embracing and allows you to nurture and comfort your child during the visit. Help the health care professional steady the limb and the injection site. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2019, August 5). Before, during, and after shots.

SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE06Suggested Holds and Embraces: Infants and Toddlers If your child is getting a shot in a leg, you can: Hold your child on your lap. Place your child's arm under your armpit and apply gentle pressure with your upper arm for a secure, hug-like hold. Use your lower arm and hand to hold your child's other arm gently but securely. Anchor your child's feet firmly between your thighs or hold securely with your other hand. Suggested Holds and Embraces: Older Children If your child is getting a shot in an arm: Hold the child on your lap or have your child stand in front of you as you sit. Embrace your child during the process. Anchor both of your child's legs between your thighs. CDC Tip: Help your child see vaccines are a good thing. Never threaten your child with shots by saying, \"if you misbehave, I will have the nurse give you a shot.\" Instead, remind children that vaccines can keep them healthy. SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE07For Preteens, Teens, and Young Adults As a parent, what you say matters to your teen or young adult. From staying up to date on vaccinations to preparing your adolescent for conversations with his or her health care provider, you can help protect your child by influencing important health decisions and behaviors. 2 Your Role as a Parent Parents can guide your child in forming important health habits, such as scheduling annual well visits and staying informed about vaccines. Risks are Real Your teen or young adult may encounter different health concerns or conditions than when he or she was younger. Adolescents are more likely to catch and or spread diseases from common adolescent activities and other risk factors, including: Sharing drinks, cups, and utensils Poor hygiene Sexual behavior Close-quartered living Group hangouts Empower Your Teen or Young Adult Talking to your teen or young adult about certain health topics can be difficult. To engage in an open conversation with your teen: Be sympathetic Provide the facts Keep your composure Stress vaccines are safe 2 Unity Consortium. (2020, March 31). Teens & young adults.
