We make our Nation rich. We come from the matriarchy, and our womanhood is a blessing.\" - Heiltsuk Women's Declaration7 Women are highly respected in First Nations cultures as matriarchs, Knowledge Keepers, caretakers of the water, and sacred givers of life.1,2 Matriarchs hold positions of power and are leaders in their communities - presiding over feasts, leading ceremonies to mark key life transitions such as birth and coming-of-age as well as nurturing and teaching children, the leaders of tomorrow. 3,4 Many Nations are traditionally matrilineal, meaning that peoples' identities - including clans and roles - are passed down through mothers.5 Two-Spirit/Indigiqueer, trans and non-binary women are also leaders on a journey to decolonize gender and reclaim the important roles they have held in many First Nations cultures as leaders and teachers, interpreters, child minders, mediators, healers and medicine people. 6 First Nations cultures strongly value the interconnectedness of all aspects of individual, family and community life. However, the vital balance and respect for women has been undermined by colonialism and the continuing imposition of Western, patriarchical values. While many First Nations matriarchs continue to thrive and lead their communities on a path towards wellness, the structures, policies and attitudes of colonialism continue to have devastating impacts on the lives, relationships and health of many - with rippling effects on the strength and balance of communities more broadly. This chapter focuses on how First Nations woman-identifying adults living in BC are thriving and self-determining. It highlights some of the ways their ability to live to their full potential continue to be challenged by colonial structures and systems. It also celebrates the ways First Nations women demonstrate their inherent resilience adapting to, resisting and surmounting these obstacles for the benefit of themselves, their families, communities and Nations. The majority of quantitative data in this chapter is from adults between the ages of 18-54 who have self-identified as \"female.\" However, some data covers those up to the age of 65.HEALTHY BoDIES, MINDS AND SPIRITS 70 | Sacred and Strong: Upholding Our Matriarchal Roles HealTHY, self-determining women & communiTies - Roots of wellness The vision of healthy and vibrant First Nations women is grounded in the roots of wellness: their connections to culture and identity, the land, family and community. These connections are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. The connection to land and water, for example, is at the core of First Nations culture, language and identity. 8 Practising culture, similarly, helps to build women's connection to their community while also strengthening and empowering the community. Self-determination for the individual, family, clan and Nation is necessary for First Nations women to revitalize and maintain these connections through their adult years. When strong, these connections provide support, guidance and strength to women as they navigate the adult phase of their life journey and balance the various mental, emotional, spiritual and physical spheres of wellness. They, in turn, keep the culture alive by teaching and passing on language and tradition to children and grandchildren. Connections to Ancestors, Culture, Language & Ceremony Connections to Land, Water & TerritoryHaving a connection to culture and language is a deep foundation of wellness and identity at every phase of a First Nations woman's life. Taking part in ceremonies and engaging in cultural practices helps many First Nations women become and stay strong, heal, and achieve a sense of balance. Connecting to culture and identity by learning the language of one's ancestors is a powerful way to break out of the cycle of trauma. 9 It has also been associated with decreased suicide ideation.10 Women and matriarchs often play a key role in leading, preserving and revitalizing cultural activities and ceremonies. 11 They have been central to the preservation of First Nations language and cultural practices14 and continue to lead the movement to revive these traditions among their children and within their communities, including: reclaiming the potlatch, traditional birthing traditions and parenting methods; 12 integrating traditional foods and healing practices into their lives; and reviving puberty rites, welcoming ceremonies and marriage ceremonies. 11 First Nations cultures recognize women's connections to the land and water - in a physical, spiritual, cultural and symbolic sense - as foundational to their wellness journeys. 15 For many First Nations women, land and water are medicine. Maintaining a connection to the land, waters and territories - engaging in traditional food practices or using traditional medicines, gardening, swimming or going for walks, fishing and hunting, camping, or canoeing - is seen as essential for healing as well as maintaining wellness. 15 Traditionally, when harvesting, hunting or trapping First Nations foods, ceremonies were held to give thanks for the plants and animals for their gift of nourishment that kept the woman, family and community strong. 30 A Note about Gender Inclusivity - This chapter is intended to honour and celebrate the strengths of all First Nations people living in BC who identify as and/or express themselves as women, including cisgender females, trans women, non-binary people and those who identify as Two-Spirit/Indigiqueer. The term \"woman\" is used in this chapter, however, as a binary term, it may not accurately reflect the gender and sexual identities of all who are reflected in the experiences, data and stories discussed. Although there is currently very limited data available on the health and wellness of First Nations non-binary and transgender populations, these distinctions are important as a person's gender identity shapes their experiences, their social determinants of health, and their access to services. \"Learning my language has been an amazing journey that I wouldn't trade for any monetary value because it is priceless. My identity is slowly emerging and I'm beginning to feel whole and powerful as a woman of my Nation!\" - Yvonne Joe, Nekepmxc\u00edn13 \"The land is the physical place we live our lives in. It is a physical representation of how we see ourselves and what we value most. If we nourish it, it will nourish us. If we degrade it, it will reinforce that same value we place on ourselves. It is a reflection, a mirror of our own level of health and what we choose every day as our priorities.\" - Coco Miller, Gitxsan/Tsimshian, Kitselas First Nation22Sacred and Strong: Upholding Our Matriarchal Roles | 71Connections to Land, Water & TerritoryColonialism caused a disruption in the intergenerational transfer of knowledge around water and undermined First Nations' rights and access to water resources, including clean, safe and reliable water for drinking. Through impeded access to territories, the Indian reservation system, limited transportation systems from remote areas, ecological destruction and contamination, changes to how First Nations can use their traditional lands have also had an acute impact on women, their livelihoods and their capacity to practise their traditional ways of life. 16 24 First Nations women's and girls' physical safety and lives have been subjected to some of the most harmful impacts of resource extraction projects involving industrial work camps17 - impacts that include increased crime rates, violence, sex trafficking and economic insecurity.18,19 In many cases, as the guardians of their families, communities and cultures, First Nations women are at the forefront of resistance efforts that bring attention to the risks associated with extractive development and reclaim communities' rights and access to territories and safe drinking water. 20,16 They are also leading the movement to revitalize ecological knowledge systems and traditional diets, as a way of re-establishing the cultural responsibilities and relationships that Indigenous peoples have with the environment and asserting control over their own well-being. 21 First Nations perspectives on wellness bring focus to the wide range of social, environmental, and spiritual contexts and interconnections that shape a women's health and identity. While each individual is valued as their own person, they are also defined by their interconnections, and kinship relationships. 24 Relationships with clan, family and community serve as anchoring points that help foster a sense of being loved and supported by others. First Nations women play important roles in their communities as caregivers for children and Elders. This connection to community and having a sense of belonging contributes to a women's safety. 26 For many First Nations women, community is bound to their territory and/or their immediate and extended family. For others who left their communities for work or education - and particularly those who were removed or disconnected from their families and communities as a result of residential schools, the Sixties' Scoop, child welfare or other policies of colonialism - their family and community may be tied more to where they live or work, a common interest or pastime. Regardless of whether these are blood connections or otherwise, having safe and loving relationships with partners, family and friends is vital to First Nations women's capacity to cope with adversities they may face through their adult years, and to their ability to overcome these challenges and threats to their security, health and wellness. These relational connections, rooted in the values of kindness and respect, have been found to be particularly significant for women's wellness, even more so than for men's. 27 Connections to Family and Community \"The greatest gift I have been given by my Elders, is the gift of knowing who I am as Tsleil-Wautt (one of the Tsleil- Waututh). Someday, my generation will be Elders, and I worry about that. What if we don't know enough? What if we forget? And then I remember my grandparents and my parents and I know that we will be okay.\" - Leah George-Wilson, Tsleil-Waututh Nations28\"I had family. They transitioned with me.

Everything we do. How we relate to ourselves. How we relate to our family. How we relate to our environment. Our relationships have been badly damaged by history. A long time ago, we had very good relationships. Then, relationships within the family were pulled apart. Relationships were just pulled apart, our social support networks and everything damaged. We also know that our communities, where the people live, don't always have all the infrastructure that might be needed for people to be strong and healthy. So, sometimes that brings about tension and a sense of expectation. Sometimes, that brings about poor relationships. In fact, I think there is one thing that almost every First Nation has in common - and that's a lack of trust. A lack of trust in self, a lack of trust in what's going to happen around me, of the band council, of the federal and provincial governments. A lack of trust in this institution or that institution. Because historically [the systems] haven't necessarily met the needs of the people well or been respectful of the cultures of the people. They just haven't served the people well. So, relationships and rebuilding relationships is absolutely a central focus to our work.\" - Gwen Philips, Ktunaxa First Nation36SuPPoRTIVE SYSTEMS The health and wellness of First Nations women is greatly impacted by the systems that - through policies, structures, underlying values and/or norms - determine the conditions of their environments, i.e., where they live, work, play, learn, heal and pray. Since time immemorial, First Nations have had systems pertaining to these various social determinants of health - systems for education, food, housing, health, and justice. While these still exist, they were undermined and disrupted by colonialism, and the mainstream systems and structures in place today are rooted heavily in Canada's colonial history. As a result, the health and wellness of many First Nations women continues to be shaped by their social, economic, cultural and political marginalization. 25 Many reports have stressed the need to decolonize various systems and institutions by removing systemic barriers that result in health inequities. These include the reports of the Addressing Racism Review (2020), National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (2019), Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (2015), and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007), among others. To create environments where First Nations women in BC can thrive, it will be necessary to work with women to recalibrate mainstream systems and institutions in a way that is culturally safe and grounded in respectful relationships. This section looks at some of the systems that influence the social determinants of health of woman-identifying First Nations adults - including interconnected systems of education, food, economic well-being, health and justice. It highlights the importance of the work underway to transform institutional systems and reclaim First Nations approaches that supported First Nations women and their families for thousands of years. It also highlights the inherent resilience of First Nations women and the many ways that they are already leading this important work. Sacred and Strong: Upholding Our Matriarchal Roles | 75SuPPoRTIVE SYSTEMS Racism and Discrimination Racism and discrimination are embedded in the everyday lives of First Nations women. In mainstream society, the values are so deeply entrenched that those holding them do not see them as discriminatory. Racism and discrimination manifest at the individual level and the structural level, through systems, institutions, laws, and policies and structures as well as interpersonal relationships - result in stereotyping, marginalization, stigmatization and violence. 19 Racism compounds other forms of social exclusion based on intersections such as gender, sexual orientation, age, class and ability, causing further injustice and harm. 41 The pain and trauma resulting from racism and discrimination affects First Nations women and their children and communities in countless ways.40 \"Growing up with two high-functioning alcoholic parents, I experienced trauma. I left home at the age of 18 after an alcohol-fueled fight with my father and dove head-first into a toxic relationship with a very unwell First Nations man. We stayed together for five years and had two children, but he had serious addiction issues and was extremely verbally and physically abusive. He had severe unresolved and unrealized trauma that was impacting the children. I finally found the courage to leave that relationship and was a single parent for a long time. It wasn't easy. Though we were separated, I could not shield our children from his pain. I didn't deal with my own trauma from our relationship until my kids were teenagers. The trauma began to surface until it became unmanageable and I could not push it down anymore. It was time to heal. I began talk therapy with an Indigenous counsellor and it was life-changing. She offered me tools to begin processing my trauma and with the full support of my partner and children, I began healing. It was extremely difficult and required me to face the many events I had pushed down, beginning in childhood and throughout different relationships in my life. I had to feel it all. I had to release it all. I had to be brave. Most of all, I had to have compassion for myself. \"Discovering the roots of my trauma has been the biggest realization in my healing - and the most difficult. Learning about residential school and the history of colonialism helped me to piece together why things were the way they were in my family. The intergenerational impacts of residential school are real. I lived them and I'm still healing from them. Unfortunately, the father of my children could not overcome his trauma - it was too much - and he passed away of an opioid overdose last year. Though my children did not have a positive or consistent relationship with him, his death was a tragic event in their lives. \"I am a grandmother now to the most beautiful little boy and another on the way. My biggest hope is that my grandchildren will never know the pain of their ancestors because of the resiliency of me and my children. \"As I continue on my wellness journey, I remain aware of my triggers and when they arise, I utilize the tools learned from my counsellor.

LATERAL VIOLENCE\"Even when physical or sexual violence is not immediately present, because the violence perpetuated against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA peoples in Canada is so pervasive, their daily lives are tainted by a constant fear and threat of violence.\" - MMIWG Final Report38Prior to colonialism, the influence and respect women held in their societies gave them a voice and kept them safe from abuse, sexual assault and stalking.42 The historical and ongoing effects of colonialism, compounded by the social attitudes of misogyny as well as racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia, disrupt the roles that women play within their communities.26 In diminishing their status, colonialism has made them and their children more vulnerable to violence, critically undermining their rights to safety and their sense of security.26 As revealed through the COVID-19 pandemic, the risks of violence to First Nations women and girls are further heightened in times of crisis.43 For some Indigenous people, the intergenerational trauma associated with colonialism and having children removed from their families as part of the Indian Act, residential schools, Sixties' Scoop, and child welfare systems has impacted their capacity to express emotions and form healthy relationships later in life. 45 The negativity and suffering caused by colonialism, racism, oppression and inter-generational trauma can also at times be misdirected towards one's family, friends and community in the form of child abuse, homophobia, transphobia, and lateral violence. 45 Lateral kindness is an approach to addressing the various expressions of unkindness that arise when the hurt and oppression caused by colonialism manifests in anger towards other Indigenous people in the form of gossip, verbal and physical assaults, passive-aggressive behaviours, blaming, shaming, bullying, and threatening or intimidating behaviour. Drawing from First Nations teachings about respect, fairness, and the importance of relationships, lateral kindness aims to create an environment built on a foundation of kindness. 46 promising practices The Kindness Project is an initiative launched by the Southern Stl'atlimx Health Society in April 2019 to bring about a greater understanding of lateral violence in Stl'atlimx communities, and encourage ways of addressing the issue through lateral kindness and traditional ways. 49 The concept of lateral kindness has emerged in response to the harm and destruction caused through the internalization of colonial values within First Nations communities - drawing on the cultural values that promote social harmony and healthy relationships, and reclaiming the teachings around lifting one another up and celebrating the positive behaviours of others. 50 The ReMatriate Collective is an Indigenous women's collective, co-founded by Kelly Edzerza-Bapty (Tahltan) and Jeneen Frei-Njootli (Vuntut Gwitchin), which aims to empower Indigenous women and provide women role models for young Indigenous girls, using social media. As a way of enabling Indigenous women to control the visual representation of their identities, ReMatriate's ongoing social media campaign invites Indigenous women to submit an image of themselves that they feel is empowering, a short biography, a history of their community, and a \"WE ARE\" statement that celebrates the diversity and connection amongst Indigenous peoples. Using art as a platform, the collective seeks to expose and respond to offensive and racist misrepresentations of Indigenous identities found in fashion, media and other sources. 51 of First Nations women were verbally assaulted in the previous yearexperienced one or more physically aggressive encounters.

LATERAL VIOLENCEFor many First Nations, education is a lifelong process that includes diverse opportunities for teaching and learning.52 During adulthood, for example, some BC First Nations women awaken knowledge of their languages, learn about the land, or explore cultural practices such as beading, weaving, dancing and singing. These connections to culture can promote wellness. Many also pursue education within the mainstream post-secondary system (university, college) that can facilitate access to employment opportunities and income security. Mainstream educational institutions often lack cultural safety, however, and as a result can reinforce colonial traumas. The TRC Report contained several Calls to Actions directed specifically at post- secondary institutions. 53 Since its release in 2015, commitments have been made to address systemic barriers; integrate Indigenous perspectives, knowledge and teaching methods; and increase the receptivity and relevance of BC post-secondary institutions and programs for Indigenous learners. 54 However, for many First Nations women, the mainstream education systems they experienced as children, youth and even as adults have been grounded firmly in colonialist perspectives, values and assumptions. 55 Education System 48.6% First Nations Women had some level of post - secondary training or educationIndigenous women with bachelor's degrees were more likely to obtain jobs in their field of education than their non - Indigenous women peersPost-Secondary education 6.7% of female students enrolled in BC post - secondary institutions were Indigenous \"I entered into post-secondary education as an adult 35 years of age.

I learned that the post-secondary nursing system did not take into account the two-eyed seeing of looking at health care wholistically and from a Western perspective.

Far too many First Nations women are placed in positions of having to make impossible decisions, such as whether to remain in an abusive relationship or face poverty and homelessness. 63 Studies have also shown poverty to be a root cause leading to the removal of Indigenous children from their mothers and their families. 65 The most commonly reported cause for child apprehension on reserve is \"neglect,\" resulting from failure to supervise and meet basic needs.66 For this reason, combined with the long history of racist and prejudicial colonial policies that have sanctioned the separation of Indigenous children from their families and communities, many Indigenous women living in situations of poverty share a constant fear of the child welfare system.

Today, traditional food sources and preservation methods are at risk from climate change and resource development, and access to First Nations foods is also impeded in some cases by food-safety regulations, which prohibit hunted, gathered, and wild foods from being served. 64 Finding affordable fresh food is a challenge in some lower-income, rural and remote areas, such that many First Nations women and their families have little choice beyond store-bought and processed foods. Those who are living on lower incomes can struggle to meet their basic needs around food. 67 Indigenous food sovereignty is a movement in which First Nations women and their communities are regaining control of their own food and food practices through the revitalization of traditional foods and ecological knowledge systems. 68 A growing number of Nations have started community gardens and reinitiated traditional hunting, food production and harvesting practices as a way of restoring their cultural relationship with food, enhancing their diets by reintegrating more First Nations foods and enhancing food security. 69 This work is important in helping to address rates of chronic disease that have resulted from the land displacement and privileging of Western diets that occurred with colonialism.

The gardening provides a way for members to reconnect with the land, strengthen and care for themselves, while also increasing their control and access to First Nations foods. The interaction and opportunity to grow has also helped community members to stay connected and hopeful during the uncertainty of the pandemic. 73 The FNHA Drinking Water Safety Program supports a growing number of Nations to increase capacity and regain control over the monitoring and management of community drinking water. There have been improvements in the number of First Nations households in BC who have safe drinking water in their homes year-round. Community-based water monitors are responsible for sampling, testing, recording and communicating the quality of water in communities from source to tap. They also develop and implement drinking water quality awareness programs, promoting the First Nations concept of \"Water is Life.\" 74 promising practices Side Note: While this data draws attention to the prevailing challenges related to the affordability of food, being food-secure entails having, at all times, physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet a person's dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. 71 Given the deep cultural significance of food systems and practices in many Indigenous cultures, definitions of food security may also include dimensions such as the food being culturally relevant and/or the accessibility and availability of traditional foods. 72 supportive systems supportive systems80 | Sacred and Strong: Upholding Our Matriarchal Roles Emergency Department Utilization BC First Nations have effective knowledge systems about being healthy and well.75 In today's world, the mainstream health care system, which is grounded in Euro-centric beliefs and Western-based medicine,76 plays a role in the wellness journeys of most First Nations women. However, many still also look often to ancestral knowledge, as well as traditional health practices and medicines, to support living healthier lives, particularly in rural and remote communities where access to appropriate and affordable primary health care is difficult and, at times, near impossible.77 The Review of Anti-Indigenous Racism in the BC Health Care System conducted in 2020 illuminated how pervasive racism and discrimination limits access to services and causes direct harms, including death for First Nations people and their families.61 Indigenous women are disproportionately targeted and impacted by racism, discrimination and misogyny in the health system.61 Those who are sexually and gender- diverse often face compounding expressions of bias and stereotypes.78 As a result, despite having a greater need for health services, high proportions of Indigenous women report feeling unsafe in accessing care.61 They avoid medically necessary treatment for fear of receiving poor care.79 They also express a fear and lack of trust in the health providers and the medical system, the need to hide their Indigeneity when seeking services, and the need to prove their worth as a patient.61,80 Those who are trans, gender-diverse and Two-Spirit/Indigiqueer talk about having to choose between identifying as Indigenous or queer when seeking health services and supports.78 Lack of access to culturally safe care deprives First Nations women from primary care services that can be key in preventing health issues.61 Good primary care can also promote early diagnosis and effective management of health issues and prevent over-utilization of emergency care. Health System \"In my experience with primary health, it is either gender- affirming or culturally humble. There is not a blending of the two. For example, when I was prepping for my surgery, there were so many conversations with the surgeon and with staff - so many questions about different aspects of my health, like my weight, blood pressure, whether or not I smoke - but nothing about other things that really impact my health like whether or not I had smudged that morning, or who my chosen family would be at the operation, which for many transgender people is more important than their blood family. Two-Spirit is who I am; whereas my transitioning is about who I am with my body.

While many communities are benefiting from the restoration of these traditional systems, the wellness journeys of many First Nations women and their families continue to be impacted directly or indirectly by the Canadian justice and correctional system, which remains rooted firmly in colonialism and Western values and stereotypes about First Nations people. 82 Justice-related human rights violations against First Nations women in community and in custody are widely documented and police, courts, correctional facilities and other representatives of the criminal justice system have been found to be either responsible or complicit in these violations. 26 Justice System promising practices Your Rights on Reserve: A Legal Toolkit for Aboriginal Women in BC is a toolkit created by Indigenous women for Indigenous women to address some of the identified gaps in relevant legal information. The resource aims to help Indigenous women and their families in understanding some of their legal rights in BC, especially as they apply on reserve. The creation and writing of the Toolkit was led by Atira Women's Resource Society (under the direction of Amber Prince, Sucker Creek Nation, who grew up on the unceded territory of the Dakelh First Nations), which provides free legal advocacy services to low-income women (including trans women) in the Downtown Eastside in a safe and confidential, women's-only space. Unlocking the Gates is a community-based peer-health mentoring program that works with community agencies inside the prison system to connect with individuals during pre-release planning, offer systematic peer support, and support the reintegration of individuals who are leaving correctional facilities in BC. The program works to build supportive relationships and employs restorative and social justice principles to enhance individuals' reintegration efforts. 86 The First Nations Justice Strategy (FNJS) seeks to reform the mainstream justice system so that it is safe and responsive to First Nations peoples, and also seeks to restore First Nations justice systems. The FNJS was developed through collaboration of the First Nations Justice Council, BC First Nations communities, and the provincial government. 87 custody rates Evincing the \"deepening Indigenization of Canada's correctional system,\"83 in 10 years, the rate of Indigenous women in provincial custody rose*: of the adult female population in BC are Indigenous Females of adult females in provincial custody in BC are Indigenous 46.1% 2016/17 2006/07 67.6 (Per, 100,000)87.4 (Per, 100,000) 5.2%\"Indigenous women are criminalized for protecting themselves or their children against violence; that is, they are criminalized for the very thing the justice system is supposed to protect them against.\"26 2016/17 | BC Ministry of Public Safety & Solicitor General; 2016 Census*Increase may be due partly to change in reporting of Indigenous identity. 2006/07; 2016/17 | BC Ministry of Public Safety & Solicitor General\"I want to be able to walk down the street with my grandkids without someone calling the social worker because they think, 'Oh, she yanked her kid there.

As affirmed by the MMIWG Inquiry, they are criminalized for resisting the violence, systemic oppression and marginalization of colonialism.26 First Nations women also encounter systemic racism within every facet of the Canadian justice system, from policing to sentencing. These systemic realities have fostered a deep mistrust in the criminal justice system among First Nations women.26 They have also contributed to disproportionate numbers of First Nations women in custody.82 Following from the MMIWG Inquiry (2019), the TRC (2015), the RCAP (1996), and the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba (1991), among others, there is growing acknowledgement of and support for Indigenous-grounded, community-based justice approaches.supportive systems supportive systems82 | Sacred and Strong: Upholding Our Matriarchal Roles Self-Rated Health Ratings of general health by First Nations women:HEALTHY BoDIES, MINDS AND SPIRITS The vision of First Nations women as healthy, vibrant and self-determining is grounded in the roots of wellness - their connections to culture and their relationships with the land, family and community. This vision involves having systems in place that nurture supportive and safe environments for First Nations women - systems that respect cultural values and are free of systemic barriers. Connected and supported First Nations women throughout BC are thriving, living this vision every day. Still, there is work to be done to dismantle the barriers that continue to impede their rights and ability to flourish. This section offers a glimpse into the data and lived experiences of First Nations women living in BC as they relate to various physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health outcomes. \"It's about reminding and supporting our communities that we have been healing ourselves since time immemorial, for thousands of years.

Spiritual wellness is the most difficult while living in the city. Any time I go back to my hometown Campbell River, I make a commitment to do a spirit bath, which is basically jumping into the ocean - the colder the better! It really shakes off any bad energy and is like pressing reset. Another easy thing I do is walk the trails near my house and pick a few branches of cedar along the way. Cedar is medicine. I give thanks and sometimes I offer tobacco. I do what I have to do, trusting that my spirit knows what it needs. It's my job to listen and be aware.\" - Jennifer Smith, Tlowitsis Note: In June 2019, BC First Nations women came together on Coast Salish Territory with Indigenous women from across Canada and developed a Declaration as an acknowledgement of their individual and collective resilience and strength. This Declaration calls upon all levels of government and private sector organizations in Canada to work with them to measure the health and wellness of Indigenous women as an indicator of the health and wellness of society as a whole. 89Sacred and Strong: Upholding Our Matriarchal Roles | 83HEALTHY BoDIES, MINDS AND SPIRITS \"The Elders talked about how if a person wasn't mentally well, there are many reasons for mental illness; most common in our history is when the spirit leaves the body, usually because of a great fear, or a scare. In traditional times, the person was taken to the woods and placed under a spruce tree, where they would stay. During that time they were told to pray for understanding to their confusion. The person was required to stay there till they received answers. Each day the Elders would go and see them, bring them food and water, talk to them about their ways. If this did not work, the medicine person would make a two-person sweat lodge, and the medicine person would take the confused person in and they would pray, take medicines and purify the mind. They would also do ceremonies using smudging through the purifying smoke with spruce boughs, calling back ceremony and another while sleeping, using feather down or burning of belongings.\" 93 Mental Wellness and Nurturing the Spirit Many First Nations believe that staying well involves being balanced and connected to family, friends, community and the land.90 Nurturing the spirit and honouring oneself - through ceremony, drumming, dancing, connecting with ancestors, spending time on the land, or taking time for self-care all help in establishing and maintaining this sense of balance. In the case of a First Nations woman, mental wellness requires having the skills necessary to cope with the stresses and worries of everyday life associated with work, home, family and community - as well as being open to learning new skills and ways of knowing, traditional and contemporary. It is also important for women to have avenues of support that they feel comfortable turning to in times of need - family, friends, a counsellor, or the traditional teachings of the Elders. 91 Ratings of mental health by First Nations women: Ratings of \"sense of balance\" by First Nations women:Sense of Balance 44% \"most / of the time\" 14% \"some of the time\" 39% in some spheres of wellness but less so in other areas 2015-17 | RHSSelf-Rated Mental Health 2015-17 | RHS It is natural for adults to experience feelings and/or periods of sadness, anxiety, helplessness and depression. From time immemorial, First Nations have had ways of supporting members through these difficult times. 93 However, when a person experiences trauma and/or if supports to balance and maintain mental wellness are weak or impeded, they can be particularly vulnerable to these different types of mental challenges. Stigma surrounding mental health and substance use can also prevent individuals from accessing supports and services. 92 Particularly in small and remote communities, First Nations women may be understandably reluctant to discuss personal issues with someone they potentially know from the community.94 Due to the wide-reaching and ongoing effects of colonialism and forced assimilation, First Nations have been disproportionately impacted by traumatic experiences, including individual, historical and collective trauma, which has in turn impacted their mental wellness. Research has consistently found a higher prevalence of anxiety and stress disorders among women as compared to men; 95 and even higher rates among those who are non-binary in gender and who identify as Two- Spirit/Indigiqueer.96,97 Experiences of racism have also been found to impact how First Nations adults feel with respect to being balanced in the different spheres of their life.98 HEALTHY BoDIES, MINDS AND SPIRITS84 | Sacred and Strong: Upholding Our Matriarchal Roles Life Stress Depression Reported stress levels for First Nations women in daily life: Reported feelings of depression in First Nations women: 33.6% \"not very\" or \"not at all\" experiencing \"a bit of stress \" 17.9% indicated that most days, their lives were either \"quite a bit\" or \"e xtremely\" stressful39.7% never felt depressed 49.4% felt depressed \"a little \" 10.9% were depressed either \"most\" or \"all of the time \" Tobacco holds important cultural, spiritual and medicinal value for many Indigenous women living in BC, who utilize the plant in its natural form in ceremonies, rituals, healing practices and prayers. 99,100 However, post-settlement, commercial tobacco products such as cigarettes have also been widely used with detrimental effects on women's physical, mental and spiritual wellness. Today, there is broad awareness about the health risks of smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke - the physical effects it can have in precipitating various diseases and conditions as well as the toll it can take on a person's mental well-being. At the same time, the nicotine contained in commercial cigarettes - and the liquid nicotine used for vaping and in e-cigarettes - is highly addictive. For those who have been smoking for years, quitting the habit can be challenging, though not impossible. 101 Non-smoking rates of adult First Nations women were non-smokers55.9%respecting tobacco2015-17 | RHS 2017/18 | In Plain Sight (2020)2015-17 | RHS 2xThe prevalence of depression and mood and anxiety disorders among First Nations women were more than double the rates seen among First Nations men 2015-17 | RHS HEALTHY BoDIES, MINDS AND SPIRITSSacred and Strong: Upholding Our Matriarchal Roles | 85 It is common for people who are hurting, feeling powerless, alone, and lost, to medicate with substances - alcohol and drugs - to help them cope with their lives and/or mask their pain. For over a hundred years, First Nations living in BC have been experiencing individual and collective trauma on myriad different fronts as a result of colonization, residential schools and the forced removal of children, the loss of language and lands, racism and discrimination. It has added up to a tremendous amount of pain - and, while people use substances for many reasons, it is often to help cope with that pain and hurt.

There's such a diversity in people that use drugs recreationally or to cope. That's the core of the issue is that people will experience judgement and then from there, could be shamed or could trigger shame within them.\" - Inez Louis, 2015-17 | RHSAlcohol and Substance Use What is therefore commonly referred to as addiction, is really sometimes more of a reflection - \"a manifestation of where one is within their own healing journey.\"103 Some First Nations women use alcohol and drugs for years to help deal with trauma and grief. Many are able to manage their use so that it does not impact their goals, relationships and responsibilities. However, in some cases, the use can overwhelm a person's capacity to cope and can impact their lives and their relationships.104 There are situations when this method of coping poses greater potential risks. Alcohol and substance use during pregnancy, for example, can have lifelong impacts on the health of the baby. Similarly, given the extreme toxicity of the illegal drugs in recent years, even a one-time use of these substances, whether it be in experimentation or as a slip in the healing process, could result in an overdose. A harm-reduction approach is about taking a compassionate, non-judgemental approach to alcohol and substance use: meeting people where they are at, accepting them, and understanding the complexities of substance use and addiction. 105 This approach focuses on building relationships based in trust to support individuals in reducing the harms associated with their substance use and finding safer ways of coping. 106 These connections can be life-saving - and in response to the toxic drug crisis, many Nations have developed innovative and culturally relevant harm-reduction and housing programs - often involving Elders - to strengthen supports and reduce the risks of overdoses.

These barriers hinder people from accessing harm-reduction remedies and critical health services. While the formats of the webinars vary based on the needs of the community, the webinars seek to engage people with lived experience and family members who have lost a loved one to an opioid overdose. They provide a safe space for the participants to share and strive to support each person on their individual journey, reframing the challenges people face as experiences of strength and resiliency and promoting culture as a pathway for wellness. promising practices8.6% 2008-10; 2015-17 | RHS 2015-17 | RHSIllicit substances Gambling The Toxic Drug Crisis Due to the increased barriers they face as a result of racism, their gender, and colonialist systems, First Nations women have been disproportionately represented among those who have lost their lives in connection with the opioid overdose public health emergency. On top of the collective trauma that First Nations women have experienced, colonialism continues to expose First Nations women to a variety of social factors such as poverty, fetal alcohol effects, homelessness, food insecurity, and prison, which further exacerbate their overdose risk. 110 There is significant stigma and a lack of understanding surrounding the use of substances and addiction. Unfortunately, there are also widely held racist stereotypes about First Nations peoples' use of alcohol and substances and, as a result, First Nations women often face judgement from others about their use of alcohol and substances to cope with their pain. This shaming and stigma can prevent a person from discussing their challenges and reaching out for help. Fear of incarceration and loss of child custody are strong barriers to First Nations women disclosing substance use, using safely, and accessing help. The grief and devastation resulting from having a child apprehended has also been shown to increase the risks of overdose. Pursuant to the ongoing legacy of forced separation of families and child removal in Indigenous communities, having a child apprehended from their care has been shown to double a mother's odds of experiencing an overdose. 106 \"We lean to culture and traditions for healing while wading through the pain we carry - culture is the cornerstone for healing.\" - Corrina Chase, M\u00e9tis First Nations Addictions Care Partnership Manager (FNHA, and the BC Centre on Substance Use) 66.0% \"My family is my life and light.

Driven by First Nations communities, the workshop was created to foster community champions to advocate for harm-reduction approaches, services, supplies, and resources, as well as to train the champions to provide harm-reduction education within their communities. It provides a framework to help communities have mindful and honest conversations about substance use and overdose through a First Nations lens. 111,112 Moms Stop the Harms (MSTH) is a national network that advocates to change failed drug policies and provide peer support to grieving families and those with loved ones who use or have used substances. As the Indigenous populations have been disproportionately impacted by the crisis, an MSTH Indigenous group has formed in BC. Those facing the loss of a loved one from an opioid overdose or drug harm have experienced Indigenous-specific racism. These barriers impede one's ability to access support for grief and loss. The MSTH Indigenous group is revising the MSTH Healing Hearts facilitator manual, infusing Indigenous teachings and practices to support families' healing processes and help them connect with others in the community who have experienced the same pain from losing a loved one.

However, when such a tragedy occurs, whether it be in one's own community or in another Nation, the events can have significant and reverberating effects. This impact can be amplified in smaller, tight-knit First Nations communities.90,113 Due to the ongoing intergenerational impacts of colonization, residential schools, the Sixties' Scoop, child apprehension, land dispossession, racism, and attempted cultural genocide, First Nations have been disproportionately impacted by suicides.90 A growing number of communities are mitigating these traumatic events by reclaiming their self-determination, rebuilding cultural continuity, and regaining access and control of lands, education, health services. Still, the roots of suicide are complex and the effects can be passed on from generation to generation.

Originally established in 1993 by the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation, the Society now provides services to First Nations living throughout the province. Their approach includes tracking and monitoring \"at-risk\" individuals and establishing support (wrap-around) services: making daily calls until the person is no longer in crisis and seeking out individuals who are identified by others in need of support (family, friends, counsellors, teachers, first responders). 114 promising practices It is the right of each woman to have the ability to live through the cycle of life - from childhood through adolescence into adulthood and the Elder years in a balanced, healthy way.57 Sexuality is a key component of a woman's wholistic health and wellness - understood in many First Nations cultures as an expression of the life-creating force.115 Women's control over their bodies and their fertility also lies at the heart of their basic human rights. This includes decisions around whether to have children, when and how many, as well as decisions around contraception. Traditional teachings and rituals provide guidance to First Nations women, helping them to plan, care for themselves and navigate the physical and emotional changes - and the decisions - that often come as one ages through the adult years and that can impact their sexual wellness and identity. These changes can include those related to fertility, perhaps giving birth, being in a mature relationship, and the age-related decline in hormone production. The natural evolution of a woman's sexuality is all part of maintaining balance through the life cycle, and in many First Nations cultures these phases of a woman's sexual maturation are celebrated. Colonization and the suppression of traditional language, cultural practices and ceremonies disrupted the passage of teachings and values around sexuality and healthy relationships. The racist, patriarchal, heterosexual and misogynistic views of European settlers were heavily enforced upon First Nations in BC with the effect of sexualizing, dishonouring and degrading First Nations women. 116 Residential schools did not teach young girls how to be in a healthy relationship or what their roles were in community; instead they subjected young girls to emotional mental, physical and sexual abuse.57 The trauma induced by this cultural oppression and colonial violence is complex and has had far-reaching implications for the lives and well-being of First Nations women. Racist stereotypes of First Nations women continue to undermine their rights to reproductive and sexual health. Coerced and forced sterilization, for example (whereby First Nations women have hysterectomies or their fallopian tubes tied without their consent, under pressure, false pretenses or as a condition, for example, of seeing their baby or keeping custody of their child/children), continues to impact women and influence their relationships with the health care system. 61 As a result, First Nations women in BC continue to face disproportionate risks with respect to their sexual wellness. The risks to those who are trans, gender-diverse, and identify as Two-Spirit/Indigiqueer are particularly pronounced. 78 Sexual Well-Being and Reproductive Justice \"Women are the life givers, but women are not going to be life givers without men.

When I learnt that there was zero change of me having children, when I learnt that I was sterile, that this was done to me, I felt violated as a woman because a woman's ability to have children is a huge part of their identity.\" - Indigenous woman who is part of a class action suit being filed by 80 Indigenous women from across Canada who were sterilized against their will.122 Contraception Abortions Rates of abortion were higher among First Nations than among Other Residents for age groups 20-34 2015/17 | BCCDC 2015/17 | RHS 2015 | BC Vital Statistics AgencySTIs Rates of sexually transmitted infections among First Nations women rose steadily between 2007 and 2015 as they did for all women, but as of 2015, the rate of 3,022.6 per 100,000 was more than four times that for Other Residents (679.8 per 100,000)A component of sexual wellness is learning about sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, Hepatitis C, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), syphilis, and the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) - being able to seek out this information and access the services needed to protect oneself, one's partners, and one's communities. 123 Having access to culturally safe, gender-affirming, respectful and trauma-informed health services is important to ensuring that First Nations women can do this. First Nations women in BC are honoured for their capacities as sacred life givers and matriarchs. At the same time, women retain the inherent right to own and control decisions about if they want to have children, when and how many. They have the right to choose which, if any, birth control method they want to use. They also have a right to accessible, culturally safe information and services to support their sexual and reproductive health, including the different options for planning and conception, as well as the different options for birth control or the morning-after pill, and abortion. While work is underway to enable universal access to contraception in BC , First Nations women, particularly those in rural and remote areas, commonly encounter various barriers to services and supplies for informed family planning and sexual well-being. 124\"It's hard to be the first to come forward, but until you do, there will be no change. I came forward in my community and was willing to make that sacrifice. 'Cause that's what we're doing - we're taking those first steps to make that change that we want to see. And it's for ourselves, but it's also to protect further people. It's the people who are being abused who are afraid, but it should be the other way around.

Pre-contact, daily livelihood tasks, food practices, and ceremonies, as well as other land-based and recreational activities, k ept First Nations women physically active and well-nourished.125 The preparation and consumption of traditional foods in connection with feasts, potlatches, cultural events and rituals continue to be one way that First Nations women connect with their communities, the land and their culture126 - nourishing their minds and spirits while also keeping their bodies healthy.131 The transition of diets and lifestyles that has occurred in conjunction with the loss of land, environmental degradation, socioeconomic marginalization, disruption of language, and cultural practices of colonialism, has increased the risks of various chronic diseases and conditions for First Nations. 127 Lifestyles are more sedentary with many jobs and recreational pastimes centered around computers. While research specific to First Nations women is limited in this area, women balancing work and family responsibilities commonly report how difficult it is to find the time to exercise. 128 Not feeling safe can also prevent a woman from going for walks or jogs and doing other types of physical activity in the community.129 Recognizing the benefits of First Nations foods for both physical and spiritual wellness, many First Nations women and their families are reintegrating the foods and food practices of their ancestors. 70 However, some First Nations have limited access to their lands on which to harvest these traditional foods. Particularly in northern communities, man-made processed foods are also cheaper and more easily accessible than fresh food from the land. 70 \"I was always told to take care of myself, so I do my best to promote self-worth. It is easier said than done. I was never taught how to grow my own self-esteem or self-worth, which went underdeveloped for years ... Enable your mind to see yourself healthy, vital and strong, and instruct your body to follow. Once you do so you feel a heightened appreciation for self and those around you.

Pap tests, for example, can find abnormal cells in the cervix before they become cancer. Evidence has shown that some cancers, such as cervical cancer, are often detected later in First Nations peoples later than in non-Indigenous populations. This discrepancy is due in part to lower rates of First Nations women being screened as well as the existence of barriers such as lack of culturally safe care. 132 The BC Cancer Agency recommends: Women and people with a cervix between the ages of 25-69 get a Pap test every three years. Women under the age of 49 speak to their health care provider about the benefits and limitations of a mammogram to screen for breast cancer. Women aged 50-59 years be screened for breast cancer (mammogram) and colon cancer (FIT test) every two years. Westbank First Nation , together with the FNHA, the Women's Health Research Institute, and BC Centre for Disease Control, is conducting a pilot project to evaluate the use of self-screening for cervical cancer. Self-screening allows people to conduct their own Pap test in a comfortable setting with control / autonomy over the exam. It can a provide a useful option for rural and remote communities and also help to address issues related to privacy, confidentiality, accessibility of health care providers, and lack of comfort with the Pap test, which may be associated with trauma. While the project is still ongoing, preliminary results indicate that trauma survivors especially prefer self-screening Pap over a pelvic exam. promising practices First Nations women are the hearts of their communities and Nations. In teaching the young and passing along the knowledge, language and traditions of families, clans and communities, matriarchs keep culture alive and communities strong. These connections to culture and the support of community, whoever that community may be, can have an important effect on the health and wellness of First Nations women during their adult years. Their well-being is influenced by their environments and by the systems they interact with. This phase in a woman's wellness journey is also shaped by the circumstances, learnings, relationships and experiences of their childhood and youth. What happens during these years will similarly set the path for well-being into their old age or Elder years.

I wouldn't be able to participate as well if I wasn't healthy - and getting regular Paps is important. I started getting screenings because I was told they were necessary. It was just something that seemed that you do when you're a woman. You take care of your body, you take care of spirituality, you take care of emotions. Growing up, I was also told stories by my sisters and my family members about forced sterilizations. I initially felt very scared. It took me a long time to go back to the doctor. After the procedure, I thought it was important to write my doctor a letter about my experiences with intergenerational trauma and the procedure.\" - Marion, Nak'azdli, Whut'en Nation (Lhts'umusyo/ Beaver Clan)133HEALTHY BoDIES, MINDS AND SPIRITS HEALTHY BoDIES, MINDS AND SPIRITS The rate of pap testing among First Nations was that of Other ResidentsSacred and Strong: Upholding Our Matriarchal Roles | 921Cave K, McKay S.
