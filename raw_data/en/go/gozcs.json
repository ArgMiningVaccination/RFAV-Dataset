Why do I get them and what can I do to get rid of them? Conventional remedy: Aphthous ulcers are small, painful ulcers that arise in the lining of the mouth. They are approximately 2cm-3cm in size and tend to be grey or yellow. Each ulcer is surrounded by a red halo. A small hole in the ulcer exposes the sensitive tissues below the surface. They are extremely common, can occur at any age and affect approximately one in 10 people. They tend to be more common in women, especially just before a period. Their cause is unknown, but there are known associations, such as being premenstrual or suffering from emotional or physical stress. Irritation from certain foods, such as citrus fruits, salt, acidic foods and chocolate, can cause an outbreak. Rough dental work, ill-fitting dentures and hot foods can also exacerbate the condition. A sensation of burning or tingling is often experienced a few hours before the first ulcer develops. The ulcers can be so painful during the first few days that eating or speaking is uncomfortable. Although they are not a serious problem, they are painful and annoying. In most cases, the ulcers heal without treatment and clear without residual scarring after 10 to 14 days. Mild painkillers can be useful during the first few days, when they are at their most painful. During an attack, you should avoid spicy and acidic foods, drink plenty of fluids and eat soft foods. Using a straw for drinks will help reduce discomfort. Rinsing your mouth with a weak solution of salt and water several times a day should also help. Several of my patients have testified to the benefits of applying a squeezed-out black teabag onto the affected area three or four times a day. This is probably due to the tannic acid in tea, which we know promotes healing. If your ulcers do not clear within three weeks you should see your doctor. Dr Muiris Houston Alternative remedy: Mouth ulcers (or canker sores) are red crater-like erosions that appear on the sides of the mouth or on the gums. They usually occur singly, but can sometimes appear in clusters. In Western medicine, their exact cause is not known, but they seem to be associated with resistance-lowering conditions, such as stress, menstruation and deficiencies in iron, folic acid, zinc and vitamin B12. According to traditional Chinese medicine, mouth ulcers indicate the presence of heat in the body, particularly if the sores are red and painful. Mouth ulcers can occur as a result of various organ imbalances, so fire\" - excessive heat in the stomach channel - which can be caused by excessive consumption of \"hot-natured\" foods, such as tobacco and alcohol, inhibiting the absorption of nutrients. Another condition, \"heart-fire blazing\" - excessive heat in the heart channel - in which the excess heat flares upwards, can cause, heart fire is transmitted from another organ, usually the liver. The liver is responsible for controlling menstruation, so if the liver is unbalanced, irregularities in the menstrual cycle may occur. When heat is present in the liver, it can enter the blood, affecting the uterus and causing excessive blood loss during menstruation. Heat can generate in the liver following a long-standing emotional state of repressed anger, resentment or frustration. From a dietary point of view, excessive consumption of alcohol, fried foods and meat (especially lamb and beef) can contribute to the formation of heat in the liver. Acupuncture aims to clear heat from the affected channel, strengthen the function of the organ involved, reduce stress levels, enhance the immune system and reduce the pain and inflammation associated with the sores. To prevent the recurrence of the sores, attention to diet is vital. More alkaline foods, such as fruit, vegetables, tofu and cooling herbal teas (particularly mint and chamomile), should be included in the diet. Spicy foods, coffee, alcohol, red meat and salt are heat-inducing and should be avoided.
