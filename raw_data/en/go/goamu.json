[](https://organicindiausa.com) [ Back ](/blog) In the West, most of us reach for a cup of coffee or tea (or maybe a lemon water if we're on a real health kick) to energize us first thing in the morning. However, for those who follow Eastern yogic tradition and Ayurveda, caffeinated beverages are replaced by a morning dose of neem and turmeric. Those who practice this ancient morning ritual swear by it for increasing lifeforce energy, cleansing the digestive tract, warding off acute and chronic illness, and enhancing their emotional and spiritual well-being. Today, we'll examine the tradition and science behind taking neem and turmeric on an empty stomach, and how it can benefit your health. What are Neem and Turmeric? Neem and turmeric are two different herbs that can be used individually or together to achieve specific health benefits. Turmeric is the most studied herb on the planet. It is a rhizome, similar to ginger but smaller, with a deep orange color that's used extensively in Indian and Asian cooking. If you've ever had yellow curry, for example, its color comes from turmeric. Its active component, curcumin, is a powerful antioxidant [that's been shown beneficial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26528921/) for immunity, liver function, the skin, digestive health, balancing inflammatory response, promoting neurological health, and supporting heart health (to name but a few of its proven benefits). [Neem](https://organicindiausa.com/blog/neem-capsules-benefits/), also known as Indian Lilac and \"arishtha,\" in Sanskrit, meaning \"reliever of sickness \"is [used extensively in Eastern traditions](https://organicindiausa.com/blog/neem-capsules-benefits/) to support immunity, bacterial balance, oral health, [skin health](https://organicindiausa.com/blog/neem-for-skin-health/), inflammatory response, and as a natural insect repellent. In the West, neem is most commonly used in oral health products. In the East/Ayurveda, it's been used for centuries to reduce liver heat, stimulate digestion, cleanse the blood, expel pathogens, and for various other health and beauty purposes. How Do Neem and Turmeric Work Together? Neem and turmeric are often taken separately for their individual herbal properties. However, the ancient yogis and Ayurvedic practitioners found that when combined they offered a special range of benefits. Including: - Cleansing the digestive tract\u2014which is essential to optimizing nutrient uptake, detoxification, immunity, and maintaining overall health. - Bringing clean and pure energy to the cells\u2014unlike caffeine, which can be over-stimulating, the combination of neem and turmeric taken first thing in the morning is used to naturally awaken the energy centers within our cells. This leads to a cleaner, natural, and more sustainable energy, without the jitters or crashes from coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc. - Purifying the liver\u2014which reduces toxic body burden while cleansing the blood, thereby enhancing energy. - Preventing various acute and chronic conditions\u2014this daily practice is used to support the body's natural defenses against unwanted germs, pathogens, etc. - Enhancing emotional and spiritual well-being\u2014Ayurveda teaches that a clean and clear digestive tract enhances emotional well-being and focus. This, in-turn, creates the ideal conditions for deepening our spiritual practices and purpose. In Ayurveda, daily consumption is often recommended for chronic congestion, mystery illness, frequent colds/coughs, skin issues, to strengthen the blood, cleanse the digestive system, support health glucose metabolism, for lethargy/lack of energy, to support joint mobility, reduce toxic body burden, to enhance the flow of energy (known a \"ojas\" in yogic tradition), and to promote longevity, emotional stability, and overall health. The Documented Health Benefits of Neem and Turmeric Although there is limited research on the combination of neem and turmeric taken on an empty stomach, there is plenty of research to back up this traditional use.

How (and when) to Take Neem and Turmeric Based on Yogic Tradition If you're interested in trying out neem and turmeric first thing in the morning, here's how to do it based on yogic tradition: - Upon rising, take a marble-size ball of neem and turmeric mixed together with a bit of honey and/or water on an empty stomach. Wash down with some lukewarm water. OR take 1 capsule of neem and 1 capsule of turmeric, or as recommended by your Ayurvedic or yogic practitioner. - Many people follow this ritual with a morning yoga practice, meditation, etc. Always check with your healthcare practitioner, but in most cases this practice can be continued daily or a few times a week for as long as you desire. Many Ayurvedic practitioners and yogis take this combination daily for life, and experience excellent health as a result. If you're looking for a particular result, be patient. Herbs often take time to work their magic...but that doesn't mean they're not working. Some people will notice benefits immediately, for others it can take a few weeks or even months\u2014especially if you've been experiencing a health issue for a long time. Consistency is key!
