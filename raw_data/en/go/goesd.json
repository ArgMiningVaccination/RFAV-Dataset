At the time of this writing, the U.S. has declared COVID-19 a public health emergency, and new information is emerging daily. Even if our nation's healthcare facilities weren't preparing for this novel virus, each day in the life of an IP would bring unknowns. I've heard IPs com - ment that their jobs are different every day and that each day takes them on a new journey. In addition to outbreaks and public health emergencies, IPs work in rapidly changing healthcare systems that challenge the profession to think differently and transform our roles. This also requires continued learning and growth. Learning is the result of active engagement with curiosity as we undergo formal training and collaborate with peers. Growth occurs when learning is integrated into sustainable new approaches. APIC is positioned to support and promote our shifting aspirations. Together, we will network and address the growing educational needs of IPs. APIC is creating and fostering diverse approaches to best prepare us for present and future work environments. These actions are resulting in changes that include the development of the updated APIC Competency Model for the IP , revision and expansion of support tools and practice resources, and diversification of communication and learning methods. Our peer-reviewed journal, AJIC , continues to provide science and analytics to support and validate our work. Prevention Strategist magazine informs us of timely practice enhancements that impact the daily application of infection prevention policies, strategies, and techniques. As you read this issue of Prevention Strategist focused on the theme of learning and growth, challenge yourself to read with curiosity and focus to identify new ideas to improve your organization's growth. I am honored to serve you as the 2020 APIC president, and I look forward to working with you and the APIC Board. In January, the APIC Board of Directors moved forward two primary strategies for 2020-2021: (1) conducting care delivery practice analyses in non-acute-care settings; and (2) building a leadership institute for IPs. Katrina Crist expands on the new strategic framework in her CEO's Message on page 8. You, the members, remain my motivation. As ever, I am inspired by your passion and commitment to infection prevention and control. Together, we will address the IP's role in this ever-transforming healthcare system and stretch ourselves to become more influential across the continuum of care and to become even better leaders!

PUBLISHED MARCH 2020 API-Q0120 1278 COVER IMAGE: APIC/CADE 2020 VOLUME 13, ISSUE MESSAGE BY KATRINA CRIST, MBA, CAE, APIC CEO APIC's strategic framework 2025THROUGHOUT LAST YEAR, the APIC Board of Directors undertook the daunt - ing task of prioritizing the 28 key recommendations developed at the con - sensus conference on The Role of the Infection Preventionist in a Transformed Healthcare System: Meeting Healthcare Needs in the 21st Century (see Crist K, et al. AJIC. 2019;47:352-357). This process helped us delineate which recom - mendations are strategic drivers that will jump-start progress in multiple areas and which strategies and solutions are outcomes of other activities. The board then went through a facilitated exercise designed to determine the \"super drivers,\" those recommendations that, when pursued, could provide the greatest benefit to advancing the role of the infection preventionist (IP). These recommendations, in priority order, include: 1. Conduct care delivery practice analyses for all care settings. 2. Include as a strategic priority the leadership development, effectiveness, and advancement of IPs. 3. Establish standard minimum academic credentials for IPs. 4. Conduct a gap analysis, inclusive of key stakeholders, of current data and evidence across the continuum of care that demonstrates the value of IPs, and identify where additional data and evidence are needed. 5. Define practice-specific competencies for the IP in each care setting. The final part of the process was conducted in the fall through a full day of strategic planning, which led to the development and adoption of a new strategic framework to guide APIC through 2025. The strategic framework is centered on three outcomes and has two specific strategies to implement in 2020-2021. We look forward to working with you to bring these strate - gies to life and to achieve these important outcomes.

As we welcome in a new decade, I would first like to thank Past President Roy Boukidjian and the CBIC Board of Directors for their 20/20 vision in developing and launching two new pathways. As I reflect back on 2019, I want to highlight the incredible progress made by the CBIC Board of Directors and CBIC staff in moving forward our collective vision for recertification by Infection Prevention Units (IPUs) and the Associate\u2014Infection Prevention and Control (a-IPC) entry-level examination. Both initiatives required strategic planning and focus to enable their respective successful launches in 2020. New opportunities in 2020 January marked the debut of the recertification by IPUs interactive platform. As a reminder to all readers, this method of recertification is available to recertifying candidates as an alternate method to recertification by examination. Candidates who recertify this way must demonstrate proficiency and expertise in infection prevention and control (IPC) by continuing competency achieved through continuing education. Activities to demonstrate proficiency may include, but are not limited to, IPC-related academic education, research, publications, presentations, and more. The interactive online platform enables those recertifying to upload a professional portfolio. It will be immediately available to those recertifying in 2020, making them the first to use the new system and the new method. The a-IPC examination will see its first cohort of test takers in the spring of 2020, marking the beginning of a new and exciting pathway for those interested in learning more about IPC or pursuing an IPC career. Both events reflect the future of CBIC. Looking forward In 2020, CBIC is looking forward to building on the momentum we gained in 2019 and continuing to challenge the status quo while supporting the CIC\u00ae as the only examination for IPC professionals accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies. I can say personally that I look forward to strengthening current partnerships and making new ones. Let's see what unfolds in 2020\u2014stay tuned!

New AJIC -NHSN case study available An 18-year-old male was diagnosed with influenza A on January 10, 2019. On January 12, the mother called 911 due to her son's nonresponsiveness. Upon arrival of emergency medical services, the patient's respiratory rate was 38 and very shallow. So begins the latest HAI Studies Project, published in the American Journal of Infection Control (AJIC) . AJIC and the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) are continuing the series of case studies in AJIC that began in June 2010. These cases reflect some of the complex patient scenarios that infection preventionists have encountered in their daily sur - veillance of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) when using the NHSN definitions. With each case, a link to an online survey is provided where you can answer questions about the scenario and receive immediate feedback in the form of answers and expla - nations. These cases provide a learning opportunity and assist NHSN in determining gaps in the understanding of the criteria. The most recent case study reviews ventilator-associated events (VAE). It can be accessed online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j. ajic.2019.10.016 . APIC has appointed Patricia Stone, PhD, MPH, RN, FAAN, as editor of the American Journal of Infection Control (AJIC) . Pat assumes the role from Elaine Larson, PhD, RN, FAAN, CIC, who retired in December 2019 after serving as AJIC editor since 1995. Pat joins AJIC from the Columbia University School of Nursing, where she is Centennial Professor of Health Policy and director of the Center for Health Policy. She is a tenured professor of nursing and has previously served as director of the school's PhD program. She has served multiple terms on the AJIC editorial board. Over the past 20 years, Pat has established herself as an expert on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, nursing homes, and home health care. The large-scale studies she has led, with more than $60 million total in federal and foundation funding, have guided healthcare practice and policy. Her research has been cited in national guidelines and in policy documents such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \"National Action Plan to Prevent HAIs.\" In addition to her research and teaching career, Pat has served on several national health policy-making committees, including twice cochairing National Quality Forum Technical Advisory Panels. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including APIC's Distinguished Scientist Award, and the author of more than 200 publications.Introducing AJIC' s new editor: Patricia Stone, PhD, MPH, RN, FAAN ISTOCK.COM/JANE_KELLEY16 | SPRING 2020 | Prevention IP PROFILE A conversation with an infection preventionist MAIMUNA JATTA, MSN, RN, PCCN, CIC, is an infection preventionist (IP) who had more than 10 years of healthcare experi - ence in diverse settings as a nurse before transitioning to infection prevention in 2017. In her current role as an IP at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, she works with both inpatient and out - patient services as well as emergency medical services. Maimuna has a mas - ter's degree in nursing with a focus on infection control from American Sentinel University. She obtained her bachelor's in nursing from Grand View University in 2013. Maimuna has been a nurse since 2009, beginning her career in her home country, Gambia, before moving to the United States in 2011. What inspired you to become an IP? Now that I think about it, the idea of infection prevention as a career path was first introduced to me by my friend in college. She would randomly make comments about how I am a germo - phobe who would make a good infec - tion control nurse. I didn't know what an infection control nurse did, but I was intrigued by the title. I looked it up and found the role quite interesting because I had contemplated a public health career before I decided to pursue nursing after high school. To learn of a career path that would allow me to use my nursing knowledge and skills while acquiring and applying public health principles was just terrific. Infection prevention has potential to make an impact across the con - tinuum of care. Working with chroni - cally ill, ventilator-dependent patients and seeing firsthand the burden of multidrug-resistant organisms and device-associated infection further nudged me toward pursuing a career in infection prevention. www.apic.org | 17 What were some of your challenges when you first entered the field? It was a bit of a challenge to transi - tion from a less-autonomous role to a seemingly autonomous one that requires a lot of critical thinking and collabora - tive skills. Also, I think being a nurse makes one gravitate toward a focus on immediate outcomes\u2014it is gratifying to see the results of care provided to patients as they transition through the levels of care to full recovery. Whereas in infection prevention, the impact of the work we do is often indirect and may not be immediate. Reconciling myself to this difference was a bit of a challenge. It took me some time to cultivate a mindset that sees beyond a single entity. I had to learn to appreciate and understand that infection preven - tion is about developing and influenc - ing system changes that promote safety across many settings. What has helped you most as you have progressed in your role as an IP? My educational foundation in infection prevention and control (IPC) through my MSN has been instrumental in my IP role. I also draw strength from my innate curiosity. I am always aching to find the \"why\" in every situation. I think this was also inculcated in me from nursing, which requires that you have a rationale for every action. Having resources and access to a network of support was pivotal. My organization supports training for new IPs. I had the opportunity to attend a two-part IP training program through the Statewide Program for Infection Control and Epidemiology (SPICE). I was especially grateful to attend the APIC Annual Conference as a new IP. The opportunity to meet and learn from a wide variety of experts in the field not only validated my knowledge and percep - tions but also brought to light unique challenges across the different care set - tings. I continue to draw inspiration from the conference experiences where I have benefited from both new knowledge and a strong network of experts.How has your background helped you in the IPC profession? As a nurse, I have been fortunate to work in various healthcare settings. That knowledge and experience has been instrumental in my understanding of infection prevention concepts across the continuum of care. I do not take lightly the need to ensure practice standards are implemented across all settings because in the world of healthcare infections, a lapse in one area will directly penetrate all other settings due to the movement of patients. This coupled with my foun - dational education in IPC strengthened my understanding and appreciation of the profession. It has helped me think beyond the immediate impact, beyond the here and now. Why is obtaining (or maintaining) the CIC\u00ae credential important to you? Passing the CIC was the validation I needed to boost confidence in my profi - ciency. I had learned a lot both in school and on the job, but I couldn't quantify my competence. The CIC demonstrates my proficiency and serves as assurance about my competence for the people who rely on my expertise. I made obtaining the CIC a personal goal because it was important that I test my knowledge and understanding of prevention concepts and strategies and fill any identified gaps. Preparations for the CIC exam gave me the opportunity to learn concepts and areas of IPC that I normally would not have encountered through my day-to-day work. Maintaining the CIC is equally impor - tant because IPC is ever-evolving, and as new knowledge and challenges emerge, we need to remain up to date with evidence-based practices and standards of care. What is the best advice you ever received? The best career advice I ever got was from a college professor. I used to hesitate to ask questions that challenge ideas. So, when the professor wrote on my term paper, \"Don't suppress your curiosity; that will limit you,\" I didn't fully understand what she meant, but I knew she had a point. Speaking with her was probably the beginning of a shift in my academic journey. I have transmitted and continue to employ that philosophy in my pro - fessional career. Allowing my curiosity to flourish has led to great outcomes, especially in my IP role. I am motivated by what I don't know and what I don't understand. My daily goal is to learn something new. What advice do you have for others who are new to the field or considering the field of IPC? Follow the evidence, and where there is none, seek and create. This is the first lesson I learned on the job, and it has been my guiding principle. While our professional role is complex and we often deal with situations that don't lead to a straight answer, we have the science to lean on. Our standards and practices need to be evidence based. This means staying current about the state of the science. Thankfully, as a professional organiza - tion, APIC publishes evidence-based pub - lications to keep us current and informed. Our roles as IPs mirror the multifac - eted complexity of healthcare in general. Healthcare continues to undergo para - digm shifts; for instance, services pro - vided in ambulatory settings continue to expand. With these new approaches and expansions come new risk factors that we need to mitigate. We also are faced with new, emerging, and re-emerging patho - gens that are proving to be increasingly dangerous and difficult to control, such as multidrug-resistant organisms and novel viruses. There is increasing need to stay current, to anticipate and navigate new and emerging risks associated with tech - nological advancements in healthcare. Standard, evidence-based interventions are critical. Always seek and follow the evidence. \"Allowing my curiosity to flourish has led to great outcomes, especially in my IP role.\"18 | SPRING 2020 | Prevention CONSULTANT CORNER Tell us about yourself and your experience with water management programming. I've been a board-certified infection preventionist (IP) since the 1980s, served as APIC president in 2012, and am currently a member of the APIC Program of Distinction team. Back in 1999, when I was a main contributor to Michael Osterholm's infection control internet resource, icanPREVENT, I was the lead author of various healthcare-associated infection (HAI) topics, including pneumonia. Our content was peer-reviewed by well-known infectious disease experts such as William Jarvis, Trish Perl, Loreen Herwaldt, and Glen Mayhall. Fast-forward 10 years\u2014I have gained personal experience with waterborne-pathogen outbreaks at hospitals where I have worked. I am an author, IP, and APIC consultant, and I've provided expert content review of pneumonia and water man - agement publications for the APIC Text, APIC Implementation Guides, and the International Federation of Infection Control's Basic Concepts educational resources. What are the HAI risks of water to patients, generally speaking? Water-associated outbreaks from plumbing, water reservoirs, and medical products pose several significant risks to hospi - talized, long-term care, and immunocompromised patients. Sterilizers, chemical disinfectants, and endoscope washer dis - infectors all need proper water quality to function effectively and prevent various HAIs. Hemodialysis units require special water treatment processes to purify the water, with routine microbiological and endotoxin testing to ensure that the water is safe, to prevent adverse patient outcomes. Likewise, the water systems for potable and nonpotable water need to be maintained properly to limit opportunistic waterborne pathogens. In terms of HAIs overall, 76% of people with Legionnaires' disease acquired their infection from a healthcare exposure, with a 25% mortality rate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also note that the incidence is likely underreported because detection is based on diagnostic tests that are not readily utilized (urine antigen tests rather than respiratory cultures). Overall, Legionella infection has increased almost 300% in recent years.1Aside from Legionella , are there other waterborne pathogens addressed in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements2 for reducing the risk in healthcare facility water systems? Yes. Legionella is not the only opportunistic water-associated pathogen of concern. fungi can grow and spread in water systems. What patients are at risk for infections associated with waterborne pathogens? Immunocompromised patients at high risk of waterborne infections include those in bone marrow and organ transplant units, oncology units, intensive care units, burn units, dialysis units, skilled nursing or long-term care facilities, and long-term acute care hospitals. Patients seen in any clinical treatment or support service area using water are also at risk. Designing a water management program (WMP) seems so overwhelming. Where does a facility even begin? CDC has an excellent toolkit, \"Developing a Water Management Program to Redu ce Legionella Growth and Spread in Buildings,\"3 which gives practical tips for implementing the 2015 American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 1884 for minimizing the risk of Legionnaires' disease. Do you think that IPs are well versed in water-associated infections and the WMP? I've observed that some facilities believe they need to con - duct routine water cultures to meet the intent of the CMS requirements for their WMP. At this time, neither CMS nor ASHRAE mandates water cultures. CDC recommends water cultures in facilities with transplant centers, or if a case of healthcare-associated Legionella infection or other water-associated opportunistic outbreak is identified. CDC also suggests if the temperature and chemical disinfectant parameters What you need to know about water management programs A CONVERSATION WITH MICHELLE FARBER, RN, CICwww.apic.org | 19 are not maintained, environmental testing may be warranted. Of course, facilities may choose to validate the effectiveness of their WMP with periodic cultures or heterotrophic plate counts, or such testing may be mandated by state or local regulations. I have also seen WMPs with inappropriate thresholds for Legionella. According to CDC, any positive Legionella test result, regardless of the concentration, warrants an active response due to the difficulties in quantifying Legionella and the absence of a correlation between concentration and human disease. Another concern I have is when water contamination or an environmental source is not investigated during clusters of waterborne-pathogen infections, especially in ventilated or postoperative patients. What is the most important part of a successful WMP? Every facility is different. One WMP doesn't fit all. Water management is highly localized. You can't borrow someone else's WMP or water infection control risk assessment (WICRA). IPs and the WMP team must assess each facility's risks, taking into consideration the unique patient populations and all local factors specific to the facility's water systems. The most important component is a tailored WICRA for your healthcare organization. For example, you need a very comprehensive WMP if you have a transplant unit, have had a historical problem with a waterborne pathogen, or have plumb - ing system issues. What do facilities often miss when it comes to WMPs? In my experience, facilities overlook the need to monitor water temperatures, pH levels, and chemical concentrations following water disruptions from either construction or water system maintenance. Construction and changes in water pressure dislodge biofilm and can release Legionella into the water. I've also seen some facilities that do not implement corrective action plans following positive water culture results. There is no known safe level of Legionella in healthcare water systems; reports of Legionnaires' disease have been associated with very low levels of the pathogen in water. If your WMP incorporates routine environmental sampling, you must decide how and when to respond when waterborne pathogens are found in your water systems. Often, adjusting temperature levels or flushing pipes may be effective in eliminating pathogens. Are there any upcoming water management guidelines or changes in the industry? A good development on this front is that CDC recently added to their available toolkits and published a sampling procedure and potential sampling site protocol.5 The protocol gives sug - gestions on where and how to collect environmental samples for Legionella during a cluster or outbreak investigation or when there are persistently positive samples. Additional water monitoring guidance, WICRA worksheet examples, and other practical tools are planned additions to the CDC website. On the regulatory front, ASHRAE is lobbying for ANSI/ ASHRAE Standard 188 be adopted into federal or state laws. Currently, only the Veterans Health Administration and a few states (e.g., New York) and local municipalities mandate a water culturing program. The CMS memorandum cites that facilities should consider the 2015 ASHRAE industry standard and CDC toolkit for their WMP. An updated standard, ANSI/ASHRAE 188-2018, is now available,6 but CDC has not updated the toolkit to reflect it. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) pub - lished their Legionella guideline in 2015;7 unlike ASHRAE 188, it provides recommendations on the frequency to test concentrations and provides interpretive guidance for Legionella concentrations. However, it is not cited in the CMS memo - randum or CDC toolkit. AIHA anticipates releasing a new guideline in 2020. To mitigate any legal or regulatory risks, facilities should document which references were used in the development of their WMP policy and procedures. The WMP should include responsible departments; document all maintenance logs, envi - ronmental monitors, response actions, and emergency dis - infection plans; and follow all manufacturer's instructions for use. Appropriate disciplines should report all findings to leadership, safety, and infection prevention and control com - mittees, and consult CDC or the local public health authority if Legionella infections or other outbreaks of opportunistic water-associated infections are detected, as defined in state regulations. Remember, the WMP must be continually reviewed and revised with the WMP team as warranted.

I was a graduate student in public health and epidemiology and had applied for an internship in something called \"infec - tion control and prevention.\" I had no idea what it was beyond what I could find on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and APIC websites. I walked into the hospital that first day a ball of nerves, hoping I looked confident, and hit the ground running. I had great trainers and mentors who coached and supported me as I learned the role and the clinical skills I would need. But sooner, rather than later, I was on my own. My lifeline was this short, squat, brick of a book that seemed to contain the answers to all my questions. That book was my first copy of the APIC Text. I carried it around for ages\u2014highlighted, covered in Post-its to mark my most frequently accessed pages, and with the spine held together with layers of tape. The APIC Text has come a long way since that print edition. Now exclusively available online at text.apic.org , it's key - word-searchable, easily portable (no more 50-pound book to haul around!), and regu - larly updated to reflect changes in the field. While its look and feel have changed quite a bit, what's been constant is the APIC Text's value to me over the course of my career. I have used it to prepare for certification, to answer questions when issues arose at my facility, and to expand my knowledge and guide my practice. And, to this day, I still keep my original copy in my office, as a reminder of how far we both have come. I am honored to be a part of the team developing the APIC Text Online today. Over the course of this year, we will be highlighting features and content from the APIC Text Online, how IPs use it, and plans for future improvements to better serve this community.

Assemblyperson Gunther was an ideal sponsor, as she has a background in infection prevention and was previously an APIC member. As is customary in the New York State Legislature, budget issues took up the first half of the legislative session. This left the second half of the legislative session for other policy priorities. It was during this time that the measure received a hearing in the Senate Health Committee, where it was passed by a voice vote. Shortly after the vote, the Healthcare Association of New York State (HANYS), one of the two hospital associations in the state, started to circulate a memo of oppo - sition stating the measure could cause a labor shortage in small and rural facilities. Unfortunately, this memo overlooked language in the bill to specifically protect rural and small facilities from the poten - tial of a tightening labor pool. However, the memo caused enough concerns in the waning days of the 2017-2018 session that it paused the progress of the legislation and effectively killed the bill until the next year. In an effort to address HANYS's con - cerns prior to the 2019-2020 session, APIC participated in a conference call to discuss the rural exemption in the bill and the evidence supporting certification. APIC stakeholders on the call highlighted that HANYS drafted the rural/small hos - pital language used in the measure when certification legislation was considered for sterile processors and surgical technicians. Unfortunately, communication between HANYS and APIC nearly ceased after this conversation and throughout the 2019 legislative session. SEAN PAVONE/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM AS PART OF ITS EFFORT to promote greater adoption of a standardized infection prevention and control credential, APIC launched its \"Certification: The Defining Difference Campaign\" in 2018. The focus of this campaign is to work with state legis - latures and regulators to implement policies that require new infection preventionists (IPs) practicing in an acute care hospital to be certified within three years of hire. The campaign started in New York and has grown to include efforts in California and Illinois. This article provides an update on where the campaign stands and where it hopes to go in the future. New York In 2018, APIC's certification legisla - tion was introduced in the New York State Legislature. Measures were intro - duced in both the Assembly and Senate with bipartisan support that included www.apic.org | 23 The 2019-2020 legislative session brought in Democratic majorities in both the Assembly and Senate. To match the new political environment, APIC tar - geted a new Senate sponsor for the bill, Jen Metzger. The Assembly sponsor, Aileen Gunther, remained dedicated to this effort and continued to sponsor the measure. APIC's certification bill made great strides after budget conversations con - cluded. However, after the bill received favorable recommendations from both the Assembly and Senate Health Committees, HANYS circulated another memo of opposition. This memo was even more flagrant, claiming certifica - tion was not required because much of the role of an IP is duplicative with other healthcare professions. The memo showed a lack of understanding of the IP's role and the entire field of infec - tion prevention and control. To rebut this information, APIC sent memos to legislators discrediting the HANYS arguments and supporting the measure. Despite the HANYS memo, the bill suc - cessfully passed the Assembly. However, the memo caused some concerns in the Senate and stopped the bill from receiv - ing a vote before the chamber recessed. APIC and HANYS met again in fall 2019 to try to work out their differences. Now, the measure is being considered in the legislature again this year. California In early 2019, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) hosted a meeting with stakeholders regarding an \"All-Facilities Letter\" to dis - cuss general acute care hospital infection control and physical plant regulations. As a follow-up to that meeting, CDPH sent out a list of questions regarding infection control programs in hospitals. The letter not only asked a number of questions about infection control but also asked about the role certification plays for an IP. With the help of the California APIC Coordinating Council (CACC) and key California members, APIC was able to respond to CDPH and highlight the important role certification plays in protecting patients. Members interested in reviewing these comments can find them at http://cqrcengage.com/apic/state . Next Steps APIC expanded its certification cam - paign during the 2020 legislative session to a second state\u2014Illinois. To begin this effort, APIC assembled a task force of leaders in the state to help orchestrate this campaign. In addition, APIC staff began the process of introducing the cer - tification campaign to Illinois members. After working with an in-state lobbyist, legislation was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly. APIC Member Support A major part of the certification effort is the grassroots support of APIC mem - bers. APIC members in New York con - tacted more than 60 legislative offices through a variety of means, including phone calls, emails, face-to-face meet - ings in Albany, and a new program where APIC members met their legislators in their district offices. CACC and members of the Illinois task force have also been the backbone of efforts in those states and continue to be champions of certification.

LEGISLATIVE SPECIFICS To be employed by a hospital, an IP would be required to successfully pass an exam from a nationally accredited infection pre - vention and epidemiology accrediting organization such as the Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.; or provide evidence that he/she was employed or otherwise contracted as an IP in a healthcare facility for a cumulative period of one year, within the last four years prior to passage of the bill; or be a student or intern performing the functions of an IP serving under direct supervision of an IP. An IP not meeting certification requirements will have three years from the date of hire to obtain an infection prevention and control credential. A healthcare facility may employ or con - tract with an IP who does not meet the certification requirements if the facility is unable to hire a certified infection preventionist after a diligent and thorough search; or an IP earns his/her certification within three years of the start of employment.\"While the legislature ended their spring 2019 session before a vote on the bill could be brought to the full legislature, I had the opportunity to meet with my local state senator, Anna Kaplan, in her district office near my home. I was able to share with her and her chief of staff how beneficial IP certification is in help - ing assure healthcare safety and quality. I was able to address her con - cerns about the impact the proposed legislation would have on smaller, rural hospitals. I remain hopeful that this bill will pass the state leg - islature in the coming months and become law in my state\u2014and that New York will become a bellwether state for the rest of the nation in this regard.\" \u2014Steven Bock, RN, CIC, FAPIC MICHAEL WARWICK/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM24 | SPRING 2020 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONFocus on long-term care and behavioral health outbreaks Identify the pathogen! Hospital outbreaks are reported more often in the medical literature than occurrences in the long-term care (LTC) or behavioral health setting. By studying and learning from outbreaks in the LTC/behavioral health setting, infection preventionists (IPs) can glean addi - tional knowledge and apply this information to hopefully prevent future infections and infection clusters in their facilities. This quarterly column helps the IP heighten awareness of appropriate interventions to prevent outbreaks.BY STEVEN SCHWEON, RN, MPH, MSN, CIC, FSHEA, FAPIC TATIANA SHEPELEVA/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMBased on your knowledge of potential cause of a maculopapular rash with vesicles in an adult community setting, you suspect the outbreak is due to:a. Hepatitis C virus b. HIV c. Widespread allergic reaction to an unknown environmental agent d. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) Chart review and discussions with the facility medical staff led to identifying 11 residents with a varicella rash onset from November 1, 2008, through February 1, 2009\u2014an attack rate of 16%. Fever was present in 90% of the cases. Five residents had more than 50 lesions, and one had more than 500 lesions.1 Serum samples were tested for the presence of VZV immunoglobulin M (IgM), indicat - ing acute infection, and immunoglobulin G (IgG), indicating immunity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to test skin lesions for VZV DNA. VZV testing for an environmental presence was also performed, and it was detected several months after the rash onset; of note, its presence did not indi - cate a viable, communicable virus.1 Three residents had laboratory varicella confirmation. A 28-year-old facility nurse and a 33-year-old caregiver also developed rashes. Neither of these individuals had a history of varicella infection or vaccination. Interestingly, the roommate of the first vari - cella case developed a localized vesicular rash on his arm. This individual had a docu - mented history of varicella disease and a discomfort were associated with the rash. As part of their plan of care, the residents traveled to off-site day programing and interacted with each other at facility-wide social events, thus increasing the exposure risk to others.Leung and coauthors described a health department investiga - tion of an outbreak in a residential facility housing adults with intellectual disabilities.1 There were about 145 staff members (nursing, direct care attendants, physical and occupational therapists, a psychologist, cleaning staff, and clerical staff) and 70 residents at risk. The residents presented with a generalized maculopapular rash, with both flat and raised skin lesions. Some residents had vesicles (fluid-filled cysts), while others did not. The case patients ranged in age from 32 to 49 years, with 91% having profound intellectual disability, requiring staff physical assistance for care. Because of the residents' severe intellectual impairment, it was difficult to determine if pain or www.apic.org | 25 positive VZV IgG antibody test. Hence, the skin lesions were thought to be fungal, not viral, and were not kept covered.1 VZV is a member of the Herpesviridae family. This contagious virus is responsible for varicella, or varicella zoster (chickenpox), and herpes zoster (shingles). \"chickenpox\" references the association of \"chicken\" with \"weakness.\" It was originally intended to distinguish the infection from the more severe smallpox.2 Zoster is Greek for \"girdle,\" and \"shingles\" is derived from the Latin word cingulus (belt).3 Classic chickenpox symptoms include an itchy rash with vesicles that evolve into scabs within one week.4 The rash may first appear on the chest, back, and face and then dis - seminates over the entire body, including the inside of the mouth, eyelids, and genital area. Individuals at risk for varicella zoster complications include infants, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. Chickenpox complications include bacterial skin infec - tions, pneumonia, encephalitis, hemorrhage, sepsis, and dehydration.5 After primary VZV infection, the virus becomes dormant in the dorsal root and cra - nial nerve ganglia. The virus can reactivate later in life and spread to the skin through peripheral nerves, resulting in herpes zoster, which is characterized by a unilateral rash in a dermatomal distribution. During the shingles prodromal stage, pain, itching, or tingling may occur several days before the rash appears.6 An estimated 1 million people, including children, will develop shingles annually, with one out of every three indi - viduals developing shingles in their lifetime.7 Persons infected with the VZV can trans - mit the virus through the air to susceptible individuals who have never had the disease or never have been vaccinated. 8 Ill persons are infectious one to two days before the rash onset until all the skin lesions have crusted (scabbed). The incubation period is from 10 to 21 days after exposure.8 Varicella vaccination is the optimal approach to prevent infection; since the immunization program began in the United States, chickenpox cases, hospi - talizations, and mortality have declined by more than 90%. 9 If a vaccinated individual develops chickenpox, the symptoms are mild, with few or no blisters and, some - times, a mild fever. Treatment is focused on relieving the itch - ing and scratching. Acyclovir, an antiviral medication, should be optimally started at the onset of symptoms. Varicella is reported through the state or local health department to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDS).10 Shingles is not a reportable condition. Airborne, Contact, and Standard Precautions are used when caring for patients with varicella zoster.11 Standard Precautions are used when caring for an individual with shingles who has an intact immune system if the skin lesions that can be contained and covered.11 Airborne and Contact Precautions are implemented in any patient with dissemi - nated shingles disease,11 which is defined as a widespread rash affecting three or more dermatomes.12 Persons who never had chickenpox or received the varicella vaccine are at risk for varicella infection from patients with shingles if they come into close contact with vesicle fluid.13 Most individuals will develop one shingles episode during their lifetime, with additional infection episodes possible. Risk factors for shingles include cancer, HIV infection, and use of immunosuppressive medications such as steroids. Airborne isolation could not be imple - mented at this residential facility. The residents lived in apartments in three build - ings. Each apartment had three bedrooms, with two beds in each bedroom. The case patients could not be left alone in their rooms because they needed 24-hour supervision for their safety. Additionally, the residents did not have the capability to follow basic infec - tion control practices. At the time of the outbreak, it was presumed that being born before 1980 was sufficient evi - dence of varicella immunity. However, all of the cases at this facility involved patients born prior to 1980. As a result of this outbreak, it was concluded that this birthyear-based assumption does not to apply to individuals living in residential facilities; the Connecticut Department of Developmental Services no longer uses birthyear-based criteria in evaluat - ing immunity.1 Steven Schweon, RN, MPH, MSN, CIC, FSHEA, FAPIC, is an infection prevention consultant with a specialized interest in acute care/long-term care/ behavioral health/ambulatory care infection preven - tion challenges, including outbreaks.

TAKE-HOME MESSAGES The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that healthcare personnel who do not have serological immunity receive two doses of the varicella vaccine, four weeks apart.14 It might be helpful to ensure that all employees have immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases at the time of hire. CDC has published specific recommendations for healthcare personnel who have been exposed to varicella or shingles.15 CDC also has specific varicella and zoster recommendations for chil - dren/adolescents16 and adults.17 Consider performing a gap analysis to identify your facility's current practice versus the CDC recommendations. Consider developing an outbreak policy and procedure as a standing reference, including the need to notify the local health department and facility administrator of an outbreak. CDC has a varicella surveillance worksheet that may be helpful during an outbreak. 18 When possible, obtaining a diagnosis for any resident with a rash would be ideal to minimize the risk of varicella transmission. Additional prevention strategies include keeping the rash covered (e.g., with dressing or clothing) and educating the symptomatic resident to avoid touching and scratching the rash and to wash hands frequently.26 | SPRING 2020 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTION microbial surveillance testing MADE EAS Y NOW!

The surveyor also asked the IP questions about the service agreement. Was the IP aware of the quality metrics established in this agreement? Was the cleaning service meeting them? Clearly, the surveyor expected that the IP would have access to this information and understand its finer points. However, the IP had never been included in assess - ing the hospital's cleaning service practices, policies, compliance, or training programs. In this article, we share lessons we learned. We hope that our insights help you incor - porate a cleaning surveillance program into an infection prevention program plan and scope of service, so that you may avoid a similar predicament. ASSESSING YOUR CLEANING SERVICE What steps should you take to assess your cleaning service and be prepared for surveys? A good starting point is to request access to the cleaning service's employee train - ing program. Look for the cleaning model the company uses. Surveyors may request records showing that employees received and completed training. Lack of documentation may result in a citation. Validate the cleaning service's performance by incorporating random \"patient-ready Welcome to the fifth installment of the Accreditation Focus series, which presents columns discussing recurring infection prevention and control (IPC) challenges during accreditation surveys. Each installment provides ideas, tips, and guidance on common IPC challenges and how to address them . You all are familiar with the scenario where a surveyor arrives unannounced in your facility. Some time passes while the surveyor conducts their business. Then, you get the dreaded call asking to meet in the boardroom, and the questioning begins.

COURTESY OF KELLEE NECAISE.www.apic.org | 29 room auditing\" into your surveillance program: Randomly select rooms that are sup - posed to be ready for patient admission and assess them with a cleaning checklist. Select a set number of rooms per session to review based on availability. Have a plan for how to manage a room that has deficiencies. We found it best to have the entire room pulled from service until it was recleaned. Once you have gathered your audit data, share identified opportunities with house - keeping leadership, noting areas frequently missed or forgotten as areas for focus with staff. Arrange to observe the actual cleaning of a patient room from start to finish, just as the surveyor would, and monitor for any breaches in protocol or recontamination. Share your findings with the environmental services (EVS) management team. Compare your findings with what they have found while conducting their own audits. If EVS does not audit cleaning, they may want to consider joining you. Monitor the turnaround time for clean - ing patient rooms, and compare it with the national benchmarks for thorough and appro - priate cleaning. Staff should be given adequate time to follow the dwell times of the products they are using and allow for complete dry time and set up. Shortening the process can create and perpetuate an unclean environ - ment. Verifying that staff are aware of the dwell times is equally as important, as this could be the root of environmental problems. Maintain a collaborative working relation - ship with the EVS team. Conduct rounds together, and use this opportunity as an educational moment. Make the rounds relatable and easily understandable for how important a thorough cleaning is for each and every area. Make sure the EVS team sees what you are seeing\u2014don't just tell them that you found deficiencies. This way, the information can be taken back to their staff for education and reinforcement, and EVS team members will feel like they are part of the solution. Invite your senior leadership to accompany you on audit rounds. This is invaluable, as they can see what you see, at the same time and in the same place. An extra set of eyes is always appreciated, and their personal observations will help leaders to validate your concerns, motivating them to help support corrective actions. CHOOSING A NEW CLEANING SERVICE When your organization is selecting a new cleaning service, read the service agreement, if possible. Take a good look at what the company promises regarding (a) the items to be cleaned, which are usu - ally defined by area, and (b) the schedule (how often items will be cleaned). How many times have surveyors asked you about curtain changes and cleaning, or how often the workstations on wheels get cleaned and who is responsible? In the world of contracted service partner - ships, it is important to fully understand the scope of the cleaning. Often, the agreement will include a defined list of items and areas, along with well-defined criteria for the fre - quency of cleaning. The service agreement does not always include the wiping-down of blinds or require a schedule for cleaning trash receptacles. These may seem like details of minor importance, but they could quickly become part of a domino effect. You may have to ask for, or work toward creating, a special project list that will address all addi - tional areas of concern. The quality metrics should be shared with the infection control committee when a new cleaning service company is selected, and the EVS management team should report at every meeting the company's compliance rates. A rate for compliance with tools like ATP or DAZO should be set. The param - eters followed for an inpatient room versus a sterile area should be clearly defined and shared with the IP. CONSIDERATIONS FOR CRITICAL AREAS Does your EVS team recognize or expect special certification or competency for staff who clean critical areas of the hospital, such as C-section suites or the sterile areas in operating rooms?Not every cleaning service company pro - vides this level of training, but training pro - grams specific to these areas exist and should ideally be incorporated into the cleaning program. Staff working in high-risk areas should be well versed on additional steps such as scrub changes and damp-dusting before the first case of the day. THE BOTTOM LINE You don't know what you don't know. Do not assume that the cleaning process the hos - pital is paying for is the service you are actu - ally receiving. Be proactive and create your own plan for monitoring, collaborating, and sharing. Yes, this work adds to the load the IP already carries\u2014but knowing that your hospi - tal is being cleaned to the established standards is extremely important. If you are not there yet, this is a worthwhile goal to set. Dennis Cunningham, MD, MHA, is a pediatric infectious diseases physician with experience in hos - pital epidemiology and infection control.

This report showed that an estimated 22% of Medicare beneficiaries experienced adverse events during their stays at skilled nursing facili - ties. An additional 11% had temporary harm events.3 The OIG report noted that 59% of the events were clearly or likely preventable. Preventable causes included substandard treatment, inadequate resident monitor - ing, and failure or delay of necessary care. Twenty-six percent of the events were caused by infections, including pneumonia and respiratory tract infections, surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, and Clostridioides difficile infections.3 In 2015, CDC released the Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship for Nursing Homes, which are leadership commitment, accountability, drug expertise, action, track - ing, reporting, and education.4 A 2013 CDC prevalence survey pilot showed that 11.1% of all residents in nine nursing homes were receiving antibiotics. 5 The largest category of prescriptions were written for urinary tract infections, at 32%; however, only a smaller percentage of those patients met the Nearly 2.5 million U.S. patients are dis - charged to skilled nursing facilities each year, and the length of stay averages one month.1,2 \"These facts affect how we need to think about infection prevention and control in this setting,\" Rowe said. \"A lot of people think of nursing homes as places where residents with dementia need assistance with activities of daily living. But we are often doing much more. For exam - ple, in skilled nursing care, we're caring for wounds and PICC lines and other devices,\" Rowe said. She further noted that residents are also more likely to move between care settings, perhaps from an acute care hospital to a reha - bilitation facility, back to the hospital, and then home. \"There are a lot of transitions, which is one reason why we need to focus a lot more on infection control in long-term care,\" she said. NOTABLE DRIVERS OF INFECTION PREVENTION AND ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP Rowe outlined several drivers of infec - tion prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship in nursing homes over the past decade. Among them was Adverse Events in Skilled Nursing Facilities: National Incidence Changes in reimburse - ment and other health - care trends mean that post-acute-care facilities (particu - larly nursing homes) currently care for a much larger population of medically complex, high-acuity residents than in previous decades. With more medical complexity comes greater risk for infection, as well as an increased need for standardization in long-term care infection surveillance, prevention, and antibiotic stewardship, said Theresa A. Rowe, DO, MS, assis - tant professor of geriatric medi - cine at Northwestern University and a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during the APIC 2019 Annual Conference session \"Importance of Infection Surveillance in Long-term Care Facilities.\"Developing infection prevention programs in long-term care facilities BY MELANIE PADGETT POWERS ISTOCK.COM/CECILIE_ARCURSwww.apic.org | 31 surveillance criteria for antibiotic therapy, Rowe explained. Then, in November 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) final - ized new requirements for participation for nursing homes, which require facilities to implement an antibiotic stewardship program that includes antibiotic use protocols and a system to monitor antibiotic use.6 This is where the situation stands today, Rowe said. RECOGNIZING, DOCUMENTING, AND COMMUNICATING ABOUT PROBLEMS \"There are many opportunities to reduce morbidity and mortality in long-term care facilities, one of them being recognition of the problem,\" said Angela Anttila, PhD, MSN, NP-C, CIC, a nurse epidemiologist at CDC. Recognizing and documenting changes in clinical status is an important part of any infection prevention and surveillance pro - gram. Another opportunity is standardizing the way infections are defined and reported to allow facilities to better monitor the bur - den of the problem. Incomplete documenta - tion can lead to incomplete information and missed opportunities, Anttila said. Communication is important, includ - ing communication across care transitions. \"Residents are moving from facility to facility, but how well are we communicating across the continuum of care?\" she asked. \"To my knowledge, there's not an electronic health record vendor that's able to electronically capture resident level data across transitions of care, so that is definitely an opportunity we can look forward to in the future.\" Additionally, increased accountability for infection prevention is important. Facility practices to prevent infections should be monitored for adherence and impact. \"We can do that by implementing consistent methods for assessing the effectiveness of prevention activities and communication for action,\" Anttila said. SETTING UP A SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM Anttila outlined how to better recognize the problem of infections through surveil - lance. She pointed out, \"What gets measured gets done.\"Since surveillance can measure what is going on in a population, it is useful in determining the need for intervention as well as measuring the impact of interven - tions. \"Surveillance empowers us and our decision-makers with the evidence that we need to lead and sustain change,\" she explained. \"Because how do we fix a problem if we don't know what the problem is?\" It's critical that facilities collect data that will actually be used. Data that don't help us better understand the problem or situation can be a waste of resources, so it's important to report timely and valid data, Anttila said. \"If we get the data to the right people\u2014to the change makers, to the policy makers, to the administrators\u2014if you put information in front of them, it's more likely to motivate change,\" she said. It's important for facilities to identify the best surveillance process for their organiza - tion and resident population. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, she said. \"You need to intimately know your population to better understand what kind of surveillance process is going to work for you.\" Start with a risk assessment of your resi - dent population. \"This is what guides your entire surveillance program,\" Anttila said. \"You have to know what the risks are not only in your facility but also around your facility. You need to have a broad under - standing of what's coming into your facility.\" Facilities need to assess the most common infections in their facilities and determine which ones are causing the most harm. For example, does your facility have a process to identify why an employee calls in sick and if it's related to an infection in your facility? Then, select both your outcome measures and process methods. Be sure to choose the definitions that are right for your institution. And be sure you consistently use and apply those definitions. \"If you don't, you cannot truly compare your data from year to year.\" AVAILABLE DEFINITIONS The McGeer criteria are commonly used standardized definitions.7 These criteria are based on structured review of evidence and consensus opinion of experts, but the definitions are published without validation.

The overall goal of NHSN is to provide data to guide nursing home infection pre - vention efforts, and define national bench - marks for measuring improvements in long-term care. However, \"without data we can't develop benchmarks,\" Anttila said. Currently, only 21% of nursing homes par - ticipate in NHSN. CONCLUSION As efforts by post-acute-care facilities to reduce infections expand, there's an oppor - tunity to develop processes and collect good data to improve patient and resident safety.

Highlighting water management in your ICRA process BY LAURA RILEY, P hD, CIH Following the 2017 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) memo requiring hospitals, critical access hospitals, and long-term care facilities to write and implement a water management program, the topic of water has been thrust to the forefront of healthcare.1 Infection preventionists (IPs) are now expected to have knowledge about water systems as well as waterborne illness prevention and control. and the third-party contractor and goes over the infection risks involved in an upcom - ing construction project. Those risks often center on dust generation and control, and how the contractor plans to separate their workers and the work from patients. Potable-water-related work and follow-up is often not discussed at these meetings. In addition, only the general contractor rep - resentative is usually present at an ICRA meeting. Subcontractors, such as plumbers, are typically not in the room when infection control parameters are outlined for a given construction project. By adding a water component to the already-existing ICRA process, the hospital organization is able to lay out expectations for the water-related work involved in each construction project. Performing a WICRA is thus a proactive step to prevent waterborne illness by eliminating or controlling many of the common risk factors that can lead to inadequate water quality in the future. A HOSPITAL WICRA TEMPLATE Bryan Christensen, an industrial hygien - ist and epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases presented on the WICRA concept at the 2019 National American Industrial Hygiene Association Conference in VALKOINEN/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM Up to this point, the typical infection con - trol risk assessment (ICRA) template used by hospital organizations has not made much mention of potable-water-related construc - tion activities and the expectations involved. This article describes how one organiza - tion has begun integrating a \"water ICRA\" (WICRA) document into the normal ICRA process to bring awareness and acknowledg - ment of water risks during construction and highlights selected WICRA concerns. UNDERSTANDING THE NEED FOR WICRA In a typical ICRA, the IP meets with rep - resentatives of the hospital facilities team www.apic.org | 35 Minneapolis. After attending this meeting, Northside Hospital's industrial hygienist brought this idea back to her Atlanta-based organization, which consists of three cam - puses with approximately 1,200 beds total. Each hospital has its own water manage - ment plan and already performs routine water monitoring and surveillance. When we looked for tools for WICRA documenta - tion, we found them lacking and decided to create our own. The WICRA template presented here (Figure 1) was collaboratively designed, with input from our hospital's engineering depart - ment, a third-party plumbing contractor, and colleagues from the American Industrial Hygiene Association's Infection Prevention subcommittee. Using the template helps make the IP aware of the water-specific work involved in the project, and helps the contractor (and appropriate subcontractors) understand the hospital's expectations when the space is turned back over for patient occupancy. A secondary goal for the template is to not overburden ICRA participants with additional paperwork. The WICRA is set up as a flow dia - gram. The first question asks the contrac - tor whether there will be any water-related work, such as adding/removing fixtures, a water shutoff greater than eight hours, or fixtures out of service for extended periods. If the answer for this first question is no, no further action is required and all parties ini - tial the page and move on to the rest of the ICRA. If the answer is yes, the contractor must then specify the type of work. Based on the work (adding, removing, shutoff, or out of service), there is a list of items that the plumber must verify. All parties must initial this page of the ICRA to confirm acknowledgement of these expectations. ADDING FIXTURES OR WATER SOURCES Depending on the scope and scale of the project, a preoccupancy disinfection may be necessary when a new water loop or a large number of new fixtures is added. This disinfection should follow the requirements of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) standard AWWA C651 or AWWA 652, or regulations applicable to your orga - nization (i.e., state or local requirements).2If sinks are being added, it is important to make sure they will not have aerators attached. Aerators mix air from the room and water together to form a steady flow from the faucet, which is not recommended in a healthcare setting. If water splashing is an issue and a device must be installed, ensure that it is a laminar flow device instead of an aerator. Laminar flow devices do not use room air to form the steady stream of water.3 REMOVING FIXTURES When removing plumbing fixtures, it is critical not to create a dead leg in the process. A dead leg is a section of pipe that leads to a removed or unused water device, allowing the water to sit stagnant in that section all the way back to the main waterline. It is less expensive and less invasive for contractors to remove a fixture and cut/cap the pipe right where the fixture was located, rather than removing the entire section of unused pipe. However, this practice leads to the formation of a dead leg, which can feed biofilm into the main water line and contaminate the entire system. Therefore, when removing a water fixture, the unused pipe should be cut back to no more than 1.5-times the length of the pipe's diameter. 4 WATER SHUTOFF OR OUT-OF-SERVICE FIXTURES Biofilm in the pipes of a water system can be one of the leading risk factors for the growth and proliferation of hydrophilic microbes such as Legionella.5 Once biofilm has been established, it can serve as food for organisms and a habitat for growth. It is extremely difficult to eliminate biofilm once it is present in a water system, so prevention strategies are critical when it comes to this risk factor. Biofilm formation is frequently caused by stagnation in a water system; therefore, Figure 1. WICRA template developed by Laura Riley and colleagues.36 | SPRING 2020 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONMore than 1,000 attendees at APIC's 2019 Annual Conference in Philadelphia toured the inaugural APIC UBC Carpenters Hospital. Designed as a joint venture between APIC and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Union, an APIC Strategic Partner, the hospital debuted to rave reviews from IPs. BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND: APIC UBC CARPENTERS HOSPITAL SIMULATION WILL BE IN PHOENIX! This year's Annual Conference in Phoenix, Arizona, June 10-12, will again feature this hospital infection control risk assessment (ICRA) rounding for construction exhibit. Imagine walking through a simulated hospital corridor with multiple rooms\u2014each room represents a treatment or patient room under construction, renovation, or maintenance. Before you begin your journey, you receive a rounding checklist for each scenario. Both positive and negative protocols are demonstrated by UBC carpenters who are actively simulating construction and/or renovation in each room. Potential scenarios include an endoscopy room, emergency department, bone marrow trans - plant unit, sterile processing room, operating room, and water management. Each scenario is demonstrated two times\u2014both with and without appropriate infection control practices. You identify infractions in the simulated rooms, learn how minor maintenance issues impact infection prevention, and witness the tangible value of infection control during construction. This hospital showcases the positive impact IPs can have on the outcome of a construction or renovation project. Come join us at APIC 2020 and visit the hospital! having frequent, regular water flow in all fix - tures is of paramount importance. A specific flush-time standard has not been established, but five minutes after water runs clear is an agreed-upon recommendation for typical situations.5 To validate this amount of time for your specific facility, consider testing oxidant levels or microbiology before the project and then post flush. CONCLUSION Infection prevention departments should consider integrating a water component to their existing ICRA process to further high - light the importance of water health and safety. The WICRA presented here is by no means the only option, and the author encourages IPs to modify the template to best serve their specific organization. Laura Riley, PhD, is a Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) for Northside Hospital's infection prevention department in Atlanta, Georgia. She received both her MSPH and PhD in the discipline of indus - trial hygiene from the College of Public Health Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the University of South Florida. Laura has helped integrate industrial hygiene and envi - ronmental health into many programs and policies throughout the Northside system, including the fields of employee exposure assessments, indoor air quality, ventilation systems, water management, and construction infection control.

One invaluable tool is IP Talk , a real-time online community that allows IPs to communicate and problem-solve collec - tively. Whether you regularly participate in IP Talk or just skim the digest, we hope this article answers your questions about the platform's purpose, capabilities, and professional value. IP TALK'S ORIGIN STORY The first version of IP Talk was a tra - ditional email list, called APICList, initi - ated in the 1990s. From the start, APIC's goal was to deepen the online member engagement experience by producing a forum \"for the members, by the mem - bers.\" During the development phase, APIC's membership and IT staff sought input from APIC members, chapter lead - ers, and staff, all of whom served as beta testers prior to launching the platform to the membership at large. APICList allowed members to post and receive responses to their burning questions. During the early days, APICList had one moderator, who was responsible for reviewing, approving, and posting on the list. As the platform grew in popularity and the technology of social media in general became more sophisticated, APIC leaders realized this type of management could not maintain a viable resource for the dynamic APIC membership. Upgrades were in order. In 2011, the APIC platform transi - tioned from an email list to the current online community platform, MyAPIC. Today, MyAPIC houses IP Talk and 15 interest-based communities, all of which are exclusive to APIC membership. IP TALK TODAY As IP Talk has evolved from its humble origins, the platform has greatly expanded the ability of IPs at every level, from nov - ice to expert, to share ideas and chal - lenges. It also encourages learning outside of a formal classroom, webinar, or chapter meeting. For example, an IP who does not have access to a mentor or is working in a remote location with limited resources IP Talk: FOSTERING EXCELLENCE IN COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION ISTOCK.COM/IHOR KASHURIN BY PAULA PINTAR, BARBARA SMITH, JANET CONNER, AND ANGEL MUELLER TOP 10 IP TALK DISCUSSION TOPICS IN 2019 1.

The Professional Development Committee uses IP Talk to identify useful topics for \"quick reads\" in Prevention Strategist. The following are just a few of the con - versation threads your colleagues have started: Hello APIC Community. We are plan - ning to renovate an office space into a room for vaccine administration. We plan to rip up the carpet d/t [due to] infection control issues, but is anyone aware of Joint Commission or state regulation standards that would require a sink be added as well? I am IFC for a SNF [skilled nursing facility] and we just got a new admis - sion with metapneumovirus. They came in on droplet precaution. I have looked it up and there does not seem to be clear guidelines as to when these precautions may be discontinued. Any information or policies regarding this would be very much appreciated. Our equipment policy says: \"All shared direct patient care equipment should be cleaned with an appropriate approved product following the manufacturer's IFU [instructions for use] after each patient use, by the personnel using the device. Refer to equipment-specific manufacturer's IFU for additional guidelines.\" Does anyone have a user-friendly method for staff to locate an IFU for commonly shared equip - ment (e.g., glucometer, pulse oximeter, electronic thermometer, wheelchair/ transport cart)? WHO'S ONLINE? The authors of this article distributed a survey to a convenience sample of APIC members from their facilities and chap - ters to better understand APIC member habits in relation to IP Talk. Although the number of responses was small, the feedback was insightful and seems to reflect the intent of bringing APIC members together to share experiences and knowledge. On average, respondents access IP Talk slightly more than two times a week. They use the platform to review posts out of curiosity, as a learning opportunity, to check responses to posts of interest, and, less frequently, to post questions.Many of the respondents indicated that IP Talk identifies new references and areas for future development to enhance their own knowledge base. Respondents found the platform easy to navigate, and while some were relatively new to IP practice, most had the Certification in Infection Prevention and Control (CIC\u00ae) credential. Most respondents classified themselves as between \"becoming proficient\" and \"expert\" on the APIC Competency Model. According to APIC's 2019 Member Survey, IP Talk is a popular benefit. While usage decreases slightly as someone gains more infection prevention and control (IPC) experience, IP Talk is one of the most used benefits for IPs with less than three years of experience, second only to the American Journal of Infection Control . And, when respondents were segmented by primary practice setting, IP Talk was espe - cially popular with individuals working in critical access hospitals or behavioral health. BEING A GOOD CITIZEN ON IP TALK Civility and professionalism are impor - tant to the success of IP Talk. For that reason, APIC requires all who participate in IP Talk to follow the terms and condi - tions and indicate their acceptance of the Social Networking Policy ( https://com - munity.apic.org/codeofconduct ) prior to using IP Talk; APIC staff have the right to monitor, edit, or remove any posting that does not adhere to the policy. As defined by IP Talk Posting Rules and Etiquette, commercial messages and postings are prohibited. Commercialism might include referencing a product by name, brand, or service. To prevent this error when discussing products or ser - vices, it is preferable to use a narrative description in place of the product name. For example, you might describe a kind of wipe by its alcohol content or other technical specifications rather than nam - ing the specific brand. Information posted is available for all to see, and comments are subject to libel, slander, and antitrust laws. In addition, members who work as consultants are prohibited from using IP Talk as a plat - form to promote their services. The main objective to keep in mind is that messages should focus on adding to the body of knowledge for APIC members.LOOKING FORWARD IP Talk helps support competency domains and APIC's Competency Model ( https://apic.org/ professional-practice/infection- (Communication, Critical Thinking, Collaboration, Mentorship), Professional Stewardship (Accountability, Ethics, Advocacy), and Research (Implementation and Dissemination Science). The platform is an asset for all IPs looking to expand their knowledge and maintain evidence-based infection prevention standards. In sum, IP Talk is a great platform for IPs to: Think critically and consider different perspectives. Collaborate to solve problems and share valuable, just-in-time resources. Support IPs at different stages of their careers, across the continuum of care in diverse contexts and locations. The right resource or connection for an aspiring IP can make all the differ - ence in their career development and motivation to make being an IP their life's work.OTHER APIC ONLINE COMMUNITIES In addition to IP Talk, APIC offers the following online communities that support nuanced, specific IPC community of practice issues: Ambulatory Care Behavioral Health Corporate IP Critical Access Hospitals EMS/Public Safety Home Care Informatics International Long-Term Acute Care Long-Term Care Minority Health and Safety Oncology Pediatrics Public Health Veterans' Affairs40 | SPRING 2020 | Prevention Given the popularity of its online communities, APIC continues to moni - tor usage and community best practices to ensure that members enjoy a quality experience. APIC is committed to foster - ing the continued growth and evolution of IP Talk and the other communities to help IPs remain on the cutting edge of research and implementation science. Supporting each other ensures continued growth and development for each IP and strengthens the profession as a whole.

Despite the risks when HH is not done right, too many people, including healthcare personnel, do not follow best practices. To combat this complacency, a dedicated group of HH advocates gathered for a workshop prior to APIC's 2019 Applied Learning Conference in St. Louis, Missouri. The workshop, Beyond the Status Quo: Innovative Strategies and Emerging Issues for Addressing Long-Standing Problems in Hand Hygiene , was led by four experts: Elaine Larson , RN, PhD, CIC, FAAN, FAPIC, Anna C. Maxwell Professor Emerita and special lecturer, Columbia University, and scholar in residence, New York Academy of Medicine Connie Steed , MSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC, director Ethan Cumbler , MD, FACP, FHM, professor, University of Colorado School of Medicine, officer of the medical staff, University of Colorado Hospital, and director of quality, University of Colorado Department of Surgery In this article, Prevention Strategist dis- cusses key insights with the speakers and highlights some of the practical ideas that were generated during the highly interac - tive workshop.WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES YOU HAVE SEEN AS THE HH CHALLENGE HAS PERSISTED AND EVOLVED? Elaine: Believe it or not, when I started looking at HH as a clinician, very little had been published in the U.S. to answer basic questions, such as the following: What are the numbers and types of organisms on the hands of healthcare personnel? Is the hand flora influenced by where one works? If so, in what way? What is the impact of handwashing on microbial counts on hands? Does this vary by product? Do soaps change the normal flora? How does HH affect the skin? What is the relationship between HH among staff and patient risk of devel - oping an infection? How effective is the preoperative surgical scrub? My initial work in HH for about 10 to 15 years was to try to provide answers to these very basic questions. Hence, I focused on the microbiology and der - matology of the skin and the role of vari - ous products in changing the hand flora. I also spent considerable time assessing the data regarding the role of HH on reducing risk of infection\u2014looking at evidence for a causal relationship. Most of these questions have been addressed over the past decades. Granted, there is always more to know about the APIC/CADE MARTINwww.apic.org | 43 epidemiology and microbiology related to HH. For example, we still don't know exactly how much HH is \"enough.\" Some of these questions can be addressed with new methods for mathematical and sta - tistical modeling. We have learned that even if we had the best products in the world, and plenty of them are readily accessible, they are only effective if they are used. As a result, the landscape has changed to an emphasis on the social sciences because we need answers to important questions having to do with human behavior. How do we facilitate best practices and support staff to \"do the right thing\"? What are barriers and motivators to performing HH? Should interventions on behavior be targeted and specific for different groups? How do work setting and local and institu - tional climate and culture affect individ - ual HH behavior? To respond to these challenges, we need behavioral theory, human factors engineering, and systems engineering. WHAT AREAS NEED MORE ATTENTION? Elaine: First, applying advanced sta - tistical and modeling techniques, such as machine learning, to data to better predict and estimate the association between HH and risk of infections in various settings and among various hosts. Second, and most importantly, we need to apply the social sciences to better under - stand human behavior and the systems in which healthcare professionals work to maximize the potential for every indi - vidual (patients and staff) to recognize their important role as a team member to improve HH practice.WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR INFECTION PREVENTIONISTS (IP s) WHO WANT TO GET STARTED IN HH RESEARCH? Elaine: Find out what has already been done and build on that. Don't start from scratch. Review the literature thoroughly, talk to others who have experience, dis - cuss your concerns and ideas with others to get their feedback and ideas, get others interested and involved, and look for col - laborators. The best work is generally not done alone, and rigorous research takes time and resources\u2014so find a team! WHAT STOOD OUT FOR YOU FROM THE HH WORKSHOP LAST OCTOBER? Elaine: I thought that most IPs were totally burned out regarding HH and sick of the topic. Attendees at the workshop, however, came looking for ideas and solu - tions and ways that they could success - fully engage. One of the overall themes was a recognition that positive change is not going to happen in a week or a month, or even a year, because the focus needs to be on building a team culture that sup - ports patient-centered care and safety. If that is the culture, then attitudes such as \"blame and shame\" or \"pass the buck\" or \"it's everybody else's fault because I am fine\" will disappear. But that takes time. There is no magic bullet that will rapidly improve HH practice. I was invigorated by the positive attitudes, commitment, and action plans that emanated from the workshop. WHAT WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT TAKE-AWAYS FOR YOU FROM THE WORKSHOP IN ST. LOUIS? Connie: HH continues to be a chal - lenge. A multimodal approach is needed, with strategies and actions for improve - ment established by small, diverse, front - line unit teams and leaders. Unit culture varies, so localizing strategies to address the uniqueness of the location's culture and needs is imperative to improve our safety culture. We need to think outside the box. It is clear that doing things the same way will not improve HH. IPs need to lead and own HH improvement and move initiatives forward. This \"owning it\" includes championing new technology, improving current processes, and com - municating the expectation to the orga - nization that everyone is responsible, including for the return on investment. I heard during the workshop from several people that storytelling using real-life examples that focus on the importance of HH inspires frontline providers. We have found that a successful unit shar - ing their success with other units is effective. I have found that telling my organization's HH journey motivates others as it demonstrates that outcomes can improve. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR FACILITIES WANTING TO DEVELOP AN ELECTRONIC MONITORING PROGRAM? Connie: It's challenging to develop your own, so tap into a monitoring program that is already available on the market. To maximize success, take time to evaluate existing technology. Choose a company that provides what you need, such as group and individual compliance monitoring. E-monitoring programs on their own do not improve HH compliance. The use of the data to influence change and hold teams accountable is key. An effective rollout is important. I found that going small by using the technology in a few targeted units and getting the system established and then spreading its use was helpful. Provide a good orientation to the sys - tem chosen and how it works. Our data are available to users 24/7, and we encour - age frequent viewing and use of the data with frontline staff. We also have HH compliance rates on unit report cards, which are reviewed by leadership. The report cards hold units/departments responsible. If their HH rate goes down, they will be asked why, and an action plan is expected. \" THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IS GETTING CLINICIANS LIKE ME TO DO THE ONE THING THAT CONSISTENTLY HALTS THE SPREAD OF INFECTIONS: WASH OUR HANDS .\" \u2014Atul Gwande CONFERENCES VOICES: HAND HYGIENE CHALLENGES Getting people to realize that gloves are not a substitute for HH Anesthesia providers not believing in the necessity of the five HH moments Some believing that once they've gelled their hands, they don't need to do it again The difficulty of educating all staff on all shifts44 | SPRING 2020 | Prevention CAN YOU GIVE EXAMPLES OF COMMUNICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED? Connie: Data denial is the biggest challenge for us. No one wants to believe their compliance rates are low. We often have to address questions about the data. We need to ensure that new leaders get educated about the e-monitoring system and how they can access and use it. This also orients them and defrays data denial concerns. We still conduct direct obser - vation to understand why people aren't cleaning hands. Sometimes it is challeng - ing to communicate to a person that is being observed when they did a good or poor job of HH. We hand out \"Oops\" or \"Wow\" cards to people if it is not the right setting to have a conversation. The network of facilities in our system reviews and discusses data routinely and addresses concerns that arise at various locations. The hospitals learn what works and what doesn't from each other. WHAT DOES \"SUCCESS\" LOOK LIKE GIVEN COMMON HH CHALLENGES WITH COMPLIANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY? Connie: Everyone would love 100% HH compliance! As that is unlikely, we feel ongoing improvement is a success. Over the last seven years, we have statisti - cally improved HH in our organization. Each year we celebrate that, and look at what needs to improve. WHAT INSIGHTS CAN YOU SHARE FROM YOUR RESEARCH EVALUATING HH PRODUCTS? Tim: One of the things that impresses me is the research, science, and market testing that go into product development. From alcohol-based hand rubs and dis - penser designs to integrated monitoring systems, products have evolved remark - ably over the past decade.When I talk about my work with non-IP colleagues or people in the pub - lic, they often have the impression that HH is \"simple.\" It only takes a few sec - onds of me talking about what underlies HH programs\u2014intrinsic and extrinsic motivation; versus inactive ingredients; or mechanism of action\u2014for non-IPs to realize that the topic is really complex. This makes me think that HH remains the underappreciated champion of infec - tion prevention and patient safety. To increase attention on HH programs, we need to do a better job communicating new findings and talk more about quality and applied behavioral and organizational change. WHAT ADDITIONAL TYPES OF RESEARCH ARE NEEDED? Tim: Since we know that most infec - tions originate from bacteria that are in or on the patient's skin, engaging patients in their own HH is a critical area. Further research needs to be done on messag - ing, product suitability, and the impact of patient HH programs on outcomes. The idea of dispensed volume based on user characteristics\u2014hand size, required dry time, and product formulation\u2014is an area that can help deliver products that are effective and well tolerated. We also need, as a discipline, more effective reporting of HH compliance data. It may be that reporting unit-level data impacts reported compliance rates, but that individual feedback is most effec - tive at motivating individual HH behav - ior. There has been a lot of attention on electronic and technology-based monitor - ing. Often, these occur at the room door, but I think it could be more impactful to develop strategies to provide monitoring data at the most critical moments during patient care. Integrating monitoring and feedback on HH technique is another opportunity. WHAT CAN THE PROFESSION DO TO IMPROVE HH TRAINING AND OUTCOMES? Tim: We absolutely need to do a better job selling infection prevention and con - trol (IPC) as an exciting discipline that makes a critical impact on patients and \" THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TO BE EFFECTIVE IS TO APPROACH THE ISSUE AS A TEAM. WHILE THE ACT OF HAND HYGIENE IS TAKEN BY INDIVIDUALS, THE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE REFLECTS THE CULTURE OF SAFETY THAT FORMS THROUGH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE.\" \u2014Ethan Cumbler, MD, FACP, FHM CONFERENCE VOICES: COOL IDEAS Foster friendly competition between units for positive outcomes. Do multidisciplinary team rounding (including with the C-suite at times). Give them a Lifesaver candy for positive reinforcement when you see model behavior. Make a personal, human connection through good teaching stories. Engage staff with huddles, visual boards, town halls, and Safety Fridays. Codesign policies and procedures. Have low-performing staff/units take a turn teaching the critical action to really learn it. Identify champions; give others a chance to lead groups/meetings and promote change.

Describing the breadth and depth of knowledge and skills that an IP needs on a daily basis can motivate younger professionals from a variety of professions to focus on IPC as a career path. We should promote it as a challenging, rewarding, impactful career path with lots of opportunities both now and in the future. We should make being an IP sexy, hip, and cool, or, as my younger students might say these days, we need to make it the profession with \"swag that slaps!\" WHAT STOOD OUT THE MOST FOR YOU FROM THE WORKSHOP IN ST. LOUIS? Tim: HH remains a challenge and an exciting opportunity to improve patient safety. I was really impressed at the sys - tematic and thoughtful ways that our fel - low IPs were evaluating barriers and gaps in practice, trying to motivate behavior change, and looking to improve HH. At the workshop, there were so many sugges - tions that people had tried that we could have written an encyclopedia! I hope we can find more ways to share our experi - ences, what has worked, and what we still find challenging. WHAT LED YOU TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT HH OUTCOMES? Ethan: All physicians are passionate about their patients having good out - comes and uncomplicated recoveries. What made HH attractive to me as a hospital medical director was that we already had all the tools needed to make a difference. We just needed to find a way to implement them effectively together. One of the things that makes preventing iatrogenic infections so compelling is that it is something we can take on as an orga - nization, at the level of a program, unit, or clinic\u2014or even simply as a personal commitment. Leadership can come from any level of the organization. HH is an example of individual behav - ior that profoundly impacts the health of our entire population of patients when performed collectively. From a quality improvement perspective, we can influ - ence this behavior by the systems we put in place to remove barriers, reinforce behavior, and provide feedback. The most impor - tant thing we can do to be effective is to approach the issue as a team. While the act of HH is taken by individuals the organi - zational performance reflects the culture of safety that forms through the interactions between people. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR PHYSICIANS AND IPS WHO WANT TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON HH OUTCOMES? Ethan : One of the critical things doc - tors and infection control professionals need to do is share data. Physicians are incredibly competitive and have a strong drive to excel. Given reliable and valid data showing a gap between current performance and the goal, it is human nature to want to improve. Seeing that another group is doing better harnesses an intrinsic driver for improvement. It is not enough for the infection control arm of the healthcare system to see HH performance data. We need to share this information with leaders within indi - vidual clinical microsystems, and even with individual doctors. At the same time, I think we underap - preciate the power of story to convey the reasoning behind our efforts to improve HH. Seeing the adherence percentages is one thing. Hearing a story of how preventable infection affected a patient is another. The two paired together is immensely powerful.WHY DO YOU FOCUS ON EMERGENCE AS A KEY CONCEPT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITY OF HH BEHAVIOR? Ethan: Emergence is the phenomena of novel and coherent structures, patterns, and properties arising during the process of self-organization in complex systems. It can be observed everywhere, from the pat - terns of spiral galaxies across space to the motions of a flock of starlings in flight, to traffic gridlock at rush hour. Safety culture within healthcare is an example of an emergent property. It is not dictated from the top down but rather arises from interactions between individuals. We discussed how organizational culture, as an emergent phenomenon, is subject to change, and that the ini - tiation of that change can start from any level within the hierarchy. From the perspective of an infection prevention professional, the realization that HH is emergent offers the insight that change can be driven by modifying the rules of engagement between individuals. New processes for feedback and new meth - ods of interactions between individu - als around infection control practices are levers we can use to change patient safety culture. WHAT WERE YOUR KEY TAKE-AWAYS FROM THE WORKSHOP? Ethan: For me, it was the concept of finding methods of reinforcing positive behavior and spreading the methods found in our positive outliers. How do we use appreciative inquiry and positive deviance to learn from the individuals and parts of our organizations that are doing an exceptional job with infec - tion prevention and spread what we learn from there? How do we celebrate and reward the behaviors we want to see more of, so that we are reinforcing HH practices? How do we approach infection prevention quality improve - ment with a positive frame to create the culture in our organizations that we want and give our patients exceptional outcomes?

In discussions with my committee chair, I kept arguing, \"Hospitals already have health security resources\u2014they're found in the IPC program.\" My advisor responded by asking me to clarify: If that's true, why don't hospitals use these resources to the fullest extent possible? Answering this question would create the fabric for my dissertation. What I discovered is that cost containment undermines disease containment.SETTING THE AGENDA FOR IPC How political, economic, and cultural forces shape our priorities BY SASKIA POPESCU, P hD, MPH, MA, CICwww.apic.org | 49 This article highlights some of what I learned from my doctoral research. Although infection preventionists (IPs) are responsible for critical aspects of healthcare, patient safety, and biopre - paredness, healthcare systems are not using IPC capabilities to their full poten - tial as instruments of public health for a variety of political and economic reasons. The unfortunate result is IPs rarely get the chance to refine our tools or deploy them as we might. On a brighter note, there are signs of hope that we can transform per - ceptions and expectations of IPC, shifting our professional priorities for the greater benefit of patients and the public. THE LIMITATIONS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSES Given the growing attention to reduc - ing medical costs and the competitive healthcare market, it's unsurpris - ing that researchers are investigating IPC through the lens of cost analysis. Studies of this type tend to highlight the cost of healthcare-associated infec - tions (HAIs) in relation to the cost of IPC programs. For example, Anderson and colleagues looked at the expenditures needed to treat HAIs within a network of 28 hospitals, assessed the network's IPC program costs, and calculated what reduction in HAIs would pay for the programs.1 They found that the annual cost of HAIs for this network was $26 million, whereas the hospitals budgeted a median $129,000 for their IPC programs. The investigators concluded that the median annual cost of HAIs was 4.6 times the amount budgeted for IPC within individual facilities. These types of findings are valuable. However, such studies primarily cap - ture data about reported HAIs. Graves took a distinctive, broader approach to the question of the cost-effectiveness of IPC strategies by evaluating incremental benefits and effects.2 This is especially relevant because the overall efficacy and scope of IPC programs in terms of patient and staff safety must be considered in cost-benefit analyses. Ultimately, it would be beneficial to have a stronger body of literature and research surrounding the costs of HAIs and IPC programs at both individual hos - pitals and across healthcare systems. Such cost-benefit analyses can help us make the case for hiring more IPs. However, these studies alone are insufficient to fully convince healthcare administrators that IPC is more than just a requirement. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP AND THE SCOPE OF IPC Unfortunately, there is very little lit - erature about the cultural dynamics that shape IPC programs. Most of what has been published on this topic reflects con - versations among IPs about the profession and the dependency of IPC programs on support from administrators for both staffing and program scope. As Murphy and colleagues have argued, IPC programs are often perceived to be cost centers and not revenue generators.3 Given this perception, IPC programs rely primarily on executive champions to define their scope. For example, if the facility or system administration is solely concerned about HAIs linked to reimbursement, other IPC efforts, such as infectious disease preparedness or predictive infection control for patients in long-term care, will not be well sup - ported. A 2017 survey of IPs at roughly 900 U.S. acute care hospitals found that 53% reported strong or very strong sup - port of the program from hospital lead - ership4\u2014which means nearly half the respondents did not think leadership strongly supported in their work. When I conducted a survey of 116 IPs as part of my dissertation research, I found that the IPC topics IPs would prioritize diverged considerably from those of the hospital leadership.5 The IPs reported that hospital administra - tors overwhelmingly prioritized National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)- related HAI work. Nearly three out of four respondents (74.8%) said that this topic was the main priority for their administrators. Administrators also prioritized disinfection and steriliza - tion efforts, but they focused little on HAIs unrelated to NHSN requirements. In contrast, the IPs would prefer more resources and time allotted for environ - mental rounding (69% of respondents), education (57%), disinfection and ster - ilization (43%), and infectious disease preparedness (40%); only 9.5% wanted more time and resources for NHSN-HAI surveillance. Other research indicates that the time demands of mandated reporting and other administration priorities limit IPs from performing the full spectrum of IPC work.6,7 For example, Parillo calcu - lates that IPs at a community hospital spent five hours per eight-hour workday on NHSN-mandated surveillance.7 For many IPs, surveillance requirements and administration demands are intrinsically married. In my doctoral survey of IPs, 31% reported spending 25% to 50% of their daily IPC time on NHSN-related HAIs, and 32% reported spending 50% to 75% of their time on such efforts. 5 Several researchers, such as the teams led by Pittet8 and Stone,9 have emphasized that IPs must convince their healthcare administration of IPC's value and positive return on investment. Stone noted the need to dispel the common mispercep - tions about \"the significance of HAIs, reimbursement, and cost saving associated with effective HAI reduction programs.\"9 Some of these misperceptions are that the facility's incidence of HAIs is mini - mal, HAI costs are offset by reimburse - ment, HAIs are an expected outcome when treating high-risk patients, and HAI reduction efforts are not worth the investment. A PORTRAIT OF IPC TODAY While there are gaps in the literature regarding healthcare administrators' perceptions of IPC programs and the implications for program scope, surveys and other studies shed insight into our experiences around the United States. When pieced together, the findings form a mosaic of how political and economic factors intersect to shape IPC during this time of minimal resources and funding. First and foremost, as a profession, we're woefully understaffed. A 2018 study of 34 hospitals, 583 ambulatory sites, and 26 in-home and long-term care programs in a healthcare system across five states found that an effective IPC program should have a staffing ratio of 1 full-time equivalent (FTE) IP per 69 inpatient beds, whereas median IP staffing ratios showed 1.25 FTEs per 100 occupied beds.10 Furthermore, our budgets, staffing lev - els, and program efficacy are vulnerable to 50 | SPRING 2020 | Prevention economic forces. In a 2009 APIC survey, 41% of IPs reported a budget reduction due to the 2008 recession.11 Among the respondents reporting budget cuts, 75% reported an inability to maintain the nec - essary education for healthcare workers, and one-third said that cuts to staffing and resources reduced their ability to focus on IPC duties. My survey research also underscored the challenges of main - taining optimal IPC staffing: 56% of the IPs stated that the IPC program would be unlikely to receive an additional full-time employee if requested.5 Additionally, and as I noted previously, IPs spend most of their time on mandated surveillance and reporting. This has clear implications for patient care and public health: When we are doing this desk work, we are not on the frontlines of patient care, which is where we are most able to be pro - active in infection prevention. Administrators focus on surveillance and reporting because they want to avoid HAI-related financial penalties. Consequently, we focus less on the many HAIs that we are not required to report. This might put patients at risk. In 2008, Lee and colleagues analyzed the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) HAI-related payment pol - icy on IPC efforts.12 Although the CMS rule increased efforts to prevent targeted HAIs, it also resulted in facilities shifting resources away from nontargeted HAIs, making it unclear how the altered IPC pri - orities affected patient outcomes. A 2014 survey of IPs and frontline clinical staff found that clinicians believed the NHSN definitions were poorly aligned with what they considered to be \"true\" HAIs because of inconsistencies between the surveillance definitions and clinical diagnoses.13 Furthermore, when avoiding penalties is the IPC priority for healthcare systems, we may not get the data needed to truly understand HAI rates. In a memo jointly issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and CMS about adherence to NHSN surveillance defini - tions and criteria, the agencies noted that some providers misuse diagnostic meth - ods to avoid HAI findings\u2014for example, they order medically unnecessary tests to use as documentation that infection was present on admission, or they do not order necessary tests that might find infections postadmission. In the same memo, CDC and CMS warned healthcare organizations to not overrule IPs in their reporting to avoid penalties.14 WHAT ARE THE TRUE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF IPC? When considering the costs and ben - efits of IPC, it is important to note that CMS rules related to HAI surveillance and reporting have a limited impact on hospital finances. NHSN-linked HAIs represent only a small number of total infections, and federal penalties for HAIs are capped, single-digit percentages affecting Medicare reimbursement only. Most U.S. patients are privately insured, and reimbursement for their care is not affected by HAI incidence. 15 As Graves has argued, although the annual U.S. economic burden of HAIs is well over $6 billion and the benefits of IPC programs are widespread, there is a knowledge gap surrounding the benefits of HAI prevention beyond the hospital's bottom line.2 For example, most cost ana - lysts and hospital administrators overlook how HAI prevention reduces the burden for other care facilities. A 2009 CDC report found that the benefits of efficacious IPC programs and interventions range from a low of $5.7 billion to $6.8 billion to a high of $25 billion to $431.5 billion. 16 The low end of this assessment is based on a model in which 20% of HAIs were preventable in all urban consumers, and the high end was based on a 70% prevention rate. Other studies have shown that the cost of IPC programs, even if they are only minimally effective at HAI prevention, is well below the usual costs of caring for patients with HAIs. 17,18 These are impressive findings, but they neglect all the other work that IPs do beyond HAI prevention. Ideally, future analyses will also consider the costs and benefits of environmental rounding, staff education, combating flu each year, pre - paring for new threats (e.g., Ebola or COVID-19), and the million other things we accomplish each day. A CULTURAL SHIFT IPs function as a first alert in healthcare systems. We will be the first to inform stakeholders when risks may be loom - ing. Whether a facility is seeing a surge of respiratory infections in the middle of the summer, an unusual number of patients with opportunistic infections, or a potential shortage of disinfecting wipes, IPs raise red flags well before issues can become more serious problems. During outbreaks and other biologi - cal events, the IPC program is often the entity responsible for internal hospital preparedness.19,20 For example, a survey of Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America members following the 2014 Ebola cases in Dallas, Texas, revealed that most Ebola preparation in the U.S. was dominated by hospital epidemiolo - gists and IPC programs. 20 Furthermore, 80% of hospital epidemiology time from October 13 through October 19, 2014, was spent on Ebola preparations, with \"70% of other hospital infection preven - tion activities not being completed during that time.\" The events in Dallas were a wake-up call and can be understood as part of a cultural shift in perceptions of IPC both within our profession and exter - nally. Internally, the IPC profession has become more inclusive of epidemiolo - gists, microbiologists, industrial hygiene specialists, and others. We are becoming increasingly aware of and more engaged in the full range of efforts that comprise IPC, such as evidence-based research and innovative infection reduction programs (e.g., the tiered hospital approach to spe - cial pathogens). At the same time, the public has become more aware of how critical IPs are in not only reducing HAIs but also improving preparedness against infectious threats and participating in antimicrobial stewardship. IPC programs are at the nexus of pub - lic health and healthcare, acting as senti - nels for infectious disease threats and a source for tacit knowledge. Investing in IPC, both culturally and financially, can translate to positive outcomes. Although some investments may not have an obvious return on investment, this could be due DURING OUTBREAKS AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL EVENTS, THE IPC PROGRAM IS OFTEN THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR INTERNAL HOSPITAL PREPAREDNESS.www.apic.org | 51 BLT Best Legionella Test.

We also need to understand how the political economy and culture of healthcare structure what IPC is and could be. This is a time to change the tides.

Bailey APIC 2020, which takes place June 10-12 in Phoenix, Arizona, promises to provide a robust learning experience with more than 100 educational sessions and workshops led by experts from across the globe. This year's three keynote speakers will surely inspire you to think differently about your career, infection prevention, and even your capacity to change the world we live in. Prevention Strategist recently spoke with Francesca Gino, Steffanie Strathdee, and Simon T. Bailey about their accomplishments, themes they will address in their presentations, and their aspirations. Francesca Gino is a professor of business adminis - tration in the Negotiation, Organizations, and Markets Unit at Harvard Business School and the author of two books: Rebel Talent: Why It Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life and Sidetracked: Why Our Decisions Get Derailed, and How We Can Stick to the Plan. Gino's research focuses on judgment and decision-making, negotiation, ethics, motivation, productivity, and cre - ativity. Her work has been published in many academic journals and has been featured in The Economist , The New York Times , Newsweek , Scientific American , Psychology Today , The Wall Street Journal , NPR, and CBS Radio. She will deliver her APIC 2020 keynote presentation on Wednesday, June 10.a troublemaker. Effective rebels, in fact, are people who break rules in ways that are positive and productive. The world is becoming more uncertain, our prob - lems more complex. The rebel, undaunted by novel situations and ideas, adapts to change as a matter of course. PS: INFECTION PREVENTIONISTS (IP s) WANT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYEES TO RIGOROUSLY ADHERE TO INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THESE RULES ARE CRUCIAL TO PATIENT SAFETY. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO AN IP WHO IS SKEPTICAL THAT RULE-BREAKING IS FEASIBLE OR DESIRABLE IN THEIR WORKPLACE? FG: Rebels are not people who break rules that exist for very good reasons\u2014 like infection control policies and proce - dures. They break rules that hold them and others back. So, for instance, rather than taking the usual way of working for granted, rebels ask questions and show the same curiosity we all had when we were little. For many years, I studied rule-breaking in the moral sphere: people who cheat, steal, and lie. I explored why this happens and what can be done to prevent it. In time, I began to notice a different side of rule-breaking\u2014noncon - formists who drive positive change. These people didn't lie or cheat; instead, their genuine spirit of rebellion encouraged creative ideas and innovation. You could ask: What if you end up with a company of rebels, all rebelling all the time? When people ask me what the exact right percentage of rebels to have in an organization is, I simply answer, \"100%.\" The rebel talents I discuss in my book are not threatening: If used with a respectful approach, they can lead to positive change in an organization, and also in one's life. When we break rules by relying on these talents, we experience full engagement in the work we do. It is thanks to this engagement that rebels perform at higher levels in their jobs, stay innovative, and reach their success. But what about dangerous rebels, I hear you ask. The rebels on the edge who might overly disrupt things? I would give them the benefit of the doubt and try to understand the intentions that are driv - ing their behavior. Often, rebels are on the edge because of frustration. Learn from them\u2014they may have something innovative to offer. PS: WHAT ARE SOME PRACTICAL STEPS THAT ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERS CAN TAKE TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING AMONG THEIR EMPLOYEES? FG: Across all sorts of organizations I visited and studied that truly encourage PS: ONE OF YOUR BOOKS IS TITLED REBEL TALENT: WHY IT PAYS TO BREAK THE RULES AT WORK AND IN LIFE . CAN YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF RULE-BREAKING? FG: We think about rebels in the wrong way. The book is about rule-breaking as a constructive rather than destructive force. Rebels challenge the status quo in ways that drive positive change. To be a rebel does not mean to be an outcast or www.apic.org | 55 rebellion, I noticed that the leaders are 100% clear and transparent on two issues: the values the organization and everyone in it is committed to, and the rules that should not be broken. In this way, rebels have control on many aspects of their work\u2014but within boundaries. Assuring they, like others, are committed to the same values is important. And then let them choose and be flexible on how to live by those values as they do their work. PS: YOUR BIO STATES, \"GINO HELPS ORGANIZATIONS STAY SMART, INNOVATIVE, AND ABOVE ALL, HAPPY.\" WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR AN ORGANIZATION TO BE HAPPY? HOW DO YOU KNOW IF IT IS HAPPY? FG: Happy organizations are those whose leaders and employees are engaged in the work they do\u2014they feel their job is a source of joy rather than frustration. PS: WHAT DO YOU DO TO SUSTAIN YOUR OWN INNOVATIVE SPIRIT AND ENGAGEMENT IN YOUR WORK? FG: I always try to remember three words: break, transform, create. I learned the power of these three words from the Italian chef Massimo Bottura. One day at his three-Michelin-star restaurant, someone dropped a lemon tart, and Bottura turned the accident into an inspiration\u2014a deconstructed dessert, with a splash of cream, which looks as if it's in motion. The name: \"Oops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart.\" Rebels break routines. Rebels ask ques - tions. Rebels aren't afraid to look at a situ - ation from new perspectives. You don't have to be born a rebel. You just have to break the bad habits that hold people back. To discover your rebel talents. To transform yourself. To create your own success. Break, transform, create. PS: WHERE CAN READERS LEARN MORE ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH AND THE STRATEGIES YOU RECOMMEND? FG: The book website, www. RebelTalents.org (don't forget to take the Rebel Test there!) and my own per - sonal website, www.francescagino.com .PS: IN YOUR CAREER AS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGIST, YOU'VE RESEARCHED HIV PREVENTION AROUND THE WORLD. HOW DID YOU BECOME INTERESTED IN EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HIV IN PARTICULAR? SS: When I was an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto in the mid-1980s, the HIV epidemic was in its early stages. At first, it was just a fascinating subject that I studied in my microbiology classes, but one day in 1986, our professor didn't show up for class. We learned later that he'd died of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, an opportunistic infection associated with HIV infection. That was the first time that the HIV epidemic touched me per - sonally. In 1991, my PhD advisor and my best friend died of HIV/AIDS. That's when it felt like a calling. PS: MUCH OF YOUR RESEARCH ON HIV HAS FOCUSED ON RISK-RELATED BEHAVIORS IN MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS SUCH AS SEX WORKERS AND DRUG USERS. COULD YOU SHARE SOME INSIGHTS INTO WHAT WORKS OR DOESN'T WORK IN TERMS OF CHANGING BEHAVIORS THAT INCREASE INFECTION RISK? SS: I've learned over the years that we can't put the onus of responsibil - ity for HIV prevention solely on indi - viduals from marginalized populations when the drivers of HIV risk are social, political, and economic. For example, when drug use, sex work, or homosexual behavior is criminalized, we can't expect people to make safe choices. Some of my team's research has shown that policing practices, laws, and immigration poli - cies (like deportation) are independently associated with elevated HIV risk. To me, that means that we need to intervene on upstream factors, like policies and laws, to have a significant, sustainable impact on HIV incidence at the individual level. PS: AS YOU RECOUNT IN YOUR MEMOIR, THE PERFECT PREDATOR: A SCIENTIST'S RACE TO SAVE HER HUSBAND FROM A DEADLY SUPERBUG (2019), YOUR HUSBAND, TOM, NEARLY DIED AFTER BECOMING INFECTED WITH THE SUPERBUG ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII . WHEN ANTIBIOTICS DIDN'T WORK, YOU SEARCHED THE LITERATURE AND LEARNED ABOUT A LITTLE-KNOWN OPTION, PHAGE THERAPY, WHICH EVENTUALLY SAVED HIS LIFE. WHAT IS PHAGE THERAPY? SS: Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that have naturally evolved to attack bacteria. They were discovered in 1917 and were used to treat humans and animals with bacterial infections. When penicillin was introduced in 1942, phage therapy was relegated to the back-burner in the West, but it remains widely used in the former USSR and parts of Eastern Europe. I was able to leverage a global village of strangers and phage researchers from three universities and the US Navy, along with my colleagues at UCSD to find phages that matched my husband's pan-resistant A. baumannii infection in time to save his life. An innovation was that we injected a billion phages per dose into his bloodstream, and he woke up Steffanie A. Strathdee is associate dean of global health sciences and Harold Simon Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. She is also an Adjunct Professor at Johns Hopkins and Simon Fraser Universities. She co-directs UCSD's new Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics (IPATH), Global Health Institute and the International Core of UCSD's Center for AIDS Research. An infec - tious disease epidemiologist, Strathdee has spent the last two decades focusing on HIV prevention in marginalized populations in developing countries and has published over 600 peer-reviewed publications. Recently, she has begun working to move bacte - riophage therapy into clinical trials at IPATH. She will deliver her APIC 2020 keynote presentation on Thursday, June 11.56 | SPRING 2020 | Prevention from a deep coma within a few days. We've since treated other patients at UCSD and elsewhere with IV phage therapy, and in 2018, we opened the first dedicated phage therapy center in North America (the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics [IPATH]). PS: HOW IS YOUR HUSBAND NOW? SS: He's awesome. After his recovery, we were told that there was no \"human face\" for the superbug crisis, so I looked at Tom and he looked at me, and I said, \"You're it, honey.\" We just got back from a trip to India and Thailand as part of a book tour for our memoir, The Perfect Predator . PS: WHERE CAN IP s LEARN MORE ABOUT PHAGE THERAPY AND ITS POTENTIAL AS A WEAPON AGAINST SUPERBUGS? SS: There's a lot of information on the IPATH ( ipath.ucsd.edu ) and my website ( ThePerfectPredator.com ). We were delighted that Amazon listed our book as one of the best science books of 2019.PS: WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU (PROFESSIONALLY AND/OR PERSONALLY)? SS: I'm still active in HIV research, but I now also codirect IPATH with Dr. Chip Schooley, who oversaw the phage therapy protocol for Tom. IPATH is about to start enrolling patients in the first NIH-funded phage therapy clinical trial. I'm actively pro - moting antimicrobial resistance awareness through public appearances and participa - tion in the WHO's task force on antimicro - bial resistance for Southeast Asia. And in my \"spare time,\" I'm writing a new book. This time, it will be fiction (thank God!) PS: ON YOUR WEBSITE, YOU WRITE, \"WHEN I WAS PROMOTED TO SALES DIRECTOR AT DISNEY INSTITUTE, I WAS A BOSS WITH AN AGENDA INSTEAD OF A LEADER WITH A VISION.\" WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A BOSS AND BEING A LEADER? SB: A boss tells others what to think. A leader will ask a person, \"What do you think?\" or \"What is the best course of action in making a decision?\" A true leader realizes that asking the question instead of telling someone what to do becomes the teachable moment that shapes a person's career.PS: WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH AN ORGANIZATION TO CHANGE ITS CULTURE AND ENCOURAGE LEADERSHIP, WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST STEPS TO TAKE STOCK AND BEGIN MAKING IMPROVEMENTS? SB: First, identify who are the key influencers and informal leaders who don't have a title but have clout among their peers. Invite them to be a part of the improvement in shifting the culture. Second, remember that everyone expe - riences change differently. The most effective way to ensure that change yields a positive result is to schedule check-ins with team members individually and collectively. Celebrate what people are doing right instead of what they are doing wrong. Third, leadership must communicate the \"why\" behind the change instead of the \"what\" that needs to be changed. Give people the opportunity to share sugges - tions, and together you will find the \"how to\" change that is more effective. The purpose of telling the \"why\" behind a change is to establish trust and create an environment for open communication. PS: WHAT ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL ACTIONS THAT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES CAN TAKE TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THEIR WORKPLACE CULTURE? SB: First, upgrade the employee onboarding experience. The first impression an employee has of an orga - nization is shaped within the first 30 to 90 minutes. Make it count by giv - ing them a buddy or team member who understands the written and unwritten rules of engagement in the culture. This is the person who goes to lunch with them within the first 24-72 hours of them joining the organization. Also, create an intentional innovation or hacking experience where teams from various parts of the organization come together to solve a problem. The diver - sity of thinking yields intangible results long after the hack-a-thon. Furthermore, it takes a person out of their comfort zone to stretch, grow, and be curious. PS: TELL US ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT OF \"PLATINUM CUSTOMER SERVICE.\" DO YOU THINK THIS CONCEPT IS RELEVANT FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS? SB: Platinum customer service is going the extra \"inch\" versus the extra \"mile\" in how we serve customers. Going the extra inch is critically thinking about how we solve a customer's problem and les - sons learned in the customer journey. As healthcare continues to be disrupted and transformed, it's imperative for health - care providers to create a culture where everyone takes ownership of creating a platinum experience. PS: YOU HAVE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF \"SOFT SKILLS\" SUCH AS DISCERNMENT AND JUST-IN-TIME LEARNING AS KEYS TO SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE WORK ECONOMY. ANY Simon T.

SB: The best way to develop soft skills is to start with assessing your last performance review. What feedback did you receive about your productivity? What are the areas of opportunity or potential areas of growth? For example, if you received feedback that you need to be a better communicator, then enroll in a public speaking course. Raise your hand to make a presentation in front of your peers and ask for feedback from your leader and peers. PS: YOU'RE AN INSPIRATION FOR MANY PEOPLE. WHO INSPIRES YOU, AND WHY? SB: I am inspired by Sparks of the Week. These are everyday people from all walks of life who find a way to go the extra inch at work and in life. These people are nominated by their peers and then we post them on Instagram and LinkedIn. PS: WHERE CAN READERS LEARN MORE ABOUT YOUR WORK? SB: Visit www.simontbailey.com and experience my three courses on ( www.lynda.com/simontbailey ). Follow me at LinkedIn, Instagram, ON THE HORIZON FOR YOU? SB: Mark your calendar: August 26, 2020, is going to be National \"Spark the World\" Day. We are asking people on this day to give hope and go the extra inch for the least, the last, and the often forgotten.

The ClipVac device eliminated the need to physically remove dispersed hairs from within the operative field. 3Significantly less microbial contamination from hair left behind ClipVac Device Use of the ClipVac device resulted in a significant (P < 0.001) reduction in both residual hair and microbial contamination within the operative field compared with SSC. The microbial burden recovered from residual hair during cleanup in the SSC group was 3.9 log 10 colony-forming units (CFU) and 4.6 log10 CFU from the chest and groin areas, respectively.3 The ClipVac device\u2014a small, portable vacuum with a single-use nozzle and filtered reservoir that attaches exclusively to the BD \u00ae surgical clippers\u2014uses innovative technology to create a complete hair-removal system. The filter captures an average of 99% of hair and airborne contaminants generated in the clipping process, down to 0.3 m,* and is disposed of after each use. This technology saves valuable time by eliminating the entire secondary step of cleanup and the need for adhesive-based cleanup products that can be bacteria-laden, damage skin layers and potentially cause adverse reactions.

When left behind on the patient, linens or floor, hair clippings can contaminate the surgical environment. Many OR nurses agree that the current cleanup practice of using adhesive tape is time consuming, 3 and the reuse of tape rolls represents a cross-contamination risk.4-6 Recently published data demonstrated that BD surgical clippers fitted with the exclusive ClipVac vacuum-assisted hair-collection device eliminates these issues.3 In this study, the ClipVac device was compared with standard surgical clippers (SSC) and adhesive tape clean up.3 985169_BD.indd 1 11/4/19 9:31 AM986184_Medentech.indd 1 10/02/20 1:34 PM "}
