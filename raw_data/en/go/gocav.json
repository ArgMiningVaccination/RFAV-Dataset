Undergraduate Medical Education Board proposes to make the above mentioned regulations in exercise of powers conferred by the National Medical Commission Act, 2019 and particularly by sections 10, 24, 25 and 57 of the said Act. A draft regulation in this regard is being shared for public comments. 2. It is requested to share comments on the draft regulations at the following email id comments.ugregulations(il)nmc.orq.in in MS Word (.docx) format or machine readable PDF Format within 30 days of publication of this notice with a subject tagline \"Comments on draft regulations regarding National Medical Commission (Competency Based Medical Education Curriculum) Regulatio ns, 2023\" . (Shambhu Sharan Director, UGMEB$IBME CURRICULUM l. Preamble The new Graduate Medical Education Regulations attempts to stand on the shoulder of the contributions and the efforts of resource persons, teachers and students (past and present). It intends to take the learner to provide health care to the evolving needs of the nation and the world. About 25 years have passed since the existing Regulations on Graduate Medical Educatioa 1997 were notihed, necessitating a relook at all aspects of the various compoilents in the existing regulations and adapt them to the changing dcmography, socio-economic context, perceptions, values, advancements in medical education and expectations of stakeholders. Emerging health care issues particularly in the context of emerging diseases, impact of advances in science and technology and shorter distances on diseases and their management also need consideration. The smng and forward-looking fundamentals enshrined in the Regulations on Graduate Medical Education, 1997 has made this job easier. A comparison between the 1997 Regulations and proposed Graduate Mdical Education Regulations, ?019 will reveal that the 2019 Regulations have evolved from several key principles anshrined in the 1997 Regulations. The thrust in the new regulations is continuation and evolution of thought in medical education making it more leamer-centric, patient-centric, gender- sensitive, outcome -oriented and environment appropriate. The result is an outcome driven curriculum w'hich conforms to global trends. Emphasis is made on alignment and integration of subjects both horizontally and vertically while respcting the strenglhs and necessity of subject-based instruction and assessment. This has necessitated a deviation from using \"broad competencies\"; instead, the reports have written end of phase subject (sub) comp\u20actencies. These \"sub*competencies\" can be mapped to the global competencies in the Graduate Medical Education Regulatioas. The importance of ethical values. responsiveness to the needs of the patient and acquisition of communication skills is underscored by providing dedicated curriculum time in the form of a longitudinal program based on Attitude, Ethics and Communication TAETCOM) competencies. Great emphasis has been placed on collaborative and interdisciplinary teamu'ork, professionalism, altruism and respect in professional relationships with due sensitivity to differences in thought, social and economic position and gender. 2.
