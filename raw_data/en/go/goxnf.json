There is a consciousness to live in harmony with nature and to eschew the use of chemical and artificial substances in our diet and beauty regimen. There is a renewed interest for utilizing herbal and natural products. The desire of living a healthy life with natural, herbal resources and maintaining a daily regimen which is 'chemical free' as much as possible are the primary reasons of increased demand of herbal products worldwide. Personal care products, hair care, fragrances, skin care, oral care, ayurvedic nutraceuticals, dietary supplements that are natural are in great demand around the globe. Dr Vidya Shembule is an Ayurvedic doctor and holds a degree in Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) from India. She is the founder and director of 'Arka Ayurveda Institute Belgium' and 'Ayurveda 4 All' India. There is an increased interest and awareness about Ayurveda. Ayurveda is one of India's best contributions to the world. Ayurveda is defined as a science of life with a holistic approach to health and personalized medicine. It provides great potential for the treatment of chronic diseases, geriatric health problems and helps promotion of health and well-being. The primary reason behind the popularity of Ayurveda is the way of treatment. Unlike other forms of medicinal practice, the treatment of Ayurveda is not limited only to a particular disease or the diseased part. Instead, it focuses on holistic healing of the body considering its entirety. During Covid-19, Ayurveda gained global attention and acceptance. People are widely welcoming this traditional medical healing system and trying to learn its unique methods to treat various diseases and to maintain the health status. Ayurveda has proudly spread its wings across the globe and is gaining popularity in many European countries as well. With the increasing number of ayurveda institutes and study centres, we can imagine its appeal among the European population. In Europe, there have been several initiatives for the promotion of Ayurveda. The European Parliament played host to two hugely popular events for promotion of Ayurveda in February 2019 and January 2020. As part of outreach activity, the Embassy of India in Brussels has also been organizing events and webinars to celebrate \"Ayurveda Day.\" One of the most attended events was the webinar on the theme of \"Ayurveda & Immunity during COVID-19\" in November 2020. In the context of the European Union, the issue of recognition of ayurveda and market authorization of traditional herbal medicinal products in the EU has been discussed at various fora. As a follow up of various discussions, the joint working group mechanism between India and the EU for cooperation in pharmaceuticals namely the India-EU Joint Working Group (JWG) on pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and medical devices in its meeting held in Brussels in Sept. 2018 agreed to create an India-EU Joint Technical Working Group (TWG) on Ayurveda. As a follow up, both the Ministry of Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy), Government of India and European Medicine agency (EMA) worked out Terms of Reference (ToR) for the creation of the said India-EU Joint Technical Working Group (TWG) on Ayurveda in July 2021. The main objective of the TWG on Ayurveda is to deepen the dialogue on ayurvedic medicines with the view to facilitate trade and increasing market access. The TWG will strive to promote and protect public health in the EU and India through ayurveda. To promote bilateral cooperation in Ayurvedic medicine, following will include: Exchange of relevant legislation guidelines and experiences. Training in Ayurvedic medicine to the staff working in the EU Member States in scientific assessment of Ayurvedic medicinal products. Identifying possibilities to enhance cooperation on Good Manufacturing Practices, Good field collection Practices, Good Cultivation Practices Strengthening collaboration in pharmacopoeias of both sides to get recognition to Ayurveda Pharmacopoeia of India in EU as well as developing herbal monographs. The tremendous efforts of both the sides bore fruit and the first meeting of the TWG on Ayurveda was held on 22 Feb 2022. Additionally, the Ministry of Ayush, Government of India had organized a three-day mega event 'Global Ayush Investment & Innovation Summit' from 20-22nd April 2022 in Gujarat. The Summit provided a platform for the global investors from different countries, working in various fields such as herbal industry, drug manufacturers, nutraceutical companies, food supplement industry, the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Instrument Industry, IT Industry, Data mining, Clinical Trials, FMCG, other Trade Bodies and related industries to invest in Ayush sector. Regulatory authorities from Canada, Australia, and USA were invited to guide the Indian industry on export of Ayurveda, Unanai, Siddha, Homeopathy, and herbal products to western countries. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Ayush had publicized effective self-care guidelines for preventive health measures and boosting immunity with special reference to respiratory health. These practices are well supported by ayurvedic literature and scientific publications. These guidelines attracted significant global attention towards ayurveda and its contribution to maintaining wellness and health during stressful times. People were immensely interested in knowing and understanding the complexity of Ayurveda. They were also equally eager to adopt their lifestyle to an ayurvedic way. The raised interest is visible in people using authentic herbal oils, teas, and other products as a part of their daily routine. This awareness has provided many opportunities to wellness industry by establishing ayurvedic massage centres, spas, and resorts. Due to increased consumer awareness and demand, supermarkets, bio shops and pharmacies have been flooded with an endless variety of ayurvedic teas that suit different body constitutions, moods, and offer lifestyle solutions such as tea for aiding digestion, promoting sleep, boosting immunity etc. We see the increasing popularity of ayurvedic herbs everywhere with different labels and serving different purposes. For example, many modern medicine practitioners, orthopedics and sport medicine doctors prescribe curcuma capsule as an ant-inflammatory and muscle relaxant along with the allopathic medicines. Besides curcuma, other beneficial ayurvedic herbs could also be added to the wellness segment to treat musculoskeletal, respiratory and geriatric disorders after a thorough standardization procedure, development of guidelines and exchange of relevant legislation. This requires a huge professional work by academicians, practitioners and researchers who must have the necessary knowledge and motivation. Although the process of research is time taking, this is the only way to make ayurveda accessible worldwide. Improved lifestyle and purchasing power have provided better options and choices for the consumers. Today's purchaser is educated, concerned, and thoughtful about his investments in health and products related to it. Moreover, practical developments in ayurvedic medicines and products will offer better investment opportunities for the investors. More intensive research and development into Ayurvedic products for a healthier and natural lifestyle will be a win-win for the consumer, the company and the planet.
