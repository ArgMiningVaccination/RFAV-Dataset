This sacred mushroom has been a principle part of the pemmican used by their Native American Men and Women for millennia and is an integral part of their daily healing regimen. Now it has been recognized and classified as a certified ceremonial sacrament for use by all Medicine men and woman in their traditional healing. Clockwise: Wild Ap\u00e1n Remedy, Spider Lily, Ap\u00e1n Mushroom, Adaptofleur Remedy, Frangipani, Waratah \"Wild Ap\u00e1n is far superior to other medicinal mushrooms and contains much more of the therapeutic healing components, than those found in other medical mushrooms like Chaga and importantly it does not contain the kidney damaging oxalates. Ap\u00e1n's beneficial bio available ingredients and chemistry including the bitter triterpene compounds, angiotensin re-uptake inhibitors like beta-d-glucans and immune-stimulating efficacies are considered superior.\" The Ap\u00e1n mushroom is wild harvested at its natural peak potency to ensure the maximum efficacy and strength. Then when processed into a super concentrated liquid extract form, its bio available and therapeutic benefits grow exponentially. When blended with organic essential oils of Black Cumin, Lemon, Cinnamon Bark, Peppermint, and Wild Sacred Frankincense, (there has been such a vast array of medical & scientific studies, worldwide on these compounds) this synergistic blend has demonstrated an unique and significant ability to strengthen, support and modulate the Immune Response in different ways. \"Ap\u00e1n assists in helping your body to heal itself by modulation of the immune system and I have seen the immune system increase over 4000% within 20 hours after taking. Over time this modulation will start the activation of the body's healing stem cells.\" Chief Man Found Standing, Medicine Man Practitioner Having a healthy and properly functioning immune system will positively affect all other body systems. When addressing the emotional, physiological aspect of whole health and homeostasis, it's fundamental to look at the correlation between shock stress and the weakening of the immune system. We can all relate back to past or recent events which can if left unaddressed insidiously assault our emotional immunity.

According to national surveys, 20% to 60% of Europeans suffer from a vitamin D deficiency so supplements are highly recommended. Food sources of vitamin D are extremely limited and if you are vegan, vegetarian or only eat oily fish very occasionally then you may not be getting enough vitamin D from your diet. [www.abundanceandhealth.co.uk/en/neutrient/187-neutrient-d3-k2.html](https://abh.link/positive-health) Sunshine and Vitamin D Vitamin D is normally produced by skin cells when exposed to the UVB rays so if you live in a country with shorter hours of sunlight your skin may not make enough vitamin D during winter. As you get older skin cells become less efficient at making vitamin D which is why the elderly at higher risk. High Risk for Darker Skin Melanin, the pigment responsible for protecting the skin, filters out UVB rays making it much harder for skin cells to produce desired amounts of vitamin D. The darker your skin tone, the higher the risk for vitamin D deficiency so vitamin D3 supplements are beneficial for anyone with dark skin. Vitamin D3 is the most Effective When it comes to supplements, it's the bioactive D3 form which remains biologically active in the body for much longer and is more effective at raising blood levels than vitamin D2. Oral Sprays are Fast Working Oral sprays deliver fast, maximised absorption compared to tablets and capsules which are dependent on intestinal absorption rates. With an oral spray, vitamin D3 passes rapidly through the soft tissues inside the mouth and heads straight into the bloodstream. Great news for anyone who suffers from a malabsorption condition (IBS, Crohn's, colitis, coeliac). D and K form a Dynamic Team Always choose a supplement that contains a balance of these two bone building nutrients. Whereas vitamin D support the intestinal absorption of calcium, vitmain K helps guide calcium into the right body tissues - your bones and teeth. Immune and Muscle Function Vitamin D3 plays an important role in helping your immune system function normally. Vitamin D3 supports innate immunity (your body's first line of defence) by playing a key role in regulating the action and total number of specific immune cells. Vitamin D is also important for muscle function and is popular with athletes or anyone with a sporty or active lifestyle. Neutrient D3 + K2 vegan oral spray - fast, potent and effective: - 2000 IU vitamin D3 with 75 mcg vitamin K2 - 150 sprays per bottle, 5-month supply - Bioactive forms for maximised absorption - Vegan certification from The Vegan Society - Provides bioactive vitamin D3 sourced from lichens - Provides vitamin K2 as the potent bioactive form MK-7 Further Information Article text by Food Scientist and Nutritionist Susie Debice.

Sacred Geometry - Chakra Balancing Bracelet with Red Cord Positive Feedback from Happy Customers People have been noticing benefits from wearing these pieces. One happy customer had been experiencing IBS for many years and was on medication for it. She informed me that she \"did not believe in woo-woo but she would have a solar plexus bracelet. She reported that after a week of wearing it she had no physical problems with her previous symptoms and was so delighted that she purchased a heart bracelet for her friend, who was single and unhappy at the time. The 'friend' apparently found her new hubby-to -be within 2 weeks of wearing the charm! Whilst we make no promises, we love the feedback! The Tridatu This is traditionally worn on the right wrist.

Almost comparable to the holy trinity, it embodies the Balinese-Hindu's three manifestations of God known as the Trimurti which permeates through the core aspects of the Balinese-Hindu's circle of life (birth, life, and death); captured by the three entities who hold the power or 'duty' of creation, welfare, and destruction for each stage of the life cycle.

I was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in January 2016 and told I had a year to live. I spent years travelling and researching cancer and how to improve my odds. I launched the first Cancer Patients Symposium in June 2018 to share my research. I am currently making a documentary around improving UK cancer survival rates - which are amongst the worst in Europe - and have teamed up with a charity, Cancer Solutions, to develop a protocol for prostate cancer. Like so many others, my cancer journey started much earlier when my father-in-law and my mother were respectively diagnosed with stomach and breast cancer. For ten years I made films for Walk the Walk, a charity that runs the MoonWalks events that raise money for cancer research and care. I have increasingly felt the need for doctors and naturopaths to share more widely information on cancer and treatments that can improve survival rates and quality of life. Although there are already some wonderful online events on cancer, I felt that many things were not being covered - and not in a sufficiently in-depth scientific way. I am passionate about 'informed consent' and believe that cancer patients should know all their options - many of which are not offered or even mentioned by the NHS. Often I've found that cutting edge treatments being used in leading hospitals and clinics round the world only become available on the NHS some twenty to forty years later. All too often cancer patients are driven into opting for extreme interventions before they have had time to think and inform themselves thoroughly. I feel strongly that a more holistic approach to cancer is necessary and that many ways of supporting cancer patients and dealing with treatment side-effects are not fully considered. Indeed, although there is a consensus that genetic changes happen in cancer cells, many now believe these genetic changes are down-stream events and that cancer is actually a metabolic disease which requires support for the whole body and immune system. This year's online event will include a range of important presentations on subjects that all cancer patients and practitioners need to understand. We will explore how to avoid the types of dangerous medical neglect that causes the death of a quarter of all cancer patients prematurely, and how to return your mitochondrial function to that of a 20-year-old. Cancer 101 - what you can do when you are first diagnosed Presentations from a multidisciplinary team on 20 different key pathways to follow, with practical suggestions and product reviews, including sessions on functional medicine, evidence-based herbal treatments for cancer, alkalising tumour micro-environments, the importance of movement (exercise), reversing the age of mitochondria, a round-up of detox techniques, and many other practical ways of treating cancer and maintaining vibrant health.

And try to 'feel depressed' at the same time....Without lowering your gaze... ?? What?? You conscientiously tried your hardest And you just couldn't do it? As long as your gaze was upward, you just couldn't feel depressed at the same time? [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0957181760/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0957181760/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2) Oh dear...how scary is that? To just not to be able to feel depressed, even though you genuinely are depressed? Or even, according to the medical professionals, 'have Depression'. Try it again...if you're indoors, fix your gaze where the wall meets the ceiling. If you can look out a window, or if you are outdoors, look at roof-lines, the tops of trees, the sky....keep your gaze fixed upward and try to feel depressed at the same time. You still can't 'feel depressed', though you know you will the minute you stop looking up. In the real world, we are all in increasingly difficult and discouraging situations. We all have reasons to feel depressed, more than depressed - much more...desperate, terrified, grief-stricken, raging against injustices, against repeated mistakes that have made things worse. Of course there are good reasons to be depressed...but when we are literally fighting for our lives, we must be at our peak of clear thinking and effective action. There is no time to waste 'feeling depressed'. Use the weapon I have just handed to you. Shamelessly cut through the apathy that might slow you down. LOOK UP! And now that your head is clear, look again at your situation, and start to figure out what to do.

Night Time Berry is blended with fruits and herbs known for relaxation. The recommended range of sleep for an adult is 7-9 hours; this highlights a worldwide worrying lack of sleep.[1] Euan MacLennan, Herbal Director Pukka Herbs and London NHS Medical Herbalist says:, \"A good night's sleep can be the difference between a good day and a bad day for most of us. Over the last 50 years the average number of sleeping hours people get have reduced from eight to seven; our grandparents had a full month more sleep per year.[2] \"As our understanding of health evolves, it becomes clear there is a strong link between sleep and the strength of our immune function.[3] During healthy sleep, our immune system releases proteins called cytokines which help promote sleep. So now, more than ever, it's important to get a good eight-hour rest per night to fight off any potential illnesses. Lack of sleep can also affect how fast you recover if you do get sick.[4] \"Sleep supports the proteins and cells of your immune system to detect and destroy bugs and germs[5] and importantly helps them to remember those bugs so they can fight them off even quicker in the future. Sleep also helps to reduce stress, support mental wellbeing and improve heart health.\"[6] Nature's finest ingredients for sleep and immunity to support faster recovery: - Elderberries: Bursting with brightly coloured pigments that act as natural antioxidants,[7] elderberries are a natural source of vitamin C.[8] - Echinacea: A renowned immune tonic with some very interesting research, echinacea can be particularly helpful in seasonal wellness. - Valerian: A traditional tonic to support restful sleep. Valerian can help us to drop off to sleep and encourage undisturbed sleep.[9] - Chamomile: Chamomile contains an antioxidant called apigenin which works on the brain receptors to help to initiate sleep.

A small shrub, extracts from the plant are associated with a host of health benefits, from helping with a range of age related health issues to improving athletic performance. There have been a large number of studies published on the possible benefits of ashawagandha; highlighting its huge potential... Sleep In a study[1] published in August 2020, 80 people were given either a placebo or Ashwagandha for eight weeks. Sleep parameters were measured, as well as sleep questionnaire. Those taking Ashwagandha slept significantly better than those in the placebo group, particularly if they previously suffered from insomnia. Stress and Anxiety A study[2] involving 58 men and women assessed the effectiveness of Ashwagandha extract at reducing stress and anxiety. Participants were given either Ashwagandha extract or a placebo for eight weeks. Those in the Ashwagandha group had significantly reduced their scores on a perceived stress scale, as well as reducing their cortisol levels (a hormone strongly linked to stress). The Ashwagandha group also found their sleep improved. Waistlines Research has also shown Ashwagandha may help with our waistlines. Chronic stress is often associated with weight gain and in a study[3] 52 people under chronic stress received either placebo or Ashwagandha for eight weeks. Those taking Ashwagandha were less stressed, had less food cravings, were happier and body weight reduced, compared to those given placebo. Exercise An eight week study[4] involving 57 men, saw participants consuming either Ashwagandha extract or placebo whilst undergoing resistance training. The results showed, compared to those taking the placebo, those taking the Ashwagandha extract had significantly greater muscle strength, as measured when bench-pressing and doing leg-extensions, and significantly greater muscle size increase in their arms and chest. Compared to the placebo subjects, the subjects receiving Ashwagandha also had significantly greater reduction of exercise-induced muscle damage (as indicated by serum creatine kinase stabilization), significantly greater increase in testosterone and significantly greater decrease in body fat. Other research[5]has shown that Ashwagandha may improve people's VO2max. VO2 max, maximal oxygen uptake, the measurement of the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during intense exercise. It is a common measurement used to establish the aerobic endurance of an athlete prior to or during the course of training. How to use Ashwagandha Fito is an expert producer of natural remedies, for over 20 years. Ashwagandha capsules offer an easy and convinient way to include the herb in your diet. Fito's vegan capsules offer a high strength and quality Ashwagandha supplement - a standardized extract with a guaranteed content of withanolides (7.5%) - an important active component of ashwagandha. Please note: DO NOT take when pregnant (There is some evidence that ashwagandha might cause miscarriages) or breast feeding. Consult a doctor before use if suffering from any medical condition, on any medication, or about to undergo surgery. Consult your doctor before use, if at all unsure whether hibiscus tea is suitable for you and stop use immediately, and consult a doctor, if any adverse reactions occur. Use may cause drowsiness.

Asbestos Audit - Symptom Checks Data Collection With the Coronavirus pandemic forcing the world to pause, sadly we have seen a significant rise in NHS and mental health issues here in the UK. One of the main concerns around the Coronavirus pandemic was patients not getting treated for the appropriate illnesses or being misdiagnosed. One disease that has similar coronavirus symptoms is mesothelioma, where those who suffer from either Coronavirus or mesothelioma will experience shortness of breath or chest pain. Sadly, mesothelioma has had a big impact on the UK with many [mesothelioma-related deaths](https://www.asbestosaudit.co/asbestos-blog/2020/11/6/mesothelioma-death-rate-map-uk) being recorded in the last decade. In light of this, [Asbestos Audit](https://www.asbestosaudit.co/), who provide asbestos surveys, health and safety services and environmental services, wanted to raise awareness of the similarity of mesothelioma and coronavirus symptoms in order to prevent misdiagnosis. Furthermore, they also wanted to look at the mental toll this may have had on people. They analysed Google search data from the last year (Sept. 2019 - Sept. 2020) around anxiety and symptom checking to see whether these terms have seen an increase year on year, throughout the year. Key Findings: - Searches around 'continuous cough' have seen a whopping increase of 3539% - slightly problematic for people who have mesothelioma, as this may mean they are misdiagnosed with coronavirus etc.; - The term 'panic attack' increased 35% rise in the last year; - Searches around mesothelioma have decreased - even though the HSE confirmed there was no decline in the number of mesothelioma-deaths in the UK for the last 5 years; - 'Symptoms' have also increased by 43% - highlighting the anxiety and worry the pandemic has caused for many. Further Information Asbestos Audit Ltd performed this research - [https://www.asbestosaudit.co/](https://www.asbestosaudit.co/) Fairy Herb Tea - Jiaogulan 'Fairy herb' may sound like a mythical plant grown by wizards and warlocks, but it's actually another name for a plant called Jiaogulan. Past research has shown that extracts from jiaogulan could help with weight loss.[4,5,6] One study[6] was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial and involved 74 men and women taking a jiaogulan extract over a 12 week period. At the end of the trial, those using the jiaogulan extracts were found to have significantly (compared to the placebo group) decreased their total abdominal fat area, losing on average nearly 21cm2 fat from around their bellies. Now new research[1-3] has helped identify ten different compounds with potential weight loss properties in tea made from the herb. The plant makes a tea with a delicious bittersweet taste and could be a simple addition to your diet, if you're looking to lose a few pounds. Where to get Fairy Herb Tea Herbal tea experts, Natur Boutique, have launched one of the first jiaogulan teas to be available in the UK. Natur Boutique's drink uses just one pure ingredient and has no additives or flavourings, which gives it an added purity of flavour. Please Note: DO NOT use if pregnant, breast feeding or suffering from a medical condition/on medication (including diabetes). Ask a doctor if in any doubt over the suitability of jiaogulan for your diet or if you are about to undergo surgery. References 1-3. Molecules. 2020 Aug 15;25(16):E3737.
