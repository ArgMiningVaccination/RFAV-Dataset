Whole Person Care: Patients are much more than their diagnosis or a chemical imbalance. They are not just physical bodies. They are also mental, emotional and spiritual beings. All of these dimensions of a patient's self must be integrated into a treatment plan in order to yield the best outcome in the shortest time. The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. 2.

Everybody has the natural ability to self-heal. Physicians can guide patients back to their healthy self by strengthening the natural healing processes to yield the best outcomes using minimal medications.
