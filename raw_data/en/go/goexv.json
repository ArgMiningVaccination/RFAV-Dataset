I have learned a lot from studying the virus over the past 18 months and with our effective elimination strategy we were able to buy time in creating a herbal support programme as evidence gathers overseas about effective herbs, medicines and approaches. We now have some evidence to go by, but herbal medicine clinical trials are still severely lacking. With the vaccine rollout nearing its peak there will be some who want to know what to do in order to support the body through the vaccination process. We want to remind you to discuss vaccination concerns with your doctor as it is outside our scope of practice to recommend medications, however we will help support people with nutrients and herbs who wish to take it but feel hesitant about their current state of health. With both of these our role is to support the health system and patients to either get the vaccine or to help treat Covid symptoms. We also know that breakthrough infections can still occur while vaccinated so we want to therefore let you know that if you want nutritional/herbal support for Covid, we can provide this as well as help you feel more prepared to take the vaccine. For more information on how to support your body before and after the vaccine please do not hesitate to Our advice, herbs and supplements can be of great help if you or someone you know is infected with Covid-19. As is often with herbal medicine, research is slowly undertaken, much of our protocol is based on the studies we have available and also traditional usage of herbal remedies for the lungs and type of symptoms experienced with Covid-19, as well as experience gathered from SARS-1 and SARS-Cov-2 from countries like China who research herbal medicine. However it must be remembered that herbal medicine does not replace medical treatment for Covid-19. We are here to support people and offer herbal support for these situations: What we have created is supportive to the immunity and does not replace medical attention. It is thoroughly important that oxygen meters are used with any Covid-19 infection and that infection prevention protocols and medical examination are used. A reminder we will not advise people on the vaccine as this is outside our scope of practice but we will help support people who wish to take it but feel hesitant about their current state of health. We will endeavour to deliver a package to those who live locally (Christchurch) and nationally we will send to those in need however the time it takes for packages to arrive will be too late for the first stage of infection so we encourage you to connect with your local naturopath in this situation. We want you to know we are here if you need us for health advice and support. If you or a member of your family catches Covid-19 you can call us for a phone/Zoom consultation and we will immediately arrange your remedies for contactless delivery.

While millions of people receive vaccines, very few focus on preparing their body ahead of time and they do not prioritise supporting their health after inoculation. This is an easy-to-implement protocol designed to support immune balance and well-being before and after receiving a vaccination. See the chart below for our suggestions. If you would like more information or want to discuss options regarding supplementation, you can [book yourself in for a phone consultation here](https://app.simpleclinic.net/index.php/patient/a#/onlinebooking/practitioners/OPg). NOTES: - For those taking their booster shot, begin at week 5 of the above protocol. - For children aged between 5-11 (or under 45kg), half the recommended dose for each supplement. Above this age/weight, they can take the full adult dose. Virus & Vaccination Support [](/store/p118/Tri-Fortify.html) "}
