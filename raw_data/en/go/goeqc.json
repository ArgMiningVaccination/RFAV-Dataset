In the Western world, death is mostly a subject of avoidance and discomfort. Of course death can be uncomfortable, tragic, painful and melancholic, but it doesn't always need to be. If we can understand that death is both a natural and inevitable part of life as well as the impetus for new life, it may be easier to come to terms with and has the potential to become an energetic tool that we come to know and utilize effectively. The seasons of the year beautifully exemplify this sacred cycle of life, death and rebirth. During Autumn the plants begin to die and wither as they ready themselves for a time of rest and inactivity during the Winter months. After the cold seasons, we know and trust that the Earth begins blooming again in Spring and Summer. All things have their own life cycle. We can look at most facets of our personal lives as many tiny, individual cycles of life. People, relationships, ideas, creativity, emotions, personal growth, etc. all live in a cycle of life, death and rebirth. This way of thinking and perspective can be extremely beneficial and helpful in the evolution of our own lives. Seeing everything in a perspective of this transformation helps us to heal, grow, let go and move on and can be applied to virtually any situation or circumstance. You could look at a current or past relationship in chapters of life, death and rebirth to help you understand the events that occurred or to help you move forward in whatever way is needed. In many instances, death, dissolution and endings are absolutely necessary in order to move on to the next phase or stage of life. These endings can be painful and agonizing, but oftentimes this pain is a catalyst for something better. Sometimes, it's easier to understand these difficult chapters once you're out of them and on to the next. However, what if we were able to keep this perspective even when we are going through these challenging transitions and transformations? The medicine and lessons of that specific chapter could be that much deeper and richer. One helpful method to keep this mindset in any situation is to create and observe meaningful rebirth and transformation practices. There are many ways for you to ceremonialize your own personal cycle of transformation with intention and ritual. Creating your own unique rituals and ceremonies to help you through the many cycles of life, death and rebirth is a rewarding and balanced way to work through life's struggles and obstacles. Remember, rebirth and transformation rituals can be applied and used for almost any purpose or intention. Going through a breakup? Struggling to conjure up creative ideas? Breaking bad habits and patterns? Experiencing a total life transformation? Ritualize it with a ritual that is both personal and meaningful to you which can help you move beyond the death stage and take you to a new and beautiful chapter of rebirth and transformation. Utilizing aroma and scent during ceremonies and rituals can help turn these moments into a ritualized practice which you may find is helpful and needed every day, week, month or year. New Moons are excellent times to perform rebirth rituals as New Moon energy encourages us to begin anew in the darkness of possibility and hope. Reference our blog on [Moon Magik](/blogs/news/moon-magik-aromatherapy) on how to work with the phases of the Moon. Autumn and Winter are favorable times to dive deep into death and rebirth medicine, but you can experience healing and potent transformation at any time of the year.

There is no wrong way to create a Rebirth & Transformation altar, so long as it is unique and specific to you and your situation. Although Spring and Autumn would be great times energetically to create this kind of altar, you can channel these seasons at any time when their energy is helpful and beneficial. The Tantric Hindu Goddess Kali is cloaked in mystery. She is known as the fierce cosmic mother who transcends all forms. She helps liberate us from mental turmoil, cut karmic ties and transcend all ego. Kali provides the courage needed to go beyond our limitations, free ourselves from Earthly attachments and cast away illusions. As we find ourselves in a time of revolution, disease and regeneration, Kali provides the crucial force necessary for change and awakening. Though her forceful and untamed nature can be formidable, her raw powers are there for potent healing and to uncover our full divine potential. Kali is typically depicted as blue-black as midnight and luminous as the moon. Patchouli and Violet Leaf provide a powerful foundation for this dramatic, wild, transgressive goddess. Jasmine centers her in the divine feminine, while a touch of Allspice gives her audacious fierceness. Anubis, the jackal-headed Egyptian god, is a protector of the dead and an overseer of embalming and funerals. He has been called \"Lord of the Sacred Land,'' as well as \"God of Deserts and Darkness.\" He embodies a protective shaman or priest who guides mortals from one realm to another. Anubis also watches over and guides the souls of the dead on their journey from the physical realm to the afterlife.

Her torch shines dim moonlight to help us find our way through the darkness. She holds the key to enter and exit the underworld from the earthly realm and serves as protector and guide along the journey. The blend for Hekate was created around the highly spiritual Indian Spikenard oil, which was commonly used as an ointment in ancient times by priests, priestesses, queens and kings, as well as Jesus of Nazareth and Mary Magdalene, for its anchoring, calming and supernatural qualities. Joy-inducing Clementine and spicy Pimento Berry bring trust and courage to this enigmatic perfume. Ganesh, the elephant-headed Hindu god, is the great remover of obstacles who walks a path of trust and effortless mastery.

Ganesh reminds us to be present, that life's sacred journey is the destination and that the obstacles on our path are our teachings.
