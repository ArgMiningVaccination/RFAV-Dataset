THE GUIDANCE IS OV VERLY RESTRICTIVE OF PATENTABLE E SUBJECT MATTER The Guidance, in striving g to offer clarity in light of recent changes to the scope of patentable subject matter, appear rs to overreach in several key ways. First, the G Guidance goes further than required by recent Su upreme Court case law, sweeping too many t ype es of claims into the detailed \u00a7 101 analysis, partic cularly those that merely \"involve\" natural produ ucts. Second, the Guidance unnecessarily sugg gests that claims to products that are functionally y different from products found in nature are not p patent el igible . Third, the Guidance has the pote ential to unnecessarily hinder inventive ac ctivity in important fields, and appears to contra avene congressional intent with respect t to certain classes of natural products. A. Examining Man- Ma ade Products Under the Guidanc e's Multipart t Test Is Inconsistent with Su upreme Court Case Law The Guidance is overly b broad to the extent that it pulls claims involving nnatural products into its scope. Such claims, inclu uding, for example, those directed to derivatives s of natural product s and methods of treatme ent using natural products, have not been the sub bject of the Supreme Court's recent patentab ble subject matter decisions. Accordingly, there is no reason for the USPTO to treat these claims differently in light of Mayo and Myriad than it d did before these decisions. A fundamental, and costly y, shortcoming of the Guidance stems from the scope of its \"Question 2,\" which asks \" Does the claim recite or involve one or more judicial exceptions? \"2 Nothing in the Supreme Court's holdings, ho wever, suggests that the few judicia al exceptions to patentable subject matter cast any y shadows that render claims that merely involve e these judicial exceptions ineligible for patent p protection. The Supreme Court has e explained that \u00a7 101 was intended to, an d does, h have a \"wide scope.\"3 It has further cautioned d against \"read[ing] into the patent laws limitatio ons and conditions which the legislature h has not expressed.\"4 Accordingly, the judicial e exceptions to 2 Guidance at 3. 3Diamond v.

Myriad invo olved claims to two types of products: naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments and man n-made cDNA segments.6 Although the Court co oncluded that naturally occurring, isolated DNA A segments are not eligible for patent protection n under \u00a7 101, it concluded that cDNA segments d do meet the statute's eligibility requirements. It t reached this conclusion with a straightforward d analysis looking only at whether cDNA occurs s in nature: cDNA does not pr resent the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurrin ng, isolated DNA segments. As already explained d, creation of a cDN NA se quence from mRNA results in an exons- only l molecule that is n not naturally occurring. . . . cDNA retains the naturally occurrin ng exons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA A from which it was s derived. As a result, cDNA is not a \"product of f nature\" and is pa teent eligible under \u00a7 101 . . . .7 Having concluded that cDNA wa as not itself a natural product, the Court did not r resort to a multifactor, totality of the circum mstances analysis. Rather, it found the man -mad de origin of cDNA dispositive on its own. Significantly, both Myria ad and Mayo emphasized that their holdings shou uld not be read to apply to other categories of claim ms not at issue in these cases. In explaining that it was \"important to note what is not im mplicated by this decision ,\"8 the Myriad Court po ointed out that no method claims nor patents on new w applications of knowledge about the covered genes were g before it. The Court noted that \" \"[h]ad Myriad created an innovative method of m manipulating genes while searching for the BR RCA1 and BRCA2 genes, it could possibly have e sought a method patent.\"9 Similarly, it commende ed Judge Bryson's conclusion, the Federal Circu uit opinion, that Myriad could claim applications sof knowledge about the covered genes, implicit tly accepting that such applications are el igible for patent protection under \u00a7 101. Both method cla aims involving the covered genes and application ns of knowledge about the covered genes involv ve a judicial exception. Yet, the Myriad Cour rt assumed that such claims were patent eligible without any h int of a deeper, multifactor analysis. . 5Mayo , 132 S. Ct. at 1293; see also Ali ice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v.

In finding ineligible e claims to methods instructing physicians to ap pply the natural law, the Court explicitly distingu uished two types of claims that involved the natu ural law: cl aims to a \"new drug\" and claims to \" aa new way of using an existing drug .\"10 Mayo 's holding was simply that a patent applicant can nnot claim the natural law; it did not say that a p patent applicant cannot seek claims that somehow w involve the natural law, and it did not say that, , if they did so, a multifactor test would be necessa ary to evaluate patent eligibility. The Supreme Court's mo ost recent patentable subject matter opinion, Alic ce Corp. v.

If so , we then ask, \"[w]hat el lse is there in the clai ims before us?\" . . . To answer that question, we consider the eleme ents of each claim both individually and \"as an ordered combinati ion\" to determine whether the additional elements \"transfor rm the nature of the claim\" into a patent -eligible e application.11 The USPTO's preliminary exami ination instructions in view of Alice appear to ac cknowledge this language in the Supreme Court's s opinion,12 instructing examiners to \"d etermine whether the claim is directed to a judicial exc ception, \"13 and stating that \"an invention is not r rendered ineligible simply because it invol lves an abstract concept .\"14 In contrast, by c hanneling g claims that in any way involve natural products s and natural laws into its \"significantly differe ent\" test, the Guidance imposes a requirement th hat goes beyond, and contravenes, these Supreme Court holdings.

It is costly and d unnecessary to sweep such claims into the multi ifactor test set forth in the Guidance. Two other types of cases are illustrative: derivatives of natural products a and method of treatment claims. Example B of the Guidan nce discusses three c laims: (1) a claim to \"purifie ed amazonic acid,\" which contains a natural p product compound; (2) a claim to \"purified 5 -me ethyl amazonic acid,\" which contains a man- mad de derivative of a natural product compound; and d (3) a method of treating colon cancer using a s specific dose of amazonic acid at a specified freq quency and for a specified period of time. The Gu uidance analyzes each of these three claims unde er the \"significantly different\" test, con ncluding that the first claim recites a judicial exc ception and that the second and third claims invol lve a judicial exception. Yet, subjecting these la atter two claims to the \"significantly different\" tes st is unnecessary and inconsistent with the Supr reme Court's holdings. Claim 2 of Example B rec cites a man -made derivative of a natural product t. The Guidance concludes that it \" recites (or may y recite) a judicial exception, i.e., amazonic acid is a naturally occurring chemical found in the l leaves of Amazonian cherry trees ,\" then proceed ds to conclude (correctly) that the claim is direc cted to patentable subject matter under the \"signi ificantly different\" test because it has both h structural and functional differences from natu urally occurring amazonic acid. Under the Suprem me Court's case law, however, these conclusion ns were unnecessary to resolve the \u00a7 101 question. 5 -methyl amazonic acid \"is not occurring\" and \"is from the [natural product] from which it was derived.\"15 It, like all other derivatives of natural products, is s analogous to the cDNA that the Supreme Courrt summarily found patent eligible in Myriad . Subjecting derivatives of natural products to the e 12-factor \"significantly different\" test is th herefore unnecessary and wasteful, at best ( i.e., i if the examiner ultimately allows the claim), or d directly co ntrary to Myriad , at worst ( i.e., if the e examiner rejects the claim). Claim 3 of Example B, w which recites a specific method of treatment usin ng amazonic acid, presents a similar problem.

A frequent embodiment of this problem w will be formulated drugs where the activ ve ingredient itself is a natural product. Although h the Guidance includes one example e discussing claims to combinations of natural pr roducts, that example (which is dir rected to a combination of bacteria) is of limited d use to the industry because it me erely recites the facts and outcome of one Supre eme Court case. Further examples con nfirming the patent eligibility of man -made comp positions that include one or more n natural components (like the firework, or a pharm maceutical composition) would b be helpful to both applicants and examiners. 2. Examiners an nd Applicants Require More Complete Exam mples of How the Guidance Is t to Be Implemented in Prosecution The Guid ance could also be enhanced by adding either stand -alone exam mples or additional material to the existing g examples demonstrating what type of response e by a patent applicant would be sufficient to o overcome a rejection under the \"significantly dif fferent\" test . The examples, as written, focus o on how the examining corps should review appli ications to make initial rejections for \u00a7 101 issues, , but they provide little information regarding ar rguments or evidence that would be sufficient t to rebut rejections under the Guidance's test. T The examining corps would benefit from additio onal instruction on how to apply the Guidance in n back -and-forth exchanges with applicants. The Guidance recognizes s that \"[t] he examiner's analysis should carefully y consider every relevant fact or and related eviden nce.\"45 This makes clear that the Guidance cont templates some examination of material outside t the claims themselves, and possibly even outside e the four corners of the application, to dete ermine patent eligibility under \u00a7 101. According gly, in response to a rejecti on under the Guidance e's test, patent practitioners will be faced with th he decision of whether to argue based on the cla aim language or specification, and/or submit add ditional evidence, beyond that considered d by the examiner, to make a case for patent elig gibility. The examples, however, do not offer instruction on what evidence that might be or th he threshold to which the evidence must rise in o order to overcome the rejection. Without such e examples, examiners will be left to develop p their own standards, which may vary widely.
