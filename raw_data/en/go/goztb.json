Discourages Johnson & Johnson Vaccine The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Thursday that Covid vaccines other than Johnson & Johnson's should be preferred, after its advisers cited increasing evidence that the company's shots can trigger a rare blood clotting disorder now linked to dozens of cases and at least nine deaths in the United States in the past year. The decision adopted a recommendation by an expert panel that effectively discouraged vaccine providers and adults from using Johnson & Johnson's shot. New data showed that there was a higher risk for the blood clotting condition than previously known. The risk was greatest among women 30 to 49, estimated at 1 in 100,000 who had received the company's shot. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is not being removed from the market. It will remain an option for people who are \"unable or unwilling\" to receive the more popular shots from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, the agency said. The recommendation is the latest setback for a vaccine that has largely fallen out of favor in the United States. The company's vaccine has not fulfilled its early promise as a traditional, one-and-done format that would be easy to deploy in more isolated or rural communities, or among people skittish about receiving two doses. [About 16 million people](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total) in the United States have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as their primary immunization, compared with 73 million fully immunized with Moderna's vaccine and 114 million with the Pfizer-BioNTech shots. Among Americans who have received a booster, just 1.6 percent chose Johnson & Johnson. This week, the Food and Drug Administration [issued updated guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/146304/download) on the risks of the blood clotting disorder linked to Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, but reiterated that the benefits outweighed its risks. Dozens of countries have authorized Johnson & Johnson's vaccine and have been using it as part of their immunization campaigns. But while it remains in high demand in some parts of the world, it has lost popularity in many countries because of safety concerns and its relative lower effectiveness against Covid. Some governments have already moved to put restrictions on Johnson & Johnson's shot because of the blood clotting risk. [Finland](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/finland-to-exclude-johnson-johnson-from-covid-vaccine-program), [Denmark](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/denmark-continues-exclude-jj-covid-19-vaccine-national-roll-out-tv-2-2021-06-25/) and [Slovenia](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-11-slovenia-halts-johnson-vaccinations-death.html) stopped using it, and several other nations have ranked it lower for use than Pfizer-BioNTech's and Moderna's vaccines. Some countries also have advised doctors to counsel women under 50 of the potential risk. The C.D.C. panel's recommendation lands in the middle of a surge in virus cases driven by the Delta coronavirus variant and Omicron, the latest version that has already become dominant in some countries and is spreading fast in Britain and the United States. Several laboratory experiments suggest that a single dose of Johnson & Johnson's shot may offer little defense against infection with Omicron. The company [said late last month](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-to-evaluate-its-covid-19-vaccine-against-new-omicron-covid-19-variant) that it was testing blood samples from clinical trial participants who have received its shot as a booster to see how their vaccine-induced antibodies fare against Omicron. At Thursday's meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, C.D.C. officials went [into detail](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-12-16/02-COVID-See-508.pdf) on the clotting-related syndrome identified in 54 people in the United States who received the shot before the end of August. Overall, the rate of the condition was 3.8 cases per one million people given the vaccine. People who received a Johnson & Johnson shot months ago are not thought to be at risk for the clotting condition because the onset of symptoms typically occurred about nine days after vaccination in the diagnosed cases. An increased risk for the condition has also been linked to the shot from AstraZeneca, which is not authorized in the United States. It has not been linked to the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. Evidence has increasingly shown that one dose of Johnson & Johnson's shot offers much less protection against infection than other vaccines. Federal health officials [in October authorized](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/politics/fda-boosters-moderna-johnson-johnson.html) boosters for people who had received a single shot of the company's vaccine at least two months earlier. They allowed for a \"mix and match\" approach, allowing people to get a second shot, but of a Pfizer or a Moderna vaccine. [Offices are](#return-to-office-omicron) canceling holiday parties. Broadway performances [are being shuttered](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/theater/broadway-coronavirus-cancellations.html) because of breakthrough infections among the casts. College finals [are being moved online](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/nyregion/nyu-events-canceled-covid.html), and some colleges and universities are [switching back to remote instruction](https://news.stanford.edu/report/2021/12/16/first-two-weeks-winter-classes/) after the winter break, at least for a time. Coronavirus cases are spiking again in New York City, beyond anything seen since last winter, and in much of the United States, where the Delta variant remains by far the dominant version. The country is reporting [more than 120,000](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) new cases a day on average, [according to a New York Times database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) \u2014 a 40 percent increase from two weeks ago, and 70 percent more than when cases stopped falling in early November. While most people who are unvaccinated remain at much higher risk, a combination of factors \u2014 widespread transmission, waning immunity and the circulation of highly infectious variants \u2014 [has led to breakthrough infections among the vaccinated](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/10/28/us/covid-breakthrough-cases.html). Several new laboratory studies indicate that vaccines, and especially boosters, may offer substantial protection against [the worst outcomes](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/health/omicron-vaccine-severe-disease.html) from the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant. Still, the new variant will infect many people who have been vaccinated or recovered from older versions of the virus, according to the research. The United States passed two milestones this week \u2014 [50 million total known cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/us/50-million-covid-cases.html) and [800,000 total deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/us/covid-deaths-united-states.html) \u2014 and experts say the addition of Omicron is likely to push the trajectory up even more. So will the holiday season, public health officials say, as people travel and families gather indoors, where the virus spreads most readily. Coronavirus cases in the United States by region This chart shows how reported cases per capita have changed in different parts of the country. The state with the highest recent cases per capita is shown. Outbreaks are growing most severely around the Great Lakes and in the Northeast. Connecticut is averaging more than 2,600 new cases a day, up from about 330 at the start of November, and Rhode Island is adding cases at the highest rate in the country. Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania have the highest rates of coronavirus hospitalizations. In some hard-hit states, federal medical workers have been sent to help exhausted hospital staff. About 68,000 coronavirus patients are hospitalized nationwide, a 21 percent increase from two weeks ago, but well below the levels seen over the summer and at last winter's peak. Biden administration officials are bracing for a potential wave of Omicron infections that could overwhelm the health care system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [warned recently that the percentage of coronavirus cases in the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/science/omicron-cdc.html) caused by Omicron had increased sharply and might portend a surge in infections as soon as next month. The administration is trying to encourage all Americans who are eligible \u2014 those 16 and older who received their second Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine dose at least six months ago, or the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot at least two months ago \u2014 to get a booster. Across the country, cultural institutions and many ordinary Americans are reconsidering what is safe. The Metropolitan Opera [announced on Wednesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/arts/music/met-opera-coronavirus-booster-shots-mandate.html) that, starting next month, it would require booster shots for all eligible employees and audience members. The [N.F.L.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/sports/football/nfl-covid-vaccine-booster-shots.html) and [N.B.A.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/sports/basketball/nba-covid.html) are discussing changes to their protocols in response to a wave of infections among players. Some Wall Street banks [are telling workers who had been going into the office to stay home over the holidays](#return-to-office-omicron). Similar surges, and accompanying crackdowns, are happening in many countries, especially in Europe. The French government on Thursday [banned nonessential travel to and from Britain and tightened testing requirements for travelers](#france-uk-travel-restrictions-omicron), as a record-breaking surge of Omicron cases in Britain raised worries that France would soon face a similar tsunami of new infections. As of Thursday, an average of 3,700 new cases per day were being reported in New York City, a level not seen since early April. New York State, which reports cases before the city does, showed caseloads skyrocketing further, with more than [18,000 new cases on Thursday, 8,300 of them in New York City](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/positive-tests-over-time-region-and-county) \u2014 levels not seen since the holiday spike last January. New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, announced that the state would let New Yorkers in areas with low vaccination rates and high case numbers [request home delivery of rapid tests](#hochul-new-york-omicron-testing), and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City announced a six-step plan to combat the surge, including more testing and enforcement of mask mandates. Officially, the city's monitoring system had only picked up the Omicron variant in about 1 percent of cases it has analyzed as of the week of December 4. But the C.D.C. recently reported in that in the region encompassing New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, about 13 percent of cases were Omicron. \"We have seen a very substantial increase in Covid cases in the last few days. It is clear that the omicron variant is here in New York City in full force,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday. Sarah Gancher, a teacher at The New School who lives in Queens, said eight of her friends who were fully vaccinated had tested positive this week. The speed at which cases have surged has frightened her, she said. \"It's literally all I've been thinking about,\" Ms. Gancher said. Sitting on a bench in Madison Square Park in Manhattan on Thursday morning, she opened her bag to show the five at-home testing kits she had just bought. Several holiday parties she had planned to attend this weekend had been canceled, and although she had tickets booked to fly home to California to visit her family, she said she wasn't sure how safe that would be anymore. \"I'm really heartsick and worried,\" she said.

The Biden administration on Thursday filed two [emergency](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21A240/205449/20211216174120640_Biden%20v.%20Missouri%20-%20CMS%20Vaccine%20Mandate%20Stay%20Application.pdf) [applications](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21A241/205447/20211216173745233_Becerra%20v.%20Louisiana%20-%20CMS%20Vaccine%20Mandate%20Stay%20Application.pdf) in the Supreme Court, asking the justices to revive a requirement that health care workers at hospitals that receive federal money be vaccinated against the coronavirus. The requirement, Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar told the court, \"will save hundreds or even thousands of lives each month.\" Federal judges in Missouri and Louisiana have blocked the requirement, which has exemptions for people with medical or religious objections, in rulings that apply in about half of the states. In [the Missouri case](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21A240/205449/20211216174132311_21A__%20Biden%20v.%20Missouri%20-CMS%20Mandate%20-%20Appendix%20to%20Govt%20Stay%20Application.pdf), brought by 10 states, [Judge Matthew T. Schelp](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/schelp-matthew-thomas) ruled that the administration had exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the requirement and that it had not followed proper procedures in doing so. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, declined to stay that ruling while an appeal moved forward. In [the Louisiana case](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21A241/205447/20211216173757030_21A__%20Becerra%20v.%20Louisiana%20-%20CMS%20Mandate%20-%20Appendix%20to%20Govt%20Stay%20Application.pdf), brought by 14 states, [Judge Terry A. Doughty](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/doughty-terry-alvin) blocked the requirement for similar reasons. Calling it a \"close call,\" a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit refused to issue a stay while the administration appealed. Ms. Prelogar told the justices that the administration's position was supported by \"both science and common sense.\" \"Requiring health care workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid to be vaccinated,\" she wrote, \"protects the health and safety of patients at those facilities by reducing their risk of contracting the virus that causes Covid-19.\" The vast majority of active-duty troops in the Army and Navy are vaccinated against the coronavirus, and [the small number of those still refusing shots will soon be dismissed from the military,](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/us/politics/military-vaccine-mandate.html) officials said Thursday. In the Army, 468,459 active-duty soldiers, or 98 percent, have received at least one dose of the vaccine. The Navy has inoculated 342,974 members, with roughly 1.7 percent still holding out. Among the unvaccinated, however, are some who have medical and administrative waivers or pending requests, or have already signed up for shots. Army officials said that less than one percent of active-force members have refused the vaccination order without a pending or approved exemption. Thousands of troops requested religious exemptions, but none have been granted, officials said. On Wednesday, the Senate passed final legislation that would prohibit the service branches from dishonorably discharging any member who refused to get the coronavirus vaccine. The measure, which was supported by Republicans in the House and the Senate, allows those who declined the vaccine to receive certain benefits after leaving the military. Earlier this week, five governors wrote [a joint letter](https://governor.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Joint%20Governors%20Letter%20to%20SECDEF%20-%20NG%20Vaccine%20Mandate%2012.14.2021.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) to Defense Secretary [Lloyd J. Austin III](https://apnews.com/article/sexual-assault-lloyd-austin-government-and-politics-13077b68cbaf65e8ad862a00aa3c5552) asking that their National Guard troops be exempted from a federal coronavirus vaccine mandate, escalating what had been a single state conflict over inoculations. While National Guard troops helped oversee large vaccine sites for Americans across the country last year, they have lagged behind their active-duty counterparts in getting shots. The French government on Thursday banned nonessential travel to and from Britain and tightened testing requirements for travelers, as [a record-breaking surge of Omicron cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/world/europe/uk-covid-record-cases.html) across the English Channel raised worries that France would soon face a similar tsunami of new infections. Jean Castex, France's prime minister, said in a statement that, \"faced with the extremely rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the United Kingdom,\" the government had decided to act. He urged people planning to travel to Britain to postpone their trips. British authorities reported 88,376 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the highest number of known infections in a single day since the start of the pandemic. England's chief medical officer warned that further records would likely be broken in the coming days, with [cases of the Omicron variant doubling less than every two days](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/world/europe/uk-omicron-surge.html) in parts of the country. Mr. Castex said that starting Saturday, travel to or from Britain would be allowed for only \"urgent\" reasons \u2014 like a family medical emergency or a legal summons \u2014 regardless of the traveler's vaccination status. The new restrictions effectively bar French and British tourists during the busy holiday season. Nonessential business trips are also banned under the new restrictions, Mr. Castex said, but he added that the new rules would not apply to French citizens living in Britain who wish to return to France. Those who do leave Britain for France will face stricter testing requirements, even if they are vaccinated. All travelers will have to present a negative virus test taken within 24 hours of departure, down from 48 hours. (The 24-hour rule already existed for unvaccinated travelers.) All travelers arriving from Britain will also have to register online and isolate for up to 10 days. However, they can take a test 48 hours after arrival, and if that comes back negative, they can end their isolation period. France is already facing a [surge in cases](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/france-covid-cases.html) attributed to the Delta variant, pressuring a hospital system that is short-staffed and under strain after nearly two years of battling the virus. Nearly 3,000 Covid-19 patients are in intensive care, the highest level since June, and the authorities expect that number to rise to 4,000 by the end of the year. Gabriel Attal, a French government spokesman, [told the BFMTV news channel](https://www.bfmtv.com/sante/omicron-attal-annonce-240-cas-en-france-et-des-controles-plus-drastiques-avec-le-royaume-uni_AV-202112160158.html) on Thursday that the goal of the new travel restrictions was to \"slow down and reduce as much as possible the arrival of cases of the Omicron variant on our soil.\" Mr. Attal said that 240 cases of the variant had already been detected in France, but he added that \"there are probably more.\" The government is convening a special cabinet meeting on Friday over the virus, and could announce more new measures in the coming days. France recently [closed nightclubs for four weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/06/world/omicron-variant-covid/france-closes-nightclubs-for-four-weeks-but-rejects-adding-other-major-restrictions) and tightened some restrictions in schools. But President Emmanuel Macron, who is widely expected to run for re-election in April, has ruled out any additional lockdowns, curfews or closures, arguing that heightened vigilance around social distancing, coupled with a swift booster shot campaign, would be enough to keep the surges in check. In a [televised interview](https://www.tf1.fr/tf1/edition-speciale/videos/emmanuel-macron-ou-va-la-france-94811115.html) on Wednesday evening, Mr. Macron said it was likely that additional Covid-19 booster shots would be necessary in the future. Facing the threat of the fast-spreading Omicron variant, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said on Thursday that her administration would create a portal through which residents could request that coronavirus tests be sent to their homes, and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City announced a six-step plan to combat a winter surge. Under Ms. Hochul's plan, New York [will join a handful of states](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/us/massachusetts-free-covid-test.html), including neighboring New Jersey, in offering home delivery of tests as part of a growing effort to ensure broad access. Mr. de Blasio's plan includes expanding the hours and capacity of testing sites, distributing a million free KN-95 masks and 500,000 home tests through community organizations, increasing enforcement of mask and vaccine mandates, and encouraging more New Yorkers to get boosters. Ms. Hochul said the state would not be able to mail tests to all New Yorkers, suggesting that they would be \"microtargeted\" to areas where vaccination is lagging and cases are high. She urged New Yorkers to get vaccinated and boosted, and described at-home tests as a tool that unvaccinated people could use to avoid infecting others. \"We're making sure they at least know if they're contagious, so they have the sense to stay home,\" she said. The governor opened her briefing with a presentation from the new state health commissioner, Mary Bassett, on [the trajectory of the virus in Norway and Denmark, where drastic spikes have been predicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/health/omicron-cases-denmark-norway.html). Because of how fast Omicron appears to be spreading, they cautioned, New York could see heightened levels of spread and increased hospitalizations as a result of the sheer number of possible new cases, regardless of whether the variant proves to cause more severe illness. The Delta variant remains the dominant version across the United States, but the C.D.C. recently reported that in the region encompassing New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, about 13 percent of cases were Omicron. Ms. Hochul reiterated that the rising case numbers and hospitalizations were both serious and expected, and defended her new mandate, which went into effect on Monday and requires people to wear masks indoors in public unless proof of full vaccination is required for entry. Several new laboratory studies indicate that vaccines, and especially boosters, may offer substantial protection against [the worst outcomes](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/health/omicron-vaccine-severe-disease.html) from the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant. Still, the new variant will infect many people who have been vaccinated or recovered from older versions of the virus, according to the research. Previously, the Hochul administration announced it would make a million at-home tests available through vaccination sites, testing sites, booster sites and schools. At-home tests have become one of the hottest commodities this holiday season, with kits flying off the shelves. Ms. Hochul said she hoped more kits would become available now that the number of companies manufacturing them has increased to 13 from eight. The Biden administration recently [announced that it would soon require](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/upshot/biden-covid-rapid-tests.html) private insurers to reimburse people for at-home tests, although consumers will still pay the cost up front. To [help alleviate the financial burden of testing](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/health/coronavirus-testing-holidays.html), experts advise people to contact their employer's human resources department or benefits to ask about available testing resources, or to contact their local health departments to ask whether and where free tests might be available. New York City, for instance, runs [\"Covid Express\" testing sites](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-rapid-testing.page) throughout the city, promising to return P.C.R. results in 24 hours or less. Most residents receive their results the same day, the health department says. The tests are available by appointment only but are free for all New Yorkers. The federal government has [suggested](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/us/politics/omicron-federal-funds.html) that it may make more funding available to handle testing given the Omicron surge. \"It's as bad as we expected,\" Ms. Hochul said Thursday, urging New Yorkers to follow public health guidance in the face of a winter wave. \"We're asking people to follow common sense. Get vaccinated, get boosted. Please don't take a chance.\" In New York City, the seven-day average of new daily cases has tripled in the past month, Dr. Dave Chokshi, the city's health commissioner, said on Thursday, and the city expects it to continue increasing. Only 1.5 million New Yorkers, or about 22 percent of adults, have gotten a booster or additional dose, according to city statistics. \"The data is showing an alarming trend,\" Dr. Chokshi said. The city's test positivity rate was now above 5 percent and has risen quickly over the past few days, he added, \"and we believe that is attributable primarily to the spread of Omicron.\" The rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus continues to upend companies' plans and force changes to policies. Some of the latest developments: Citigroup sent a memo to its staff in New York and New Jersey giving them the option to work from home through the holidays given the surge in cases in the New York metropolitan area. JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley haven't changed their policies, staff are being given the flexibility to work from home, according to people familiar with the situation who declined to be identified discussing personnel matters. JPMorgan Chase's huge health care conference is going virtual. The event, set to begin on Jan. 10, is moving online \"out of an abundance of caution,\" the bank [told attendees on Wednesday](https://twitter.com/adamfeuerstein/status/1471115460913602561). Goldman Sachs reportedly told teams in New York to cancel holiday parties. The bank has [already held several parties](https://www.ft.com/content/d055d4da-d85f-41a0-b63f-e7b20d623008)over the past few weeks. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are reportedly allowing individual teams and departments to go ahead with holiday parties (for now). Apple delayed its return to office \"to a date yet to be determined.\" The company [told employees on Wednesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/technology/apple-return-to-work.html)of the change in plans after already pushing back its return date three times. It also [temporarily shut stores](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/apple-temporarily-closes-three-stores-in-response-to-rising-covid-rates.html)in Annapolis, Md., Miami and Ottawa in response to a rise in coronavirus cases. Several Broadway shows were canceled and the Metropolitan Opera will require booster shots. The [cancellations](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/theater/broadway-coronavirus-cancellations.html)came after cast or crew members for shows, including \"Hamilton,\" tested positive. The Met's new rule [mandating boosters for staff and audience members](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/arts/music/met-opera-coronavirus-booster-shots-mandate.html), which takes effect on Jan. 17, makes it the first major performing arts institution to introduce such a measure. \"Everyone is going to be doing this,\" said Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager. Lananh Nguyen contributed reporting. Only a little more than half of nursing home residents in the United States have received a coronavirus booster shot, according to federal officials, even as infections continue to occur among residents and employees and the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said about [55 percent of residents](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/covid19/ltc-vaccination-dashboard.html) had received a vaccine booster as of the end of last week. In states like Arizona, Florida and Nevada, the figure is less than 40 percent. More than a dozen states, including Connecticut, Minnesota and New York, have boosted 60 to 75 percent of their nursing home residents, according to the federal data, which does not include reporting from every facility. As Covid cases climb among nursing home residents with waning immunity \u2014 a trend that may be further fueled by the coming holidays and the Omicron variant \u2014 federal officials are emphasizing the importance of providing booster shots as quickly as possible. The rollout in nursing homes has appeared to be [lagging](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/27/health/covid-nursing-home-booster.html) in recent weeks, with little public information being released about the efforts until recently. At a White House [ press briefing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/12/15/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-73/) this week, Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, alluded to updated vaccination rates as showing significant progress. \"We know we have more work to do,\" she said. \"C.D.C. is working in close partnership with states, localities and providers across the country to expand access to boosters and to ensure that every state has access to the resources and support they need to protect those at highest risk, including residents of long-term care facilities.\" Boosters seem particularly important in protecting nursing home residents, many of whom are old and at high risk of severe illness, Dr. Walensky said. They were among the first to receive the initial vaccines, and it is likely their immunity to the virus has waned. Those who have received a booster \"have a 10 times lower rate of getting SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to those residents who have only received a primary vaccination series or are unvaccinated,\" she said. The nursing home industry has defended its efforts to get residents boosted but acknowledged the newfound urgency. \"Given new data indicating that Omicron is highly contagious and that boosters are critical for nursing home residents, we need to increase the pace and are strongly encouraging long-term care providers to double down on their booster shot efforts,\" Dr. David Gifford, the chief medical officer at the American Health Care Association, a trade group, said in a statement. The European Medicines Agency said on Thursday that it was recommending the use of an antiviral treatment developed by Pfizer to treat some adults who contract the coronavirus and are at risk of severe disease. The agency, which regulates drugs in the European Union, said the Pfizer treatment, called Paxlovid and taken in pill form, was expected to reduce the need for hospitalization. The agency has yet to authorize Paxlovid, but said its recommendation paved the way for national governments to start using the treatment on an emergency basis \"in the light of rising rates of infections and deaths\" across the continent. One member nation, Italy, has already ordered a supply of Paxlovid. European Union officials warned on Wednesday that the highly contagious Omicron variant could be the dominant cause of coronavirus cases in the bloc as soon as mid-January, and may drive up numbers of hospitalizations and deaths. The bloc's infectious disease agency has said Omicron poses a \"very high\" risk. In a clinical trial, Pfizer reported, Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization or death in unvaccinated, medically vulnerable patients by 88 percent if given within five days of the onset of symptoms. Though the Delta variant was dominant during the clinical trial, the company said this month that Paxlovid also worked well in studies against [the Omicron variant](https://www.nytimes.com/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant.html). In its recommendation on Thursday, the European Medicines Agency said that the treatment could be used in patients who did not require supplemental oxygen, and that it should be administered as soon as possible after a Covid-19 diagnosis and within five days of the start of symptoms. The agency gave similar advice last month for an anti-Covid pill developed by Merck, which seems to be substantially less effective than Pfizer's. The agency is formally reviewing both treatments. About two-thirds of the E.U.'s residents have been fully vaccinated, and about 14 percent have received a booster shot. But it remains uncertain how well current vaccines protect against the Omicron variant. And some member nations, especially along the bloc's eastern edge, lag far behind in vaccinations. The head of the bloc's infectious disease agency warned on Wednesday that there was no time left to close the gaps in vaccination rates before the worst of Omicron hits, so the bloc should not expect vaccinations alone to blunt the surge in cases. Though the Canadian province of Ontario is racing to offer booster doses and rapid antigen tests to curb coronavirus spread, that may not be enough to head off a huge surge in new cases caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant, a provincial scientific advisory panel warned on Thursday. Citing new projections from [computer models](https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Update-on-COVID-19-Projections_English_2021.12.16.pdf), the panel urged officials to take more preventive steps immediately, or face the prospect of overwhelmed hospitals, \"unsustainable levels\" of intensive-care demand, and daily case records beyond any yet seen during the pandemic. The province is already taking some of the recommended steps. It [announced on Wednesday](https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1001352/all-ontarians-18-eligible-for-covid-19-booster-appointments-at-three-month-interval) that it was widening eligibility for booster shots and imposing capacity limits on large indoor venues, among other measures. Omicron is poised to overtake Delta as the dominant virus variant in the province, according to new projections released on Thursday by the panel, known as the Ontario Covid-19 Science Advisory Table. Increased vaccination alone would not be sufficient to stunt the Omicron-fueled wave, the panel warned. It called for adopting \"circuit breakers\" like limits on person-to-person contact and more rapid testing to \"help buy time\" for vaccine booster shots to be administered and take full effect. The measures are not \"any sort of new things that we haven't seen before,\" Adalsteinn Brown, a co-chair of the advisory panel, said during a news conference on Thursday. \"It's those core public health measures.\" Citing hard-hit businesses and schools, he added, \"I recognize that these are very, very hard decisions, and I don't think that we need to necessarily stop things full-out.\" The Ontario government [announced ](https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1001352/all-ontarians-18-eligible-for-covid-19-booster-appointments-at-three-month-interval)on Wednesday that it would expand eligibility for booster shots to anyone 18 or older, effective Dec. 20, and that it was preparing to administer 200,000 to 300,000 vaccine doses a day. It also said indoor venues like sports arenas, museums and casinos that can accommodate more than 1,000 people would be limited to 50 percent of capacity starting Saturday. \"Today's modeling would not have factored this action into their assumptions,\" Alexandra Hilkene, a spokesperson for Ontario's health minister, wrote in an emailed statement. Ms. Hilkene noted that the province was offering free rapid antigen tests through schools, government-run liquor stores and other outlets. Close to 88 percent of Ontarians 12 and older are [fully vaccinated](https://twitter.com/celliottability/status/1471499637022289929), according to the minister of health. But it remains unclear how well existing vaccines protect against the variant. The leader of the United Nations expressed worry on Thursday that its health agency's Covid-19 strategy would fall well short of year-end and mid-2022 vaccination targets, a failure he blamed on the rich-poor divide in access to vaccines that had given coronavirus variants \"a free pass to run wild.\" Speaking at his customary [end-of-year meeting with journalists](https://www.un.org/sg/en/node/261225), Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres also acknowledged that the pandemic, about to enter its third year, was not going away. \"If things do not improve \u2014 and improve fast \u2014 we face even harder times ahead,\" Mr. Guterres said at the meeting, held virtually from his Manhattan home to minimize the risk of inadvertently spreading the virus. While Mr. Guterres has not tested positive for the virus, he has been in contact with his spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, who said on Wednesday that he had tested positive. Both have been fully vaccinated and received boosters. Mr. Guterres has been an outspoken critic of what he has described as a moral \"obscenity\" of affluent countries hoarding or wasting vaccines while lower-income countries are struggling to obtain enough \u2014 or any at all. Mr. Guterres said the World Health Organization had aimed to vaccinate at least 40 percent of people in all countries by year's end and 70 percent by mid-2022. But 98 countries won't meet that end-of-year target, Mr. Guterres said, and 40 of them had not been able to vaccinate even 10 percent of their populations. Moreover, he said, vaccination rates in high-income countries were eight times higher than in the countries of Africa, which may not be able to meet the 70 percent goal until August 2024. \"Vaccine inequity is giving variants a free pass to run wild \u2014 ravaging the health of people and economies in every corner of the globe,\" he said. \"We cannot defeat the pandemic in an uncoordinated way.\" Earlier Thursday, the director general of the W.H.O., Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also expressed alarm about low vaccination rates in poorer parts of the world, particularly in Africa. Speaking at a public health conference on Africa, Dr. Tedros commended what he described as the most ambitious vaccination effort ever undertaken over the past year, with more than 8.5 billion doses administered, which he said had achieved a vaccination percentage of 43 percent for the world population as a whole. But that figure obscured the vaccination rate in Africa, which is only 8 percent. Dr. Tedros also acknowledged that [\"we are still a long way\" ](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1471505960531230724)from reaching the W.H.O.'s vaccination targets for 2021 and mid-2022. An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the spokesman for Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general. He is St\u00e9phane Dujarric, not Guterres.

A day later, Queen Elizabeth II canceled her annual pre-Christmas lunch for the royal family, according to people with connections to Buckingham Palace. The queen's decision to call off the lunch for the second year in a row comes as Britain reported a [record 78,610 new infections](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) from the virus on Wednesday. Palace officials said it was a precautionary measure to avoid putting family members at risk by bringing a large group together at Windsor Castle. The pre-Christmas meal is a longstanding tradition for the House of Windsor, assembling children, grandchildren, cousins and other members of the extended family before the queen leaves for Sandringham, her country estate in Norfolk, where she celebrates the holiday with her immediate family. Elizabeth, 95, has largely receded from public view since October, when she abruptly canceled a trip to Northern Ireland after what palace officials characterized as exhaustion. She has continued to conduct video calls and taped a speech to welcome delegates to the United Nations' climate conference in Scotland. The queen sequestered herself inside Windsor Castle with her husband, Prince Philip, for the first year of the pandemic. When Philip died in April, coronavirus restrictions forced the queen to grieve alone in a choir stall at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, kept apart from other members of her family. But the queen ventured back onto the public stage after that, welcoming leaders to the Group of 7 summit in Cornwall and playing host to President Biden and his wife, Jill, at Windsor Castle in June. She was a spry presence at those events, though palace officials said she overdid it and became fatigued. The royal family's holiday celebrations were already going to be missing key members: Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, as well as their children, Archie and Lilibet, are not expected to travel from their home in Montecito, Calif., to Britain for Christmas. The Washington Post will bring all its employees back to the office by mid-February and mandate booster shots and weekly testing for every staff member. The Post delivered its latest return-to-office guidance to staff at a town-hall meeting on Wednesday and in an email (titled \"Coronavirus Update #44\") on Thursday, which was reviewed by The New York Times. From Feb. 15, all employees based in major office locations will be required to work from the office at least three days a week, the email said. Managers must return to their offices three days a week from Jan. 31. The email said that more than 99 percent of The Post's work force was already vaccinated, but \"out of an abundance of caution, we are taking the additional step of requiring weekly testing for everyone returning to an office location, beginning on Jan. 31, 2022.\" The Post said in the email that there would be on-site testing clinics with rapid antigen tests in its Chicago, San Francisco, New York and Washington offices. The Post staff were first told about the booster mandate in a Dec. 10 email, which was reiterated on Thursday. \"Booster shots are now incorporated into our mandatory vaccination policy \u2014 that is, they are a condition of employment, regardless of your location,\" the email on Thursday said. The email noted that those who had children under the age of 5 or lived with someone who was immunocompromised could apply for a temporary extension to work from home full time. As the [Omicron variant](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/briefing/omicron-update-spread-vaccines.html) sweeps through the United States, other companies have begun mandating booster shots for employees. The National Football League said [on Monday](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/sports/football/nfl-covid-vaccine-booster-shots.html) that it would mandate boosters for coaches and staff members who work directly with the players. The Metropolitan Opera announced [on Wednesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/arts/music/met-opera-coronavirus-booster-shots-mandate.html) that it would require booster shots of all employees and audience members from Jan. 17. Universities and colleges are also starting to establish booster mandates. New York University [said Tuesday](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/nyu-booster-shot-required-will-other-universities-follow-suit/3450526/) that it would require all staff members and students to have booster shots to be on campus next semester. KATHMANDU, Nepal \u2014 As coronavirus vaccines were rolled out last spring across the world, Nepal struggled to find doses because they were being hoarded by richer countries. But now, the small Himalayan nation finds itself in a peculiar situation: It suddenly has too many for its cold-storage capacity, and it has asked for shipments to be slowed down. \"Due to a lack of adequate cold-room space, we have been requesting vaccine suppliers to delay shipment for a while,\" Badebabu Thapa, a government official who deals with the logistical management of Nepal's vaccination campaign, said on Thursday. \"If vaccines keep coming at the present rate, arranging warehouses for sensitive vaccines will be a herculean task.\" Health officials said they had been making frequent slowdown requests in recent weeks, after the flow of vaccines from Unicef \u2014 which has been delivering coronavirus vaccines from the global Covax pool meant for poorer nations \u2014 and other suppliers significantly increased. This week alone, about four million doses have arrived in the capital, Kathmandu \u2014 2.1 million doses of Johnson and Johnson from Germany, and 1.8 million doses of Covishield, which is manufactured by India's Serum Institute. In the coming days, Nepal is expecting 2.4 million doses of Vero Cell from China, and 676,000 doses of Pfizer from the United States via Covax. Health authorities are now seeking to delay shipments until the modest central and regional warehouses are emptied. The country's poor health infrastructure has struggled in the face of deadly waves of the virus, and vaccination efforts have been slowed by the country's difficult terrain. Doses to some far-flung villages are transported using helicopters, mules and yaks. Nepal has vaccinated only about 30 percent of its population of 30 million. Mr. Thapa said the government could not arrange enough warehouses in time for the sudden influx of supplies. What made planning particularly difficult, he said, was the unpredictable nature of the deliveries. But he said the Health Ministry was working to build new cold-storage facilities and to expand the capacity of the existing ones. At least [a dozen](https://ny.eater.com/2021/12/15/22838282/nyc-restaurants-close-temporarily-coronavirus-exposure-omicron-variant) New York City restaurants and bars have temporarily closed this week because employees tested positive for the coronavirus, as reports of new cases in the city [climbed sharply](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-city-new-york-covid-cases.html) to more than double the average rate of two weeks ago, [according to a New York Times database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-city-new-york-covid-cases.html). Restaurateurs said the cases among their staff had been mild so far, but they expected the number of shutdowns to grow as businesses try to shield employees and customers from infection. The restaurants include [Contento](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/dining/new-yorks-top-10-new-restaurants-of-2021.html) in Harlem, [Temperance Wine Bar](https://www.temperancenyc.com/) in the West Village and several in Brooklyn: [Otway](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXgo_zRPGlz/) in Clinton Hill, [LaLou](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXhNMTwloTz/) in Prospect Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and [Di An Di](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXg6KrVPOR3/) in Greenpoint.

New York City has some of the most stringent [vaccine requirements](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/nyregion/new-york-city-vaccine-mandate.html) in the country, requiring that workers and indoor diners provide proof of vaccination. Many restaurants go beyond the official requirements: At [Pheasant](https://www.pheasantnyc.com/) in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the entire staff is not only fully vaccinated, but must also wear masks at work. At the Clinton Hill cafe [Otway](https://www.otwaynyc.com/), there are two separate staffs for daytime and nighttime, so that if someone from one team tests positive, the other team can still work and an entire day of business will not be lost. An employee reported on Tuesday having been exposed to Covid-19, so the owner, Samantha Safer, shut down dinner service the following evening. She estimated she lost $4,000 to $8,000 in that one night. She said it was especially frightening to her that, though her employees are taking care to protect customers, some guests are not returning the courtesy. She said a server overheard three indoor diners \"who were talking about how they might have been exposed to Covid.\" Ms. Safer said she isn't taking any chances this New Year's Eve, typically the restaurant's highest-grossing night. In addition to proof of vaccination, she said, diners will also have to show a negative result from a recent test. [An Italian province relies on pure air and herbal remedies. But nature isn't protecting it from the coronavirus.](#an-italian-province-relies-on-pure-air-and-herbal-remedies-but-nature-isnt-protecting-it-from-the-coronavirus) SAN CANDIDO, Italy \u2014 For a family of organic farmers nestled on the side of a snow-blanketed mountain in Italy's northern province of Bolzano, the coronavirus was no match for the immunizing effects of the crisp alpine air, the invigoration of a good hike and the healing powers of the forest's mosses, herbs and vegetables. \"If someone coughs, we do onion compresses, a body cream of thyme and myrtle, and drink a lot of tea,\" said Sabine Durnwalder, 37, an unvaccinated resident of the farm in the scenic valleys near the border with highly infected Austria. \"I know how to protect myself.\" Bolzano has traditionally had the healthiest, fittest and most active population in Italy. Now, it is also the area with the highest rate of coronavirus infection. A traditional preference for natural remedies has extended to a widespread rejection of vaccines, making it Italy's least vaccinated region. Though officials have raised concerns regarding conspiracy theories and disinformation about vaccines spread by right-wing populists, experts here say the nature-loving and science-doubting health enthusiasts are at the heart of a vaccine skepticism that is largely contributing to a surge in infections, filling up hospitals and prompting new restrictions. As Americans approach a third year of pandemic living, therapists around the country are finding themselves [on the front lines of a mental health crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/16/well/mental-health-crisis-america-covid.html). Social workers, psychologists and counselors from every state say they can't keep up with unrelenting demand for their services, and many must turn away patients \u2014 including children \u2014 who are desperate for support. \"All the therapists I know have experienced a demand for therapy that is like nothing they have experienced before,\" said Tom Lachiusa, a licensed clinical social worker in Longmeadow, Mass. \"Every available time slot I can offer is filled.\" The New York Times asked 1,320 mental health professionals about how their patients were coping as pandemic restrictions eased. General [anxiety and depression](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/well/mind/depression-anxiety-physical-health.html) are the most common reasons patients seek support, but family and relationship issues also dominate therapy conversations.
